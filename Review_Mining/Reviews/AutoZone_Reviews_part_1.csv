bad,The highered me as full time but put me in the system as part time. Never got my holiday pay or vacation. Tired to solve number of times. Got hurt and then they cut my hours and gave my full time to someone else while I was out
bad,"everyone who works here is absolutely miserable, underpaid, and greatly underappreciated. but if your lazy and don't want to actually do anything while everyone else around you works then its perfect"
bad,"Horrible regional and district managers don’t give advancement in company, will not pay what job is worth, overall horrible company to work for in the Modesto area"
bad,"Say good bye to your personal life, with scheduled from 11am to 10pm and a very low paid position, no benefits the fo slave people there. no respect for your off days and tons of responsibilities makes you wanna quit on the spot."
bad,"Don't ho against any manager because they still make up things to write up in a warning to get you terminated. And they will never forward your concerns about harrassment to employees,  by other supervisors, to upper management."
bad,"They dont care about their employees, they only care about them. Not a good company at all. They dont pay well, they are very unfair with the employees."
bad,Not the best place to work. The job itself was okay. The people dont do anything they are supposed to do. If you can find another job then do so. I mads the mistake of working for them .
bad,"Auto Zone is a company who does not value their employees on many levels.  You are basically a tool that can be replaced at a drop of a hat.  I would not whole heatedly recommend this business to anyone seeking employment  "
bad,"Bad manager in my division, terrible work environment, bad hours. I want to find a new jobA.S.A.P. pay is not equal to various jobs I perform. Shift is not contingent to a family life schedule."
bad,"I worked my butt off for this company and then got accused of something that's not true all because I don't put up with disrespectful employees who are same position as me but if you wanna "
bad,"This company worse  ever i work period  this company."
bad,"District management sucks!"
bad,Mala organización desde los superiores y en todo el transcurso de la empresa
bad,Not much really to say. Very indifferent about my experience working there. Not a job I'd recommend. Because I really did not enjoy what I was doing. Slow pace.
bad,"This company is a big joke, the district managers have no idea what they’re doing, they lie to you about advancement opportunities, lie to you about pay scales in terms of promotions, and lie about company policies based on what mood they’re in. Specially the Athens,GA Market there a bunch of brainless district managers,store managers,regional staff  they always "
bad,"This company is a big joke, the district managers have no idea what they’re doing, they lie to you about advancement opportunities, lie to you about pay scales in terms of promotions, and lie about company policies based on what mood they’re in. I was a full time manager and was told I would have to get demoted to part time because I was going to night school 2 days a week, I had to take deliveries in my personal car because our store was short staffed and they did not hire more people. This company has an outdated system that crashes on a daily basis and you get blamed for it.. it’s a joke and a waste of time and not worth the pennies they pay you."
bad,I hate it their da pay is bad and everyone plays around too much da manager pick who he wants to be friends with he yells in front customers in front da workers I just  wanna leave to work for a better environment where I could grow
bad,I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy. The hours suck. The pay sucks. And they don’t appreciate their employees.  The hiring process takes about a month
bad,"Dont waste your time with a company like this,  go find a company that actually cares about you. No matter how good you are, you'll never be good enough for this second rate company that thinks their 1st rate."
bad,Pésimo trabajo mal pagado y te arriesgas mucho yo estuve de chófer y la verdad no se los recomiendo
bad,"Getting a job at AutoZone was the WORST decision i have ever made.  That place made me broke.  They start you with part time which is 15 hours and tell you all kinds of bs about promotions but it never happens.  So you are stuck with $300 paychecks for 2 weeks and they always switch your hours time that way you wont be able to look for another job.  "
bad,Bad company to work for do not waste your time. There is no loyalty. They do not pay for your experience. They will run you in the ground and pay you pennies. I have several decades of experience in the automotive industry and make $9.00 hr. They expect a lot and pay nothing.
bad,"The company is a shady one. The management is very unprofessional. The regional management is even worse. Lost Prevention will accuse you of stealing if your register ever comes up short. Lack of respect amongst management and employees. I worked there for 2 years, never saw a raise. The company DOES NOT care about the environment and will throw away containers with oil in them. Best advice: stay away from this “job”"
bad,"This company does not appreciate  Their employee,  They give you false hope and  Empty promises.  The time that I worked there at 1st I was very happy"
bad,"Nobody general want to help, main manager terrible!!! Always running at mouth!! Only worked less than a month!! Seemed like I was always putting away all the more difficult parts as others would walk off a part at a time instead of a cart full!! Again can't say enough main manager terrible!!!"
bad,$10-$12 an can't afford to eat wage.... horrible computers... horrible customers....   pay is starving.....  nobody cares about anything at any store I've worked at....   company to work. for.
bad,This place is  horrible  to work for. Distinct manager is an a-hole. Store managers are just worse. They hire employees just to put bodies in the store. They hire people who doesn’t have any mechanical or customer services experience. People who don’t wanna deal with customer.
bad,no culture at all manager always gone no staffing alone in the store all the time sr management non existent H R dept a joke poor raises and lousy discounts
bad,The managers were mean and very belittling. They had no respect for there employees. I was a commercial driver and would deliver parts. You had no say in your work schedule and they would make a fuss about every little thing
bad,Their management structure is based on fear and intimidation only. They do not properly train employees and when they fail they blame the employees. I was not there very long as I quickly learned that is not the place for me.
bad,Prejudice they try to also have u doing alot of illegal things. There were no breaks or lunches given at times. You work off the clock at times. Alot of commercial deliveries to non commercial shops.
bad,They don’t value there employees at all it’s not a long term place to call home they don’t have respect for your health also it’s there job or nothing at all and hate to pay you for time being sick
bad,Has short staffed and overwork and pay is very low and if u dont suck up to management  u wont make it in the company. Also they dont care about there employees
bad,"Top management plays favorites and allows store managers they like to treat employees in less than dignified ways, and puts serious stress on store managers they don't like even if they are doing a good job. HR is no help and will do everything to reword your statements to try to convince you everything is being handled fairly and appropriately. Which is very untrue."
bad,Bad job unorganized at manger level don’t recommend being a grey shirt NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I’m at a new company making more money with half stress. It’s a under staffed store that can’t keep employees more then 2 months because of AWFUL management.
bad,"Unprofessional/unfair and abuse of position mostly managers cm,dm,sm promoting wrong personnel. Terrible customer service. Alot of employee theft of store merchandise and cash from register's."
bad,Dont work for this company they make tons of money dont want pay you anything! They also dont tell you your doing more computer work then out on the floor! The lady manger is a rude nasty lady that lazy and down grade people that walk !!! She will pile all her work on you and not do anything but . I should put her name out there on blast but it the holiday so I'll be nice ! Do not work for this company you will regret it!!!
bad,Autozone does not care for your pocket or you. It always starts firm the top.  Do us all a favor and move along.   The manages can't tell you different.  They just can't.  The company itself only care about making money for themselves.
bad,As a former store manager for ten years my stress level was through the roof. The best day I've seen in ten years was the day I left this company. DM's and higher only care about their bonuses. They claim to not put you in a hostile environment but if a customer spends any money they have the right to do or say anything they want. You as an employee are always in the wrong. Iwouldn't suggest this Company to anyone
bad,"The staff is horrible, management is useless, the ones who call themselves managers take jokes way to far. Hours keep getting cut but yet they hire more and more people. When working for autozone you have no rights as a human being. Management tells red shirts we arent allowed to fix customers cars or offer mechanical services but yet it's the managers going outside fixing customers cars for money"
bad,"I worked for this company while I was in college, it was a good job to somewhat “get me by”. It only gets worse after you become full time. You will be underpaid in any role you work in. You’re punished for trying to work hard. The “so called” benefits don’t outweigh how terrible the job/company is. It doesn’t matter if you’re part time or full time they will rob you of hours if you even remotely stay the slightest bit over your scheduled time. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Very poor management. It was always a clustered mess. Anytime anyone other than the GM gave their thoughts or opinions it didnt matter, even sometimes when it was them it didnt matter."
bad,Management was all about themselves. Hours were changed all the time without warning and the store manager would only help you if it benefited him. Enjoyed the experience but would not go back.
bad,Would not recommend any body work for this company.the manager is lazy doesnt teach you nothing but expects you to know everything on day 1. Stressful if you have anxiety issues dont work here.
bad,"The corporate culture is toxic. The pay is awful, especially considering the amount of work expected. There is little to no chance of advancement and there is an almost 100 percent turnover rate."
bad,"I can't speak positively about this company or the people it hires. Management is backstabbing, unprofessional, unappreciative and stressed out which probably contributes to that nature. Half the time the District Managers and Store Managers should be fired for all the policies they break verbally and through actions. If it wasn't for my Commercial Sales Manager I would have gone off on them and lost my job. I literally lived out of a headache medicine bottle due to that job and became very unhealthy. You may be saying as you read this, "" why did you not quit?"". Well because I have a house and bills and did not want to risk it but looking back I wish I did because your mental and physical health is more important. If you are considering this as an employer option please reconsider. I know you need work but trust me for someone who worked there 5 years that if you are a genuine, for the most part happy and care about people then please look else where. It will run you to the bone and hurt you mentally and emotionally in a way that is not worth it. Plus for the work you do there you could make more at a dealership ( not saying its a better environment ) or a auto shop as parts/ticket front desk person. This place will slowly ruin you and test you to the point you except or break."
bad,"Store lacks management and true managers and the moral of the store is always low due to certain managers who instead of helping you succeed and coach you to do things the right way, they just  criticize and leave you to learn on your own"
bad,The worst management I've ever seen horrible training and they have you work off the clock with no pay alot I would never recommend anybody I personally know to work at autozone....
bad,They are making me work right now for free with this questionnaire and I have not been employed for 2 years does that answer question? And I have to actually say something that is 150 minimum letters? I just want to upload my resume that is all.
bad,"This place is nothing but a huge joke lol, promotes from within where!? They always hire someone from from off the streets an they most definitely don’t pay well at all, you will find yourself working alone cause they can’t keep ppl"
bad,I love working in the automotive industry and it is mainly management as the reason behind my super low rating because it is true what they saying says; management can make you really not like your job.
bad,I don’t know what’s else to say other than it was not a good experience at all and it really ended up putting me down in life management was awful and hours were terrible
bad,Employees are nothing more than a number. The stores are run with bare minimum staffing and then upper management complaines because nothing gets done around the store
bad,"right when you get there ur busy day goes by fast, you meet a lot of people, learn alot of things about parts and cars, day goes by fast just not enough hours, you start off part time lucky to get full-time."
bad,"Everyone that i worked with was always very unhappy, very unorganized, and gossiped all the time. Management was a joke, they played favorites and they do not care about their customers or employees."
bad,Poor Management. Have children running store’s. Autozone will keep you part time unless you have family member or good friends that are upper management. Being that this was a temporary job and my real job is ASE Certified Master Technician I can honestly say that most employees including managers give bad advice or ill informed advice when it comes to today’s vehicles.
bad,Horrible work environment. Know one knew anything about cars it was all about up selling I was one of the few at my store with any actual automotive experience. And managment was poor
bad,"I started this job hired to drive and deliver parts, I was told at training I would be expected to help out in store when not delivering parts, I agreed to that stipulation keeping in mind I was hired and being paid the hourly rate of a driver $10 instead of $11-$13 hour that sales associates make."
bad,"Sólo números y no importas como ser humano."
bad,"lousy pay.  overworked.  not gratified.  disrespected regularly.  the harder you work then the more they expect from you, while others slack off.  poor management.   frequently disregard labor laws, OSHA regulations and employ rights under law."
bad,I was there at autozone for a little over a year on time everyday 6am to 6pm sometimes and no matter how fast i did my work it wasnt fast enough they always piled up more and more work before my shift was over and then fired me because they claim i wasnt fast enough....i would never recommend anyone there they dont aporeciate there workers your just a number ...
bad,Managers are completely clueless on how to lead. My former store manager was tyrant plain and simple. They also need to raise their pay scale for the kind of things you put up with there.
bad,Manager is always too busy to talk too annual pay raises that arent good and the same excuse they wasnt allocated much and wish they could give a better raise
bad,Autozone was not a good job because they do not care about their employees. Autozone did not treat me right after all I did for them. I left because they slashed my hours and took my manager's position because I had started school.
bad,"I do not feel that Autozone is a good company for anyone with career goals. They do not treat employees well and their only interest is Regional manager and above bonuses, they will cut your hours, pay the absolute minimum, take your vacation, and any other thing they can think of to meet their goals."
bad,"Horrible management, who give false hope to employees. Management tries to force you to swindle customers into getting nothing but the most expensive not caring for the customers needs financial situation or mentality."
bad,You come here wanting to work and get paid to work....but no somebody wants to play a game of carrot on a stick with you ( Google It)  Instead of money I will get you a title......
bad,Management can be harsh no paid time off stressful work place  management would threaten you with termination if you called in sick not enough hours and pay
bad,AutoZone offers the ability for raises and benefits yet aren't willing to do any of it. unwilling to teach new things and make it easier to get promotions.
bad,The company thinks you have no life and make you work any time they want you to work. Customers treat you like garbage in the phone. The store I worked was dirty and regional managers acted like they sold their souls to autozone.
bad,"Company is beyond mismanaged"
bad,"The pay is bad, you don’t get benefits if u work part time, u can get more hours but can’t get 40 a week if your not full time, the work isn’t hard but the money definitely isn’t worth it. U can pay a light bill with this job. The management is racist but will work you to death if you allow them too. They want you to do dollars worth of work for pennies on a dollar. Find another place to work please."
bad,"I get paid $9.00 an hour for mental and physical exhaustion. No appreciation or respect for employees. They care more about the dress code and the sales that they are making than you. No raise within a year and a half in working there. I have seen many good, hard working people quit. All jobs include stress I get that. But autozone excpects so much from you for little pay and no appreciation. This job will steal your soul."
bad,"Management sucks was sexually harassed and 2 managers knew and nothing was done about it "
bad,Not a good company if your looking to advance. They don't care about family and the only thing they care about is the company.  Poor management skills
bad,"I would not recommend working here at all, the pay is not good and upper management does not care about other employees. workers are treated poorly and stores are so short staffed no one ever gets a break. They do not train you properly either."
bad,"My work and life balance has completly shifted to work around the manager instead now i have five days of work with only one day off. Not so easy to work around a schedule like that, especially if you dont have time for your real life responsiblities because work is taking up all your time. If dont get those five days of work, i dont end up getting the full 40 hours either. Even though i am considered ""full time"".  The typical work day for me is i have to put up the hole truck while being called up front to install batteries constanly to only hear ""why isn't truck done?"". Kinda of confusing which one do you want me to do. All your batteries installs or finish truck. I learned almost everything about the system expect so far just need to learn the manager. Management is cool when they have their good days. The work culture i cant complain about, everybody is pretty chill. The hardest part is trying to be at two places at once, but overall it is easy when you arent being slammed. Most enjoyable is just when payday rolls around the corner. That is all i can say is enjoyable at that job."
bad,"By far one of the most unorganized jobs I have ever had. Management allows incompetent employees and district managers allow for incompetent store"
bad,If you wanna be treated unfairly work At AutoZone. If you wanna work for managers that do not take responsibility for their actions then Autozone is the job you
bad,Poor management throughout the company. Cut most of our benefits. Low starting pay. Unrealistic sale goal expectations. Not a stable work environment. Stay away from AutoZone
bad,Always short staffed district manager and corporate didn’t care. Hostile environment because everyone’s stressed to the max. Can’t meet goals when you’re short staffed. Usually there were only two people in the store working
bad,"I wouldn’t even tell someone I didn’t like to work there. It’s that bad...unless you like getting underpaid, overworked in an understaffed environment. Literally no positives that I could think of. Straight days I guess? Even then if you close you will be there until 10pm and may have to open at 7am. Not worth it unless you were literally desperate. They don’t care about their people and make that crystal clear"
bad,It was a great learning experience.  When I met my boss she liked me and for some odd reason she started to not like me I believe I was advancing way to fast instead of promoting me she hired a new manager and made me train him
bad,"*Corporate does not take care of their people. "
bad,"I felt as if I was walking on eggshells every time I went to work. There were a different set of rules for me compared to everyone else. I was the only one she was writing up and everyone else she would simply laugh and joke with them to not let it happen again! She definitely discriminated against me versus everyone else because they would bow down and kiss her tail and I refused to lower myself to her! So every chance she got she was writing me up for the simplest infractions that others were also committing but they didn't get written up! When the customers complain to me about her all I could tell them was to call corporate because she doesn't like me so there's really nothing I can do for them! I don't think all of the AZ's are like this and if I had known that she was going to target me in this way I'd never taken the job in the first place! So, if your willing to lower yourself to her standards then you'll get along just fine with her! Bottom line is that she doesn't know how to manage a store and since I was an Assistant Manager at one time she saw me as her competition. I knew when she bit my head off my very first day because I needed help figuring their computer system out that I had made a very poor decision by agreeing to take this job! She tried to get me to quit by making my schedule so out of whack that she thought that I'd just up and quit! Meaning if I closed the night before she would expect me to open the very next day and she knew that I lived 30 miles away! But, when that didn't work she then started to write me up for stuff that she said I did like 3 weeks"
bad,"Corporate routinely blamed their employees for lack of sales. Hours were inconsistent making for difficult home life. Co-workers are great, however, really enjoyed working with the people at my store."
bad,Management. Was poor in high places so it just came down the ladder .cut your neck just to watch you bleed. You start making friends and they turned you against each other to watch the show.
bad,"horrible benefits horrible pay the managers will lie about pay and advancement to you to get more production out of you. managers ""top"" out at around 10/11$ an hour and are basically asked to be mechanics/janitors/sales people and never go over 40hrs in a week or the district manager flips out because he is so cheap and reduces staff forcing everyone else to work harder with no compensation. i could sit here and type about how bad this place is but all you have to do is go to any location and talk to any employee and they will tell you just how bad this job and company are. i mean come on minimum wadge starting at Walmart is now 11$ an hour for a shelf stocker with now job duties besides putting merchandise on shelfs. 11$ is what most managers maxx out at at autozone if you are lucky. do some easy research before you apply and ruin your life"
bad,"Auto zone is not the best place to work, unless you are on a delivery, then it's okay . So stay outside of the store and your fine. I've said enough, there's nothing more to say."
bad,Autozone almost ruined my mental stability and the minute you say something they wing you out or push you harder. They do not care about there employees one bit its all a number game for them
bad,grest place to work great pay great hours if your store don’t have hours they will send you to another store to work so that you can have hours to work. You can transfer to different stores as welll
bad,My manager was loud and obnoxious and was to busy flirting around she only liked her kind which is black so if you are not black you are not getting any were
bad,"During my year and a half at Autozone I was able to find two incidents of internal shrink, which I reported, sales went up 35% during my time there. I was told I would be going to assistant manager position for 9 months, never occurred. Customer is always first, but when you put the customer first you're in the wrong. You're not fully trained on commercial, but expected to run commercial and are reprimanded when you try to. One incident and one bogus customer complaint will get you demoted and transferred and HR says ""take it or resign""."
bad,Being in management sucks vacation only applies to full-time people only after they worked for a year in the position hours suck no formal training not a good place to get stuck at if you need it
bad,Ok place to work. When there is overtime you will work alot of it. They should have better options for when overtime is mandatory. They need to move people around to give workers breaks from being on heavy jobs all the time.
bad,The upper management is a joke the division manager does not care about stores that struggle and should not be in his position the division manager lied about checking on the store because it was about an hour drive
bad,Never wanna work here again very stressful boss never wants to compromise nothing and boss is always in a bad mood can't do but avoid him I was glad to be outta their
bad,You need to value your workers more and stop under paying. You also need to be more strict on your store managers there mistakes affect us all employees
bad,"If you like Fast Pace than this might be the job for you, but before you make that decision hold up because management is a joke. And district reels you they care about their employees, but the hard truth is, they only care as far as how your sales are. If you do not meet the sales goal, then they could care less what you think or how you feel."
bad,It’s an ok place but I wouldn’t recommend getting anyone on there ! They are ok but really don’t take care of there people like I thought it may be a great place for some but for me no I’m used to moving around an not being in one building all day long !
bad,my store was too quit and we always had a radio that way the customer's would be interested in coming in and shopping not just come in and get what they need.
bad,it was not a fun enviorment to work at. the pay was not a fair or good pay.  i was under payed for the amount of work that i did. i felt unappreciated at the job.
bad,"Schedule one week at a time, hours sometimes open, sometimes close, no set schedule.  Poor training, 20 years of experience started at 8.50 hourly.  Corporate sales goals are a joke.  Corporate America at its finest"
bad,"There is NO balance of personal/family time and work time. Working for this company is very stressful and fast paced. You are underpaid and overworked. Part timers are treated like garbage. There are more managers than there are non management. Managers seem to have their wallets padded, some way more than others. Oh and if you're a store manager, it's okay for you to actually work 5 or 10 hours a week and get paid for 50. And being on your phone is a huge no no, except if you're management. And expect to roast in the summer and freeze in the winter. This company is too cheap to pay customer is always right... yeah right. for heating or air conditioning. Ridiculous dress code, horrible practices on training, and t."
bad,With so much drama going on in the pearsall location I was forced to leave the company and management was the worse! I would share my concerns to the store manager to district store manger and HR and nothing was ever done. About all the trouble going on at  the store instead they would turn it against me and make me feel as if I was the one creating a hostile environment work place like I said worst place to work t
bad,"autozone was not fun it has a bad energy and from the moment you are hired you are told unions and unionization is a terrible thing , and you will see why they want you to think that."
bad,"They pick and choose their favorites and the job is stressful. My store had bullet holes from gang violence and still, corporate refused to close the store. Loss prevention was horrible! Regional Managers didn't know what they were doing and bi-weekly pay was horrible."
bad,"There were so many great workers there, but the managment was very poor. They promoted laziness and did not give credit to those who worked hard. They dont give write ups and they will basically let you go if they dont like you. Even if you did nothing wrong.  The new manager is God awful and doesnt know how to run a store. The district manager is the same. No one including regional,Hrand corporate will call you back if there's an issue"
bad,"La gerente nada preparada para poder llevar a cabo el manejo de su equipo. No te capacitan, y el ambiente laboral está muy pesado."
bad,It’s terrible place to work and some managers are bullies. It’s way to much stress within the workplace. The Regional Managers are terrible and don’t care about you or your wellbeing. The are very unfair far as males and females being out in positions. They are rude and don’t know how to talk to people at all. The stores are filthy and most of the have mice really bad. I wouldn’t recommend anyone working here at all.
bad,"If you're a Senior looking to supplement your income, a driver position isn't bad. If you're an adult that needs to make enough money to live on, keep looking."
bad,"Started this job under the condition that my position woul be as a SALES REP, specifically requested they NOT send me on ANY deliveries. Then got let go for not making delivery Fast enough. This management was a complete joke."
bad,The harder you work the worse they treat you. Pay is horrible and they have a lot of awful people who have power trips. They're constantly disrespectful and unappreciative.
bad,poor management skills  manager was always playing games on his phone and never working.  other employees had no relative experience at all in the field in which they were hired and company offers poor pay and benefits for the amount of work they make you do
bad,go in the sun all day changing batteries help customers restock no paid lunches nothing interesting no help bad place to work at would not recommend. low pay
bad,Es una empresa en la cual la gente q la maneja es corrupta deshonesta y precionan sin bases a los objetivos
bad,"Job was like a high school environment from the jump! Lots of sneaky people and talking behind others back. And that includes MANAGERS, which I’ve never seen before at any job in my own experience. The pay is barely above minimum wage. They work you like dogs and treat you like just another dispensable worker. I wouldn’t recommend this to my worst enemy. Should be called dramazone or stresszone"
bad,Not only do you do the exact same work as “gray shirts” but you do way more while being under paid I could have a line of ten people and they would just sit as I dealt with the complaints. My store didn’t have a manger when I was there and still doesn’t it’s been 7 months the place is a joke.
bad,"Good high school job but for a living, not good at all. Managers are biased towards employees. If your manager is a guy they will give any female employee based on looks, more preference. Though I could do everything on my own. I can run DIY alone. I can run COMMERCIAL alone."
bad,"The hours are terrible and are not flexible, the management is rude and treats the workers like slaves. I hate working here and I need a new job very badly."
bad,"I never liked working here as a ""manager."" The difference between a sales manager and a sales associate is only 1-2 $/HR. No added commission but a ton of responsibilities are added to your work load. The added headaches weren't worth the minimal raise when the pay is already very low. The training video has a Red Menace vibe to it where the commies are people trying to organize unions. I was fired trying to take a leave of absence to attend a family member's funeral across the country in less than 2 weeks."
bad,Awful management. Awfully low pay. The pay is below average for jobs of the same kind. The hours are very inconsistent. One week you would have 35-40 hours and the follow you would have 15
bad,"Managers do not manage, they babysit.  Managers do not have the power to terminate.  The managers have to cover all shifts if an employee calls out because of the lack of payroll.  We have been known to run the stores with one employee, ourself!  Managers are required to travel to other locations, including stores over 2 hours away to perform manual inventories.  Then if employee calls out, to return to store to close.  No or little support from upper management.  We were constantly told, ""this is your store, run it"".  Every manager at one time or another has pulled numerouse open to close per week.  Yet when we wanted to take time off, we were constantly bombarded with quotas and what is called wittdtjr items. (Items that make the company the most money and increase average ticket).  There is no balance between home and work here.  Management is  24, 7 with this company.  Enough said.  Oh yeah there is a pending lawsuit for reasons stated."
bad,"The store manager at this store needs to take a real good look at himself as a; human-being, and how he treats his team members on the sales floor, and OFF of it as the store manager for such a large corporation!!! :("
bad,"I work 4 hours Saturdays and Sundays "
bad,"AutoZone is a fun place to work at and learn about cars. On the other hand, the pay is vary low. Even if you advance in the company to management the pay is still below living wage. This causes tremendous turnover that puts a burden on other employees."
bad,"Started out 20 months ago. Worked more hours as a part time than I ever got as a full-time employee. Asked to transfer to another location with the understanding I would be promoted to management position which didn't happen. Asked about a pay raise to cover expenses of traveling 30 miles each way was told no. Was told I could transfer back to my original location by the District Manager and when I mentioned it to the Store Manager she refused to even discuss it. Informed me I was needed at that location since it was poorly under staffed."
bad,"AutoZone is a revolving door for employees.  They cut your hours at will, "
bad,"Show up get yelled, while doing the best job with time given to do job.  Nothing was learned.  Management knows how to yell about anything and everything with back stabbing.  Easy job, too much grief...   The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid bi-weekly..."
bad,Typical work day consist is trying to sale extra items to customers and answering a phone ringing off the hook all day. I hated it. Half of the customers are rude. Lots of heavy lifting also.
bad,I would have to say that the company would have to improve on security especially at night for night crew have to hire more people and put more people on 4 at night they just security overall there is like no security whatsoever so someone were to come in and robbed the place there's no security so that's just what I'd have to say other than that the business is a great business but you guys have to improve on security for sure security nut is the number one thing but I would have to say that you guys have to work on
bad,I was there for only about a month. I was SMIT but was in a store with no manager to train me. There was a young  boy as assistant who was more or less running the store more or less. I was told to I was the top manager in the store even the though I hadn't received very much training. Needless to say the assistant manager walked all over me along with the crew and consistently called out sick. When I told the DM what was going on he basically told me not to go head to head with the assistant manager and that he would take care of the rest of the crew. Right before I was going to turn in my two weeks they were going to send me to another store  or training and actually had a manager. I was going to work there for a week however this store was more than an hour away each way. I have a big SUV which takes tons of gas money which it did not have so I then turned in my 2 weeks and when I told my DM he then just let me go instead of trying to get me to stay. Also one last thing that sucks store managers get treated like there nothing and have to work tons of extra hours and have to work almost every single weekend. Working on 6-week rotations on how they get their weekends off with their families is unacceptable. AutoZone needs to revise this and reconsider what they're doing to their employees.
bad,"Autozone is garbage , advancements never ! They rather hire a bum from the corner than to put a skilled experience associate as boss. You don’t get paid to install battery or headlights or wiper blades like other actual shops. You have to do it for free for customers Forced by general managers and store managers. When they receive shipment you better be praying they don’t schedule you every day to u load at 4am. Raises, they don’t believe in it, they just say to do more hours or make more sales to get money."
bad,As a store manager you are held accountable ver every little thing. Expect long hours and little pay. The DM's expect way too much and complain alot. over all this company has a bad business philosopy.
bad,"A two man ran store in a high volume area. Phone constantly ringing with more than 2 people calling the store yet only two people operating the store. Along with answering the phone calls and assisting people over the phone, the customers inside the store also need help at the same time whether its a battery change, wiper installation, or a free diagnostic ran on the car. Along with help customers via in person or over the phone, one must also complete daily tasks such as recalls, store restock, price changes, planograms, ect. Very difficult to run with just two people yet through prioritizing we find a way to pull through."
bad,"I worked any time they needed me and went way beyond what was expected.  The pay was minimum wage and the hours were horrible considering some of the newer employees got better treatment and hours because of ""who they knew"". I ended up working days I asked off which messed up my kids schedule. The gossip and chatter among co-workers was horrible and theft was outrageous. This was by far one of the worse jobs I have had."
bad,It’s was ok when I started everything is easy and you can move at your own pace but after 3 years I only got 1 raise and it was 36 cent and I was doing manager work so I quickly looked for a better opportunity
bad,"Miopía,violencia laboral sin tiempo extra,ventas sin comisión,es un favor que hace autozone que trabajes ahí,sobre todo en el hub de los reyes"
bad,They hire you in with no automotive experience even though the customers expect you to be their personal mechanic and blame you for everything while they work on their own pieces of junk.
bad,"Autozone does not treat their employees well. Constant schedule changes throughout each week, most of the time you dont even know about the change until you show up. Management treats you like poorly unless you brown-nose the boss. Bad hours, bad benefits, and horrible pay. Raises are .20 cents or less a year."
bad,"Worse place I've ever worked. Full time position but only get 12-18 hrs/week? Like,  really? Then store manager calling you on your day off to yell at you for something unrelated to work? Calling me names behind my back, in Spanish.  I understand Spanish. Right. BYE."
bad,Very bad job supt was incompetent and job was not very good company  was not supportive to many bad people trying to be the boss and bosses are afraid of their jobs
bad,I worked there because the store manager and district manager wanted me so bad but little down the road no promotions just me doing most of of every ones jobs basically me staying as a red shirt and that’s that I worked hard enough to become a grey shirt show them that I knew what I was doing physically and mentally I left because several I put in the system for certain time off because it was well needed for personal things that needed my attention and I was still scheduled
bad,"The lack of respect for the employees starting from the owner of the company, to the managers & supervisors at the stores made this job stressful and demeaning."
bad,I was asked what it would take to come to work there full time We agreed on a wage and after 2 months they come to me and say they cant do what they agreed to but it wasn't there fault. I would like to see companies be loyal to their employees like they want them to be.
bad,i was there for two years promised full time never got it even though i worked full time hours for almost two years then they cut my hours to ten a week so i quit
bad,"They say they encourage women to work there but they dont.  They hired me to set up to take the fall for the store manager who was stealing out the back door.  They faked a story that i lost a deposit (manager found it a week later by chance alone in the office and told the employees not to tell me they found it. ) Had corporate come for interrogations about missing stock letting me think it was about the deposit.  I was the only employee in the store that wasnt told besides corporate ,who also wasnt told about the missing deposit, so i would tell them inadvertantly. Then after they found it fired me and wanted me to sign a paper that said i lost 700 dollars..."
bad,"Don’t ever expect to get raises, they won’t teach you anything. The manager was always rude, she wouldn’t ever wanna teach you anything and when you screwed up, it was a viscous circle. This is a very last resort job, pay is terrible and it’s impossible to get full time."
bad,I was working for two people jobs getting one check. The manager she has an nasty attitude to be a manager. She showed a lot of favoritism to this one particularly make. It wasn’t the job that it was made out to be at that particular store. Although at the store where I was trained was everything I thought it would be.
bad,Autozone only cares about how much money they make and not about you. If your looking for a career this is not the place. They are only giving part time hours too.
bad,"I worked at Autozone for about 6 months and it was the most horrible experience on my life.  The company cares nothing about employees, they only care about pushing sales.  You are required to sale certain items that nobody wants and if you don't sale, you get hollered at my management.  Training was a joke.  Your told how to do something once and your expected to be perfect the first time.  My manager was a complete jerk (that's being nice), the only time he ever said anything to me was when I messed something up.  By the way, the pay is horrible, benefits were terrible, customers were rude.  We had a customer that took a dump in the parking lot.  The manager told me to clean it up but I refused.  I left it there.  Nothing is good about this company unless you get into upper management.  Don't waste you time applying here because I assure you, they care nothing about you."
bad,"Treat their employees terribly "
bad,Drudgery from start to finish. I suppose it matters from store to store but my experience was not good. Nine managers for every one workers and management is not inclined to help.
bad,"Worked here for over a year, it was an ok place, lots of language barriers with the customers. Most spoke Spanish and that is not my  first language.."
bad,I won't say anything bad about the company or the employees other then it didn't work for me and my family. I loved being able to help the customers meet there needs on what they needed.
bad,"Low pay, over worked and your asked to do ridiculous tasks all the time. It was not a good experience at all. I would never go back or refer anyone to work there either."
bad,The hours are flexible for everyone however this place sees you replaceble they don't care how much you work your but off cause they won't give you a raise and much less a complement. Management suck they wanna complain about everything that going on. And another thing is that the customers is always right. They will treat the customers better than they will treat you.
bad,Expects alot of work from you with very little pay.And you dont get flexible hours like they say they have.wasted almost 3 years of my time here and got know wheres.
bad,They expected you to sell everything to the customer even if they did not want it. They would even threaten termination if not sold. They are more worried about their numbers and not their employees or customers.
bad,"i have been in the company now 3 years. they hand pick employees to get moved up the ranks, they do not just push employees that do a good job. either your picked from day 1 or not at all. all the District Managers and above only care about themselves and do as little as possible to keep the managers above them from coming down on them. on a personal level there is nothing, no help for promotion or even problems in the company resolved. the vacation hours are a joke and there is no paid holidays. its like being in high school again. no stores handle business seriously or even care about their store. this is all company wide problems...i have been in multiple different stores."
bad,"If you plan on asking for help forget about it, if they don't like you, they will hurt customers and the business to run people off."
bad,I have nothing to say about the company just the management needs to be looked into and the employees. The need to take a look into the employee taking free parts.
bad,"Terrible in almost every way.  You are pushed to sell with no benefit to either the employees or the customer.  And more often than not having to take the abuse from customers as a result of needless upselling."
bad,They build up hype just to shut you down I was promised promotion 3 times and yet I never saw it so thus for leading to me quiting the company due to lack of respect for others
bad,Bad management all around. Nobody ever knew what was going on or what they should be doing. Managers liked to play on their phones and not do anything. Hours were terrible.
bad,The environment work wise is harsh no room to move in the company no effort to get you where you wanna be pretty much management leaves you to sink on your own with no help and watch you suffer
bad,"management was Bad didn't pay well. hours were ok at best the discount was nice but honestly the ""rules"" were only applied if you weren't friends with the store mangier"
bad,Very poor management waste of sales calls every Thursday at 5:00 PM. Always pushing sales and really no properly promote new business. No fleet oriented in sales
bad,"Be careful if you work here. Most of the people are nice. But it seems that every store has at least one employee who is in constant contact with the DM. Once the snake employee has you, it's over. They will never give you a fair shake. It's what the UC had to say and that's it."
bad,"I was on my lunch break n was rear ended in a car wreck n AutoZone dm  n store manager tried all they had to fire me, from threating me, to thinking I was dumb enough to have my doc sign papers stating she released me from her care when she hasn't. Horrible horrible company to work for."
bad,The workload was not challenging but the culture quite different from what I am use too.  I enjoyed my job overall but there were other dynamics at that time.
bad,"AutoZone is a company that ONLY cares about making money at any cost. They let customers disrespect, bully, sexually harrass us as long as they're spending money in our stores. They run their best employees ragged while their worst get away with stealing and being insubordinate. We work twice as hard and get half the pay we deserve."
bad,Stay away - the company will just use you until they're done with you. They'll find any reason to fire you because its cheaper for them to hire a new person than it is for them to give you a raise and keep you.
bad,"In the area i was at, the managers set me up for failure. i worked my butt off between work college and family. Autozone did not care. i left for college at 4:00 in the morning, and theyd make me work tell 11 at night. the point system for days missed is unfair in the situation i was in. theyd put my times to be there far to close to the times id get off shool. i had a three hour drive and they would give me 3 hours to be there ready to work and clock in. when hired they said they would give me room for improvements, but they would hire on managers after i asked for  a higher position, and say to my face ""sorry we arent looking for anymore managers"" with a mocking look on their face. the two head managers would sit in the back and talk all day, and would make you stay past closing from 30-60 minutes past time and then demand you to stay to take care of their overtime hours, but they still got paid for the over time hours. many many times they triked me and lied to me, i personaly had a very bad experience working here. made many friends, but the job itself was just miserable"
bad,I love to work around people who are influences on good behavior and love to stay busy. I'm always on time. Like to work hard and make time pass by quickly.
bad,The worst place to work I got hired when they first opened still building racks the first few months were ok but then managment fron other states came in to run it an it went down hill we had an ops tell the has got the lowest bonuse hes ever gotten when coming here to pasco d.c because of the hours we worked due to lack of proper equipment an help an training to load trucks an pull orders they just toss you in an expect you to do it an if you fail your fired you only get maybe a couple weeks to learn I've seen over 100 people get hired an quit the same week due to the actions of managment an amount of work expected with the little pay they give you also just fired for not being liked by management I've had buddy im the military work their an were mad fun of by management for no reason its just the worst place to work for in king city every thing is strict you cant even use the bathroom for 5 minutes with out being harrassed for not picking any product its outta hand the pay sucks an managment makes you wan a turn it into a shooting gallery  plus they accused all of employees of stealing stuff since 10 grand In merchandise came up missing due management not doing their job correctly an instead of taking the blame for their actions they like to blame others so they look good to their bosses an get their nice bonuses at the year end while workers dont evem worl a full 40 a week an have to fight to get decent pay even then they wait to pay you it an will not pay  you any back pay
bad,"unable to take bathroom break no lunch time never got off on time never would pull parts won't transfer to a location closer to home, never get the quest time off"
bad,"No structure within management. Poorly managed."
bad,"They do not make people accountable for calling out constantly, they have very unrealistic sales expectations, there is no room for advancement unless you are liked by upper management. They hire any one and everyone wven if they are not qualified."
bad,"No room  for advancement , you have to pay for the  benefits, vacation  time if your  lucky  yes . You have to find somebody to cover  for you . Pay increase  when ? Always  short  handed  . Never work  for  auto zone again"
bad,"(Part time)My experience at autozone was a terrible one,everything was ok until they started hiring more people to cut everyones hours,it started as 20 hours a week sometimes more and over the course of a year went to maybe 8 hours a week if that,lots of favoritism and a strong desire not to fire store managers creates alot of issues and opportunities for theft,myself and the last 3 employees in my position were blamed for internal theft done by someone else,this job may be best suited for someone on supplemented income or someone who doesn't need consistency or a stable work environment,strong anti union stance discourages employees from standing up for themselves or co workers"
bad,"Horrible work environment. They can't keep people because the pay is so low. Upper management does not care about their employees. Store managers are forced to work open to close 7 days a week if staffing is short or someone is on vacation."
bad,"The Work/Life balance at AutoZone is terrible. They are always short handed, and the turnover rate is high. The shifts are very long (10-12 hrs), and if someone doesn't show up for their shift you are expected to stay and work a double. When you're hired you tell management when you're available to work, but they still schedule you whenever they want. Some stores are so busy that sometimes you don't get a lunch, and you can't even step away from the counter to go to the restroom."
bad,"To begin the pay very low from the start and the raises are very very low.  Your just a number from the start to them,  because they know they can replace you.  There is so much back stabbing among the worker and management.  The turn over rate there is very high too.  Its hard for them to even keep an employee more than 6 months.  They complain if even want to take a break.  I'm very surprised management don't hand you number when go to bathroom to see how long your in there.  I'm 54 years old and I can honestly say it was the worst job I ever had.  God bless if you ever get employed by them."
bad,"Nothing positive, very disappointed with district management, only care about herself and her job. Works with threats to employees on a black and white level."
bad,"Scheduling is terrible never enough people in store always just two people to handle customers phones installs stocking shelves cleaning store puling parts. At times there will be twenty people standing in line and phones ringing off the hook and not getting answered. Only certain people never work a closing schedule some due to family needs some due to having a personal relationship with manager. Commercial always has four people on schedule never work beyond 4:00 manager leave store at random times for 2 hours at a time drivers take four hours for 90 minute round trip. DIY people are required to support commercial with phones and customers but commercial is not required to help DIY sales."
bad,"Just awful you might get 8 dollars an hour if you are lucky and then will be expected to work yourself to death with no issues. Management is just terrible, they don't care about you and do not treat you like a person."
bad,"Shady stuff happens at AutoZone, all all managers did some shady stuff at the retailers, not just the one I worked at. Plenty of them quit or were caught. They treat new employees better than the ones long with the company. Terrible pay and no benefits."
bad,"Upper management, including DM’s and the RM is not a good representation of any company I would want to be apart of- the first RM got demoted and current RM is even worse!!! 🙁"
bad,The auto zone on Reynolds rd in Bryant ar is the worse auto zone in the state. Management is not interactive with employees. A lot of favoritism is played at this location. There are no competing pay no room for raises your stuck making what you make until you make manger
bad,very bad would not tell anyone to work here they are not a good place to work for they do not case about the workers at all they say they do but do not
bad,"This company only focuses on it's stock holders, not it's employees, I was a MIT there for over a year and received nothing but broken promises, they do not have structure set up for advancement, they pay suck, I could go on and on but I refuse to sound bitter, if u have in your life to waste by all means try them out but if u value your time, and health don't do it."
bad,High employment turn around rate. Work for them and i will find out why. Management can alqays be better and the hiring of people in the can also be better. They like to hire very limited experience people to work there
bad,I loved it when I first started. But once I got into a different store I was singled out and miss treated. Everything that went wrong was seemed to always be my fault. AutoZone isn't for everyone. As I was told my a store manager if you still believe in sunflowers and horses and such you are not going to make it far.
bad,It was an unpleasant job. I was never given opportunities for anything at the job. There were also instances where at times they would accuse me of accidents that were not on my account.
bad,"They allow no instore advancement and if you go to the useless DM he says all decision are made by the manager. The company will use you until you realize what they're doing and quit. You ask for more hours they take more away, you ask for a higher position they hire people from other companies and say you're not ready. They expect you to run short staffed while all the ""managers"" sit around and talk about movies they've seen. This place does not pay well and expects everyone to bend over backwards for them."
bad,Horrible management along with horrible hours. Third shift was 6 nights a week 12 hrs a night. Rate was almost impossible to make. They run you worse than a horse.
bad,"The worst job I’ve had, the managers don’t know about cars and everyone at my job is lazy. I’m the lowest paid yet do all the work. Minimum wage for more work than other jobs"
bad,My worst job by far. I have been lied too numerous times by management over looked for jobs within my own store. I’m underpaid and  Underappreciated .
bad,"A typical day at work is pretty much depending on who and where you are located typically you are constantly busy helping a customer trying to achieve their goal. You learn as you go, I say this because there is absolutely no one at AutoZone that will train you one on one if you are new but if you are enthusiastic about learning or just trying your best to learn and move forward then you will learn a lot faster then usual. but it all depends on you, you will be thrown to the wolfs."
bad,I thought it was a great company to work for but little by little I realize that they don't care about there hard working employeess I had so much dedication for these company and they just don't appreciate your work
bad,"Poor working conditions, limited parking, very long commute, the way the work was structured was very poor and unsatisfying. Working an open setting while welding an loud construction was happening near by."
bad,"Es una empresa que no tiene buen clima laboral no pagan horas extras,hay mucha diferencia en sueldos con el personal que realiza las mismas labores mucha rotacion de personal constante mente solicitan personal por las mismas causas."
bad,This company is out for themselves and only themselves. Little to no reguard for their employees. Advancement ? Forget about it unless you brown nose it no other way.
bad,I will again refrain from reviewing current or previous employers at this time This is not relevant to my current job search and not appropriate to be required.
bad,"Culture needs to change, they are still on the good ole boy platform. Need to be open to change and get out the old Regional Managers who have been there for 30 plus years."
bad,It’s an good job if u know about cars which I didn’t know anything about but some of the customers were rude and hateful and it really made the job  not worth it
bad,I’m unhappy with the treatment the employees receive They treat their employees as they were animals with no respect  I was training a store manager as the assistant doing his job as well as my own. They show no kind of consideration for the employees
bad,Worse place I have ever worked. Talk about underpaid and over worked. This is the place to be. And they say they are diverse but when one of their employees calls a co worker racially insulting names they don’t lose their job. Just a slap on the wrist and told not to do it ever again. My store manager never promised me anything but he did lead me to believe I was moving up sooner than later. And then turns around and tells me I won’t get paid more or get a new position until someone quits. So if you want a whole lot of work for minimal pay. This is the place to work!!!
bad,"Most workers are labeled as part time so that no benefits are paid, minimum wage per hour. Schedule changed every week never knowing if you would be working night or day shifts. Worked most weekends and holidays."
bad,Lack of employees strick guide lines and lack of management unlawful favoritism and no breaks and short lunches and rude employee s and management and racisim
bad,Not a good place to work they treat their employees like garbage and dont promote within the company rather hiring people from outside that dont know anything about the company
bad,AutoZone doesn't pay nearly enough for the work required. Hours are hectic. You may close one nigh and open the store the next morning multiple times a week. Kiss your personal life behind. If you are fulltime you are required to keep open availability and be on bc all 24/7. There are very good reasons I am on Indeed looking for a new job. So is most of my store.
bad,The worst retail environment possible. All you need is a pulse to be hired. Managers are promoted from within and treat employees like animals as they were treated. The only people that stay and promote to managers are non hireable anywhere else.
bad,"Worked there for 5 years. Only got $0.18 per year. Would rather hire more people then give the employees they have the hours. Promised full time all the time.  Transfered to hub hoping for full time.  Never happened, quite after 4 months of transfer. Management in hub had there own group/friends that got everything and anything."
bad,"I’ve been working for autozone 5 years as a manager and it couldn’t be any worse. They expect you to do the work of 5 people for the pay of 1/4 of an employee. They constantly add new job requirements while cutting your staffing hours and complaining when requirements aren’t attainable. Expectations are super high . Morale is super low. If you like doing 10 times the work and stress load for 1/4 of the compensation choose autozone . If your a good employee that shows up to do your job while everyone else quits and calls off to being overworked for minimum wage , choose the zone . If you like being reminded nothing you do is good enough and hate being praised for good things choose autozone . There are literally 2 to 3 call offs a day in their stores while you are expected to maintain all of that work ."
bad,Does not pay enough . Needs better organization within the company. Stock should be there when you go to get it for the customer. System should work while working with a customer
bad,Horrible pay lazy managers horrible customer service ticked off customers all the time there's nothing one can say that would make this company sound good in anyway.
bad,"it'd be hard to raise a family because this company only wants to pay its employees bare minimum. Even if you are blessed with forty hour weeks, its still barely enough to get by even as a single person."
bad,"Not a good company to work for.  I only give them them one star because there is no option for zero stars.  If you have a choice, work somewhere else,"
bad,"Just like every other retail job, management puts more tasks on your plate which is already full and offer no wage increases. Typical for a well known retailer with over 1000 locations nation wide and in several other countries."
bad,Typical large corporation that treats employees poorly. Great short term employment in a pinch but not somewhere anyone should stay long term. I wouldn't recommend a family member apply.
bad,"Unprofessional management. They will not work around your school schedule as a full time. District manager in the west palm area doesn’t pick up his phone when something happens, hard to get in contact with him. He’s doesn’t really take care of the employees at multiple locations."
bad,"AutoZone needs to hire people dramatically needs to promote management who actually cares about their job,better commutation with staff better benefits for maternity leaves"
bad,Management will tell you what you need to hear with no follow through. Horrible leadership and District Managers. Good part time job to get experience.
bad,I made a bad investment working for this company as long as I did however the biggest thing is you learn from your mistakes and don't make them again.
bad,unless you are single or you want to work all the time and never see your family and you enjoy going to work and being a drone then this is a job for you.
bad,management not so good at the store i was at never wanted to hear us out about anything if ther was a problem would bring it to his attention he would tell us to handle it on our own
bad,"I was not happy with the work flow."
bad,"Best part of the job helping customers fix their vehicles. What I learned the company doesnt care about your well being or health, just sales & numbers."
bad,"Horrible pay, hours suck if you want a life, they push upselling extremely hard, under schedule to cut costs which causes lost phone sales and customers walking out and going elsewhere because of wait times, their employee turn around is the highest of any company I’ve worked for because they don’t pay very well at all."
bad,I was used to bring commercial stores back from the dead basically and was never compensated for the extremely hard work I was doing instead was passed over several times for promotions and was told that I was not qualified for these positions even though the person hired or promoted had less experience and qualifications then I did.
bad,love my coworkers the manager was horrible and very unprofessional that particular store is like a revolving door can't keep workers because of the manager if they get rid of her it would be a great store to work out of
bad,"I would give them zero stars but one is lowest available.  No quality of life, management is very poor, affirmative action bias, too many negatives to list."
bad,Hostile environment due to drug use among employees. Did not want to be in that type of environment. Opening managers would not show up on time. Priorities were skewed.
bad,"sales sales sales is always drilled into your head and being told/reminded that if you don't sell a bunch of extra junk that people normally don't want that you can get in trouble of some sort. you're told how to act and feel, answer the phone like this and offer the customer that. Unlike the greater majority of auto parts stores, you have to answer the phone after 3 rings, and say things that normally irritate a customer instead of being genuine and telling the customer the truth, you can made out to be a liar, which is never a great feeling. ""Yes! We got it!"""
bad,"If I could say one good thing about this job it was the fact I was able to deal with car parts! the rest was bad! Managment was awful, training was awful, the knowledge about the auto industry in whole within the company was awful!"
bad,"I wish I could think of something good to say here.  They say time heals all wounds, yet, I have yet to find anything positive from my experience/time with them."
bad,All thier parts are chinese junk. Push the warranty cause the chinese parts will have to be replaced. Not installer quality and have NO BUSINESS being in commercial sale as none of the employees or management  have any manufacturing knowledge.
bad,management was abusive and time off to support my families medical needs was reprimanded.The continually changing schedule made it impossible to schedule anything outside of work.
bad,"Autozone has their part-time & full time employees deal with unruly customers, unrealistic expectations on both for low pay considering migrant workers make 11.00 and autozone pays 12.00."
bad,assist costumers with auto needs. you have to have the knowledge of knowing about a car before you are truly successful. you knowledge of cars trucks and other modes of transportation is valuable
bad,"The district managers do not care for employee relations, and Human Resources does not care either. Do not expect to be valued for your work ethic when working here."
bad,It all started at the interview. I was told i would make a certain amount per hour and then i start working and find out i was going to get less cause i am not BILINGUAL and they said a certain amount of hours and i was getting less. That is not something they should do.
bad,"Not a good company, never enough hours, always getting complaints as to why things aren't done, with very little help in getting them done, poor management as well."
bad,"Discipline isn't followed through. Managers don't take responsibility and there is no accountability given for their lack of managing. Not enough training for MIT, therefore significant turnover employment rate."
bad,Everything about this company is ill managed and chaotic. There is no accountability from the corp level trickling down to each retail store. The structure is ill equiped.
bad,No. Autozone is terrible. I do not recommend it to anyone. Ever. It is quite an unfair work environment that does nothing but push you to be a complete jerk.
bad,This job is really good for someone in high school but as a adult with bills to pay. No this is not the job for you. Maybe for a little extra money but as you’re only job you won’t make enough.
bad,Never wanted to pay attention to the time of day that was not a good time for them to get the work done by the end of the day and then no one is here yet but I will be there in 10
bad,"AutoZone does their employees wrong. Never organized under staffed. Does not pay what employee is is really worth. No one will back you in the store from upper management to lower management. "
bad,If you like to be a seller this is for you. I work with them just to proof me that I can do anything for my family but they don't pay good I was a gray shirt means manager and 11 dollars per hours to be a manager is not fair. But it's stressful job but not impossible to do it.
bad,I am not woring at autozone and never will again. This place is the idiot factory and would not work there or remend this to anyone unless homeless. Do not need jobs like this
bad,"I have never worked for a place that expects so much, with little gratitude, and compensation. The management is awful, and the dress code for a warehouse environment, is absolutely ridiculous. Was truly disappointed in the company. They do not believe in working smarter.  They preach safety, but expect you to lift heavy objects, without properly setting them down. You should be able to squat to release a heavy item...not bend."
bad,The manager barely gave me any hours. (This is at the watervliet location. He is very rude to new hires and tends to scare them off. Bad work environment in general.
bad,"My store I was the only one with schooling & hands on experience repairing vehicles. All employees were told they had to ""upsell"" items a car does not need and/or is no longer required for proper vehicle operation."
bad,"hate it hate it hate it, management sucks, told since hire that they promote within but watch people with less expierence come in and boss you around. chances are someone in the company is dating their boss. place sucks for pay. they do yearly raises of like 10 cents"
bad,"um............................its a car parts store, not very exciting, unless you have a love for cars, and even then most of the parts are standard after market parts"
bad,"Very high stress job,with little to no appreciation for the hard work you put in. They don't want to pay anyone what there worth, Pay raises are a joke. No sick pay, you only get vacation time. You're told you cant have any unpaid time off if your a Fulltime Employee."
bad,"En un dia comun y corriente solo te sientas a tomar llamadas, el ambiente es seco y serio como cualquier otro y las posibilidades de crecimiento aunque sean muchas no subes de 100 pesos por nivel y necesitas el año o años para subir de nivel, en resumen cuentan con una cultura laboral normal y la direccion no te valora como en cualquier empleo, solo te dan unos pines si hiciste algo bien, no te confundas aqui no dan bonos pero si lo que buscas es una empresa en la cual establecerte y estar triste, nada como un buen call center llamado Datazone, los sirvientes de tiendas y clientes."
bad,To many upper management clowns to answer to. Low pay for the knowledge some have. All about the numbers and rude when numbers are not being met. Just all aroumd corporate America BS
bad,This is a great place to work in your first 2 years. After that it becomes a nightmare with harassment from management to targeting certain individuals. Upper management will leave the building and go to the gym for a couple of hours then come back. Unfair treatment of seasoned employees.
bad,"Was a part sales manager, but pay was not congruent for the job requirements. Terrible place to work for, wouldn't recommend to anyone with a family. I wouldn't recommend to anyone, family or not."
bad,"My manager was incompetent, knew what he was talking about when it came to cars but did not know how to interact with the employees or problem-solve. I really would not recommend working at this place unless you are a teenager looking for minimum employment or financial gain"
bad,greedy company that paid poorly and did not care about their employees poorly and all they care about is them selves they could not even cover my shift when my grandma died.
bad,This is a good job for a high school student. unless you run the store you wont make good money and will be looked down on. Not a good place for a career.
bad,Upper management get all the credits and all profit sharing.  They hire part time employees so they don't have to give any kind of benefits.  The start pay sucks and so does their pay raises.  They have a very high turn over rate.  I mean very high.
bad,Autozone is not the place to work its fast pace and hard to keep your numbers and production up so yea with that being said i do not recommend this to anyone
bad,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians here. Terrible treatment of employees. Management thinks they can just do nothing and be paid for it. Terrible place to work for its an environment where management and customers are always right the employee in the middle is the one who catches all the c.
bad,"Autozone fails to follow some laws when pertaining to wages or meals and breaks. Managers are not compensated for the work that they provide (minimum wage), sometimes they will have you working shifts from 7:30 am (open) to 10:15 pm (close). No problem whatsoever with co-workers, customers, or the actual work to be done, major issues with upper management, (district,regional,corporate)."
bad,"This place has the worst safety, life balance, and over care of any place in the area. The management is terrible and you either get away with murder or treated like you’re scum on the back of their shoe. Lots of overtime, big favoritism, if you get injured they will try to get rid of you regardless of fault. e.g harassing/ bullying the person into trying to point out or leave. "
bad,"its an ok job but you never get appreciated for coming in short notice, i went from full time to part time because i went to school. i complained to corporate and they transferred me with no opportunity for FT."
bad,"always understaffed, poor pay, no matter what your experience or skill might be. this might be something if you want to do a part time job while going to school etc. but I do not recommend this as a career choice"
bad,the company its self may not be a bad company however the managers i had were the worst and corporate office didnt want to fix the issues. even though store numbers were not produced they refused to investigate the common issues even when evidence was produced several times of management stealig
bad,"Nobody works hard, if you do, don't expect advancement unless you are the bosses favorite. Favorites rarely are the hard workers. Hard workers spend too much time working and not enough time being/becoming a manager favorite."
bad,"Worse company ever , poor manager , any stupid person can be a manager at auto zone,  manager don't do anything ......................................"
bad,I worked there for 8 years and always got looked over!! It was the worst... always looking past the people below everyone....  never has been a fair company
bad,good place to learn about cars but not to make a career out of. fast pace environment. Alot of phone answersing involved. Great employees to work with.
bad,I hated everything about this place. It was poorly run for one. The manager would take her and another manager on 2 hour breaks and leave store to fend for its own at busiest of times. Low pay as well.
bad,"Worked my butt off for this company, stayed when they needed help, came in on my days off, took initiative to learn as much as possible and was treated like just some female, lied to about promotion and raise. I would never recommend working for this company in my area at least can't speak for others."
bad,Working here was an ok job. They filled their positions and without much training. You have to basically learn everything on your own or through the computer.
bad,There is no advancement for women. Worked for Auto Zone for almost 11 years and was passed over for store manager many times. Not because I was not qualified as first store manager trained me.
bad,"Poor management, pay, and hours . The work was a joke , parts are cheap, system is ridiculous . would never recommend anyone goes to autozone. Most unprofessional environment,"
bad,"Does not care about their employees, will fire you if you speak out against shady dealings between managers. Regional manager has been made aware many times, doesn't care."
bad,"Auto Zone is a well known company, it is so sad that they feel like their employees can survive off working 17 hours a week. I would like to think that they can do better."
bad,worst job ever south Tacoma way AutoZone has THE worst management . which is why I found another job. I would neeeeever recommend anyone to work here . stay away
bad,"Management was good when started but changed. Love the job but there are issues like all jobs. "
bad,From my opinion and the years I gave to this company... Its all about who you know on whether or not you move up. It also helps if you are a man when it's time to be promoted to a manager. I felt like I was used to improve the store I was at and then disrespected.
bad,"the store itself was great. not a fan of the DM he made things very difficult"
bad,Okay place to work if you are male and know about cars. Pay is not that great and girls don't seem to have a success rate in this business even if they try really hard.
bad,"I was late once in the 2 years I worked there, but was never allowed to call off. I was the lead in sales, but was barely paid above minimum wage. I cleaned the entire store and organized years of clutter and catastrophe, yet was let go because thousands of dollars are missing and I was pointed out because I would have a habit of telling my bosses to get off of facebook and help with the dozens of customers who are waiting on one person (me) to help them all."
bad,"good place fast paced, good people. management is ok , learned a lot on cars , worked full time while going to college , good for students and first time job seakers"
bad,My manager did not have the proper knowledge to run that type of store. Other managers did not treat all customers the same and were inappropriate with several customers in my short time there.
bad,Autozone distribution center 55 is the worst place to work because the managment treats people like slaves and the people are really hypocriates. plus they dont atke care of you if you have an accident
bad,very unfair treating..high internal theft..they will drop you down to part time without warning..its a dead end job..they wont allow you to better yourself
bad,Don't know horrible company the general manger is not fair with all employees and the company sucks they don't care about anyone they need a hole new crew there stores are horrible Sou th ogden is clean and okay people the 31 at store is dirty in organized the people there don't care about anything they don't drug test you it is a horrible company
bad,"Management had no clue as to how to do their jobs, nor troubleshoot any interpersonal issues that would arise. Long days, no breaks, wages borderline a joke."
bad,The upper management is terrible. They do not care about there employees at all.  The district managers have no respect for any employees. They do not know how to run a company
bad,"Very busy, 2 people at night with 20 customers, gotta be careful with drawers coming up with missing money, fraud returns, making sure someone doesn't see your password or will do a fraud return with it or money missing. stressful with customers."
bad,"Low pay, poor inconsistent hours, Terrible employee appreciation. You would close one night, then be in at 5 in the morning, I never received a raise in 2 years even though i was supposed too after ninety days!"
bad,Garbage people fill the store to the roof.  By far the worst retail experience I've had. Customers are typically idiotic and management is not much better.  Horrible culture that puts profit before everything else.  Me and other managers worked 12 hour days with no breaks or lunches. District manager is nothing but a selfish weasel who breaks nearly every promise he makes.
bad,You were expected to read the customers mind. You were asked to go out and work no peoples cars in all weather conditions even though that was not supposed to be part of the job. Low pay. No set schedule. Late getting work schedule so could not plan around schedule or have a second job. Might be hired for 40 hours but very seldom would you get that many. No real option for advancement to management if you were not hired as a manager.
bad,AutoZone corporate is not very good place to work. Computer systems and hardware are outdated. Management is petty and they like to micromanage. No sense of belonging.
bad,There were too many over-turns with store management.  This caused the work environment and procedures to change non-stop.  Employees were very confused as to what was proper protocol and working days were extended due to lack of coverage.  Commercial started to plummet and customers were very aggressive due to lack of merchandise.
bad,Managers are not willing to train you. Very cut throat environment. Management discourages you to advance. Company over works employees and under pay them. If you don't have friends or family in upper management you are doomed. It's based on not what you know but WHO you know.
bad,autozone is a bad place to work for the people dont take there job to heart and when they do its to late the maniger that is there does nothing to get them to work and the maniger is the same
bad,"Definitely was harassed at this job to the point of quitting. No morale, honesty, no care for personal life. I would work for Auto zone again cause honestly I liked selling car parts."
bad,"No advancement for women. Salaries are not comparable to other places. I would not recommend it to anyone after wasting years of my life before finding out about no advancement for me,"
bad,The worst company on the planet to work for! Terrible management. Terrible wages. This company doesn't care about anything besides making the numbers look good on paper. I hate this company and the worthless managers.
bad,A very ungrateful company. Just google the many lawsuites. Lack of pay for the stress. Over whelming and hazardous. From yhe customers mistreating you to the store managers and DMs.
bad,The supervisory discriminated and I wouldn't work back there. The surroundings are rude. Workers aren't treated right in all the whole place is a bad environment.
bad,"My job at Autozone has been the worst experience I have ever had. I have been sexually discriminated against, treated horrible, told that my family does not come first, and told that I will be fired for missing work even with a doctors note because my son is so sick. I have to find another job that agrees that family should always be first."
bad,"Auto Zone is a mill for stripping the money from the customers and using the employees to do it at as little cost as possible. The corporation does not care about anyone because they just keep rolling workers in and out along with the customers. Everything is designed to maximize sales and minimize loss and expense. There is nothing that is not designed by the company from the way products are placed on the shelves down to the over the top security passwords in the computer systems. We are told to always say, ""Yes we have that!"" even if we don't, then you are told to say ""it will be here in the morning from our Hub"". There are so many returns because of part failure but as long as you only issue store credit the money still stays in their pockets. The customers have no clue and just keep on handing the money over. The attendance policy is designed to get rid of employees before they get too much tenure, and the scheduling is randomized each week to make sure you will screw up. They like to mix your internal clock up by making you close at nine and then open at six. Or they bring you in at three till close and from ten until four the next day, but they never repeat more than once in a month. When they say ""our customers come first"" they mean get the money first and make them try to get it back. Most customers don't try because it is such a hassle so they just leave their money behind. Even with the hurricanes you still have to get to work on time or you get demerit points. When you hit twelve you are done. You will get two for being late five minutes and three if you don't call"
bad,Just was an poorly managed store. That lack teamwork. There was no leadership from the management. I never received the correct training. But I believe not all Auto Zones are poor places to work for.
bad,this company suffers from a lot of turn over. people are not being compensated effectively. people aren't being trained correctly and there's racial divides between emplyees.
bad,"Its low pay with a lot of jobs in one. Only way you can move up, is if you are close friends with management. Hard work is not notice or rewarded friendship is. If it's your first job then its ok to learn to be able to remain calm in any situation."
bad,"Store manager and top assistants have been together for years and will throw new people to the forefront when something goes wrong, only loyalty is to each other, looking good is always more important than being good, if that means cheating a customer or lying to them to put up better stats, then so be lt"
bad,just a boring job to be at no one cares to work in professional way everyone comes in late they do what they want no advancement in any position you get
bad,"this company has a tendency to make promises that it doesnt intend to keep. Multiple management figures made promises of advancement, pay raises, and promotion. did not honor one of the promises"
bad,"I rather not type much about this company, if I could give no stars I would."
bad,"a typical day at work is busy"
bad,Bent policy on a daily basis to suit they're own needs. No room for advancement. Worked circles around other employees just to be let go over a flat tire.
bad,"poor work hours, low staff, no breaks, and bad management, constant re-location, unprofessional and bad work environment. stressful workplace, they don't show employees any appreciation."
bad,It was a great learning experience it taught me so much about managing a team and also about managing myself indivisually. It also showed me how go work as a  team to get the job done and have a productive day.
bad,"the management is terrible with communication ,they only care about their bonuses and don't care what you have sacrificed for the company and don't dare question them"
bad,"When I worked it i hated it there always drama with the managers and the rest of the workers. Bi-polar managers,  they don't try and give you a higher pay at all. I have auto/diesel background and i still couldn't a higher pay. I asked for more hours and my hours got cut. They do not work with you at all since they cut my hours i had to pick up a second job and was told I couldn't I have a second job. Then after telling them I need it or done  then they wanted to change. They will make you do all the outside work so they can stay in the A/c They as in the managers or they leave you all alone in the store with a lot of customers needing to be helped knowing you need a manager password for almost everything."
bad,Poor upper management. Pay is low. Raises are low. Breach of contract is in order. I dont recomend anyone working for autozone. Management lies and your miserable
bad,You have managers and employees having relations and other things. You have employees leaving when ever they want to with no punishment to their actions
bad,Manager would give me hours and the assistant manager would take my hours away.... they will make up bad things about you to try to get rid of an employee
bad,They expect slave labor with hardly any breaks. Many 10 hour days with one lunch break and no 15 minutes . Not worth it. Dont work there if you can...
bad,the DM for the Pittsburgh  region is worthless and will fire you so that he can promote his girlfriends. the store i worked for was great but outside of the direct store almost all higher up were useless
bad,"Horrible pay, Hours and request for what you make. Pay rate is drastically below market value compared to similar positions at other companies. "
bad,"From  store manager to the C.E.O. The customers satisfaction and safety are but aside in exchange for horrible service and making quotas. If you like being condescended to by people who have never done a hard days work in their lives, Autozone is definitely the place for you."
bad,"well working at Autozone sucked, even though i had a lot of experience in this field. no matter what store you worked for it never felt like a good environment to work in. Everything you do goes unnoticed, i was a parts manager and i felt like a regular worker. The store manager does not give you respect which makes it a little hard for team members to respect you."
bad,"The job itself was a easy job, however it is not a job for a women. Men will hit on you and touch you in ways you don't want to be touch. They don't really have any respect for women that work there. The manger blames you and the way you dress for the disrespectful comments and behaviors"
bad,Auto Zone is not race friendly. I have encountered so much disrespect by the customers and employees. I did learn a little while not being racially profiled for not speaking Spanish
bad,I liked this job because i learned more about cars than i knew before. They were very hands on so i learned everything quick. Also the pay was fair and the workers were nice.
bad,There pay sucks and management is bad... The manager is not good with making employee feel safe welcome or even like if they are worth being thre ... Over work the employees for little pay
bad,"while working at auto-zone i experienced a lot of different things.A typical day at auto-zone would go like this, i would walk in to the store clock in and start stocking depending on if a customer was there i would stock by myself for about 30 to 35 minutes. then the manager would call me and complain that i am not stocking fast enough when their are two other sale associates not doing anything that could have been assisting me. getting close to the end of the shift, i would either finish assisting customers or finish stocking products. five minutes before clocking out i would do a quick run through the store make sure things are put back up and then work register till my shift was over. on a typical day i would have worked a 4 or 5 hour shift."
bad,"If you like the automotive industry, this is a great place to work.  The only set back would be the customer service aspect of working there.  The Company has great ideals, but however management in the company is unacceptable.  There is little potential to grow within the company.  They want you to do everything for them with no reward and horrible pay.  If you are working holidays, forget about getting time and a half or even anything more than 20 hours a week if part time."
bad,Bad Cooperate Management Would not recommend anyone work for autozone they do not care about their employees only about how much money they can make and what they can use you for.
bad,"poor pay with an even worse schedule, poor training poor management skills. bias managers too much to list on how negative this company is. good luck working there."
bad,"Autozone is a good company but they don't try to help you move up in the company, they don't really care about their employees,  i worked there for 3 years and as many times i tried to improve myself and move up they denied me."
bad,"The last store I managed had a 10% increase in retail and a 12% increase in Commercial.  Was able to change attitudes and get everyone of the employees to perform above and beyond past employment history. Hired good people and helped people get promoted. "
bad,"i worked at to different stores, the people that work at autozone are rude, and the pay at autozone is low and they want you to work alot of hours with low pay. no vacation, sick paid off days, benefits, until you work for them for 1 years full time, not part-time."
bad,I loved working with customers. Helping them to chose the right part to fix their automobiles. It's fun learning knowledge about cars. Sometimes it was a messy job when i had to change a customers battery. But fun at the same time
bad,I can't speak for the whole company but my store was a terrible place to work.  Back-biting and rumors being spread by management made the store a very uncomfortable place to work.  When the store manager started asking us to lie to customers (anything it takes to close the sale) and threatening subordinates with cut hours or worse if we didnt't.... that's when my conscience dictate that I leave and find honest work elsewhere.
bad,Very harsh work environments while having to push through a lot of discrimination and competition for job titles. Hourly wages and benefits are challenging as well.
bad,"worked 3 hard years for this company and when I asked to be set full time they kept giving me the run around. Their excuse , was that my shirts where dirty . working at a job where half the products are covered in oil and battery acid . and they make you buy your own shirts . NO THANK YOU"
bad,Worst job I've ever had. Little to no concern for employee well being. Management only cares about the money/sales. Work hours are not aligned to have a Job/Life Balance. Scheduling was horrible. Pay was horrible. Benefits were modest. If they could work you 24 hours with no break or meal period they would but since its the law they will do but be disgruntled.
bad,"At this location the team was very lazy, bad at costumer satisfaction, and overall not friendly. I would not recommend any one to apply here. Good company but poor staff."
bad,"It's the worst company I have ever worked for.  The managers and district managers discriminate when it comes to promotion.  They expect to much for nothing in return. If you are interested in 5-10 cent raises for a whole year, and if you are looking for a job without any advancement opportunities then this is the job for you.  Just don't speak up when you are treated unfairly because the managers are expected to retaliate.  However, it is fun helping out customers."
bad,very easy work. the manager is very nice and the take care of the customers very well. the hardest part of the job is finding stuff on the shelf. the job overall is not hard
bad,I worked a decade for this company and was terminated because I mentioned that I may need to seek another profession due to a chronic back issue and the job not agreeing.
bad,"minimal hours, low pay, management sucks, hard to move up in this company, management expects you to break your back and work like a dog for minimum wage"
bad,"Autozone inc. cares about two things, money and how to make more of it. It's a thankless job with horrible benefits and pay. The employees are treated as numbers. there's no job security with high employee turnover rates."
bad,Autozone was stressful and unfulfilling. It took forever to get promoted and the pay was not very good. overall just not a good place to work .............
bad,"poor management skils from the way top all the way down. the best thing about this company was that I no longer work there,If you want a dead end job than, this company is the right one for you,"
bad,Very horrible the worst place I've ever worked the company does not care or respect their employees  and the pay couldn't be worse
bad,"Had an unfortunate event happen where a coworker threatened my life. I reported it to HR and was told to take 3 days off while they investigated.  When I returned, I had been written up 5 times while I was gone. Ridiculous."
bad,"Las politicas de autozone estan bien fundadas , son los gerentes de distrito , gerente de region los que no los cumples con ellas  , por eso hay muchas bajas , ya que los empleados son tratados como esclavos, los hacen quedarse tiempo de mas y no les pagan tiempo extra. la gerente de recuros humanos de la region tijuana es la peor de todos , se le da una queja y no hace nada , ya que tienhe favoritismo con los gerentes de distrito."
bad,"Understaffed and over worked And underpaid, most SM are worried about bonus program rather than focus on tasks needed to meet sales, staffing is a major issue. Too much moving problems with employee instead of handling them."
bad,To this company you are just a number they hope shows up everyday for their lacking  job and pay. The hours they have you work are ridiculous because either people just don't show up or the people who actually DO their job get shafted most of the time an are not valued as much as the lazy employees.
bad,"to many chiefs not enough indians. "
bad,Starting out at 8.25 an hour and getting know raise know matter how hard you work and getting absolutely no advancement and appreciation.
bad,Upper management slams you every day and never makes you feel like you are doing the right job. Company is so focused on WITTDTJR they want you to sell a grease packet on items we install it pushes people away.
bad,People take advantage of you and walk all over you here you don't get paid for what you are doing and I care way too much about my customers not to care
bad,"its awful place to work. very unorganized. no help and no training"
bad,poor place to work pay is bad and if not a manager you are the dirt on the welcome mat was called a liar by district manager for not taking safety test that i did and told my manager to shut up when he tried to tell him that i had taken the tests not a good place to work for if they treat their employees like that
bad,"autozone rewards employee benefit longterm "
bad,"Auto Zone management in my experience has treated employees very unfairly. Management does not speak up for other store employees. Emplyees are known as ""red shirts"" and treated as the under dog. Getting a promotion in Auto Zone is done by ""knowing"" or ""getting along"" with your store manager. If your store manager does not like you a promotion will not be offered. A transfer is likely while working for Auto Zone so a member of management can be sent to a new store at a request."
bad,Horrible work place they play favorites the supervisors don't supervise just talk with the young women there all about production but preach safety but there not safe at all
bad,"autozone is all about sales.They are only concerned about numbers."
bad,Just an all around terrible place to work. They overwork you and try not to pay you at all. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worse enemy. Terrible management.
bad,"Overly micromanaged, District Manager only cares about what the reports are and not the people. No stability and no one from upper management will help you"
bad,none not nor am I interested in writing a review about past employers this is offensive and intrusive in to the personal history
bad,there is no good reason to work here besides they pay better than the other auto parts companies.  YOu cant ask questions or give your input or you will be looked over.  There is no life to being a manager... you must always be available and work when required... no more weekends or holidays... enjoy them while they last
bad,"Everyday is different"
bad,"If you died tomorrow you would be lucky if this company sent flowers."
bad,"-terrible uppermanagement"
bad,"I really enjoyed working for the company. It was very challenging and hard work at first but a couple of months into it, things were running smoothly.. I was trained by a very smart manager who new a great deal about the automotive industry."
bad,"i wouldnt even send my dog there to get tortured by people sitting on top and watching people work like animals."
bad,"I learned more about cars"
bad,Management does not care about employees. Focus is on selling and numbers not on customer satisfaction. Decent employees to work with
bad,decent job but my co workers were great people just the way the company was ran could have been better management was decent hardest part was doing a lot of work for practically no pay even as an assistant manager. most enjoyable was getting to work with the great guys I work with.
bad,Just basic checking guest out and selling car parts.Didnt like being the only female. Hardest part about the job was installing batteries in the rain.
bad,"wont recommend this company even to a enemy."
bad,"My days consisted of coming into work in a place that forced its workers to upsell ""necessary"" items to customers who honestly don't know what they're doing. Granted we were expected to educate them about what was best for their vehicle, but a lot of people refuse to believe that. We as workers should not be punished for other peoples' ignorance."
bad,"this job is real easy and fun, unfortunately it is more for a student with minimal financial responsibilities, because the pay is low and is only part time."
bad,"well autozone might be a good company to work for if your up in management and making good money,but if your the low man just hired in ,the pay is not good at all."
bad,this was a good job love my coworkers my day would go buy so fast .the hardest was replacing the batteries in the hot sun and truck day . Mangier was always in a bad mood and wouldn't help out much
bad,You go where ever they tell you to go. If you say no to going to another store you are black listed. If you try to question a DM or a policy you are black listed.
bad,its a good starting place to learn but impossible to move up without being close friends with people higher up in the corporate ladder
bad,Company does not care about it's employees. All that matters is the bottom line. Asks employees to push products that are not needed by the customers.
bad,i worked there for 7 years we never closed except for twice a year. in the winter even though your not supposed to be on the street during a weather advisory they require you to be there no matter what. they dont care if you have a medical condition either your just expected to work. they would not schedule lunches regularly.i worked alot of over time. did alot of extras for the company went above and beyond my job . only good thing of the job is that i got to help customers with there problems.
bad,"the job was alright nothing hard, just wished I wouldn't have got laid off so fast...learned that they hire and fire people easy and seasonly"
bad,autozone is not worth working for...trust me...i was there 6 years.  I do not recommend working there.  Save yourself from a heartache.
bad,They expect your services  to be available from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Monday to Sunday but will  ONLY give you less than 12 hours a week schedule for a 15/7 full-commitment. Are you kidding me?
bad,"I didn't like work for the place. I will never go back to that place."
bad,"(Stocker) Responsible for unloading merchandise off truck, and 				      stocking floor shelves"
bad,"I don't put down companies but this one is the worst i have ever worked for. With this company it goes further than just a bad boss or bad co-workers, the company and how they do business is very bad."
bad,company doesn't care about employees....alot of stealing of parts....place is a joke...if tour not happy about the environment you work in they give you less hours and look for another worker and try to wean you out of a job.
bad,"It all depends on management. "
bad,A typical day at work is normal. I learned a lot about vehicles.Management is good. Co-workers are good to work with. The hardest part is moving up in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is what you make it.
bad,Management left a lot to be desired. and job security very low.
bad,"Satisfied. Positive job experience"
bad,"I had to work under too many managers over the 3 years I worked there.  They overlooked me for advancement and did not compensate me for the time I spent taking someone else's shift after they called out.  I pulled double shifts on a regular basis. I was lied to about advancement opportunities and pay increases. Overall, this working for this company was a terrible experience. Over those 3 years I worked in Wake Forest, Louisburg, Rolesville, Henderson, and 2 stores in Raleigh."
bad,"Very fast paced environment working with the customer to get the right part the first time was the key to success at autozone keeping the customers happy made the business grow. Knowing how to read pl's  and going over them with the district managers every week was key. Making sure that your store was properly staffed at all times was very important also developing your team for success, making sure they were ready to move up the ladder when needed. The hardest part of the job was gaining the confidence form the male customer who did not believe that I am very knowledgeable about cars. But what I enjoyed the most was my staff we worked so well together"
bad,If i knew the way they treated there employees i would have never applied  extremely low pay and cut hours.
bad,Management takes all the credit for the work you do. No matter if they were not in the building. They over work you under pay you and thier confiedentiality system DOESNT exist. As long as you bend over backwards for them they will give you a few hours but the minute you ask for the correct job title or compensation they no long want to be bothered.
bad,"I'll start with the upper management. They are the worst to try to talk to about anything. They'll cut you're hours to the point you never make ends meet. I was a full time employee and sometimes got 25 hrs  a week. The benefits suck along with the pay and the 10 cent a year raises. They don't appreciate anything you do, nor how hard you work. They only recognize the sales which they were never happy with. I worked there over 5 years and would not recommend this company to my worst enemy...."
bad,Miserable experience.  Lousy place to work.  I received a written reprimand for coming back from lunch one minute too early.  Unreasonable expectations and very hostile environment.
bad,"Management was not very well organized, did not conduct business very well such. Did not learn much at this job."
bad,I only like the customers the company is horrible to work for with low pay! They let any one run the stores especially the ones ran in jersey HORRIBLE!
bad,Good place to start a career.This place gives you good knowledge.
bad,"store manger jesus zamudio doesn't like to give hours but the thing you do Customer service,Stocking Merchandise,Cleaning,Salesman,Organized products,putting new planogram"
bad,"Management within this company is not good at all. I require a professional environment, where staff and management work toward providing the best service to the customers. However, there was much dishonesty within management."
bad,This is not a good company to work for. The management has no training or professionalism. Most of the management has no education above a high school diploma if that. Customers will treat you like you are inferior and other employees treat customers the same. I'd stay far away.
bad,"I was a Store manager for them. I was really making a positive change in my store. I found that I have a bad hip and couldn't stand for the 50 hours a week they required.  "
bad,"stay clear, too much nonsense to deal with. would never work for agian"
bad,"a typical day at work involves stocking the shelves and doing anything and everything any of the managers ask me to do which is quite a bit for just being a parts sales associate, as I am currently being trained for management but have yet to get it. my co-workers are constantly back stabbing each other with no remorse. its hard dealing with the constant bickering from them. The only enjoyable part of my job was being able to help costumer's get the right parts for their automobiles."
bad,"Great start if you intend to automotive field a career. The ability to learn about all type of automobiles, parts, and problems. Great for anyone trying to get ASE Certified. Must learn to deal with rude customers and poor management."
bad,Working at Auto did teach me a great deal about parts and people skills. But the lack of full time hours made it almost more costly to work there than to be be unemployed.
bad,Would never work there again not enough pay and no hours and management was terrible
bad,At AutoZone I was able to multitask and it was fast pace and on slow days as a team we work on making our appearance as a store look better. I learn how to lead my team and do inventory. The managers were pretty fair. I really had a great experience with my co-workers. The hardest part about the job is dealing with a irate customer. I enjoyed working with people and meeting new people.
bad,"Bad hours, bad management, just a poor place to work. No training, no support, no investment in personal"
bad,"Low pay, horrible schedules, and bad management...enough said."
bad,"worst place I have ever worked, I was there 5 months and went through 3 managers. company had poor customer service, always told the customer if they could not find it in the computer that they did not have it and sent the customer on their way and lost a lot of business to oreilly auto parts and advanced auto because of this"
bad,This company is very difficult to work for if you have had more than a high school education. They do not offer advancements or the ability to excel in the work environment.
bad,Boys club. You go in work very hard to be treated lie garbage by management.
bad,"This job is rampant with double standards, complete vacuum of leadership, and and overall two-faced approach to customer service. I was actually trained to charge customers for items they did not need, and even told to ring them up without even asking the customer. Also if you have any problem and report it to their ""tips"" line don't expect and confidentiality or protection from your managers. Received an on the job injury due to faulty equipment which I reported to OSHA on 3 separate occasions, and I was denied any type of Workman's comp and in addition was barred a return to work for months until I left for the competition. "
bad,"I don't even know where to begin. If you're thinking of applying here i would pass. Autozone over hires and you WILL NOT get hours. In my store all of the part time workers were down to 13 hours almost all winter. I've never worked anywhere where whole 8 hour shifts just got cut. I was recently asked to become a grey shirt (still part time) and laughed at the opportunity. 25 cents more an hour (literally at the most), way more responsibility and no extra hours. No thanks. If you want to make 12,000 a year this is the place for you."
bad,A typical day at work was dealing with racial slurs and belittling of the minority employees which are african-american due to the fact that autozone employees are predominantly Hispanic or have a Hispanic last name or spouse. I don't feel like I've learned anything from this job but if I did it was to treat everyone with respect at all times and be fair no matter the race or color of their skin. My co-workers I have nothing positive to say about them. The hardest part of the job was just coming in period and dealing with the disrespect and constant inconsideration of peoples feelings and integrity. I enjoyed clocking out everyday honestly the best part of this job.
bad,"I worked at the Bristol rd store with Amelia Hudson as my manager and the work ethics there were disgusting , you don't get but maybe8-10 hrs a week and they give you the days they want off its just a bad place to work with minimum wage!!"
bad,"Too much favoritism and discrimination to work for at this company, not worth your time to try to get a career at Auto Zone"
bad,"Corporate cares nothing of their employees. They want you to push, push, push, and it puts a strain on employees and drives customers away."
bad,poor management and they do not support lower management
bad,A typical day of work consisted of dealing with unsatisfied customers and arguing with bootleggers who are allowed to work on vehicles outside of the business (despite signs posted outside of the building). I was hired at AutoZone as a college student and despite providing my class schedule to be accomodated and I was until the store was short staffed. I was scheduled during my school hours and was working full time hours which interefered with my studies causing me to quit my job.
bad,they would promise advancement but it never comes. they work long hours with little pay. do hard work and not even get a thank you for your extra work.
bad,"Co workers were lazy and manager didn't do good at his job. the Manager was a new manager and his first time managing a store, even the district manager wasn't a trustworthy guy and was also fired a little after i moved to different job. I was a hard worker and was also the change they needed but i alone couldn't change the store by myself, i am only one person but i tried my hardest and made sure the job was done right regardless of my other co-workers."
bad,Not a good place for oportunities of ascending position. Your treated by your workposition.
bad,I started this job as a temporary stepping stone until I could find something in my degree field (design). I ended up staying over 8 years.
bad,I wish i would have know it was that bad cause I wouldnt have accepted the postion.
bad,depending on what region u work for is what proves the good of the job.
bad,Typical day at work was unpredictable
bad,"BAD CORPORATION!!! No Advancement or raises to speak of. Co-workers are pitted against each other, Store Managers think they own store and lie on scheduling to corporate, then give hours to their pets...."
bad,"too much unorganization, the benefits are not the greatest, upper management along with the D.M. are more focused on upper management then the hourly associates."
bad,the worst place i ever worked bad managment and nothing to learn just slave driving
bad,very unprofessional management and co workers dont pay enough for the amount of work they want done terrible job
bad,It is a very stressful enviroment for a female to work. The hardest part of the job is having no know knowledge of car basic parts and mechanics.
bad,I'm use to corporate environments and shop atmospheres. My one year experience so far in the automotive parts retail business has been a less than pleasant experience.
bad,Autozone was not a good company to work for. Very little advancement opp.
bad,"unreasonable work schedules, unreasonable expectations and no support from upper management. You can make no changes to this ridged structure, it works their way or no way, stuck in the 80's and not willing to change. If you are a robot this would be great for you, there is nothing new to learn!!!"
bad,I didn't learn anything i didn't already know about auto parts. They didn't train me at all for the management position i was given. The other managers were not friendly and reliable. I had great co-workers. The hardest part of my job was learning the management roll because i was never trained. The most enjoyable part of ny jib ws my customers and helping people.
bad,Autozone has a very poor structure that has no respect for there employees. Would not recommend anyone working there.
bad,One of the most underrated jobs in the parts industry. Management tought me so much.
bad,Commercial sales.
bad,A company lacking integrity towards employees and customers!  Honesty is not the norm for this company only profits. Regional managers decide how store managers operate or change store strategies not the store managers.  The local stores wealth of information is ignored when evaluating the needs of that demographic population.
bad,"Ambiente laboral muy pesado, falta de comunicación y organización entre las áreas, no se cumple la cultura laboral, RH siempre a favor de los gerentes y directores, no se toman en cuenta, alta rotación de personal"
bad,"The customer is always right even when they are wrong. They pay is no good compared to the work load you will have. Which is why i had to seek work elsewhere, I do not recommend this jobz"
bad,I hate this job mostly because of the people i work with and the hours. They promise things that they dont follow through on and they pick favorites and the highest raise I have gotten annually is .08 cents
bad,"They will honestly hire anyone  which will make your job 10x harder,especially when their turn over rate is 50%.. This job is a job for someone young that needs money.. This isn't  a career job! Regional Manager sucks and depending on which store you go to all Managers suck accept a few hand. Training is poor so expect to learn by trial and error.."
bad,The DM and the Store Manager do not  appreciate all your know about vehicles I was the only person in the store out of 16 employees that know about cars.
bad,"You will work for wall street. The store will always be purposefully understaffed because managers receive bonuses based on labor savings. You will be called in on days off, but never enough to earn overtime."
bad,"Never work here...."
bad,"I was a parts sales manager. As such, Autozone will expect you to fill in for the store manager, commercial sales manager, other sales managers, and subordinates. You will likely be required to fill the role of mechanic, salesman, general laborer, upper management, parts expert, etc..."
bad,"Unprofessional performance between departments and from management teams makes each day a stressful task. "
bad,"You do way too much than asked for the pay, if you ask for a raise they treat you horrible from then on. Even when your one of two of the only unloader for the company."
bad,Good only as second pt job. Or you are a student. No future in the Company. Only promote from the outside. No bunuses no perks no holiday pay. Poor hours. This company is a fortune 500 company that dosent take care of there employees. They just dont care.
bad,"management didn't know what to do most if the time."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend working at autozone to anyone terrible company doesn’t care about employees what so ever. I’ve worked here for 6 months make 9 an hour an can’t move up in the company because I’m 18 years old. I only get maximum 60 hours for 2 weeks of work I think autozone is a joke, I’ve asked multiple times to get more hours because I have bills to pay an most the time I jabbed to go get a loa becase I get paid so portly"
bad,"Lots of favoritism. Hard workers are over worked.  And once a advisor don't like you you will get the worst assignment. There friends get the easy jobs. The place is run by the community.  These people grew up together so if you not from there you get treated like bad. I liked the old management that moved to Florida. At least they treated you fair. Minorities really get it once your on there bad side. "
bad,"not going into any excessive detail, place needs someone to give everyone what their direct expectations are of them in their particular positions. Towards the end they started employing anyone that was a living breathing body. Which presents you with a situation where everyone else is constantly asking you questions while your attempting to get your daily managerial tasks done.....knowing full well they hired them with absolutely no automotive knowledge...at that point my friend you're working their job too...not worth it."
bad,The district managers do not have their employees back on anything. Employees are disposable and no training is offered. The only reason I stayed is to prove the store manager wrong g who stated it was not the job for me because I questioned his actions. He was later fired for theft and the DM tried to keep the store managers job
bad,"you learn really quick how attendence means everything, also there are times of discrimination based on your shift, they don't care for the weekend shift, or night shift, their top prioroity would be their monday- thursday shift, their work load on those days are low, but if it's heavy, they rather put it on the weekender or night shift, and heaven help you if you speak up, you WILL be given the "" no one is a victim speech "" ."
bad,Autozone cares about money only. Will work  you into the ground and give nothing in return. Lots of promises and very low pay.  What more can I say. Stay away from this company.
bad,"Very under paid, with poor management to back that up. No opportunity for growth and they have a high turnover rate."
bad,"One of the worst companies to work for, the district manager doesn’t care about his people, and he treats them very badly, don’t recommend working for rick"
bad,"Low pay, condescending, no upward movement, people lie but hold you to expectations they themselves do not do!! Tell you one thing and do another!! Not a good place to work"
bad,"I had a brief work experience with AutoZone and I'm glad I didn't stay any longer. Each and every Manager I met all said the company has no care at all for it's employees"
bad,"The scheduling is so erratic and ridiculous one day you work from 730-11am then the next you work from 11am-10pm and management is corrupt, pay is bad"
bad,There's nice people there but No one is well trained. They don't pay you well. Benefits are good but Management is horrible. Everyone lacks experience about any car knowledge
bad,I really enjoyed working with some of the people I encountered while the time I played my role however management above me only cared about their bonuses and how they looked to the people above them.I am a man with responsibilities and a family and felt like I was being unappreciated the amount of stress and work I put in didn't equal to the amount of money I was bringing home.Some red shirts was more qualified than the store manager.I was a grey shirt (Part sales manager) Which I had more of an influence on my co workers than the higher ups and just right before I left instead of giving me a higher position they hired someone from the outside to play the role.this job is for kids out high school trying to build their resume and work experience people have experience and know what they bring to the table should find a career where they are valued and given a fair shot
bad,Only work there if you want to be worked to death and your job security threatened every day with very little compensation this was very unhappy place to work out they really think that by chanting some song that people will want to work there and they are very unfair giving all the easy jobs for the women and the hard work for the guys
bad,"Autozone had me relocate to open a new store without any help from corporate office. I hired and trained all the employees myself, and they didnt pay relocation until after I was already moved. A few years after the store was running and profitable, they decided to let me go so they could bring in a seniored store manager.  from another"
bad,They were not too good to employees Worried about the dollar and sales. You want anything else FORGET AUTOZONE. Only thing good was the discounts and good customers.
bad,"Gente no apta para manejar el negocio , bajas de personal sin considerar el trabajo producido y esfuerzo , RH con muy mal manejo"
bad,"They want you to eat, sleep, breathe AutoZone. Not worth it. Turnover is ridiculous since no one wants to be there. Mgmt has it's favorites and they're always on their phones and most never help. Bad attitudes all the way around, it's a cake walk if your one of the few favorites. To much stress and you can never count on the schedule that you get to be the schedule you actually work. The"
bad,I constantly requested for advancement and never received any opportunities. I took all chances to pick up shifts and be as available and flexible as possible for no recognition. I was always scheduled on days I asked for off and even though it was a part time job it ruined my life outside of work because I was always scheduled to work when I had plans even though I had requested off.
bad,poor management make a bad day what a joke I have to say more than the fact that it sucks at autozone what is wrong with this picture I dont know why this is imoprtant
bad,It is company a little bit of my time but all in all they were not a very good place to work for they just treated their managers like they were no better than nobody else meaning of the only thing they ever would do for you there is make sure that you get your break
bad,"Favorites played by management, good buddy system in place, pay sucks. Customers can yell an cuss you and you gotta take it. Only perk was a 20% discount and 1hr lunch breaks."
bad,They lie to get you in and use you horrible work conditions machinery is in bad shape attitudes are bad most of there osha requirements are not met just an all around bad place
bad,company wide no more overtime work load to much for the hours no help by manager when needed and everything was blamed on me when it did not get done and they would not give help when i needed it
bad,"Being in Los Angeles if you are not Hispanic you will go no where i this company,it’s all about who you know and what you are willing to do.Very racist towards African Americans,Store managers are pointless because they are just the district manager puppets.They expect you to put your family last and put them first.Horrible pay but they expect tremendous effort.High turn over rate.This is a place for kids out of high school who just wanna get some work experience but there is so much better out there I would never recommend this company"
bad,A typical work day there was very repetitive.  Store manager at the time spent more time in the office than actually helping the staff with anything. Fortunately we had a good crew to work with.
bad,Autozone is corporate. Dont care about their enployees. If you didnt sell enough C.O.C your hours would be cut. They expect you to change batteries under the rain and when you get sick because of it and call out they penalize you by giving you a point or writing you up. When you refuse to change a battery under the rain you get a point. One time i was telling my coworkers how i changed 7 batteries in a row under a 100 degree weather and my manager wouldn't even give me a break... they told me it happen to them to.
bad,"The worst of everything about corporate America.  Terrible management, high stress environment, poor pay compared to other similar jobs.  No training.  Phony customer-first culture.   It’s a place to work until you find something better."
bad,management plays a lot of favoritism recent ops manager is racist their culture is to rat people out and prepare to be retaliated against by management if you say anything that they dont like very toxic work environment and they make decisions based on rumors
bad,"I had the pleasure of getting hired at what I thought would be a fun, good job because of the duties involved and the work that gets done; nope. I got hired at an unlivable wage and given part time hours. Wouldn't recommend the job."
bad,"You really couldn't do anything each store is different and the district and regional managers aren't much help either, if you have a complaint and tell HR they don't do anything to help the situation either. All around one of the worst places i've worked"
bad,As stupid as the employees seem when you go in...they and upper management are even more so on the other side of the counter...an awful business full of awful people!
bad,"Low paying/compared to the work they want you to do."
bad,Store manager would take more days off then his employees. Would always have an excuse to take time off. Senior employees would always get the short end of the stick. No room for advancement or learning. Manager would always expect you to do his job and would always be rude to customers. I will never work there again.
bad,"Existe un gran nivel de favoritismos."
bad,backwards management who is raciest .unless your mexican and speak spanish they treat you like snot. only company I ever seen that actively tries to get there employees in trouble
bad,Everyone is a number and their loss prevention lady sucks she assumes everyone is a thief. Stressful and if you are a manager you cold work 70 hrs a week and only get paid for 50. It happened to me several times.
bad,worst job i ever had no benefits people are rude. Human resource doesn't help you . the pay is low extremely .you get no credit for your work managers leave early
bad,"...did give me experience working and networking with alot of different people,   learned about how the company work from the inside...there was room for advancement...but not enough for me"
bad,With this company you wont get far they demand everything out of you and don't expect to have a personal life they call you on your days off if you don't sell you hear about it from rude district managers and managers customers act like they know everything and also are rude oh and if you don't get work done expect to get written up
bad,I was promoted and was doing well but the results of my performance were poor because of lack of training one had that they do not teach as being a manager.
bad,"There is a staggering amount of turn over at this company, In the two years I worked there 27 employees were hired and Fired/Quit. They are not great at cultivating from within. When the assistant manager position came available at my store they hired outside the automotive industry with someone that knew practically nothing about the products they were to sell"
bad,"This is the place to go if you want to get stuck. Work hard, but get no appreciation. Politics is involved when trying to move up. HR is only worried about Company and not the people, HR will not hear your opinions or concerns.  NO HUMAN ELEMENT TO WORKING AT AUTO ZONE"
bad,"As a manager your expected to perform the duties of sale with the added responsibilities of cash management, the safe and store security."
bad,"Very stressful work environment, upper management is very unprofessional, extreme favoritisim, constantly belittled in front of the customers in the stores."
bad,"inconsistent schedules, basically you never know your work schedule for the upcoming week until that Friday . which prevents any planning of personal time for family or self.  overworked and underpaid.  Irate customer base. constant changing of planograms that do not increase sales.  closed only on Christmas day. stores hours are too long with out generating justifying revenue.  no advancement or slow advancement. Parts sales managers do all the management work but only averages between 10 to 11.75 an hour. part time employees only get 0-25 hours a week at about 8-9 dollars an hour. extremely high turn over of employees. constant beat up over low sales numbers. low WITTDTJR reports are threaten with reprocutions.  even termination.  constant expectation to do work on customers cars when its suppose to be a customer do it yourself type of store. key word store not auto mechanic shop.  misleading advertisements make customers believe its a auto mechanic shop. yearly annual evaluations is only between a 10 - 30 cent increase per hour on a employees pay.  store managers, commercial managers, district managers and up on the chain, are the only ones that receive bonuses. part sales managers and below do all the work"
bad,"Low pay, work overload. No consideration for employee welfare."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. The moral level is so low at our store. All of our workers come to work with their heads down dreading the day to get over with. We don't care for our store manager. He reeks so bad. The workers and customers complain about his body odor. Some of the workers take advantage of other workers while at work. They take long smoke breaks, play with their phones while on the floor, disappear off the floor to go outside. No one seems to care about their jobs. Most of the time, the customers walk in the door and don't get greeted. I work hard for this company. I treat our customers with respect and treat them the way I would want to be treated.  I believe a company is only as good as the management running it. Lets get new management and start over.  Why should workers show up to work and not earn their paychecks. Some good things about this job are their flexible around other jobs, school, and would be good for someone who is retired looking for some extra hours. That's about it. Don't think this company would be good for someone who wants to make a career out of it."
bad,"From a women's perspective this job is not one I'd return to. The customers are sexist and management did nothing about it. I was called names, told to get lost, asked for my number after i repeatedly said no, harassed and got parts thrown at me. The managers are just too much, they promote people who steal from the store and fire the people that really have ethics for their job. They also don't allow over time. I worked 16 hrs one day and had 8 moved to a diff. day so they wouldn't have to pay me over time, also you may or may not get your breaks and sometimes they clock you out while you're still working. illegal activity galore."
bad,all they care about is the money i learned nothing from this job i came into this job with 30 years of previous experiance
bad,use to be a family oriented business but now it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  its all about the all mighty dollar and less about the people.
bad,"Driving 4 to 8 hrs. a day. Loading of Parts. Mgt. Poor, nice coworkers, finding locations, meeting other people."
bad,"Alex(the store manager) has cut down an employees hours to single digit hours knowing he has kids. how is anyone suppose to survive off of less then 100.00 every 2 weeks??"
bad,Boss gave me free rein on everything.
bad,"expect every second counted for and you dont know what time you get off ever"
bad,I worked there for 5 years.  It was a terrible  company the district managers threatened your job on a daily basis. The best thing I did was quit.  There is no place for advancement  unless your are in with the regional manager who has the same attitude  has his district managers.
bad,The workdays are always the same. You are running around constantly answer phones and helping customers. You are always waiting for some help to show up. There is never enough employees to make a day that is not stressful.
bad,It’s a good job but just don’t get enough hours because of my school they pay low an I jus don’t like to be bored it’s kind of a boring job but other then that I like the job an the people I work with
bad,Sometimes you'll work 5 days in a row anoyher week maybe a day or 2. And theb theres times where you will work 8 days in a row with no OT. Good people to work with. Just not a long position job i would recommend to anyone.
bad,"No communication, to many cheifs not enough Indians, the rules change a lot and very very rude people. Would not reccomend for anyone unless desperate but the job is easy."
bad,"Company is a joke. Pay is fair for responsibilities and tasks. Typical retail. Now that being said if you are a full time gray shirt you are expected to with little to no notice. Travel to conduct inventories. inventories. No one asks you in advance if this is something you can do. If you go against it you are punished without being punished by a reduction in hours. This comes from the district manager not the store level. You are also required to buy your uniform tops . all in all this is a great job for someone who is semi retired, retired or a college student. Not a good fit for anyone trying to earn a living and prepare for retirementtellyou one ask"
bad,Regional manager only cared for a chosen few. If you where not in his circle you had little chance for advancement. Hours are bad and raises not very good.
bad,"My time at Autozone started good , but over time ended up being a nightmare , uneven hours non fair pay , I clear standards and god for but you where the wrong dress code"
bad,Was with the company for almost three years until I realized the opportunity for advancement was not going to be offered any time soon. So I went to school and quit my job for something I could excel in.
bad,"It is the worst working environment ever! Cliques and lies fuel most of these stores. If someone doesn’t like you- best believe you will be terminated. Worse than high school with 1000 mean girls and boys"
bad,Beyond that there is nothing. Was physically assaulted by a commercial customer and had another employee sexually harassed by the same person and not 1 thing was done about it. District manager only cares about money. All you will ever be at autozone is a number to him. Does not give 2 sh%ts about employees well being. Great place to get started knowledge about cars and trucks.
bad,autozone sucks. their hr is a joke. store management is stupid. corporate does nothing. the district managers could care less about you. ive worked there for about a year and a half. its really just a paycheck attached to stress.
bad,Dead end place. Really bad customers. They aspect you to know everything about cars and act like a mechanic when selling. They want you to sell useless stuff to rip off customers on stuff they do not need.
bad,"Poor management from store manager to human resources. No integrity, no morals, nor values with this company in this regional district. The company's main concern is the almighty dollar and not the foundation of the company, its store employees."
bad,Upper management ran a little club of good old boys and would fire store managers and assistant managers after complaints about their behavior would surface. No sort of employee recognition and the training is nonexistant. Inconsistent core values and will nickel and dime both their customers and employees.
bad,"Poor pay, scheduling sucks because you get the schedule on Friday or Saturday for the week starting Sunday. Employees are micromanaged , you are not allowed to make a decision of any kind. I worked at two different stores, both were the same."
bad,AutoZone that's not care about their employees. It seems like if you don't speak Spanish and there was not a spot there for you. Very racial very discriminated
bad,When minimum wage goes up don't expect you will make more . Management will not get a raise even though we do more work. HR is not worth contacting when there is an issue. Hours can be crazy with little acknowledgement or recognition from your higher ups.
bad,"My experience with Autozone was shaky. The entire company is disorganized and understaffed. Once things start to become less stressful and the stores begin to reach a level of excellence, management always changes something to the detriment of the location's image, and to the dismay of employees."
bad,Trickle down management turns into puddles of stagnant water at this place of employment. Great company but lackluster management and hostile work environment.
bad,"They work skeleton crews all the time, have unrealistic time tables set for stocking truck, employees are in a revolving door because it's too much stress for little in return, everyone acts like a friend until they stab you in the back, don't try to help anyone or you get fired, pay you bare minimum and you have to pay for your own shirts, they want you to upsell all the time without any compensation or reward. Horrible place to work for. Only apply if you are a masochist..."
bad,"When i first started working there, I was part-time in my first 2 weeks of working there I worked a total of 170 hours as part-time and then the following 2 weeks I worked 160 hours. Within 6 months of working there they made me a fulltime employee and all those hours was being delivery driver. I've been there for 4 years now. Management sucks, people that haven't been late get shafted, but people that come in late get rewarded for advancement in the company."
bad,"Up front Autozone presents itself as a well organized company that cares about its employees, but after working there for about 6 months you will see this is not the case. And the management (at least in the location I worked at) only cared about store operations without regard the the employees. Furthermore upper management (at least in the location I worked at) was sloppy in operating the store and lacked any skills involving efficiency or organization. The place was complete chaos to work at and training was kept to a minimum."
bad,Poor Management and lack of opportunity for advancement. Working in the same department for 4 years in a job that does not request any education with a bachelors and masters degree with no opportunity for advancement due to poor management.
bad,I liked working at autozone but the management wasnt professional at all !!! I learned few things about cars how to change lights and put a battery in.
bad,Not too much to say as far as a good company to work for my experience was very bad dealt with a terrible manager at this particular store which gave me a very poor attitude about the company itself and the way they treat their employees
bad,HR dept requires no schooling and they have too much authority to do as pleases with people they like or dislike. Very political. Must be part of their chliche to succeed and retain your job.
bad,"In the district I worked in, Autozone only cared about the $. It did and does not care about its employees. The pay grade is completely unfair. They like to come in and tell you everything that's wrong but won't hear an explanation. Their computer system is awful. They tell us we are not reaching our quantity for the day and then we log in and it says we are. Then they say well on our end it says this. Their parts are cheap and overpriced. A dangerous place to work because of it. Boxes rip and the stuff falls out at you. Not a big deal when it's brake pads, but when it's a 40lbs strut that's as big as you, it's an issue. They have a ""no hold"" policy which is impossible to do. They refuse to give raises. Managers can not have the weekend off yet one of my former managers gets one weekend off a month to go larping because he's friends with one of the higher-ups. Their insurance plan and benefits are garbage. Your managers will go outside 50 times to smoke but yell at you for sitting down for 1 minute."
bad,As a part timer I works more than 40 hours a week because of the people that were constantly quitting and covering the shifts. They promised me a promotion to manager but it never happen they kept putting it off saying they were waiting on my background check to clear. And the management is the worst they we literally yell at you and write you up for the mistakes they make
bad,"I work in the Bakersfield ca area and im currently a part sales manager im extremely good at what i do butbthe company/management doesnt care they see your performance and then they expect more out of you, even tho i would upsell like crazy i could never ask for a raise because they wanted me to push everyone else as a store so i could get that raise, with all honesty ima tell you guys like it is, managers are underpaid and over worked, your entitled to 2 breaks in a 8 hour shift but other people get upset over you taking your break the yearly raises are 15 cents to like 30 cents, if someone calls out it hurts the whole store and your gonna suffer, you build up sick time but if you call out for being sick you start bumping heads with people so you probably wont end up using it and they wont pay you for it if you leave, it doesnt matter what you do the customer is always right over your opinion, as a manager your just a person with a password you dont even get to make decisions cause you can easliy get written up, people at autozone dont get tested unless you have an accident you know what that means lets just say many people could loose there job, you dont get 40 hours a week youll end up getting 36-38 if your full time, overtime is rare and you can get in trouble if you go over, the only two people at autozone making ok money is the commercial manager and the store manager thats it youll just be there backup with less pay. Vacation time is once a year for 1-2 weeks and its called paid time off, insurance sucks cause your already getting low money, customers will put you down"
bad,It’s an alright job for someone who’s in high school or doesn’t live on their own. Wages are low and hours are inconsistent. Managers and other staff are great.
bad,Very unfair to African Americans! There was a lot of racial profiling and not enough professional behavior. It was very unsafe too. A lot of inappropriate behavior from upper management and if reported they will retaliate.
bad,Auto Zone upper level managers do not follow core principles. Upper level managers do not treat employees with respect and do not value their efforts.
bad,"I did work for Autozone for 3 months, location manager was very helpful but they cut hours one day, next day you have 10hrs with only one hour lunch, no breaks. I was a full time employee but almost never reach 30hrs. Managers, yes they are 50hrs weekly. Payment too low."
bad,"The customers are rude, my coworkers were narcissistic egomaniacs  and the store manager was so incompetent that he became the joke of the store. This place is purely toxic and working for it just feeds into it even more. Avoid this place and never consider working or shopping here again!"
bad,No typical day. Learned a lot about car parts and repair. Management is lazy. Workplace culture is cultists. Hardest part is dealing with angry customers due to poor inventory control. I like helping people.
bad,"If You Seriously Like Abuse This Is The Place. "
bad,very un organized switching managers every week no routine. Very unorganized.not good place to work very unprofessional and very little training for there employees
bad,Had me trained by 3 different people and 2 of them told me wrong information. Being white isn't helpful in this warehouse.they make you do cheers like a cheerleader.
bad,The classes given made my job much easier however being a female made me a target. I didn't feel safe or appreciated. I routinely was harrassed and when i filed a complaint i was ignored
bad,I was what they call a “grey shirt” which means I was a manager. I received MINIMUM WAGE FOR TGE ENTIRE TWOVYEARS I WORKED THERE!!!! AS A MANAGER!!!! It’s kind of embarrassing when your getting the same pay as the people you are managing! The ONLY time I got a “raise” was when the LAW INCREASED MINIMUM WAGE! Sad!!!!! I asked upper management about this obvious oversight and I was dismissed time and time again! Two years.... manager.... might volume store.... MINIMUM WAGE! Poor business ethics!
bad,they like to give you responsability of managment positions but always find an excuse not to properly pay you for them. they over work all there employees and under pay them. If an employee ask its impossible to get answers its always you need to speak with someone else let me transfer you
bad,company sucks overall. they want more work for no pay and write you up and fire you to not meeting their out of focus goals when they don't provide the means to achieve them
bad,The culture could be better as well as pay. Working at this company is rewarding as long as you stay productive. The hardest part is trying to remember where each part is located. A typical day can be very busy depending on the time of the year.
bad,"Job is a stressful environment, 6/10 customers are always rude."
bad,Several times I informed the DM I wanted to grow in the company.  On two occassions my Store Manager was unable to work for weeks and I took on their duties. When there were open Store Manager positions I (who had 2yrs with the co) was passed over and the positions were filled by a man with 3mo with the company and a man who had been a manager less time than myself.  They will use a woman as long as allowed.
bad,"It started off goo to get you in the door but once your in, you want to leave. Its a great  part time job but nothing more. To deal with management for help is a waste of time"
bad,I have worked for them a while now and you spend so much time there its either a 10 or 12 hour shift. But the will only give you 30 to 35 hours a week just enough to keep you full time. While the store manager is paid nicely there lower workers i.e. assistants and other works are almost paid the same. Poor upper management and there is no concern for the worker.
bad,"Loved it, for about 2 years. People started leaving, therefore hours started climbing. It got to the point where they were running a store with 6 employees. The district manager didn't seem to care, nor want to help. No interviews, no hires. Some employees worked for 3 or more weeks without a day off. The job itself isn't bad, but if you want to work your life away, be mircomanaged, and not spend any time with your family, Autozone is the place for you."
bad,"So focused on getting customer emails and upselling every single time, they spend almost no time actually training their employees. They are showing all the signs of a culture that is about to collapse. The management are looking for the ""sweet spot"" money of high salaries with little responsibility and the low rung workers are just doing enough to not get fired. Turnover is high, as is frustration among workers. They punish the good ones and promote the ambitious but incapable. Work hard enough for them and your manager will feel threatened and start messing with you so you quit or do something stupid to get fired. Every. Single. Store. Is. The. Same. Worked there long enough to watch the negativity swell until everyone is at each other's throats and no one cares about the customers they help."
bad,Most people start off and 9 and managers start off at 10.50 workers aren't moviated I hate that I was always they're when they called me and they cut hours 10 times more than any other company I know.
bad,Do not do or say what they promise at all been promised things that have not come through yet just hard to believe that a huge company like that will not follow through with what they say and actually mean
bad,While I worked there Store Manager always left the store knowing that other managers will do the work. Never received proper training by the store manager and If something went wrong the store manager will blame You for It.
bad,i would not recommend this job it is bad bad managers disloyal managers self absorbed they do not cultivate and are not will ing to car about employee family
bad,"Good management is key and there was a severe lack of management. Except to work every night, weekend, and sometimes up to 14 days in a row. Also expect to deal with lying, gossiping and out right backstabbing. Parts is a demanding environment but the amount of drama behind the scenes is the main reason for the constant rotation of new employees and management. "
bad,Horrible management from the top down. Terrible pay and worse hours. No opportunity for personal advancement or growth. Poor training with high expectations of its employees.
bad,"A typical day at work requires doing everything from sweeping to doing planograms."
bad,Worked for the company for 2 years as a manager and the company is not well ran. They only care about tenured employees who have been there for some years. Specifically store managers
bad,"well at this place you don't need to know anything "
bad,just do your job no playing around coworker were nice if you needed help they would help if you sick they help you get your job done & ask no qustion
bad,"hard work for low salary"
bad,Fast and demanding work environment. Help me to hone my automotive knowledge. Helps you and develop's your social/ negotiating skills.
bad,"No training at all, no balance of life work , opening and closing with just one person.No advance opportunities."
bad,"There's no reasonable compensation for the amount of stress for this environment. No benefits, low pay, rotating schedule (for no reason), no work life balance. The only good thing about this job is that occaisionally, you might get a customer  that has a cool car and have a nice conversation."
bad,"I loved the environment helping the customer that walked through the door with their particular problem. Everyday was usually something different. It is a great job if you love working on cars or are eager to learn, you pick up on a lot of information. It was a great employer in the beginning plenty of hours even overtime, and worked perfect with my schedule. A manager got promoted and left the store and a new manager started. The New Manager wouldn't work around my schedule and did not teach me how to request days off on the computer after asking Multiple times. I also tried talking to them about safety hazards that should be addressed and I was ignored. They then proceeded to cut my hours to less then 10 hours a week and scheduled me on the days I couldn't work. I had to call people and have them cover the shifts I couldn't work. On the days I could work they cut my hours to where I would only have 4 hours a week"
bad,I believe the company has a problem keeping employees. Hourly pay is very low and overtime is never permitted.
bad,"I worked here for a year, and it was horrible. It could have just been the particular store I worked for (which was 5030 Delhi Pike, Cincinnati, OH), but my experience was awful and had to quit. Poor management, poor pay, not treated equally."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone working here. AutoZone is a terrible company. Hours can get cut if one doesn't enroll enough customers into its perks system, or doesn't sell enough grease packets with car parts. The company is very cutthroat."
bad,"It sucked, I quit, still it sucks.  They stole lunch time, manipulated inventory time, put pressure on sales, customer service.  Only to turn around and not pay redshirts the hours they are owed, or district manager tries to convince you to give employee hard time only to turn around and do you to same way when you decline.  Attempted to get transfer closer to my house, my body control module failed, towed the car to the dealership, the tow truck guy damages my rack and pinion.  This was in June and July of 2013.  By November, I quit due to an employee returning to my store, he left in January.  I felt like it was a slap in the face.  "
bad,"-Greet customers and assisted them with the right parts for their cars."
bad,loved helping cutomers but worked there for almost two years and went through FIVE DIFFERENT POSITIONS and then got hurt on the job and was fired shortly thereafter.
bad,Horrible hour cuts! Management is lazy and not friendly! Work load is heavy and others dont help with questions regarding parts.
bad,after 4.5 years there is no care for the workers you can work your back side off  and they  do not care
bad,"typically you'd do other people's work and try to stick to their ""customer service values"" and be as polite and helpful as possible to the customers, which is a task of its own since many do not know what they drive or would constantly try to abuse the warranty and return policies of the company, and the only thing you'd get is"" you did that wrong"" or ""great. work faster."" from upper management, who brushes off any concern you may have. if you did have any problems, the end result would be ""I can't help you with that"" and a cut from what little hours you had to work in the first place. the only people who'd run the store correctly was lower management. they would wind up multitasking all time time while their doing their own part. they are the only ones who deserve any praise when it comes to management. "
bad,Paid partime non-managment more than managers who had been there longer as well.
bad,"Good part time job if you don't have alot of family or friends, the work schedule is very cantankerous."
bad,"The only enjoyable part of the work day was break. I'm not at all a lazy person, however being pushed night after night to keep up with the companies ""rate"" system then watch so many good workers lose their jobs because they are trying to do their job accurately, and as quick as they can, but not to autozones standards....its a little bit much. There are no advancements. Any position change you make you keep the same rate of pay, and after two years you meet the cap. Thats about $16 and change, after that you may or may not get cost of living raise (they call it something else). Autozone implements a point system. Every absence you recieve one point, leave early its a half point, get to 12 points you are fired. It doesnt really matter what the reason is, hospitalized...you get two points for your first two days missed, wife...kids...you get points for whatever you miss. They do have some medical leave, not a fun process. Unless you become an advisor (their word for supervisor) then you become salary. Everyone I worked with truly hated their job and the company. They all stay for the money. The benefits are decent. Management is a joke, what works for some doesn't for others. They often refer to the ""handbook"" unless they see reason they choose to look the other way. I've seen people repeatedly harrassed and nothing done about it after many mentions, I've seen people fired after one outburst. eh, its a warehouse....I wouldn't recommend it for long term....short term maybe, if you really need a job and the money. And they pay every two weeks"
bad,I was originally hired for part time as I was a full time college student. This was fine until two other people quit then I was working more and more hours. I was able to balance the two ok but the home life suffered a little. Once that was worked out I was working more on the commercial side then on the walk in side this was fine until yet again I was picking up other people slack including manager's. When I asked if I could be promoted and what that would entail I was told because I was not a full time employee I could not be promoted even though I was working 50+ hours a week and going to school. But the final straw came when an assistant manager played a power trip on me singling me out I was done and already had another job lined up.
bad,Poor management and always short staffed worked long hours to make up and no flexibility on week ends when team members showed up  most were on their phones nothing would get done and truck took a week to get done because of the laziness
bad,"Work day was typically 11hrs including 1hr lunch break, high stress environment with store understaffed at all times. You will change wiper blades, batteries, head and tail lights in any weather. Raises are based on store performance so pick a good store. Pay rate is not good for how much you do, no ot pay if you're pt."
bad,They don't pay enough for all the work i do. And the management are very rude. They want you to do things that are not in your job description and if you don't they'll cut your hours
bad,"Don't work for them they ain't  fair ,they only look out for each other, they don't care about your life they give u a bad  hours,  they steal  the  raises  are 15 cents for 12 yrs."
bad,Wouldn't go back. Team work isn't an option everyone is out for themselves. Being a woman in the automotive field.is hard and is worse when your management team does not support you.
bad,"The manager is horrible and so far gone. His head is up his rear completely. To disrespect anybody whom disagrees with him. Even other managers like one we had transfer in from a different city. When she took her complaint to higher ups and HR they told her that is how he was. She ended up transferring back all due to this man. The job is fine but pay is horrible, no commission and they look to outside people for raises. So don’t get your hopes up."
bad,A 17 year employee was injured they paid short term but waited to long for long term disability so won't get paid. Vacation been gone to long will not get paid. About to loose there house willing to take any hours but they will not let him.
bad,"The utter most unprofessional managers in my assigned store. Regardless, it was rather easy. Very little pay. asking for more time was NOT an option. Will never come back here again."
bad,The managers wasnt patient enough and didnt give me time to learn the computer to make sales. They sucked at giving help the leading managers uses to joke laugh and make fun of me not being able to use the computer to make sales. Meanwhile i was a Commercial driver an shouldn't have to deal with clerk sales. The managers would leave me alone behind commercial dept just to let me do the work by myself
bad,Pay is horrible and management is questionable. The scheduling is hectic and they want you to give up your life for peanut wages. It's a good environment
bad,Had some good employees but  losing more good ones all the time. Some stores don't fill out work orders and tear up the store.Tried to get parts for new equipment and was still wanting 1 year later.
bad,"...Would be better than working at this store, I work directly with two men, one in his FIFTIES and the other in his SIXTIES!!!!! They act like children and when talked to about their disrespect by management they walk around glaring at people rather and refuse to talk to anyone that was there during the day when the conversation happened."
bad,"I do NOT recommend working for this company. I was there for nearly two years and it was nothing but stressful. If you weren’t part of managements good ol boys club, you received horrible hours, unfair pay, and discrimination. Do not work at a few of the stores in Fort Worth. O’Reillys is a better bet."
bad,"If you like overtime this is the job for you, they work you 60 hrs a week sometimes, management sucks, there’s no communication between shifts, they say safety safety safety but it’s more like push push push, your work is never enough! And if your a hardworker they take advantage of you! They need a new manager cause the overall manager is an idiot and don’t care about family at all"
bad,"The work/life balance is awful at AutoZone, to be successful the company pretty much demands your time and your soul. Your schedule is never consistent from week to week, these are the worst issues with the company."
bad,"AutoZone is always pushing you to sell extra products that customers don't want or need. And you earn no commission on extra products sold but the store manager does.  Corporate will randomly do cold calls and chew your butt out if you don't say your ""5 on the phone""  prices. You are a slave to the phone and must answer phone within 3 rings even if your stocking parts in back room. Don't ever work here this company sucks on how they treat employee s."
bad,I work for this company for 5 years. Never seen so much unprofessionalism an inconsistency in policy an procedure.The district n Which I worked was strictly a Caucasian base. People of color was always treated differently an more severe than their counterparts.Promotion given base on color not skills are experience
bad,Managers set up a mentally I'll employee (me) and I am now out of a job and most likely going to become homeless. 1 manager set me up after a shop lifter went and stole but he knew my mental health conditions as well as every single manager that works there.
bad,"I don't agree that AutoZone does not drug test. They hire all these drug addicts and expect for us to manage them. When half the store turns up missing, then loss prevention wants to come out and question the whole store. SMH. There are employees that steal and managers who cover for them. One day of training isn't long enough in my opinion to learn about the work and  dealing with customers. If you are well liked in the company  you can be the biggest slacker known to man,  you will get promoted continuously,  raises,  etc.  Nobody here wants to do their job,  instead they push work off on other people.  dealing with customers."
bad,"Management sucks, manager would see your request day off and deny it."
bad,Don’t waste your time . They have people getting out of high school managing with no experience grumpy moods an very unprofessional .  Friendly are the drivers there in and out an greet other then that “good luck “
bad,"This is definitely not a selling point. This company is going to go bankrupt. If someone in Florida comes up, they are going to say, ""I have no idea what this is."""
bad,I had worked there a little over a year moat during my senior year in highschool. I had barely anyfree time during then because i worked most nights during the week and most of the weekend. You never knew what your schedule was going to be. The benefits they offer will rob you of your paycheck. The pay wasnt good
bad,"Autozone is not a good place to work at, the life and balance is horrible, if you say you can’t make it that day you need to tell them 2 weeks prior or they will count it as a no show. I applied for mornings, but ended up doing both day and night. They have something called WITTDTJR (What It Takes To Do The Job Right) and if you don’t offer the little lube packets or bulb grease, they’ll get really upset. They even threatened to fire people if they don’t sell enough of those items and they keep track. For 10-11 bucks an hour, it’s not worth it. You’re better off working someplace where they respect you"
bad,"Autozone 640 in New Castle Indiana was a joke under the management it had. The clients were ignorant and had no business working on cars. They wouldn't listen to anyone and trashed parts, only to return them and receive the same part or money back. Most were meth heads and hillbillies. This brings us to the manager who passed me up for promotion only to give it to a know thief who was later fired for stealing. I wish I could get that part of my life back. It was not enjoyable."
bad,Had to unload truck as everyone else in the store was sitting and talking in the office and i maybe got 1 or 2 hours of help.  the smoke brakes were nice but if you werent on the popular list you always got the short end of the stick.
bad,"Selling useless items to people who don’t want them. Most customers know exactly what they want but we have to try to sell them what they don’t need  and a lot of the time they don’t like that. Other times your just selling people things that they don’t know they don’t need. Plus the monthly specials are a huge thing and will get you penalized for not trying to sell them. Now the pay is atrocious. During my almost year of working, the minimum wage increased in FL so my pay which used to be over minimum, barely, is now at minimum."
bad,"3-5 diff managers telling an employee 3-5 different things. They treat employees like children and if you are not on the store managers good side during scheduling, Don't expect to get many hours. They make us sell these little packets of grease with basically everything. We can't make people buy stuff but if we don't sell it we get a write up. The great part is you get to work with people from many different backgrounds. The down side is not many of the in store managers know how to speak to fellow employees."
bad,"Charlotte upper management here is pathetic. They boldly LIE to you, to get you to accept a position. Then when you try to train for the position you agreed to, they switch gears on you and claim ""there is no documentation of  that conversation with them"". So you just get stuck with a sales manager position. I spoke to 3 people about the position I was interested in. But they had no record of who I spoke to???"
bad,This job sucked. Done a village people cheer 3 times a day with a pledge of allegiance to there company. if you got all your hours it would be 76 hours Biweekly. Get sent home for lack of work most of the time.Advisors (supervisor) are clueless in there roles also they are way overpaid.Get treated like your stupid. The pay starts at 14.05 sounds good at first lol
bad,"They don’t like to pay. Also, managers don’t care about employees availability and schedule them for whatever hours they want. Store manager rude and disrespectful."
bad,"You will be required to change batteries, wind shield wipers and headlights in the rain. They will demand you sell extra items with each sale. You have to put stock up,change shelving, answer phones while ringing out customers, simultaneously, while paying you under 10.00 a hour"
bad,To many cheifs and not enough Indians and they show favoritism towards certain people. The management and employees play on the phones all day and don't want to help the people that are working.
bad,"The fact that this company has been in business for over 40 years, is beyond me. Horrible company, horrible management, horrible product. Upper management doesn't care about the store level employees."
bad,"Low pay lots of hours avaible always short handed. District management not in touch with store level needs as people. Always just looking at numbers, not a people place."
bad,"Though my time at Auto Zone was limited, it was rather informative about the company culture. Many complaints from employees fell on deaf ears, however customer complaints were handled immediately."
bad,"lots of turn around employees and unstable work environment. "
bad,The dm thinks she's a god she has no self control. When they find a person for the right job they work him like a mule and makes them want to quit they undermined the employees and show no team work
bad,Quite often there are only two employees working at a time so when there is a rush it is stressful. The upper management has unrealistic goals and expectations.
bad,The store management was the only thing that made my time worth even being there. I had two store managers that were great and the employees we had were good to work with but the upper level of management was intolerable.
bad,If you like living at your work place this is the job for you!  Mandatory overtime and ridiculous quotas keep you sweating  write ups but hey if the insane demands don't kill you the lack of air flow in that massive warehouse definitely will.
bad,"I gathered information from customer about concerns I maintained expert customer service and offer friendly advice Performed register reconciliations, receive stock, make deposits, order change i also print and hang signs, along with warranty look ups and corrections. I keep the employee customer relationships positive and productive. I also order and receive parts and merchandise from the hub stores and sister stores in addition to private vendors"
bad,Ten hours on your feet with no break . Absolutely no work /life balance which makes it a bad career  . Hard to keep employees to stay with the company pays . The personal satisfaction is helping people in need .
bad,"It is a good starter job for minimal pay and low hours. Managers cut your hours right quick bout 30 minutes to an hour on slow days. Overly sensitive manager who like to nitpick everything. They influence employees to do stuff like ""front facing"", and ""overselling the customer"". District manager is perverted. Culture keeps workers with low pay and is extremely stingy. Ironically the store has no budget for security. DM Fires people randomly based on accusation."
bad,"disloyal coworkers,not dependable Work environment wasnt safe at all and most importantly the store manager was very inconsiderate of ones time and personal life"
bad,"the job is cool if you are in high school or freshman in college but other wise the pay is bad , and no hours. If you are A person who works on cars and looking for customers to come to your shop i recommend this job for you but besides that you would not like it. most of the managers walk around like they are better than everyone."
bad,"This is probably the last place I would ever want to work. Constant harassment from management, threats of job loss, extremely disgusting environment."
bad,"As said in a previous review Auto Zone used to be a good company. This store was a nightmare, very poor management from DM and store manager along with longtime shift manager, very high staff turnover, very disorganized,always understaffed, customer base expected you to practically rebuild their car for them, and I had never experienced such an unruly and unreasonable customer base."
bad,"Pay sucks, hard to advance, very little hours only like 8-15 hrs a week, managers make the part time people do everything."
bad,In charge of pretty much everything from installing car batteries to balancing the safe. It is a stable job and that is about that. The phrase around here is everyone replaceable. As a PSM you are responsible for everything in the store. I Enjoy working here to help people out of the goodness of my heart.
bad,"During my first interview, one of the first things I was told was ""We're not the good old boys here"". But what I REALLY heard here was, ""We ARE the good old boys, and if you're not from the south ya ain't goin' far in this company!"". I read a sign that alleged they welcomed diversity, yet the DC Manager did not want to hire any non-english speakers (where else did he plan on getting hard workers from?). I LOVE how you have to wear a uniform, I-I mean dress code... IN A WAREHOUSE!!! And to make matters worse, the colors change depending on whether you're wearing a hoodie or a cap... Really? You're told you have to work mandatory overtime, but hey, once we do a cheer, all your problems will magically disappear!!! At one point supervisors were given a quota for writing people up for safety, this after sups were told to simply do a coaching."
bad,"Depending on which location you land in, there are always personal agendas at play. The store managers are always out to hire the pretty girls that they think will blindly bring in the male clientele, regardless of parts knowledge and will immediately turn down a perfectly qualified employee for a female that is more attractive. The company will attempt to pay you as little as possible, even if you are ASE certified. Everyone has ""outside responsibilities"" that will leave you with the leftover shifts, whether you are management, or an employee, you are going to be underpaid. As one of the higher paid members of management at my location, I still only make enough for a car payment - not insurance, not rent, not even enough to eat between paychecks. "
bad,everyone out for them selves management dont care about wrongful write ups and warnings.
bad,"A typical work day would involve interacting with customers who where so disrespectful and rude, I learned that patience is the key to improving your self in life and not to get upset at another persons attitude. Management shows favoritism to the newer employees. There was nothing hard about the job for me because I learned how to make a bad attitude into a great day for a customer."
bad,definitely worse place to work between bad manager and lazy employees its nothing but a stressful environment
bad,Poor management. Not much space to move around in the company if any. Employees really need to be treated better. By far every other job i have ever worked at has been far better than Autozone. Currently employed at advance.
bad,"lazy Co-Woker."
bad,"This has been one of the worst places I have worked at. The management is horrible, they treat their employees terribly, they are not understanding about life situations (family emergencies, sick kid, etc.), not to mention how badly you are treated on a daily basis. The store manger takes it upon herself to constantly tell you to where the door is if you aren't happy, when in most situations the person is only asking for time off. I am sure other AutoZone's are better but I do NOT recommend Utica, NY."
bad,does not pay well and most employees are part time. Sometimes not enough hours.
bad,"This retail company outside of Miami seems to be great so I have heard but in Miami, FL. if your not a Hispanic suck up you wont get acknowledged. You can put in all the hard work and push all the extra sales and you wont get any reward... no bonus. zero incentive. low wages and false promises is what they have to offer. Learning to deceive the consumer into buying more is what you'll learn working here. micro managing is what this work place is all about. The opportunity for growth is seldom you either have to be a sexy lady or be related to someone in management. They offer zero training towards a management position they demand you train your self and preferably off the clock too they offer no paid training what's so ever. They have no over the counter stools you will be standing and walking non-stop your whole shift so by the end of the day your feet will be thrombin in pain I guarantee you this. The customers in Miami are a pain in the butt. You must have patients dealing with rude and ignorant for this job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the 1 hour unpaid lunch break where your able to get away from all this BS. But I guess that's how most retailers are in Miami, FL nowadays."
bad,If you want your job held over your head and an advisor with mental heath issues who takes all of his anger out on employees then it’s the place for you. 2nd shift is terrible and has absolutely no work/life balance. You find out your working overtime on your last day as you walk out the door so don’t plan anything for your day off. Wouldn’t  work here again if they paid me $100 dollars anhour.
bad,I would not advise anyone to work for this company at all!! There unfair and don’t pay enough for what is asked of them . I tried to file for flma and wasn’t even given the correct information!!!
bad,"I hired on to this very low paying job for the opportunity to stay busy, BUT the complete lack of reward for a job well done obscures all other good qualities of employment with AutoZone."
bad,I can only speak for the one I worked at in Zanesville Ohio. Which I did for nearly 2 years. It was kind of like being in a abusive relationship. The one keeps telling you how important you are to them. And how much they care for you. While your covering black eyes. The management is layered to insulate AutoZone legally. I found the office to be curupt dishonest and hateful. If the HR  lady doesn't worship the devil...she knows him.
bad,"This company refuses to pay employees what they're worth. They will send employees home if their undershirt is not white but won't fire an employee going home in a work vehicle on work hours even after being reported to the store manager and HR, was deemed ""not important"""
bad,"They will promise you a manger position if you just stick with it and not keep thier word along with a quarter raise yet everyone else got 78 cents the prior year, cannot wait to be done and over with this joke of a ""career"""
bad,There’s no job security and too much management always trying to find ways to get you in trouble. so if their bored their gonna bother you no matter what. So if your looking for a job don’t come here unless your trying to get fired for the dumbest rules. If they mess up they blame everything on you they don’t take any responsibility for anything.
bad,"This was the second time I worked for Autozone.  When I was previously employed with the company in the late 90's I would praise to everyone I knew about what a wonderful company it was to work for...at the time. The company truly cared and looked out for the well being and happiness of their employees both professionally and personally.  I left the company due to an overseas relocation but returned to them when i came back to the states...what a difference.  I immediately noticed that the people being hired were not at all qualified to do the job they were hired for, but they also did not receive the training and support needed to bring them up to those standards.  Employees get treated as not much more than a body to be used as needed with no regards to whether or not they could actually fill the position they are being tasked with but being held fully accountable for their inevitable failure.  Autozone has gone from one of the best companies to work for to an absolutely dreadful place to work, and consequently a horrible place to shop since you end up with a staff that is absolutely clueless as to what the customer needs or how to help them get it.  Ive got to call them like i see them......"
bad,"Initially, the job seemed right up my alley and really exciting. Training was not difficult as I had previous experience. The issues began when I began my path to upper management. I was at the busiest store in the district and I had three Store Managers over the course of a year. The District Manager went out of his way to promise he would come and help solve any problems. He never answered the phone, left when the store was swamped without saying a word, and never actually did what he said he would do. He somehow managed to get rewarded with a promotion despite his high complaint status within the company."
bad,"I loved working with the people I worked with at Autozone.  I loved my manager dearly, he really tried to take care of his people.   I loved the clients, I loved the job itself, and the hours really weren't that bad, even when I had 10+ hour days.    They expect WAY too much work for WAY underpaying people though.   Here, in CO, I've seen many fast food places that pay $15 an hour to new hires.   Autozone underpays their workers BADLY.   Their competition underpays their employees as well.  I would LOVE to work for Autozone again IF I was paid enough.   I worked my butt off and lost SO MUCH TIME with my family that I can't get back.. all for next to nothing.   In other states, that may be a good income, but here, it's really not.   I would've been better off going pretty much anywhere else but enjoyed my work, my coworkers, and my clients too much to leave.   The connections you make at this job can be helpful."
bad,If you are looking for a place that treats employees poorly than by all means work for them.  All the managers worry about is pieces and production.   Manager treat employees like work horses.
bad,"I was hired as a part time shift leader, even know I needed full time to support my family, they didn't care, to get my 40 hours i would have to call other stores myself to get hours, and drive all over to different stores. I worked my home maybe once a week the rest of the time i was driving all over to other stores, which didn't fit my schooling schedule."
bad,could not get promotion was accused of misconduct several times with no resoluition they where just dirtying my promotion file. cannot believe i waisted 3 years .
bad,I started as manager and i did everything myself no one was willing to work the training is long and terrible. I was scheduled every truck day. And the only one who would close. You only get two holidays off a year. Everyone takes advantage of hard workers and the company never promotes from within and since they are a fortune 300 company only care about customers money
bad,"Day Dragged for clocking in to clocking out, phone always rings and people don't pick up, were always left in the front while the rest hid in the back."
bad,The worst place I've ever worked at. I was the store manger. Unorganized upper management. District and region. He was a joke. No training for store ma
bad,"Very low pay for my many years experience, no drug test know of several who could not pass a random test,  DIY business is big with them and they let the DIY's rip them off return parts with no receipt, not proffesional in any phase"
bad,"Typical day  be absolutely miserable the whole 8 hrs you were "
bad,"My license was suspended because the manager turned in the wrong vehicle information, and some of the managers there are very judgemental, racist and not supportive."
bad,There is no communication with higher ups and store employees. They do not know what going on or maybe they don't care. It took me 2 years for them to fix my pay
bad,"Very productive environment that help you strengthen your mind and body.  Good people to work around, helpful and available at anytime. Was only a temporary but was treated like I was an AutoZoner!"
bad,all parts sales manager duties. running commercial sales when the commercial manager was unavailable. Keeping a positive and safe environment withing the staff.
bad,"MAYBE OK FOR TEENAGERS not a good place because of bad management but i heard they've dealt with the person since i left"
bad,Always busy. Managers always in the back instead of helping. Learned a lot about cars though. Getting help is hardest part and most enjoyable is clocking out. Make it a full time not worth the pay. A lot of favoritism is going on always. Its great for part timers and people that go to school. I would not recommend this place for a full timer to just get paid literally pocket change more.
bad,Was a shipper for 15 years  on weekend shift  the managers show a lot of favoritism to certain ones some of the bosses try to tell you how to do your job but they don’t even know how to
bad,"la empresa y sus politicas son muy buenas pero desde que hubo cambios en la presidencia de la empresa todo va mal,me duele decir que estabamos mejor con presidentes y directores gringos que con los mexicanos que estan acargo ,antes se valoraba el esfuerzo de cada zoner ahora solo con ser amigo del mas influyente subes de puesto,que pena que la cultura de auto zone no se lleve acabo en las tiendas"
bad,"firsts months was good, then a big cut in hours an bad "
bad,"Job was extremely stressful as a grey shirt in a small store. Was forced to cover for people who would constantly call out sick. It would be good Overtime, but unfortunately constantly having unreliable people call out would interfere with personal plans. The pay was decent at about 13/hr but at times even that felt like not enough for all we had to handle. Store manager was a nice guy but lacked the spine to tell upper management we needed more people. This resulted in him getting long hours and having to constantly cover people as well. Things wouldnt get done in time and it seemed as if the whole store depended solely on the two of us. Doing all this while juggling customers, who sometimes could be the worst type of customers, was not ideal to me so I left for a better opportunity elsewhere. Overall, did not enjoy working here. Glad it was only temporary. Wouldn't even advise teens to work there based on my experience."
bad,Wasted 4 years of my life to be told they would no longer work around my family responsibilities. They tell you one thing and the poor management then suddenly changes their mind. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.
bad,"Cutthroat company that eats it's own. High turnover. Highers Managers from outside. No upward potential. Few hours, no benefits for parttimers. Overall if you're looking for a career it's not here.Management can't approve a schedule, DM is virtually non-existence. Never met the RM. No desire to grow the commercial business."
bad,The general feeling of helping customers with their Automotive needs answers and parts advice where the best parts of this job delivering parts helping commercial cashiering where some of my duties and responsibilities also restocking inventory
bad,"Shipping and receiving, packing & organizing * Merchandising, floor displays, stocking, shelving * Attention to detail, accuracy and structure *  Complete tasks well under the pressure of deadlines * assist and greet every customer."
bad,I use to love working in the automotive industry but no longer do I feel that way after working here. So much more into their own gain as a company than the employees working for them.
bad,I loved my Job but the company is very unprofessional.I worked here for eight years and still didnt get promoted to the next level.I would recommend this job to a student.l
bad,The people you work closely with are good people. Corporate regularly finds new and inventive ways to abuse their employees. Creates bad morale and hostile work environment.
bad,They don't care about their employees at all. Big corporation so I feels like you are a number. I'm not sure that is company wide just the Kansas City region. They want you to work 80-90 as a store manager and now its all about WITTIDJR. The extra stuff you don't need they require you to sell or you will end up losing your job.
bad,Does not stand for customer service. Computer prgrams are difficult. Lies are forced to customers. Way too much drama in a work place. To many unqualified employees due to just hiring because it's a friend and were promoting due to acknowledge of friend.
bad,"Constant harassment from upper management to up sell tiny packets of lubricants, that most mechanics already have. Not selling these little packets was grounds for being written up, and after 3 write ups you could be terminated."
bad,Autozone had low pay but my biggest issue was the cleanliness of the stores there would be oil spills on the floor so there were times i would slip the shelves in the back where badly dented and only being held up by other shelves so a whole wall full of car parts could fall on you at any time.
bad,Would not recommend this compant to anyone looking for a job. Managers would be quick to write a person up for not pushing products on customers.
bad,"Do not stop moving, do not make mistakes, every answer should begin or end with sir/ ma'am. Do not be late or call in unless you're in the hospital dying. Worst company to work for ever."
bad,"I would not recommend working for Auto Zone.  Its a good place to wok if you need a job, but I wouldn't make a career out of it.  Management will write you up if you don't meet their required sales, regardless of anything.  Your hours are based solely on sales, despite being an hourly employee.  Benefits are worthless, and they give insulting raises."
bad,to operator a forklift and pick and pack and to work with people
bad,"You have to be a YES MAN to get anywhere. If someone doesnt like you, you wont get anywhere, you have to kiss some major butt to suceed."
bad,Customer service to the max. Need to be a people person to do good. I learned a lot about cars because of their OS you use to help customers. Bad Management. Played Favorites with employees and a serious lack of professionalism through out my whole experience while i was employed. Bad co-workers. Hardest part dealing with bad customers. Best part was learning about cars.
bad,"I did my job well, but needed a bit of guidance at first. Unfortunately the managers at this company are not trained to guide. Upper management struggles to stay up to date with it's employees and can terminates for whatever reason they want so long as it doesn't make their days any more difficult."
bad,Great concept. Very hard to find people to work. Upper manager Dm and rm do not help at all.. No support your on your own.. They back stab you any way they can..
bad,I was responsible for closing then opening the store. The company doesn't support it's worker's nor does the management team they assign. All in all horrible company to work for
bad,"Love the atmosphere around the company, however the management is a mess and no sense of direction within the company, customers are put last on the list."
bad,No raise just a few cents .feels like a job for a high school kid.I couldn't manage my scedule it was hard to get time around family events.  I worked hard and the people who didnt work got the same treatment.bull.
bad,"Nunca hay coordinacion en nada, los gerentes buenos los explotan en este caso yo era uno , puedes ser el peor empleado y no te botaran . Peor experiencia de trabajo en toda mi vida , posiciones establecidas se las dan a familiares o amistades pasando por encima a alguien calificado, paga completamente por debajo de cualquier empresa , 100% prioridad tu no . Horarios sin menos de 5 horas de descanso entre dia . Explotan al empleado y le exigen mucho mas de lo q es necesario, etc,etc,etc... si no estas pendiente a Pay Roll no te pagan las vacaciones o no acumulas nada , ni enfermedad aun trabajando tus 40 horas semanales"
bad,"I loved my job at Auto Zone, I hated the fact you were treated like your replaceable, it's a great place to get your foot in the door to the Auto industry"
bad,I actually lived my job the first couple months until i found i was pregnant while i was trading to be promoted. They then denied me the position to be promoted and also refused to make me full time because of the benfits. I was working 50 plus hours every single week. I then properly put my 2 weeks notice in
bad,"Open store, print out all reports, audit registers, assign duties, conference calls, meet sales quota, hardest part of the jobs was to keep staff focused and teamwork. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
bad,They will work you to the bone. You will have no life if you make it into management. Dedicate your life to the corporation or they will replace you. Poor training. Most often you will be thrown into a role.
bad,The company seems to promote the least deserving making work harder and more uncomfortable for those who work the hardest. Favoritism definitely applies here. There is no incentives for anything. They demand you upsell customers on scammy things like bulb grease while threatening punishment if you dont sell enough of it. You are also to completely be a victim to thieves and criminals. Company policy prevents you from doing anything to protect yourself and the company cares so little about you that they will do nothing to protect you.
bad,Most of the managers where really good at their jobs and would help you to grow as an employee. Others would question why you are asking for time off months in advance. 90% of the regular employees know what they are doing. But the other 10%should never have been working there. It's a good place to work at if you are in between jobs. The pay was horrible for the amount of work you have to do. And you're expected to come in on your days off
bad,"Great place to get started if you need a part time gig. Helped me out alot with car knowledge. Enjoyed majority of the customers. The pay was god awful and raises were a joke. Schedule sucked due to the store manager. The crew was good outside of the store manager and one brown noser there. The store manager is lazy, manipulative, selfish, cynical, cunning, arrogant, pompus, shiftless, and a procrastinator. If you wanted a day off, you had to fight him for it. Autozone is a good company to work for depending on your store and district manager you work for, but depending on the situation you get yourself into, it could be good or bad."
bad,"Worked for the company 3 1/2 years, 6 store managers came and went. I finally got full time after 3 years and couldn’t ever get a opportunity for growth having to prove myself over and over. I was over commercial sales and feel the proof was in the sales and the numbers. This company doesn’t notice what you do."
bad,"They hire you on to work 4 day weeks. 12 point system, to earn half a point back you have to endure 3 months of perfect addendance. Leaving anytime after lunch is 1/2 point. Leaving at the end of your scheduled day, but before they call it, is still 1/2 point. Indefinite mandatory OT rotating between every day of the weekend. (Can work up to 6 days) 45 minute lunch, 15 minute break. Our facility struggles as the company jumped started the facility to hit capacity sooner than any other. Some shifts hit up to 11/12 hours when needed. 15 minute notice if the shift will be extended past scheduled release. Cannot plan weekends ahead, hope you don’t have to pick your children up from school either. Unprofessional environment, no consideration for the employees by upper management. All day physical exhaustion. Vacation days available after 1 year(40 hours every six months), 3 paid days off a year. Benefits after 90 days. Overall my experience has be unpleasant with this company. No consideration for our work availability and home life responsibilities."
bad,Not worth your time better suited for a kid in or fresh out of high school the pay sucks no benefits  definitely not for a parent or a single adults with their own home
bad,"Large Machinary moving quieckly past you, alot of young people ho have no clue of the dangers of those equipment. There no room to growth and they favord man over women."
bad,"Wasn't a real fan of the store i was assigned to, company as a whole was great. Employee's lacked basic knowledge, weren't trained properly. Everybody for themselves. CAN NOT SPEAK FOR ALL AUTOZONE STORES, only mine."
bad,"Autozone has a structure, your either 100% AutoZone or your out. No family time or days off that you can count on, Autozone is always first before family."
bad,The store manager was fired for misconduct during my employment. No one knows how to operate a business at Auto Zone. The replacement for the fired manager would demean the lower level managers (me) in front of the workers that I was to manage when he left. The whole system was a cob job.
bad,"they are understaffed, underpaid for what you do i worked at the hub location so thats the busiest one you have to work for all the other auto zones."
bad,"Company is more concerned about loss prevention than it is about employee compensation.  Employees get paid very poorly and annual raises average around $0.05"
bad,I some what enjoyed it for the reason that I learned a litle more than what I knew from cars and how to not to try things ur not familiar with .Alot of socializing and dirty at times the cool thing was my assistant manager he gave us gifts if we reach store goals at the end it didnt matter
bad,Regular super market with no advances. Or good pay often pay minimum low wage.
bad,"After 12 yr employment, I can say autozone created an atmoshere of unwarrented uneasy and stressfull atmosphere. I however worked at th D.C. it may be different at store level."
bad,"corporate hr benefits is the worst department ever! Very loud,immature and unprofessional. Management is allowed to insult,bully and micro managed. If you file a complaint nothing will be done on your behalf! Your work is not valued and leadership only supports management decision without thorough investigation. The worst job experience I ever had. I will never recommend this"
bad,Hr and dm dont follow up the people in Tennessee (VP)and staff are great the Louisville regional team dont care about their employees (lp)in Louisville is a great guy he should be rm
bad,"Nothing good to say about all but one of the Staff managers! The work team work well together, just to have senior staff look for ways to undercut them. Overtime for some but not for others."
bad,"The management at Auto Zone could be improved, with that being said don't expect to move up very fast no matter how well you perform. The company will have you drive all around your area just to obtain the full time requested."
bad,"If you like to be micromanaged, and always short staffed and dealing with young staff that would rather be on there phones than work. Auto zone is for you."
bad,"the place is unorganized, first day they threw me in diy selling with absolutely no training! I applied for commercial driving! No computer training, item location, etc. not knowing where parts are can be overwhelming and very time consuming, especially you start getting angry customers bc it takes too long of a time to locate parts, They need a better system in place, parts can be easier to find. ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."" By Warren buffet. This quote implies to the customers. Customers are number one.  Many improvements can be made but I am not getting paid for my opinion."
bad,This interview wss informative. Then after working there. Th ed y sometimes have only 2 in the store. Then comes the customers. Then the phone ringing off the hook. They need mor ed bbn people there at times during the day.  Then they want you to deliver parts about 5 mins before you are done for the day. Also you have to finish customer befor going home. Also want you to work opening and closing hrs. Even thought you were hired in as a deliver ugh person.
bad,"If you work here and have a family, you will not get to spend time with them. Constantly working mandatory 20hr overtime shifts. Managment sucks as well."
bad,For a starter job interested in the automotive field it can work out for someone who isnt interested in expanding outside into a repair or full time automotive technical field.
bad,Its way to much goin on your under staff at night u will get basic online training but not really the training you need its best to have mechanic experience
bad,"My objective is to get a position where I can be challenge and be able to use my Bilingual communications skills, leadership abilities and management skills. These skills can be used to contribute to the employer and the companies summery of qualifications. In the following are explained in full detail: "
bad,"I worked for AutoZone for a year and a half. I am female. Aside from the harassment which I've come to expect working any position that deals with the general public, it was only a good place to work when we were in trouble. During the time that I worked their my store manager was fired for stealing. For about a six month period we had no manager. During that time rules were followed and everyone was mutually respected. A store manager was transferred to my store and he continued to disrespect and steal from the company with no repricussions."
bad,Hard to hit 75% production. Advisor never worked in this enviroment so he can't  train you and ither lady rather load trucks and other stuff than help.
bad,"very stressful too many overtime mandatory hours, job was risky lots of people getting hurt, either because they were not being safe or becuase the job is too tough picking rotors all day. The production RATE is too high 75% per day insane."
bad,"You basically work to make someone else rich at whatever cost."
bad,This is a very stressful place to work. It has oor management and workers. Very rude to customer and co employres.. thereis really nothing else to say but I was hulimayed every time I had to ask a question where something was because I was new and did not know where it was manager was very rude me..
bad,Autozone at my store at least has horrible hours 6am-12am a lot of the time overworking employees with less than 8 hours off on average and a terrible district manager who refuses to help in almost every sitiuation unless he benefits. Everyone i work with are hard workers and easy to get along with just upper managments refusal to hire new people and piling to much work on current employees with less than competitive pay.
bad,Upper management is very belittling. No recognition for achievement. Hard to advance. Pay increases are very small (less than $0.25) and once per year
bad,"Meet a lot of very nice customers and learned how to deal with high stress environments. "
bad,Horrible work ethic no one did there work on time I had to go behind cleaning up  others messes. No one has a good work ethics. The manager is a liar.
bad,"You are nothing but a number working for autozone. There is benefits for commercial sales bonus but they are near unattainable. The DIY sales has no bonus programs for anything less than store manager, yet daily you are pushed to meet goals. Over all I enjoyed my manager, and fellow employees but disagree with most all things Autozone. There is a reason no one stays."
bad,"semi - nice company to work for. nice low stress situations, wages were low to turn into a career. managers not willing to stay or stand up for employees. Commercial clients were extremely rude at times."
bad,It is a pay check i got to work help people and go home and hope my check pays for the bills for the next two week
bad,delivered autoparts to other stores. I learned good custumer servics and my way around town
bad,"The company is more interested in gimmicks and making money than it's own employees. There is very minimal training, and there is a large discount between the management and the average employee."
bad,It's a good place to work if you don't want to work 40 hrs a week. Make about 1250 a month. Was promised full time and to move up instead a newer employee got promoted.
bad,"I was hired as a fast track to be trained manager for a location that they had not even purchased property or leased building and after almost a year, the same was true  Managers arena ysittersfor the store and the staff  They will try and accommodate your time working if possible, but there are no chairs in the store for employees to sit even in the break area  "
bad,Working at Autozone has been a incredible ride as well as a rocky ride. Working at autozone is very incredible because you can help problem solve with your customers as well as creating a trust bond. It is a rocky ride as well because you don't always have the support from your employees as well as management team.
bad,"The store Manager and some employees were the only reasons. That I worked at AZ for almost 3 years. I saw great customers come in and some of then rude and high on pot. That the smell will make you sick."
bad,This place is not awesome but not horrible. Only bad thing is that they wanted them first before your own family and ummm nope. My family comes first. The pay is horrible and the raise ain't great. Overall it was a job and don't let how I feel not try to get a job here. All I can say you try then judge. Good luck
bad,"Alright place to work if you dont mind upper management being a pain, plenty of room for growth and amazing benefits, spent 6 years there before switching to a competitor"
bad,"All they care about is making money for their stock holders,  at the expense of everyone of their employees. "
bad,New store no one knew about it so I left to pursue better opportunities elsewhere. It just wasn’t a good fit for me personally but I don’t have anything bad to say about the company
bad,"I had a great experience with my immediate manager, but upper management let me go because of ""bad paperwork"" Was not really told why, I guess that what I get for working though an agency."
bad,Es 1 empresa que se dedica a la venta de refacciones y accesorios pero no paga lo que en el ramo esta acostumbrada la verdadera gente especializada psra ellos no hay promociobes y si para los abarroteros que no saben nada de refacciones automotrices.
bad,"Good benefits "
bad,"poor management , rude workers with few customer service skills , they dont give the right parts or advice making it harder for the people that actually know what their doing and giving advice on"
bad,Not a bad place to work if you don't mind customers treating you like dirt. Some customers are nice but there are enough bad ones to make you want to work else ward.
bad,"this job is quite literally a dead end job, absolutely no advancement, even if you have gone through all the paperwork and hoops that are in place. pay keeps going down and only goes up when minimum wage gets increased. insane customer base that is brutal if you don't know absolutely everything about all the cars in the work from 1940 to brand new. Horrible reliability of hardware and software. Best of all, the places are normally surrounded by drugs and addicts of all kinds."
bad,"to slow on many day, tired of always putting the truck, never enough help to go around, very stressful, almost every costumer coming in is either angry or confused"
bad,The employee does not seem to have a voice. They are always overlooking the needs of anyone who is not managment. It's a belief that everyone can be replaced. So you get stepped on.
bad,"I started as a sales clerk and worked my way up to a supervisor position.Manager was great,co-workers had many issues.It was a fast paced job with a lot to do each day."
bad,No opportunities for advancement through the company. No health benefits offered. Poor pay. Manager was horrible and sexist. Left for a better career. Manager ended up being demoted and removed from the store.
bad,"Teamwork is mandatory part of being a team.  That includes management cooperation.  There are many aspects out of control of the sales technicians part, like operation of the system and change for the drawer."
bad,Need to be more interactive with employees. Offer you awards never receive them. Need to listen and understand that we are dealing with different customer base and competition should be judged differently.
bad,"Okay job, Lots of enjoyment, Every company has there ups, and downs. Erratic Scheduling, Not enough coverage, Mis-communications. Benefits are bland."
bad,hours are long and you do work hard but you get the satisfaction of helping people cause a car is what makes you money to survive.
bad,I worked for the company for almost 3yrs loved this job as a part time job.  I always put 100 percent in. Also the company has some policy that are wrong also wrongful termination.
bad,"If you still want to be consequenced for taking off for something that is out of your control, then be my guest, work for the company. If this will bother you, then steer well clear because they really dont care about the employee personal life, all they care about is keeping the store open."
bad,"Auto zone, is the type of job you would want only if its temporary. I dont recommend any one to work for this company long term. Everything takes too much time, and the money doesn't match. They want you to dedicated many many hours just to become merely a manager, and get payed between $11-$12hr maybe even $13hr if you are lucky enough depending on the store you work for.. To see anywhere near $15hr you would need to have at least 2-3 years of experience, and get lucky enough to be promoted to the position that would pay that amount. Where as if you have a degree of sorts, you can easily find a job starting at that price."
bad,I have a bad review about auto zone. They only use me in their convenience. Very inconsistent hours every week. Dont get along w the manager for personal reasons.
bad,"garbage company to work for, and management favorite employees based on friendship and that's how you advance in the company, or by doing the manager personal favors, otherwise you will never advance in the company."
bad,Autozone is a good place to work. Hours are flexible. They are understanding of schedules. The manager however picks and chooses his favorite employees. He sorta doesn’t care to much about some employees. Most positions are extremely awesome especially the driving positions. The front is considered DIY which is customer service.
bad,Poor treatment of workers they underlay people over work then don't train there workers up properly there a terrible company and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
bad,"Quieren que vendas , los Miles cuando hay días que no entra más que 20 a 30 clientes"
bad,AutoZone es una empresa en la cual no  se toma en cuenta el que hagas bien tu trabajo y rápido los ascensos están condicionados a como te lleves con el gerente si te llevas bien con él y te vas de borrachera con el es más probable que te tome en cuenta para un ascenso y lo dicen textualmente que no importa que trabajes rápido y bien y todo es avalado por el distrital
bad,"Poor Management and Judgment on Others. "
bad,The way this company is thwy say that thwy will not promote within unless you are friends with the higher management. They alao think education is not necessarily.
bad,If something didn’t go someone’s way stuff would get thrown and the commercial manager would yell at people in front of customers and I felt it was not very professional and also they cut hours without notice
bad,Loved my job but there was a D.M. who was nasty and very rude to employees.  I could not grasp the way he treated employees who are the face of the company.  Worst person I ever worked for
bad,When I first started we had a strict but very nice Dm but after we switched DMs it went down hill. Current dm does not know what she is doing and is very unreasonable. She wants a store that is understaffed and without a store manager to not have anyone go over overtime let alone scheduled hours in the store.
bad,"Hours change weekly, no real guidance, poor management, often left alone with no back-up or help. Required to answer the phones even if you're actively helping a customer. Training program lacks and they focus on a company cheer instead of actually doing the job. Current manager, plays favorites and gives more hours to his friends instead of established employees.  All in all, I'd avoid it unless you're a driver."
bad,There’s nothing really interesting to say about this job! They have great stores and some stores that are not so good. Some store managers suck at there job would be an overall great company if management wasn’t poor.
bad,"One of the worst companies to work for. They doesn’t care about it’s employees unless you know a district manager and are part of his “family” or friend then you move up, not the hard working who keep stores going. And the store and district managers are always getting busted for sleeping with their employees."
bad,"Company had no care about what is going on with employees, or how they are, Don't give the help or equipment needed to do job(s) correctly and timely. Only care about making money for higher up in company"
bad,"just a temporary and close home job while collecting social security benefit.it was a very stressful job everyday physically emotionally to deal with coworkers,managers,corporate and customers"
bad,Autozone was a great place to learn and make a little money as well. The people were nice and the job is easy mostly. Ran into trouble when my original manger quit and his replacement began stealing. I was fired because they thought it was me stealing but could not prove it. The new manger was fired 6 months later due to theft and poor management.
bad,"I would walk in, nothing was taken care of from the previous shift, no one took responsibility for their actions. Company put customer satisfaction before employee happiness which makes it difficult to run a functional, customer happy store. Managers were condescending and rude, it was difficult to communicate issues in the store to management and if it wasn't important to them then it didn't go any higher than that. The employees do not get paid enough and they are pushed too hard with only 1 to 3 people in the store at all times even during rush hours."
bad,"auto zone is a job, i went to auto-school"
bad,i dont want to write a review indeed just makes you write one to submit on to your resume kinda dumb really lame dont know what else to say about it it stupid
bad,"I would have enjoyed working there if there wasn't a manager constantly badgering you to sell customers things they don't need. The emphasis of this company is that the customer is ALWAYS RIGHT, which is not always the case."
bad,"People are very rude, manager incompetent and difficult to work under, employees were not trustworthy and were also incompetent and difficult to work with."
bad,"Great job, terrible company to work for. No chance for improvement. Managers have their own agenda. Treat employees like they don't matter. Complaints go unanswered."
bad,"I worked at Autozone for & months, ad after I was hurt on the job they treated me awful and lied to me. The working conditions are awful and management does not communicate well at all."
bad,If they don't need you anymore they will dump you with no warnings. I learned costumer service skills. The hardest part of a commercial job at Autozone is you have to be available when ever they need you. Traveling is the most  enjoyable part of being a CD at Autozone.
bad,"This is a very large corporation with thousands of employees. While the company culture claims to promote teamwork through ""coaching,"" in reality a new employee is ""thrown to the wolves"" after sitting through 4 hours of video training and 4 hours on the floor with customers. "
bad,Shows favoritism and if you are a female it is hard to move up. says will work with you but will not.  3 years and still part time with the knowledge of everything in the store the manager does.
bad,I had a nice time working with all the people at auto mzone I would go bak there If I had the chance to...they work with you at times
bad,"my day started off very early with stores sending credit applications"
bad,"Got to delivery drive automotive parts to various shops around town, the customers were great people to deal with. Liked being out on the road and to assist commercial account holders."
bad,"Terrible place to work. bad people, terrible responsiblities and very angry customers. the employees dont know what their doing and it causes a great deal of problems. nothing enjoyable at this job"
bad,"Bad hours, poor pay, killing the auto parts industry but flooding the markets with poorly trained people and driving down wages"
bad,"typical day at work. long hard hours."
bad,Only one or two employees actually knew about cars or other important required information. Most of the other employees were not trained and knew nothing. They continuously irritated customers and cost the company money on a daily bases.
bad,Not enough hours available even though i was hired as full time
bad,There is no room for advancement. I became a sales manager and there was no more room for advancement from there.
bad,"Manager, worked as a team, co-workers were great. Learned about auto parts. We changed and installed batteries, wipers,all bulbs that we were able to change for the customers. Did check engine lights and looked up the codes. We had x-mas parties.."
bad,"Not a very family friendly place to work. 50 to 60 hour work weeks, and cutting so many hours that it left only a 2 person work force every day."
bad,Employees were fun to work with but I was mistreated by customers because I'm a woman working in an auto parts store so they assume I don't know what I'm talking about.
bad,This is the worst company I have worked for. They promise you everything and deliver nothing. District managers will sacrifice you for a chance to better themselves. Instead of helping you fix a problem you didn’t have anything to do with they find a way to blame you for it. AutoZone believes that every employee will steal from them and will find a way to prove it. Save yourself the time and trouble and don’t work or do business with these “people”.
bad,I was lied to and hours cut. I would not tell anyone to try to work there.
bad,"Always pushed to be productive.  They have offices in China, Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and all over the US.  They acquired ALLDATA sometime in the 1980s."
bad,This is a good line of work if you are starting out and want the experience of customer service and retail. it will also help if you have some sort of mechanic background or have some what knowledge of auto parts and basic automobile components and functions.
bad,"Worked at AutoZone in a management position for years and towards the end was told on conference calls that ""people were expendable"" As many corporations in todays business climate, you get used then, GOD help you, your are gone. I was terminated over ""paperwork errors"""
bad,I really enjoy work with people and learning more about car problems.
bad,They don't care about you. Pay not good.co workers not friendly at all.lots of favoritism.they will try to work around your personal time.customers usually very friendly
bad,"They couldve cared less about our health, they preached safety while having us work in unsafe conditions. The things we had to do alone were unsafe and lots of people could have been hurt. They kept me on clean up for 8 months before hiring me in through the company, once I became an autozoner, I was proud of my red and black, I worked very hard and busted my butt to get production. Working 70 hours a week made it very hard to keep up and have errorless pulls. We were so tired that it was danged near impossible to get  our jobs done and all our stores pulled every night. Instead of thanking you for a good job, we were more criticized for our mistakes, promised for months that every weekend would finally be a weekend off only to get to Thursday night and find out we had to work the weekend. Morale amongst employees was very very low. They gave us a hard time about using our floaters and vacation time. Points system was very good until that included mistakes we'd make out of exhaustion. No, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone until they overhaul how they treat their people."
bad,I loved my job working there for 3 years as a Commercial manager. My attendance was very good rarely had points. I became pregnant and when I returned to work I didn't have reliable babysitters. I always followed procedures with that. But within a month I was fired and they even took me to court because they didn't want to pay for unemployment. They lost
bad,"No saben escucharte como trabajador, solo la del gerente de tienda . Y eso deja mucho que desear cómo trato al personal."
bad,"buen ambiente de trabajo, buen compañerismo, desempeñando cada quien sus funciones dentro de la empresa con tranquilidad, tuve conocimientos de varias auto partes, lo mas difícil era cuando teníamos inventarios, me gusto trabajar aquí xq llevaba una buena relación laboral con mis compañeros y jefes inmediatos y a su vez un buen trato al cliente"
bad,"I learned a lot of patience with people working here"
bad,Management all the way to the top is corrupt. They do not care about their employees only about making money. Your life can be in danger and no one will do anything about it
bad,To much stress for nothing. Upper management doesn’t care about employees that are under them. They do not want to give there employees raises. They treat employees that actually care for about company with no respect.
bad,This job had many issues. Management was not good at keeping track of scheduling. Last minute scheduling. Lack of communication. The hardest part of the job is to keep customers happy as many customers complain quite easily here.
bad,"Horrible management. "
bad,Over worked and under paid! Over worked and under paid.  I will continue to say it.  The amount of work they expect you to do and the time the expect you to be at the store does equal the pay they offer. It sucks!
bad,"It’s started well, after one month I notice that management is a jock, all they care about is how much they can sale with the less amount of employees to be very  profitable,  even if it affects employees and customers."
bad,"I was a PSM at Autozone, and was promised the position of Commercial Sales, or Commercial Sales Manager.  Needless to say, that never happened.  I started getting scheduled for 730am-7pm shifts, I was made to feel like I was lazy if I asked for a lunch break, I was told that if I sat down I would be fired, I was made to feel lazy and usually got scolded if I sat outside for a few minutes throughout the day.  If I ever asked for a weekend off the manager would look at the request and say ""hmm, must be nice."" In a snide tone.  Customers were rude and usually said demeaning comments towards the female staff and they were made to feel as if they couldn't stand up for themselves without putting their job on the line."
bad,"This place is ok at first but then they start dragging you along without ever fulfilling any of their promises, corporate non sense, I wouldn’t recommend if you’re not a teenager and you want a livable wage"
bad,"Pay is really low, with very high expectations and duties. Schedule was almost always messed up. No organization or communication. The actual store needed many repairs."
bad,Meeting and networking with different machines is the best part in working for autozone. They barely pay it’s a nice job for someone out of high school but not for anyone with kids and responsibilities
bad,"You won’t get far if you’re not Mexican, honest truth and it’s not a diverse place at all. They show favoritism to people who been there longer and if you work better they’ll intentionally try and mess up your percentage. There’s alot of racism in this place as well."
bad,Working in this retail industry the competition in and out of the company was cutthroat. A constant arguing and hurting others who worked there. The district and store manager were always at odds.
bad,"Want to leave your current job in look for a full time position? Then you're in the wrong place. You may be lucky enough to get 8 hrs a week. Don't worry, it'l be an 8 hour shift for one day that turns into 10 with no lunch or brakes."
bad,I loved the company but there way of handle upper management is a joke was having proplem a with manger when to hr an dm an got no where manger was racist disrespectful bigot who could do no wrong I’d go back if the fixed there issues
bad,Just flat out autozone sucks. They dont pqy enough to even survive...  been there over a year with no raises and no advancment oppertunity. Plust the managment wont do anything but sit on their butt
bad,"Corporate greed results in minimal staffing, which translates to a poor employee representation to the customers.  If you enjoy a fast paced job with no opportunity to complete day to day inside tasks, this job is for you."
bad,Too much rush with poor considerations to safety. Doesn’t report injuries and tried to cover them up. Not enough employees to cover the work that is needed done and poor deligation
bad,"work managers next day review, to see if any bad behavior accurred. Auto Zones main focus is Inventory management management can be micro managed most of the time, the hardest part of the job is retaining good people, the most enjoyable part of the job is competing to beat last years numbers and your staff is in full cooporation of accomplishing the goals."
bad,Not a great work environment. Management overlooks things going on that should never be allowed in a work or any environment. Want you to do more work for no more money.
bad,This place is pretty political. Unless you are a part of a clique there is little chance you will advance. The VPs are untouchable as they rarely speak.
bad,Decent Job Poor Management no benefits long hours no advancement closed every weekend and most nights  busy work fast paced great co workers some what flexible.
bad,Not the best job but a good job that doesn't layoff. Management can display favoritism. Low paying depending on demographic location. Does not provide yearly raises at certain locations.
bad,"not really good place for advancement, Demands a lot with little compensation. HR is not very helpful in resolving employee issues. And workplace atmosphere can be sexist and racist"
bad,"Job culture is big in words but not always placed. Pay isn't great, its all about who you know in this company. Computers are always crashing and if it snows out well lets just say you better be there to open the store"
bad,"part sales, management bad, low pay, stealing by employees is ok and having an employee that upsets every customer but if you have on the wrong shoes they will send you home or if you forget to put in a trash bag you get talked to as if it was a criminal investigation"
bad,pay is no good and i had to work doubles when someone doesn't show for their shift and there a no reprecutions for their actions. manager is never there and always uses me when he takes his vacations as i do work part time and do fulltime hours and not get the full benefits for the position.
bad,Inadequate training with no support from management and very low moral throughout the entire staff. Too many personal issues brought to work place.
bad,"Autozone, is one of the less than desire places to work. it is for teenagers. if there was a self service place it would be better."
bad,"I started working here not knowing anything about auto parts, and now  I am one of the most knowledgeable in my field. The best part of my job is my customers."
bad,Great experience working with customers but this corporation does not care about your life outside of work and they are not in the business of compensating you for your work and sacrifices for their company.
bad,"You may open, close have midshift or truck.You will learn how to use the system, and hopefully enough about cars to help customers efficiently choose the correct parts for there particular problem (vehicle repair knowledge is not a requirement to work here)."
bad,"When i come in the store in the mornings nothing is cleaned or front faced that is supposed to be done before the store closes. i learned that if you need help and ask you would have to call another store for help. Also management always makes the lower employees do all the work, but most of the employees try there best but at night or management dont do anything. the hardest part of the job is not getting any help from management. the most enjoyable part is at the end of the shift when you can leave witch is the worst part of working there."
bad,this job is pretty much a job you will get hired pretty fast but your pay will be low and your task is going to be high and managers higher up seems to be doing alot of underhanded things to make the lower lv work and most of the high end managers doesnt seem to do much to help the lower lv workers
bad,Its a fun place to work at if your really into vehicles. Hourly wise not to good at all
bad,"it was okay, but I got pick on by the District Manager for having a religious stuff on my wrist arm. She made a big deal out of it. I explain and showed her proof, She said if I didn't cut it off, I can not return to work. It did not cause any hazardous for the type of work I was doing."
bad,"Upon working at this job, I learned that the things that should be important for advancement and compensation, such as incoming knowledge, credentials, and display of hard work, didn't matter at this place. At this place of work, you were fit into a role and were not to leave that role despite any knowledge of operations or any hard work that you do. Even after verbal promise of advancement, you would still not move up. The pay grade was low and there isn't much to look forward to. I would only recommend this place of work to someone as a ""last resort""."
bad,"This company does not care about values, family, or there employees. No bounses, no comission for extra efforts."
bad,"Decent entry level automotive experience, the online training needs a serious facelift from the 1970’s. Other than that, it’s okay depending on the crew and management."
bad,Autozone needs some extreme employee structure overhaul.  These stores are small and really easy to navigate. There should never be a day when the(s) line is backed up to and/or through an idle. Pay more money to your grey and red shirts and your company will blow any other brick and mortar auto parts store in the nation.
bad,"They will hire anyone, I had one person steal half the store and light the dumpsters on fire mitple times, I wrote up an employee and when I left that night my lugnuts were missing, GM and district managers will curse at you and belttle you if you do not SELL SELL SELL, management is garbage,upper management was just as poor."
bad,AutoZone has the potential to be a great company. But the severe lack of leadership is what’s tanking most of the Cleveland region. There are no clear rules on what is right and wrong and it’s only made clear when you do something wrong and the district manager comes in and threatens your job.
bad,District manager is never happy complains . Its all about ## . Never gives any one credit for doing a good gob . you work hard and all holidays n weekends .Your schedule is never the same week to week
bad,Management would lie to employees' face. Over all the higher up to get big bonus while at the same time employees get a 25 cent raise. Then the insurance would go up a dollar or more then the cost of living increase
bad,"There is a reason Autozone does not want it's employees discussing pay rates amongst themselves. A red shirt can make more than a grey shirt. Depending on the manager, you can either have a great and knowledgeable crew, or a crew that has an entry level grey shirt with ZERO automotive experience or knowledge"
bad,This company needs to review the stores because so much goes on that is not authorized by the company. Alot of slacking goes on and employees and managers are always on their phone watching videos etc
bad,"Dealing with auto customers are a challenge, being it's a D.I.Y  store ppl dont dont know anything,they want your advice then tell you, your wrong. AUTOZONE  say Yes we have it but the inventory suck"
bad,Poor pay poor management lazy workers to many call offs that are over looked some workers are coddled.Some workers don't anwser the phone don't work the counter and are just lazy.Manager don't care high turn over.
bad,"I enjoy working with the crew that is here but management is very poor. Promises of advancement with no intentions of doing what they say. The work schedule is very unstable, never know when you get breaks or when you will get off work."
bad,"If you are Salary, you can expect to always get called in on your day off. They make you ""FOOL"" the system showing that you only work 50hrs, but then require you to work more. Very few good District managers! Very hard to get help. They will just throw you in there with little to no training."
bad,"I was constantly scolded for not being like the men at the work place and they were very unfair. Grey shirts would not go outside, and they are messy with the hours there. I had to try to survive off of 10 hours a week. Which resulted in me getting another job. Another manager came in and they took me off of the schedule completely with no explanation. Robert Saunders was sexist and made me uncomfortable."
bad,"Horrible environment,been there over 10yrs. And people ask why i stayed in a Job i got promoted 3x and only reached $2 more."
bad,The store manager made all decisions regarding employee interaction which gave.no authority to shift managers. When policy was broken only the store manager coild write an employee up not a shift manager so no respect was shown to shift manager by employees. The policys were enforced not as written but as the store manager interpeted. The store i worked at was disorganized and poorly ran.
bad,4 hour work day . Slave work sloppy terrible Pay . Two people in  store per shift. Want us to upsell with no motivation at least offer us commission. It’s just not worth it.
bad,Upper management is the serious problem at auto zone. They are completely indifferent to whats going on under them unless it is affecting their paycheck.  You are just a replaceable cog in the machine.
bad,We sit there running around for parts cleaning the store up while are manger plays around and does nothing as we horrible  pay and horrible  hours while he sits there and does nothing and he gets 60 hours a week for doing nothing.
bad,"Normally, a day starts with slow pace but most of times, when you get busy, you won't get any breaks. It's a very fast paced work environment. It teaches a lot about parts knowledge but pay scale is very low."
bad,work while others stand on phones and bring in doctor excuses for their point system and still get docked points then when you have a roommate call in because you were on your way out the door and child that isd 2 gets sick but have your roommate call so your work is aware that you were coming in but a sick child is being taken care of in this supposive family oreintated environment and get told a no call no show per dm. I know a lot of people have quit because of this new dm and heard a lot of complaints because of him . i was suppose to be hired on as a full time worker and was told different than i got. I would still be employed if only someone would straighten the situation out
bad,Delivered and picked up auto parts from Texas to Louisiana. Made sure vehicle was maintained properly and reported any maintenance issues. Stocked items on shelves.
bad,Its not a good job for what they pay you an the work they want you to do it doesnt add up they want to much for to little an there is to many bosses  customer are rude to you an its just stressful
bad,"When hired by manager, i was given one pay rate. Agreed upon accepting job offer. First check, pay rate was less than originally discussed - when brought up to manager to discuss and straighten out, I was brushed off"
bad,The management is not trained well and they not think on employees they only want numbers and has to be a balance they can do better but they just don't. Many good workers deserve more but the management are so incompetent.
bad,Some what good working area and ok employees..at times manager were not being managers some employers didnt kno how work with customers and give them the right products.
bad,"Worked part time for three years, with no benefits, 45 to fifty hours a week. Very poor Distrct mngmnt. Asked full time and was cut to 5 hrs per week imedietley ."
bad,I worked here after the military and they paid $8.25 an hour and make you earn more than that throughout the day. There is no commission and no sitting down.
bad,"As a driver my workload was heavy, while managers slacked off and messed around on their phones most the day.  Clients for the most part were good people.  Communication skills are lacking between managers and employees."
bad,"poor communication, lack of team work but previous manager was good to work with, have to push extra products, store productivity has to be at certain level"
bad,Go straight to the back and check if there are any parts or stock that need to be put back. Check the customers car batteries and under the hood to see what the problem is. I learned how to take care of my own car and others. The management was very disorganized and  unprepared. The hardest part of the job was that I had no prior car knowledge. And the most enjoyable part was that I got to learn what every part of my car does and how to put it in or take it out.
bad,"Autozone was okay but I won't recommend anyone to work there the only thing I liked about Autozone was, I got discounts for my autoparts. I would deliver autoparts to different autozone stores"
bad,No time with family you do not have a set schedule the managers are all buddie buddie and you gotta get in with the group to make it anywhere in the company. Way to many rules and regulations. Do not get paid for all the hard work. Also you get no thanks for your hard work.
bad,Autozone is still a very sexist company. Men are preferred over women. Management makes promises that they NEVER keep and they put people in charge who don't know what they're doing.
bad,"i was a Territory Manager. Everyday you get a call about how are you going to beat last year. Your job is on the line day to day. Always being told you are easily replaced. "
bad,"We made it fun even when the upper management tried to make it stressfull. "
bad,"Title says it all. Management is not good, no security, no job advancement. Honestly if you prefer having no life than this is the place for you. Only good thing is you might end up with a few team members that make it worth it."
bad,"Non supportive regional staff, who like to talk down to people and demean them. Expect too much from store teams with little pay and not enough help to get the job done that they expect."
bad,Not a good place to work very judgmental worked you very hard for less pay a lot of favoritism the job it self was very greasy and not a place for a lady that was not so experienced they were pushovers and I stayed with job because I needed the work.
bad,Great Job for starters but not as a career. Fortune 500 company at its worst. No consideration for customers time or needs. Company expectation is exaggerated .Sales personnel are not always knowledgeable of product or cars for that matter.
bad,"I love to go there to buy parts for a vehicle, hate to work there. The pay is horrible. The job/life balance is terrible. The management doesn't care about you or anything you can provide. They want a drone. Other employees are filled with negative attitude about the workplace. They're absolutely terrified of unions. You're just a number as an employee. Don't recommend working there!!!"
bad,management is not up to par most managers being hired now don't know much about cars they just a customer experience . and poor decision making on upper management
bad,"As a part time they don't give you enough hours per week. Managers are not good at making schedules. They'll have you close one night at 10:30PM and then have you open the next morning at 7PM. Bilinguals don't receive any extra incentives although Spanish speakers help 80% of Auto Zone customers so we work a lot harder than those who don't. Not a good place to work, it was temporary for me and close to home which is the only reason I took this job. Red shirts only work on truck days most of the time and weekends."
bad,"Massive turn over numbers. Any good employee I hired soon quit as there was no advancement opportunities, terrible raises, and no respect from upper management."
bad,Autozone is a terrible company to work for if your looking for a career. Openings for advancement are fee and far between unless your good buddy with the regional guys. The pay is a joke for a management position and they always make you feel like your in fear for your job because you didn't rip someone off with a 1.50 bag of grease
bad,"if you are a gray shirt (parts sales manager) don't exer expect a weekend off. it's nearly impossible to plan anything due to the randomness of shifts. The district and regional managers are usually people that you wouldn't trust to run a one stall bathroom if you have had any leadership training. as for compensation, its retail and they pay pathetic wages for what they expect. if you show up and do what is asked, your job is safe. advancement is only at the DM's discretion. store management is great, those above them are pathetic. overall culture is good within the store team but, the DMs tend to roll out ideas and edicts that could crush even the most optimistic of people."
bad,"It is a lot of work, unless you are disabled, you are to carry heavy equipment, place it throughout the store neatly and where it belongs. There is no structure, you are never doing one function on the job. You have to be multitasking between customers in the store and on the phone, all the while you have to keep the store clean, and carry heavy parts back and forth. You are lucky if your manager has a soul and you get along with him or her because if not, prepare to kiss up or you'll be blamed for the most childish offences. It is very stressful but if you are hard-working and dedicated then you can get far, even though you'll still be overworked and underpayed. I recommend it for the car enthusiast as you can learn a thing or two about cars. other than that, it gets repetitive and very annoying."
bad,"Every day was the same. Always belittled for being a female in a male work place, from customers and co-workers alike. Sexist atmosphere. Management constantly promised promotion and never followed through no matter how hard you worked. Some of my co-workers were supportive and stood up for me while others would feed you to the wolves and only make matters worse. The hardest part of working for Autozone was the lack of recognition for hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job was finally leaving after putting up with too much for too long."
bad,The best part of my job was helping customers fix their cars.  To identify problems and give them the correct parts to fix it.  I had a great team and the expectations were set.  It was very demanding with time.
bad,"Some of the higher ups/management are super rude and disrespectful to temps. One of the managers in paticular talks down to me constantly as well as others, people have gone to HR about it to no avail."
bad,"Auto Zone is like any other automotive retail sales,there is very little room for growth. The managers seem to have power trips and can't seem to relate to the employees."
bad,I think the most part that I dislike and my job is the room for advancement and the wages. For the most part I love what I did my job was easy and my co-workers were great. the hardest part about my job is putting in the hart work and long hours with no compensation..
bad,la gente se estresa demasiado y la cultura es quedarse siempre mucho tiempo despues de la hora de salida.
bad,"They do not pay well, employees do not  get good benefits and they are always cutting hours very insecure job DO NOT work here!!! All they care about is their customers that's it not their employees."
bad,"the district manger expects to much of his employees."
bad,"Auto zone expect you as an employer to dedicated your life to them go the extra mile be there all the time, and they will even call you on your day off to come. Also make you up sales with no commission if you don't up sales your more likely on the red zone of getting a write up and your schedule is never the same and hours are always getting cut."
bad,"I really loved it at first , 10 years ago.  Now it is ran by a bunch of rejects from advanced auto. There is a reason Auto zone did better then them all the years before.   Its not a fun place to be.  Its too stressful . Too much bs."
bad,Would not recommend Auto Zone as a place to work for anyone.  Management do not have boundaries and will call at all hours of the day and night.  All district managers and regional managers micro manage all aspect of the business
bad,"I would not suggest anyone to work for this company. Poor management, no advancement, poor pay, and poor hours. No recognition for work performed."
bad,Perfect for a part time. I would not suggest this to someone looking for a real career. Don't waste your time hoping for a career that will never happen.
bad,"If you're a female working here, you will be under-minded by majority of the customers here. It's not super bad if you have some auto mechanic knowledge."
bad,Work there five years and no advancement!!! Management is very poor!!!!
bad,Company does not care at all about their store employees. advancement is very difficult beyond the store level. They preach culture and values but do not show it.
bad,"Was originally guaranteed a large promotion, but was later denied due to as they phrased it "" my military obligations would interfere with my work"""
bad,gained one on one customer experience
bad,"At first I thought they were different to other companies, but then I've realised that its the same. A manager that doesn't stand up for his staff and rather believe in what client's are telling him."
bad,overall i lkoved helping people to fix thier prolem very satisfying but to much pressure to sell overstocked products
bad,"Work begins at 8 a.m., answer telephone orders, cash- out customers or look up parts for customers, order car parts thats needed. clean work area before leaving."
bad,"There is no advancement, poor management in the region I work, consistently understaffed and they are unable to keep qualified employees due to low wages and lack of any benefits or compensation"
bad,I worked there for a year as a csm .management undermines everything you do and was never good enough every conversation with d.m. was only negative feedback.. pay to work ratio was terrible store managers are treated just as bad if your not part of the good ol boy system you will be  pushed out only good thing I can say is employees were great to work with
bad,"A typical day at work involved coming in and getting ready to start either for the morning shift or the evening shift. Set up the drawers, clock in and start helping customers. Everyday is different but the customers are always the same."
bad,Working at AutoZone is like working at a poorly managed zoo. AutoZone expects you to constantly upsell to the point of making you feel very uncomfortable doing it with penalty of write up if not . Management is very do do do while I sit sit sit over all horrible place to work.
bad,"Started out to be a cool place to work and learn different parts,, no pay rate sucks and people are two faced and lie !!! Especially ones that you thought you had a good working relationship with ."
bad,Some of management needs to be replaced. Work culture is behind the time. The organizational culture does not match the needs of their customers. Always trying to sell more than the customer wants. The organization needs to remember that the customer is the one who pays their salaries and keeps the lights on
bad,"I have been there for 4 yrs no raises for the last 3 even though I get bonus for meeting goals they did not do an RPM on my store  they just put anything in the system to show a review was done and said nothing to the employees I have been in the area when the try to hire people and have witnessed them straight out lie to get someone to quit another job and then put them in limbo and wait for them to be desperate and then back down the offer to less money and I am willing to place Names and places and TImes of RM ,DM,SM open ended lying to people and the list goes on in short this company needs a Institutional  self study and maybe a look into by the Fed. if anyone one specific info don't hesitate to drop me a line"
bad,"I worked for this company for about 3 years at multiple locations. I got promoted to management after 2 years. Upper management does not care about their employees, they only care about how much you’re selling and their “check out challenges.” I had to fight for months to receive a raise. They finally offered me a $0.25 raise after I got an interview somewhere else that offered to pay me $5 more an hour so I quit."
bad,it's like working at a grade school everybody tells on each other and everybody makes stuff up about each other and basically everybody that works there's kind of childish.
bad,"Not good management and the pay is not good, not enough to  live off of ."
bad,"Just was not a fair place to work for,. I did not enjoy it other then the customers. and helping people. was about the only part of it i enjoyed. Not good pay"
bad,"Horrible Manager, unable to train properly. no one felt safe, hostile environment. always felt like your effort was not good enough. Many employees left right after I did. manager was unable to relay help when you were busy. expected everyone to know without training"
bad,The location that I worked at was the worst.  The store manager was afraid to promote anyone that he saw as a threat to his career.  Constantly lied about everything and took credit for things that other employees did.
bad,Not a great place to work. Do not give timely performance reviews. If you are a good worker there is no reward. It is difficult to spend time with your family.
bad,it’s an okay job. not many hours in it if you are part time. you have a lot of down time during the job and the point system isn’t very understanding.
bad,From start of day this is a fast paced environment. From putting away parts to answering phones and getting the right parts to the customers is the name of the game. You will learn more about vehicles here in a hurry. Some managers are great...just not mine. Sometimes they promise you things but don't deliver through.
bad,Autozone is a great company I believe that due to lack of training and poor management it was extremely stressful. Customer service is something I strive for however when you are an employee who has not had proper training and you are thrown into the front of store in which the computer system is different from your department it was frustrating. The store I worked at was understaffed and when new hires came in they too weren’t properly trained.
bad,"I began my short career with Autozone having over a decade of experience within the Atomotive Parts and Service Industry. The auto parts company that I had previously been employed with was very well positioned, within the local market, to be successful.  They did so by hiring qualified individuals who were actually parts experts and most of, if not all, also had service experience.  I was foolish in believing that Autozone would follow a similar business strategy. After only 1 day it became evident to me that the culture, within the store, was severely broken and with the exception of one other employee, there was absolutely no employees with any formal automotive training or experience.  I quickly realized that the SM had no interest in the success of the store beyond its WITTDJR score.  As a CSM I was focused solely on sales and rebuilding a clientele base, which I later found out he destroyed.  I was promised that I would have at least 1 full time delivery driver, which never happened. That’s right...I was the CSM and I was expected to delivery my own parts, all the while maintaining my customers accounts, keeping up with mounds of paperwork, and ensuring that his DIY WITTDJR score was up to snuff. After only two weeks I began searching for a new career opportunity. I reached out to my DM and TSM on multiple occasions, but it became quickly evident that they were more interested in preserving the reputation of their SM than they were repairing the reputation and performance of the store.  I love the auto parts industry and so very badly wanted to be successful, but the SM,"
bad,"I can only speak for my district. Working here is absolutely horrible. Upper management does not care for anyone below them any attempt to contact upper management is usually dead end with no callback. I only worked here while in college because of how flexible it is. The pay is not good even as a manager you aren't paid well. Sales targets tend to be very unreasonable. Everyone is expected to do everything. there are no cashiers, stockers, mechanics, parts specialists. You are expected to fill all those roles while understaffed and very few hours. I know of some stores that have such little hours that fulltime employees are not given fulltime hours. Overtime is almost never given. The company at least in my district in NY is not a good work environment. There is a revolving door here for a good reason anyone smart leaves within a month those who remain were either like me in college or just weren't able to go anywhere else. Avoid unless you desperately need a job."
bad,They really don't treat their employees very well. They have a lot of expectations  they do not want to compensate you for. They are not helpful at all to former employees looking to return as well.
bad,"Computers and software are 20 years behind.  No work life balance.  Honestly, loyalty and hard work have no place in AutoZone.  9 hour shifts on your feet.  Chairs and counter stools are forbidden.  Nasty public restrooms.  Break area is a folding chair and a small folding table.  Company has a laser focus on customer service and satisfaction.  No attempt to serve or satisfy the workers.  This is my experience and opinion, I do not represent the opinion of  AutoZone or there management."
bad,"Years ago, it was a good company to work for. Then it turned bad. If you're happy with being berated daily for not selling unnecessary grease packs by your District Manager, this job is for you. If not, steer away. The only thing that the company concerns itself with is maintaining its inflated stock price. The only thing mid-level field management is concerned with is their bonuses. They say they're ""thrifty"", What they mean is ""cheap""."
bad,"You're expendable, management doesn't care if you die as long as you get the work done, be prepared to have an unstable schedule and ridiculed if you have to go school, customer's expect you to know what the problem is with their cars"
bad,If you want to learn about cars more its a good place to work IF you don't mind making penny's. They don't pay well at all for the amount of work they want out of you.
bad,This is a good place for someone to work if they are looking for short term employment opportunities. AutoZone is not a place where careers are built.
bad,They don’t value you as an employee. They ask for so much yet pay little . Only people that really get benefits and all the good stuff are store managers and up.
bad,Good parts great prices wish the company was batter with their employees the covington hwy store in decatur ga is a terrible only a couple of ppl in there like the store manger she makes it a hostile work environment.
bad,"If you're fine with staying in one place, and not going anywhere, or looking for a part time job, it's a good place to work. Outside of that, there are no advantages to doing a full time position. You'll be underpaid and overworked."
bad,"Debes aguantar groserías y malos tratos, tú no serás contemplado en nada sin Lambisconería, prácticas de sabotaje para hacer renuncias, siempre te pedirán te quedes más de lo que te pagan y se tomarán represalias si no lo haces, muy mala atención a problemas internos, muy difícil subir de puesto, prefieren contratar gente que no tiene ni el mínimo conocimiento, te piden hacer tareas fuera de tu jurisdicción o obligaciones, con tal de quedar bien los superiores"
bad,bad wont work there again. did not take account for family. can not move up. Coworkers made the Job bearable. hardest pRT WAS DEALING WITH mANAGMENT. ENJOYABLE PART WAS COWORKERS
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work at the location on 24th street and southern. Management is horrible. People quit left and right. Customers are very rude there.
bad,"Management grills mindless busy work into store personnel. The only break in this routine is assisting customers, a welcome break from the routine. A sad way to make a living."
bad,Good for a temporary job. The job constantly has new employees coming and going. Autozone expects you to meet very strict goals sometimes even when certain times of the year are slow. Hours constantly change weekly and pay is barely above minimum wage.
bad,The building has no AC. The summer is completly miserable to work in the facility. The pay is how they trap people there but in the end its not worth your sanity and the time you spend away from your family. Mandatory over time happens a lot.
bad,After working part time for a year was promoted to part time manager from there it was a dead end with no more advancement opportunities after being promised full time after 90 days of being part time manager. Store manager and above management were only worried about themselves and the bonuses they received and would rather hire new employees to higher positions instead of promoting the experienced ones. Pay increase from sales to manager was not worth the more than triple workload and responsibilities.
bad,"Its a good job if you want to make minimum wage, and have no career advancement. I drove delivery for commercial and loved it because it gave me some freedom."
bad,"AutoZone is an okay place to work at. Definitely recommend those who are into cars and want to make some cash on the side. You always feel under pressure to try and sell items. I would definitely recommend being a driver, it's definitely more fun than working the front but it gets stressful at times."
bad,"Poor management, lack culture, hours are unpredictable, to many clicks in each store leaving little room to advance. Pay is only fair, you must train yourself by video's if you can get free time to complete them. Horrible support from H.R."
bad,"They do not allow the correct labor hours to meet their customer satisfaction expectation goals. In other words, they do not allow the store manager to staff the stores with the enough associates/employees to service the customer without putting undue stress on the employee and there is inadequate security in stores with repeat arm robbery incidents in some cases where employees have be injured physically and mentally."
bad,"as a manger i was put under stress daily. i would be pulled six different ways, get called in constantly due to a call out, there was also no signs of improvement nor advancement for employees past manager."
bad,was working there and had issues with the dividing of hours usually fluctuated between six different staff but was a full time red shirt on the books working 25 hours instead of the full 45
bad,"Everything about this company is terrible. Management is inexperienced. People enforce rules and don't follow them. Most of the management lack common sense. "
bad,"Worked there for about 8 months, I replaced a car battery for a customer and herniated a disc and pinched sciatic nerve in my lower back ,Autozones Doctors told me I'm good to go back to work immediately and i cant stand more than 3 minutes without severe back pain, they are currently fighting me on Workmans Comp and i have no income cause i ""chose"" not to work."
bad,"Co-workers were the best part of the company. Management however, decided to pick and choose who could be promoted or transfer stores. They could deny any request to try and keep an employee from advancing without explanation or justification."
bad,Every store is understaffed... they overwork their employees and never support them... severely underpaid their employees... worked there for five years and was always the lowest paid manager despite training store mangers for them
bad,It started out as a good place to work. about a year in it began to be a  stressful place of work. The I work 38-40 hours per week. The way the hours are given is draining. One day its 11am-9:15pm then the next day its 7:15-6:15pm in a constant cycle. There is more to it as to why I want to find better.
bad,Management always pushed us to upsell basic little parts for a markup so they can get nice bonuses at the end of the year. It's retail pay for warehouse work. Installing batteries in the 110 degree heat plus the heat of the car is not worth 9.33 an hour
bad,The management team shouldn't be management that's part of the reason i'm searching for other employment also the advancement opportunities is void. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the commercial manager because she is forever talking down to me.
bad,"Heavily focused on upselling customers, rather than helping fix actual problems. Hours would be cut if you didn't sell enough COC (Check Out Challenge) items, regardless of the actual amount of the sale."
bad,Empty promises and hard to move up and if you don't click with the manager they will only give you 4 hours a week happen to me and many other people be for me.
bad,"Place was not willing to work with my work, school and kid schedule whatsoever. Mostly School and sick child. They ended up letting me go due to excessive absences due to tending to my sick child."
bad,"After working there for 10 years and working with the same crew. I was lucky and had a great DM and store manager and great red shirts below me for years and years that definitely helps but nothing last forever and once those were gone the overall company sucks and doesn't care about you but the crew when you have that and everybody cares about each other and looks out for each other that makes it all worth it. Raises suck even I got large raises by standards and would only get .50 or more a year till capped. Hard to take a saved vacation on time when so shorthanded because of turn around then when it gets lost and They don't want to reimburse it or if they do anything it's in a way that falsify's company documents would help if they would give you an option to sell it back to them. The employees that do you stick around normally do so because they build up clientele or get lucky like I did. I saw a 35 year employee did a front page on the company annual news letter/magazine and yet he didn't get the ""extra miler "" as they call it which is a monetary award.   They push you to go extra for the customer and if it works out you might get semi rewarded but if it doesn't work out then you're in trouble and possible  reprimand. All in all just depends on location."
bad,"Need more communication and higher pay.Management does not show lower level staff ant type of respect. They make lower level staff do all of the work. They do want to help you complete your task at hand. It's more of a do as I say, not as I do situation."
bad,"This employer expects you to do ""ALL"" job titles, not just the one you got hired for, and get paid minimum wage. They crack the whip on you and tell you to push sales with no commission, only to put more money in the managers pocket at the end of the month for their bonus. They say they have rewards, but they never recognize you for your efforts. Grey shirt managers only get paid 1.00-3.00 more per hour than a regular. I knew a manager who was there for 10 years+, poor girl only got paid 14.25/hr. She does so much for so little, but it's all she knows. If you have nothing better to do with your life, or if you really have no other option, or are on probation, go ahead with this company. Autozone has a lot going on for it, but they need to improve the pay system for there lower employees who are the foundation for this company and they need to recognize them more."
bad,"Good high school job, early hours or late. learned a lot about cars trucks, tires and batteries. was only there about 6 months until I graduated high school and moved to Sc"
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction I received knowing I helped a customer find the correct part or the hard to find part for an older vehicle the customer needed to get his/her car running again.
bad,Might not get lunches managers don't know how to talk to their employees and does not believe in letting you better yourself can't go to school or advance in the company have lost a lot of good people since I been here and it's do to bad managers!!!!
bad,"Get what you can at the start because no matter the performance raises are meek at best! Company proclaims to be ""employee"" friendly but their actions speak louder. The first thing to cut so they can keep their streak of ""double digit"" profit and growth is payroll and benefits, but only at the store level! Their HR does a very shoddy job of investigating any complaint and does not care about the employees. Their only concern is limiting any potential for litigation. A very politically correct company that places no value on length of service or commitment right up through district management! The longer you are there and more you advance the less secure your job is! Never expect this company to have your back or even do what is right or just! I literally heard a regional manager telling 2 other district managers he didn't care if store managers quit or get fired, especially ones that had been around awhile, because he could replace them with with younger people and pay them far less! I was a store manager for this company and gave my all and feel like of any job I have had this was a real waist of 7 years of my life!"
bad,"this job just isnt for me, low wages, low management communication. overwhelmed on weekends. not enough employees scheduled. found my self with one employee often. doing manager duties at the same time while im taking care of customers"
bad,"In charge of the other co-workers and cashiers, making sure they provide great customer service and produce sales. Tasks included register maintenance, tracking of daily profit, daily paper work filing, commercial accounts, store upkeep, and cleaning. stress"
bad,"Worked for a year and a half, constantly upset by senseless changes by upper management/corporate. Our store is the top profiting store in the district but to keep other stores running and employees paid hours were cut multiple times after astronomical sales goals weren't met (though we're still far above average). Making pennies above minimum wage for far more labor and knowledge than what would be needed for other similarly-paying jobs."
bad,"Working at Autozone was an experience. They constantly advertise to their employees about job advancement, but never pull through with promotions. They also have a program to sell a certain amount of products at the cash register, with no incentive or acknowledgement of completing these numbers. Working with Autozone was a true demotivator as all they cared about were amount of sales and how fast you can unload the trucks merchandise 3 times a week."
bad,"Fun to go to work but tiring having to deal with the bad management at this company, they provide no motivation to do a good job, they do not train you on what the expectations are and now matter how hard you work its not good enough. The most enjoyable part of the job is the end of the day!"
bad,"Great job for those who is new in automotive"
bad,"There isn't a set schedule, nor guaranteed even part time hours. I recieved less than 20 hrs per week with open availability. Other mangers were not held accountable for their actions."
bad,co-workers either friendly willing to help or lazy. management has no communication adding you to work schedule not calling you till your new shift was supposed to end and putting it against you .telling you your in for promotion and telling you the same months later. and lying about paying you a servant hourly wage ans paying you less.
bad,A difficult job with not much payoff. Production is difficult.  There is no employee/management communication or help.
bad,"I did learn a lot about cars and kept busy once they gave me the spot I applied for in the beginning. co workers were great, I enjoyed meeting new people I ran parts to."
bad,drive all day and got to meet new people. I've learned to be responsible on having a good driving record. The most like enjoyed about this job was learning about auto parts
bad,throw you on computer no training cannot say or do anything without prior approval from some kind of management always about what your doing wrong or not doing
bad,Auto zone was bought out by another company. Auto zone carries auto parts that your car may need. They are open 7 days a week.
bad,"Autozone has to be the worst company I have ever worked for. The managers don't care about employee schedules and usually schedule you without any input. I was offered a middle management position that would have given me a $1.00 hr raise for the increase in aggravation. Safety is a joke in the back of the stores. Autozone also doesn't bother to hire people with any working knowledge of the parts they sell. They don't want people who are knowledgeable because it's easier to sell new employees on the company line of what parts they need to sell. The more unnecessary parts, the bigger the profit."
bad,"work day consisted of deliverying parts to selective businesses , maintaining clean work environment . customer service"
bad,"I work as a commercial delivery driver and sales associate.  It is a job.  I was looking forward to the possibility of promotion, but it never came.  I was always willing to come in whenever needed and work when others called out, but I was never given 30-40 hours a week on the schedule.  I was always reliable, and was willing to work when others were calling out.  I was offered the opportunity to transfer to another store, because I went to fill in when they were short workers and my store denied it even though they wouldn't schedule me for additional hours."
bad,I worked at Autozone for a few months and it was one of the most dysfunctional business's I've ever been apart of. When it gets busy the whole place just falls apart.  Management is never willing to help or communicate with you. Most of the employees are disrespectful and disobey anything the managers say to them. Hours are also unfair and they underpay the managers significantly. I do not recommend trying to get a manager position here.
bad,"A typical day at AutoZone consists of clocking in and either working on returns (parts that customers from other AutoZones ordered and ended up not wanting that are returned back to us with a transfer paper that needs to be checked and put back into the system), picking for customers and satellite stores, working on truck from the distribution center, or loading your van to deliver parts to satellite stores. You work at a fast and steady rate consistently through your entire shift with an hour lunch that is not paid. There are several managers in the store: three managers in the hub that consists of one hub coordinator, a mid-shift manager, and a closing manager; in the front part of the hub (store) also has three managers: an opening manager, mid-shift manager, and closing manager. There is also a store manager and a commercial manager. Several co-workers that I work with don't even do their jobs correct most of the time meaning that some co-workers mostly stand around, put parts lazily in the wrong place, or will only do one part of their job and nothing else. The other co-workers that I work with do their job effectively. This is the hardest part of the job. A lot of co-workers that I work with don't do their job, just do their job lazily, or call out several times which makes it harder for everyone else to do their job. AutoZone has a point system, and because we are the hub, the store manager is lenient on everyone which makes it very hard on everyone. Another part that makes the job difficult are the conflicting managers in the store, mainly the hub coordinator. The hub"
bad,"Low pay, work conditions are shoddy at best. No stability. Refusal to  take into account a persons certifications for job promotions."
bad,"no room for advancement, poor management, minimum of 15 hours a week."
bad,"I've had a lot of bad jobs but working at AutoZone by far is the worst! My coworkers were great but upper management was HORRIBLE. They treat everyone as if they are worthless,constantly giving the threat of termination,attempting to force you to sale customers things they don't need,forcing the promotion of unqualified associates while passing over the more qualified.Making store managers hire more people to cut hours of others."
bad,"Depending on the day we have different task."
bad,"The store manager was a bully, he was against females working in the automotive industry, and he was just plain mean. He was let go not long after I left this company."
bad,"Primary responsibilities included supervision of 12 employees,   order processing, inventory control, quality training and sales.  Worked with customers to ensure they received the correct parts and information pertaining to their needs. "
bad,"Liked the work, .Left the job because of treatment by store manager. I do not treat anyone poorly and I will not take such treatment from anyone."
bad,"Poor Management, Lack of opportunity to grow and most importantly over worked and underpaid. As a ""red shirt"" you're job is to run around and do everything. This includes installing batteries for customers, unloading truck shipments and helping customers find parts for their vehicle AT THE SAME TIME! The company puts customers first... not their employees."
bad,I liked the job that I performed during my time there. I really loved the coworkers and getting to know the customers.
bad,"The people for the most part are really fun and enjoyable. The upper management 'ie' District and Regional Managers, are not as smart as they think they are. They are more about the money than actually taking care of the customers and hard working employees. They feel u should be married to your job and not worry about your family. Which to me is completely backwards. Family always comes first in my book."
bad,Great pt job always getting extra hours if need it. Loved helping the customers with a problem or finding a part . Harest part would be the hours and days off never know what your schedule will be like.
bad,"As a sales associate your job is to get customers in and out as quickly as possible. You must know how to handle customers with patience, (handling irate customers a plus)."
bad,"Learned a lot there, but very little room for advancement and no support from management to do so.  Compensation for the work was not good and lead me to find other employment."
bad,Starter job. Nothing special. Wont get anywhere fast if white. You can flip burgers for more then working managment position. Company is very greedy. Bonuses where tooken away.
bad,"I really liked the job when I first started but over time it got harder, they packed down the hours and i come home every night exhausted. The managment and employees were disrespectful."
bad,"Poor management, I worked with 3 sequence manager. Their management are super poor, they HR don't want to promote employees . they just higher new people and put them to manage the store. It was supposed to be like walmart or publix where people start from simple employees and got promoted step by step to manager."
bad,Fast paced and customer oriented. The customers you deal with generally have attitudes and are excessively needy! The customers will expect you to do things you’re not allowed to do then report you as not being helpful. Once that happens you are subject to district managers discretion of employment.
bad,District manager provided no guidance. Way to many hours 50 or more a week for store manager. Just not a place if you are a single full time parent. No advancement
bad,They want to pay you way way less than what they expect out of you.  They are so desperate for employees they will hire virtually anyone.  Great job as a backup til a real one comes along.  They don't drug test so if you need a job while you kick the habit there is another reason.  They will schedule 5 days a week but will ask you to come in 75% of time on days off.  There are some good employees there and I valued them but I also feel sorry for who they have to work with normally.
bad,"The only thing I liked about the job were the people I worked with. Upper management is horrible on their employees and aren’t realistic. And it is a very sexist company, and you’ll get sexually harassed daily if you are a female. And the management acts like it doesn’t happen."
bad,I started as driver and I worked hub 40 hrs for 2 y and would not give me full time moved up to psm so I can have full time but was paid less the the guys I had to quit 3 times to get the same money as the guys and I was trained to work everything in the store. Got in a car wreck not at work when it happened  and got fired.
bad,"If you don't mind working harder than a janitor and getting paid less than one, then this is your place. Always understaffed and when they are fully staffed, half the people couldn't tell you the difference between a crankshaft and a camshaft."
bad,"The place can get supper stressful when it's summer time. I really don't recommend this job. Also, they lie when they tell you that they are going to give you a goo raise. Usually there isn't much advancement."
bad,"Politics is what is the issues with these kinds of companies"
bad,"Autozone is a decent stepping stone if you are new to the workforce. They will not pay you enough for the knowledge they expect you to know. The customers get hostile when you dont know ""the thingy next to the airbox"" based on nothing else but that sentence. most of the employees dont know the difference between a spark plug and glow plug. Its astounding how they keep anyone in this company with more than two brain cells. Turnover rate is high and the benefits... there are no benefits. If you have any experience at all avoid this place unless you are hired as a higher up person. They tend to be more pampered. Management is a joke and the store manager all the way up to regional only care about how many of the stupid grease packets  you sell or autozone rewards cards you activate. If you are a parts sales manager good luck not getting ground down emotionally. There isn't enough space to type out the cons of this company."
bad,"The job was easy, but the people there make it seem harder than it is. Management has poor leadership skills. Instead of raising store morale, it tends to bring it down. Too much negativity. If it’s not done their way, the result is insignificant. Poor training as well. I basically had to teach myself how to do everything. It would explain the high turn over rate."
bad,"One of the worst places I have worked. Poor management and no help if you have a problem. Had 3 store managers in less than a year 4 commercial manager changes as well in that time. As soon as you try and get comfortable at your job they fire or relocate management so nothing in the store gets done and you stay behind because of the constant inconsistency. The employees are the ones who get blamed for the store sales going down even though the coorpoation can not seem to keep a manager in the stores. Your annual review has nothing to do with your individual performance and is based solely on the stores numbers so it does not matter how hard you work as an indivual. If you want to learn new things in an attempt to move up good luck. I asked daily to learn new aspects of the store until I finally gave up trying. After 2 of the managers got into a fist fight in the store during store hours and dealing with yet another less than adequate manager I left. Its a hostile and unsettling work environment. The only plus is if you like cars its good, IF you can learn on your own and the customers that come in are great. But as far as the company its garbage. If you like cars and parts try a job at Napa, O'Rielly, or Advance Autoparts honestly they can't be worse."
bad,"For some reason this company has gone away from having a staffed store to just having two people run the entire store themselves because they want to penny pinch as much as they can. Not only that all employees are paid poorly at this company. Even the gray shirt managers are only making 12-13 an hour while all the red shirts are making minumum wage. The company will also give out raises yearly based on your review and only actually give you something like 8 cents. All this and they still expect you to sign people up on their reward card system, to sell a certain item of the month, and stock shelves, bring in and put away the weekly stock shipment, and clean up the store. With only two people."
bad,nothing really enjoyable about the job at all just come in and work and go home..typical day is busy and stressful. employees that don't show up yo work makes it harder om sll the other employees and hard to get all the task done
bad,"I worked at AutoZone for 2 years,. At the location I worked at, there was very poor management. I worked overtime on occasion, managed commercial department, and stocked shelves. I wasn't;t given the opportunities to advance in position."
bad,"Fast paced working environment, puts customers first. Always able to provide exceptional customer service. Great place to work for someone looking to make a career in the automotive industry."
bad,Scheduling prevents work/family balance. Managers may try to hit their target numbers in terms of hours in a store and in so doing will under-staff a store or deduct hours from an employee without their realizing. Employees should pay close attention to their pay stubs.
bad,Auto Zone is a good opportunity for someone with a background in auto maintenance looking to make some extra money on the side. I would suggest this job to someone looking have a job that would pay all their bills.
bad,They have no organization and no structure or security. They want and want and want without giving back. Managers only look out for themselves and it's a joke.
bad,Management is horrible unless you are willing to kiss but to advance you wouldn't advance no matter how good of an employee you are don't go above and beyond the call of duty because they will write you up for your troubles
bad,The Job is fixed hours. No sick day pay. Raises are about 25 cents a year. If you are not available for the hours they put you in for you are not considered Full Time. Any asking for days off they put you to Part time employee.
bad,Very face paced at some stores and very slow at others.  Did not feel the pay was ideal after working there for as many years as I did... Raises were not sufficient
bad,"The job kept you busy, but customers were not the friendliest people and at times impossible to please and management did not always have the back of their employees."
bad,Wouldn't recommend working here if you're trying to make a living. Not nearly enough hours and I was only getting paid $8.30. You get a 25c raise every year.
bad,"closed the store daily, counted the tills, stocked the shelves, helped the customers. I was able to learn the basics of what it was like to run an auto parts store. Management was the same as any other place. They were very unprofessional, they refused to take their job seriously. The hardest part of my job was the language barrier. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the people that needed it the most."
bad,Managers not interested in helping associates make rate. Managers Like to belittle people because they can't keep upwith the pace. Very cutthroat environment
bad,"I find that the grey shirts delegate until its too late."
bad,Was hired as a Parts Sales Manager to run the store and oversee employees for $9.00 an hour. Schedule changed every week. No benefits other than slight discount.
bad,"Pushed to sales additional part customers don't need. The company will wright you up for almost anything. The culture is very negative. Even when giving 110%, the District Managers are not satisfied."
bad,Too much turn over and management does not care enough.only favorites move upwith company.most raises are not far for example one employee had received a five cent raise
bad,Autozone provided little-to-no employee perks and felt like a dead end to everyone there. The management was distant and only intervened to punish. No one every seemed to know who was the boss and higher ups never checked in.
bad,"My experience at autozone might have been better, if it was in a better location. I enjoyed the work, but the management there was something to be desired."
bad,Management at AutoZone lacks the proper skill to run the business day without problems occurring constantly. Some management positions are fulfilled with people who lack the proper background for the automotive industry in the parts industry.
bad,"Unfair treatment of employees, minimal raises. Will lie to you to get you to do more than what you are being paid for, including advancement opportunities just to overlook you in the end no matter how hard you work and how well you do your job."
bad,I loved the environment and the people I get to work with i just do not like the hours I would receive. like i would get maybe 17 hours a week and to top it off you have to provide your own work cloths. so that means taking out from the little bit of money they give you and having to buy cloths to work in..you do not get paid holidays only if you are hired on as a full time worker and you never have a set schedule its always all over the place.
bad,"I'm sure Oreilly's and Pep Boy's working environment is much better. It was ok when I first started but as I got deeper into the company & culture, I started seeing things that were unfair and borderline illegal."
bad,"I had worked for Autozone for about 8years. Every position that company had to offer i did it! They lacked management communication, and withdrew a lot from helping employees. The store where the best years of my employment at Autozone until I went to the distribution center. The employees who needed to be recognized where not recognized and those who needed to be told something or should have not continued with the company tend to have gotten one too many chances. The communication is poor, but overall as an hourly or a non-managment position job is less stressful and you seem to hold yourself better as an Autozone employee. As a manager it gets hard, the amount of work does not meet my personal salary expectations with the knowledge i have but for some i may not bother them as much."
bad,"Being a young person I did not have a good experience working here. There are a lot of older people who have worked there a long time. I felt talked down to, treated as though I am not smart or competent and ordered around by many people. During my shifts I felt used or taken advantage of; I would work afternoon to close or weekends and a lot of work would not be touched all day, then I would be ordered to do it all by myself. My coworkers would not help. Many shifts were only scheduled with 2 people on a busy weekend, that leaves 2 employees to help customers, answer phone, place orders, ring up customers, as well as 1 person needing to go outside to customers vehicles. I would also be scheduled when I couldn't be there, with my boss knowing I was in high school and then written up for being late."
bad,It’s a nice job but they pay isn’t what I️ want I️ been here for & want somthing new. Everybody here is nice & fun to be around but I️ have a family I️ need to support
bad,"The job itself is not bad, the customers and most of the responsibilities are manageable and enjoyable. Management is terrible, I mean terrible.  Very inappropriate treatment, physical harassment such as pushing and slapping, foul names, regularly being threatened with my job, write ups, etc.  This isn't just my in store management, when taken to a district manager it was disregarded and the situation got worse."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of this job is the interaction with customers and the ability to really help them. The hardest part is the micromanagement and ""Big Brother is watching you"". Always looking for more by threats."
bad,AutoZone is an average place to work. They give all of their employees a 20 percent discount on all auto parts. They just don't pay their employees enough. It can be stressful at times because the very best of all of their employees is expected at all times. They leave no room for error. It's very difficult to call in sick.
bad,Depending who you are working with the job could be very easy or very difficult. I've worked for this company for a year and have been promised opportunities and have not received it.
bad,It's easy to become a manager but the weekly schedule sat-sun does not allow for you to make plans for the weekend. The low pay is an issue in talent retention and acquisition so don't count on a lot of coworkers to be able to swap shifts with you. They require an open availability but most positions are part time not allowing those to make a living with a second job.
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. They pay poor wages with outlandish expectations.The store was never properly staffed but it was never a top priority to upper management to fix.
bad,"AutoZone is not a good company to work for. Pay is very weak, even for a retail job. The upper management does not care at all about their employees and views everyone as completely expendable. They preach many contradicting company cultures and standards. Avoid this place if you can."
bad,"Was ok to work for, raises were small and place was always understaffed. nothing was done about it. Had people to jobs they were not trained to do or paid to do."
bad,"this place is for high schoolers who does have any bills, they only offer part time work, less than 15hrs per week. management are children, and there's most chiefs than indians for sure"
bad,"The first few years of working at AZ were good, but once the new CEO was in place the main concern was money and how much money can we make with as few employees working. I did learn a good bit about auto mechanics and developed even more of an interest in mechanics than I already had. The most annoying part of the job was how pushy higher management (DM and up) were about pushing check out specials and other add on stuff to customers. The more of that stuff that sold the bigger the DM's monthly bonus. Many people are very clueless about their vehicles and the basic maintenance that is needed for the vehicle to run."
bad,"A typical day at work would usually start with me clocking into work after I change into my uniform. Then I'd look for a manager to see what my task for my shift was.Most likely work from the day before that might not have been completed by another Autozoner. Then maybe about three to four hours later there'd be a rush of people and I was told to take my obligated break, whether it be a fifteen, thirty minute, or hour break. Even though the store was filled with people and we were more than likely understaffed. Then I'd come back from my break only to be given management level work because some managers weren't trained properly and couldn't complete their daily task. Finally my shift would be over and the work i was assigned to do would only be half way to three quarters of the way finished, leaving more work for the morning staff for the next day."
bad,"Not a good company to work for low pay stupid managers, part-time negative coworkers, always cutting my hours,  employees hate coming to work."
bad,"Management was a turnover consistently, no one was in the store more then a few months at a time, whether they were management or not"
bad,"If you are lucky 1 in a 100 customers that walk through the door is not up set at the world he/she lives in. They are all mad at the fact that there car/truck is broke and they don't want to take it to a mechanic to get it fixed of properly diagnosed. These may be the same people the go to a pharmacist when they get sick instead of to a doctor! PARTS SALES PEOPLE ARE NOT MECHANICS!! I don't care what the adds on the TV and radio say! Witch brings me to management, the company is ""top heavy"" as most companies in this country are. Chopped full of over paid people that think they deserve there over sized paychecks! The kind of people that think yelling at people to sell little packets of Vaseline with every purchase of break pads will motivate the employs to sell! On the over all, the guys and gales I worked with at the store level were great and some of us still keep in touch."
bad,"good management and flexable hours. Help custumers trouble shoot there automotive problems. replace batteries, light bulbs, and read check engine lights for custumers and also help custumers find the tools and parts to do the job right."
bad,"Assist customers with there needs, stock inventory, advise customers with job related needs. Management expects to much from employees they weren't trained for."
bad,"A typical day at work is me answering commercial lines and helping shops figure out what they need and when they need it. I had to either locate the part at another store or contact the vendor and order the part that way. It was also my job to deliver the part on the day and at the time we quoted the business. I learned how to speak to professional people in a tense, rushed setting for them. I learned a great deal about time management and even more about car parts along with the business side of it. My coworkers and managers were not overly helpful so I was left to figure things out for myself  which was frustrating and hard at times. I'd say that was the hardest part of my job. Not being absolutely sure of what to do and nobody was willing to help out. I enjoyed building relationships with the shops in the area."
bad,I see no teamwork in this company when it comes to the management. Sales associates and commercial have no strong leadership. Hours are up and down because there are to many associates in one store and schedules are not done accurately. Customers are loyal and dedicated to the store but customer service is fair and poorly to the Hispanics who are 80% of our customers.
bad,very difficult to help customers inside and outside the building at the same time. customers don't understand when you have to ask them to wait while you get the line down inside. I can multi task with the best but this goes beyond multi tasking.
bad,I would never recommend this company to anyone male or female and no one I know shops there anymore because of how 5 stores treated employees and customers alike.
bad,Employees are not valued as they should. I have learned that it was mostly what the manager can get out of you and show very little appreciation. I gave it my best but it never seemed to be enough.
bad,The workplace was very unorganized and poor management. They cut my work hours a week from 30 hours to 10 hours. They were trying to get me to quit so they wouldn't have to fire me.
bad,I was the first driver hired but I got the least amount of hours people are lazy
bad,company keeps telling you that you can be replaced but they can't find anyone to work scratch a van and your fired someone call the 800- number your fired and they don't care to hear your story elected the worst place to work in 2012
bad,"Best part of this job was interacting with the different types of people from Mechanics, ""do it yourselfers"", etc. I was able to build relationships with a vast group of diverse people on a daily basis."
bad,"I took this job with an attempt to obtain even more knowledge on automotive parts and systems. Though i did learn some, the workplace itself left me completely unsatisfied. I worked at Autozone for a period of merely two months. The benefits are acceptable but when i say benefits i primarily mean the employee discount. If you need an easy secondary job, this will be good for you. The pay isn't great but as a first job or a secondary job it is exceptional."
bad,I have worked for the company for over 2 years and have only gotten a 1 dollar raise.
bad,"very promising from the outside. When you start its not what you expected a lot of work and little compensation, They always want the most out of you and never give you any credit its a battle to move forward in the company. Employees for the most part hate their jobs."
bad,All is ok until your get pregnant and can't bend over backwards for them. Then they toss you to the side like damaged brake rotors! Not a good employer for aspiring women. They only want submissive women...
bad,"Can be a good place to work depending on which store you work in and for what manager you work for.  Hours are cut arbitrarily, pay fluctuates from paycheck to paycheck. HR issues not addressed in a  timely fashion. "
bad,"When I started with the company it was a wonderful and great place to work even though the pay was on the low end of the scale. A typical day could be very taxing at times because we were constantly under staffed but was the number 3 store of profitability in a region of some 10 stores. No two days were ever the same which added to the fun of working there. Management at first was good, but during the last 1/2 year there with changes that had been made management was anything but truthful and honest. Employees were abused and under constant stress for fear of being fired. Co-workers were some of the best to work with. Hardest part of this job was just keeping it. I really loved and enjoyed waiting on customers and solving their problems."
bad,I typically open the store in the mornings. I have learned all that is required to be in management. I have also been involved with training and interviewing new employees. The hardest part of the job is the unpredictability of the schedule. The most enjoyable part about the job are the customers.
bad,I am not at liberty to speak. AutoZone has an employee whose job is to monitor the net for unfavorable reflections of the company.
bad,my co workers were the best part of the job because we understood each other. hardest part of the job was getting along with the management team
bad,Autozone is the typical corporately owned venture. A high attrition rate of part time and full time employees is sometimes difficult to keep up with. It seems like your alway training someone while trying to keep up with demanding sales. Management at the store level is effective and fair. The ever increasing demand of upper managment for increase of proffit over decrease of overhead is a constatnt struggle.
bad,customers yelling at you for parts and they can't put things on or they want you to do it but management don't want you to go out to do what they say on the posters. some of your co-workers don't know what they doing. but they make your day when you are down.
bad,Only suited for those seeking part time employment. Must be able to multitask.
bad,I could write a book on this company. Overall there is hardly any supportive training.  Any questions I would have for my district manager were always referred to me speaking with another store manager for the answer as it became obvious they themselves didn't know the answers. The expectancy of what the company wanted and the budget didn't line up. Constant computer failures daily! It appears I have no more room to write
bad,"Very very corporatized. Auto zone does not care about their employees in the slightest bit,. All you are is a cog in their machine, they will do anything to make money."
bad,"The work isn't bad. The pay is. No raises to compensate for minimum wage hikes leaves managers making pennies above. Good hours, good staff culture. You will see every person imaginable. Things move slowly internally, don't expect much from upper management(store mgr and higher). Car folks are mostly good folks, save for a few bad apples. Two things you'll learn to hate if you don't already, thieves and liars."
bad,"I personally feel like it could have been one of my better jobs, unfortunately in the end they showed no care towards me. Almost 2 years of dedication not missing a day and covering for others, they kept me at part time ultimately leaving me with no paid vacation time after it should have been earned. After telling them about any mishaps with electronics for drivers, the driver will automatically be blamed for it. After being promised a promotion and raise, was given to another."
bad,Its a job that will not go anywhere but is a job. Admin just like any job have their favorites that do no wrong. Poorly organized an ran. I would only rec if u needed work for year or two. Heavy lifting fast pace.
bad,"Poor management, terrible hours for employees other than management. Bad pay, false promises. Expect the world from each employee but will only pay just above minimum wage."
bad,Costumes are priority and employees at least at store level are treated poorly. Management expects top notch service but does provide any of their own employees anything but a subpar pay check and a hard time. Incentives would be nice in conjunction with a sense of worth.
bad,"Autozone is a large cooperation, that varies in work environment between store locations. Though as a whole, they value the customer experience over anything else."
bad,"Upper management only cares about money. Taking care of the people manning their stores isn't even a consideration, no matter how hard you work for them or how many hours you put in."
bad,"Applied for the full time parts delivery driver position.  Was called by the Regional Mananger who offered an interview at another store, becuase the store I applied to had no manager.  I arrived at the other store, many miles away, and expected to be interviewed for the full time drivers position.  I was inforrmed that the interview was for a part time sales position and the full time position was filled.  It is a sham, or a farce...however you want to call it.  Mgt. in the store was decent because they want to keep turnover low, but if you have any sense or brains, stay away."
bad,Autozone focused mainly on promoting latinos within the store over everyone else. I worked there for 5 years and trained numerous people who became manangers....but i myself was never promoted
bad,"They added to the stress of the job ,by creating unnecessary test and tasks .. they being mgmt. And I was to get two weeks vacation after a year ,,not true got one week after 1.4 years and got screwed out of second week.. that's why I left unless desperate go elsewhere "
bad,"Working for autozone was a really bad experience. Managemente is usually losing their time on the phone. They gave a promotion to someone who doesn't really knew, about cars. The main manager prefers to get shouted and give merchandise instead of fight back because they say that client should leave happy the building."
bad,It would be a great place to work only if the pay matched the expectations. The pay sucks. To be a billion dollar company why aren't the employees paid better?
bad,"Have seen far to many employees completely clueless on auto repair & misinform customers & cost them more money than they needed to spend had they had proper information & guidance. On that note, for the low pay they offer they'll never get someone that knows the field."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working with AutoZone because the pay is not good enough it doesn't compensate you enough to live. Benefits aren't all that great! And too much favoritism
bad,They focus on keeping their pockets full they don't care too much about the employees if you don't reach daily targets for the day they cut hours sad.
bad,AutoZone has a tendency to overwork their employees and underpay them. Only certain people have to do their jobs while everbody else get to slack off. Management would allow this too.
bad,"If you're a man or a veteran, u advance without knowledge or experience. If you're a woman, even a knowledgeable woman, u will remain at the bottom of the totem pole & be treated like a second class citizen."
bad,"Autozone as a whole cares very little for their employees. Though things are kept to a smaller scale from store to store with the Store manager making the general decisions, the District Manager takes lead in the final decision. As the chain continues you begin to see very little concern for workers. The pay is fair for the work that you put in however it is never going to be enough to survive on as a single income unless you are in a higher position. Corporate consistently creates new things for you to do in which greatly interferes with productivity despite having the intention of making it easier. People who have never worked in a store are making decisions of how a store should be ran. Hours are greatly inconsistent and part times only receive a maximum of 4 hours per day with a very slight chance of extra hours to cover shifts. Full time managers house become even more erratic and leave no time for a personal life such as having you close one night and then open immediately the next day."
bad,"unorganized, very mismanaged at the higher level, managers plays favorites, hours not guaranteed, and hard works gets you no where and goes unnoticed."
bad,They treat there employees like replacement and they dont focus on the importance of customer service the are focused on there own agenda and they have alot of favouritism with members of management.
bad,"Some people acted as it was like high school drama, everyday I went to work never knew what kind of drama was going to be that day. I witnessed some accusing of somethings that were incorrect and never happened so anything that was implicated  was wrong. Which goes back to what I said different drama everyday,"
bad,"Working for autozone was alright. Learned some new things, and had some good customers. Location in city/neighborhood/state matters. I worked in an autozone in what most people would call ""the hood"", after a little while, I recognized that the location wasn't for me, got tired of dealing with non-related work/autozone/car/vehicle conversations."
bad,"This job was the worst. However it was only because of a store manager at the time otherwise, I loved the job that I did. I just found that it was very sexist both with other employees and customers."
bad,"Over worked at multiple locations in the Henry County area under paid and the manager refused to give me my 90 days raise, no one never mentioned giving me a performance evaluation."
bad,"I did not like this job and how i was treated, i was trained to be a manager and they never gave me it never got hours here. My manager was not to nice and didn’t schedule me as i would like."
bad,"It was worth a try. If you like an unbalanced life schedule, being underpayed, and being disrespected on the regular. Don't wear the wrong color black to work either as yes they have a dress code that they don't pay a penny to make possible but think you should. Kinda odd policies at AutoZone???"
bad,"Store managers and personnel are all fine for the most part, but their hands were tied by lame corporate policies and lack of support. Pay is as low as they can get away with, scheduling is sporadic and you are required to be completely flexible. Probably fine for someone who enjoys a fast paced retail environment, but with no palpable incentive for increased performance, or complying with their ridiculous up-sale requirements, the job wears on you."
bad,"They say they care about their employees, but they don't care if you make enough to live on, just look at the schedule they give you each week.  They will waste time training u and if u want more hours they will let you go than take care of u to keep a good person."
bad,"The manager is extremely disorganized, you are lucky to get your work schedule that starts on Sunday by Friday. You can never plan to get things done on your day off since you find out one day before the week starts.  Why not do a 4 week schedule?  Manager can never answer HR questions or get you the answer.  I have been waiting also one year to get a question answered about leave.   On the positive they do provide life insurance and disability at no cost to the employee.  Most days are very busy and I have worked at a few stores with good management and it makes a difference in how the store is maintained and how the employees feel about their job.  The managers should lead by example. You are told one policy only to learn later the policy was incorrect one year later"
bad,"culture is based around backstabbing,and snitching. "
bad,I haven’t had many jobs. Three to be exact but this was the worst out of the three hands down. Management system is so screwed up. I was in a situation with an assistant manager who disliked me because of reason outside of work and eventually was fired because of that. There system is they believe management minor workers don’t matter.
bad,"I don't know if the same goes for all departments, but the area I was in did not support you personally or professionally. The expectations were unreasonable, given the few available resources and lack of management involvement. Accomplishments go unacknowledged, and managers frequently took credit for my work. The PTO program is a joke, and you have to be employed for 13 years before receiving your 3rd week of vacation time."
bad,Na ....it was very hard to move up in the company as i felt that they only advanced men & not woman . they also barley gave hours.. I wouldnt not recommend if your a parent
bad,"The manager is extremely disorganized, you are lucky to get your work schedule that starts on Sunday by Friday. You can never plan to get things done on your day off since you find out one day before the week starts.  Why not do a 4 week schedule?  Manager can never answer HR questions or get you the answer.  I have been waiting also one year to get a question answered about leave.   On the positive sick they do provide life insurance and disability at no cost to the employee.  Most days are very busy and I have worked at a few stores with good management and it makes a difference in how the store is maintained and how the employees feel about their job.  The managers should lead by example."
bad,"I enjoyed the working at Autozone. It started off interesting, endless opportunities to learn something new, although career advancement with this company takes TIME. Alot of time. The cost of living is much more expensive than it used to be. I found it nearly impossible to live as a single mother. Only speaking for myself. I felt way over worked and under paid. Unappreciated."
bad,As soon as you were hired you want to quit you find out how they treat you once you're but you have no clue what's going on until that actually does happen by then it's too late you moved and settled and really uncomfortable stressful place to be They Ride you on performance delegation with no appreciation or compensation but is labeling as it being your job title so going above and beyond is nothing to that company but your job title
bad,"I worked for AutoZone for a bit less than a a year. I was a hub delivery driver and when I had spare time I was putting away parts and pulling orders for delivery routes. I was constantly moving, and there was never any down time. If i was behind schedule for my 3 trip a day route, I would only get a 5 minute break and sometimes no break at all. It was very high stress and way too little pay for what a single individual could accomplish. If I were to recommend this job to anyone else, i would advise to stay away from the hub if you're not ready to be on a constant move."
bad,Low hours. Very little to no increase in pay in over 2 years of service. No benefits offered to part time employees. Ridiculous expectations for productivity in a low economy area. overall disliked working there.
bad,i would consider Auto Zone a secondary job type of place the money is not great no place to make a living unless if your management . the customer i miss the most
bad,"Claims safety but forces selectors to move unsafely to meet production, so when the selector inevitably gets hurt, they point the finger and play the blame game. Overall advisors are just low boy team leads, although really nice and respectable, they lack actual work ethic and integrity. Ops management and the big boy on top are absolute tyrants. DC Manager hailing with the company for 30+ years, looks and talks to his very own employees as if they were a literal pile of uneducated garbage, and hes just a very very sad person to see exist. Overall i wouldnt go back, give me an A-Z!!!"
bad,I dont have to much bad t say about the job it was a good place to work and im still here they offer so mant things as far as paying for you to go to school
bad,the work is easy and straight forward and simple but the lack of quality managers is sad. constantly changing works hours due to lack of picking ect..
bad,"When I received hours it was fast paced, lots of work but not enough pay for the work we did.  Upper management was not consistant with information and unorganized."
bad,"Not really a place for advancement. Employees deserve more valuable recognition when it comes to location security, job security, healthcare opportunities, and as well career advancement."
bad,"Had I known it was going to take so much time from my family i would not have done it."
bad,"The hours are very little and not fixed, one day you close the next you open. They only hire part timers as to not pay benefits, no paid vacation. Very stressful most of the time."
bad,"They expect you to go above and beyond, but barely pay you enough to afford peanut butter and jelly.  They hire anybody, with or without auto experience, and pay them exactly the same.  The worst part is that you get stuck working with newbies who dont know the difference between two wheel drive and four wheel drive.  The schedules suck, the insurance is too expensive to be able to afford to use it, and they dont give any cares about how your work schedule effects your life, sometimes making you close one night at 9, then be there immediately the next morning at 7.  I have learned a lot about automotive parts, even though the customers treat you like you're barely above a trained ape.  the management is inexperienced, but understandable when they only make 10 dollars an hour.  Overall, this job is not worth it.  Even as a side job, you will be berated and treated like your life does not matter compared to the companies success.  look elsewhere."
bad,i had a very hard time with the mangers felt like i was picked on over and over again workplace wasent for me i was not comfortable where i worked. didnt get along with the mangers.
bad,dealing with rude customers was kinda hard  drove to different areas to drop off parts and saw alot of new faces. no gps sothat was hard finding places you didnt know the area
bad,"En entrevista con distrital te manejan un sueldo o expectativa economica para cuando eres MIT y otra para cuando sales del programa MIT, si te notan inseguro pero das el perfil te manejan que puede ser más, y que te vas a ganar los bonos trimestrales , lo cual ya enrolado es una mentira, no cumplen con el sueldo propuesto ya que estas a cargo de la tienda y los bonos trimestrales dependen de varios factores, por lo general no los ganas, las metas son altas y tienes que andas detras de los cajeros a diaro descuidando otras actividades."
bad,"Te da buena experiencia con customer service, y para aprender ingles es bueno porque tienes la oportunidad de practicar mucho con lo clientes. Pero en mi opinion no es un lugar para hacer dinero. Mucho trabajo y la paga es mala, en dos años alli no he tenido ningun beneficio, sola una tarjeta de descuento para comprar cosas con precios por las nubes."
bad,"Auto Zone does not care about their employees. Their turnover rate is extremely high because their company is a revolving door or employees. The work is hard, the customers are rude and the pay is little. There is little to no opportunity for advancement and there is strong favortism. How you actually perform at work had nothing to do with promotions, its all about who the boss favors. Wish I had never wasted my time learning their software and store.Such a waste of time and energy for a very little check and little hours."
bad,"dm, gave the company whom, still works for them, a bigger raise after telling me he would take care of me, when i had to play manager and driver. loved my job, never wanted to quit. wish to god he would have just bumped it up on the raise, id still be there"
bad,Mangers didn't work well together. Day to day was a struggle because of egos in the workplace. Workers weren't put in places most could succeed at. Most of all the training left many without the tools to be as productive as we could. Learning the job was more on the fly.
bad,"i absolutly enjoy work because of the clientel that ive built in my time in auto parts, i love being able to help hard working people like me solve their problems fast and the most economical price possible ."
bad,From when i started working there to when i eventually quit we had half of our work force quit because of unfair and lazy management who pushed 90% of their own duties onto everyone else.
bad,poor management very rude towards employees and not enough hours give as the said they would. needs better management other than that it was fine for someone who needs a part time job.
bad,Started as a very good career job . Company changed policy's and started downsizing managers as well as other department heads. Company became very stressful to work for.
bad,there were to many pt positions and not enough ft. there was no room for promotions for pay raises. The job wass fast pasted and required us to have a completely open schedule in order to recieve the hours that we wanted even if it was a day that we were not available
bad,"I started at Autozone when I was 19 years-old. I began my career as a part-time CSR (Customer Service Representative), and quickly decided that I wanted to stick with the company and work my way up. After about a year, I was promoted to full-time PSM (Parts Service Manager), and set my sights on Store Manager. I watched as many talented people were either terminated over meaningless issues, or left due to poor management. I stuck with the company, and a couple years later got the opportunity I had worked so hard for - Assistant Store Manager. At Autozone, you have 1 year as an ASM to prove you can run a store, or you'll be forced to step down. I was put in two different stores, both of which were incredibly high volume. The store manager's for the those stores were often taken away by the DM to help other stores, or to help out at the Hub locations - leaving me in charge. I proved myself, and was offered a store of my own. The store was located 35 miles from home, and went with traffic, so the drive would take me a minimum of 45 minutes - without traffic - and up to 2 hours one way. I was promised this would only last 6 months, but it lasted for 2 years. I often talked to my DM and RM about this, but they always gave me the run-around. After a year of doing this, dedicating anywhere between 12-15 a hours a day to the job (including drive time), I was beginning to wear out. My performance began to decline, tasks began getting behind, and soon the store was only hanging on through sheer will power of my own. No help was given, despite asking repeatedly."
bad,It's a good place to work as far as the people go. Compensation is very low for what you are asked to do. They never give full time drivers 40 hours a week and that's a shame because with what they pay it is necessary to work at least 40 hours a week.
bad,"I would come to work look at the daily to do list and get a plan together. I would assist customers and staff in all their needs ensuring the best possible experience i could."
bad,I had a great manager but they do not care about their employees like they claim at the orientation. My job was easy and not physically demanding. The problem is their chain of command!
bad,"Schedule was always different, less than 25 hours a week, low pay. Management did a terrible job at balancing work load between two shifts. Pay was very low, had to hold two jobs just to get by."
bad,Four store managers in 3 years. Current store manager delivers parts to commercial customers instead of minding the store. Never get consistent hours. Be ready to work 7am to 10 pm and anything in between on any given day. Bad for your health.
bad,"Poor work hours, low staff, no breaks, and bad management, constant re-location, unprofessional and bad work environment. stressful workplace, they don't show employees any appreciation. When a store manager doesn't want to help with anything, a store doesn't function correctly."
bad,"They would hire anyone with a beating heart with fingers, the company has the potential to be a well-oiled machine not saying Autozone doesn't generate revenue. it's just surprising the lack of knowledge and information you receive."
bad,"Your manager will feel your head with false hopes and dreams. Don't work too hard they'll just use you to their advantage with no compensation to you. May have to close and open the next day. Try to force associates to push small grease packets, fuel additives and other products but with no benefit to the employees. Only person your hard work benefits is your store managers bonuses and the higher ups."
bad,"Lower managers are overbearing, aragonite and power hungry, OTHER lower managers were , well picture an upper boss with his foot on your throat. upper managers are over bearing, uneducated as to the needs of the store managers and the maintenance department. it was ALL about the bean counters wants and needs. shameful. If I was the big boss, I would fire EVERYONE of them and start over with people, who care about people."
bad,Auto zone was just a part time job until I started at my main job now which is Boeing/Spirit Aero systems. It was a great stepping stone to get closer to my career goal.
bad,Very low job training and then put on the floor not knowing what you are doing. Very few hours and very stressful work place. No time to be properly trained and product knowledge
bad,management will fire you at the drop of a hat. no sick time. dirty. sweltering in the summer. freezing in the winter. managers will yell at you and try to make you cover for them
bad,"Unfortunately, this job is just a pay check.  Benefits are very expensive.  Very fast paced day in, day out.  The management with Autozone in Indianapolis, Indiana  are thinking only revenue.  The time I worked for Autozone, we went through 5 managers in just a year and half time."
bad,Management is very unprofessional & rude towards employees and customers. They want you to do extra work when the store is under staffed. The employee discount is nothing compared to discounts that customers receive.
bad,Autozone stays understaffed. Workload stays overburdened due to shortage of associates. Advancement in the company is minimum at most. Autozone does have benefits. Communication between management and associates is poor.
bad,"Worked there for about a month and a half and all I can say is wow.  Horrible management, not enough hours and very two faced when it comes to advancement.  Seemed like the managers did not want to to much other than talk to each other instead of working hard.  Not to mention I have a medical condition and I was not treated in a way I should have been when I was not feeling good at work that day, especially by the store manager...very unprofessional...Never again."
bad,This company has some good people that really care about their job and doing a good job for poor pay and hours.  Management need to understand that 30 minute lunch is not enough when you get some of the horrible customers that they get.  Scheduled hours also are not to be followed especially if someone calls out sick.
bad,my coworkers are amazing but autozone does things the wrong way. they dont care about employees they only care about money. not a fun place to work. HR is non existent in that company if u try to contact HR most likely the district manager will fire you ! District Managers pretty much do the schedule for all their stores .......
bad,"very little hours"
bad,They will use you as much as they can because they are constantly short staffed. They will have you doing things that you never thought was intended for someone in your position.
bad,"Low pay, zero to slim chance for advancement, a job I hated from the beginning, but took because of necessity.  I feel that it was a waste of my time to even be employed by this company."
bad,Management doesn't follow thru on hiring new people when they know people are leaving. Leaving more work for the current employees and they're raises are chincy and few and far between
bad,"Started out great, 40 hours a week easy. The company changed within the three years I was there and you could no longer get 40 hours a week unless you were a manager and I was a Assistant manager that meant my hours dropped as well. Left because hours for regular employees went from 40 hours a week to 23.5 and that was all you could get. No benefits!"
bad,"I understand there's good and bad with every job. I would like to say after working for this company close to four years as a part sales manager I worked at several locations throughout Michigan. I am very unimpressed with the way this company handle situations and treats their employees. The upper management treat the lower management and the ones that actually run the store operations throughout the day very unfairly. it's actually quite sad a lot of the staff try to work hard and also do the best they can to train new employees however the turnover rate makes this nearly impossible. most of the staff are under paid, it's sad to say but looking at it as optimistically as I can the bad definitely outweighs the good anymore! this company does not follow rules as they should Nor guidelines that are Underlined in their own book! I see a A lot of good people leave unfortunately they don't know how to keep good staff on hand instead they waste money with a lot of turnover.. they also allow limited hours and resources so that upper management can have larger bonuses. So all in all I wouldn't work here if I had the chance to again and I will be leaving as soon as possible."
bad,"I do not have anything to say about the job. It's cool, nothing special, could be better in vero beach. Would not go back to that one to work, maybe to shop."
bad,It was  mildly safe. Working here was ok. It was very boring and the people were not nice. Except m i k e. I would not recommend this job to any friends or family. I had long hours with minimum wage.
bad,"It's either for you or it isn't. Customers may or may not treat you like garbage. This job requires a lot of automotive know how. Fellow employees personal lives tend to conflict with work ethics, Loss prevention is a big thing, internal theft is even bigger."
bad,"The management for this company has favorites and I've been to different stores and experienced the way the employees are treated. I really think it depends on the area and DM you have in order to really enjoy working for this company. If you are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant, don't even think about working here. They will overwork you and give you less hours."
bad,"It can be a fun place to work however the way the DM's and RM's run the stores ruin that for anyone. Highest turn over rate i have ever experienced. Always tearing down employees and riding their back on issues ONLY the DM's and RM's can fix but are unwilling. There is no trust and when it comes to Human resources there is no privacy between the Human resource and employee on any matter. Completely in the open which goes against what the purpose of human resources is, confidentiality. Pay raises are lousy, under ran stores which keeps task from being done in timely manner. Customers walk out because of under staffed stores are. If the company really cared about the store and customers it could be a great place to work but sadly I do not see this happening. Its amazing how I have been able to tolerate it so long, i guess mainly a paycheck."
bad,"The company is a decent company to work for. However, management does not care of their employees, often times people are out doing things for customers that they ar not supposed to. A good thing is that it is not as hard as other companies to be promoted by merit."
bad,I would clock in and start stocking for the time im there. I learned more about vehicles. Management is poor no leadership skills.My co-workers are some of the best people i have worked with.The only hard part of the job was lifting heavy parts overhead.the best part of the job is to learn more about the vehicles.
bad,"Time would go by fast, learned how to diagnose vehicle issues by trial and error. Customers would think employees where mechanics wanting stuff installed."
bad,Company doesnt really appreciate its employees. doesnt stick to its core values the way they say they do. high turnover rate for employees who arrive. overall not much of a fun company to work for.
bad,"log on computer system to view previous day sales , look  at kpi's and look for areas to improve sales for that day. kpi's will afford me give me the opportunities to coach certain employees.Prepare deposits to be picked up by armored car courier  . Prepare for warehouse truck delivery and supervise truck unloading and shipping  out merchandise. look at store opening and closing procedures to make sure management staff have followed operating  procedures."
bad,"company hires people to run and don't know what  they  are doing, Very upset with head people.. store i was in wasn't bad people were nice and willing to work with you . its just  the higher people."
bad,"i learned alot working here. i learned car parts and how they work, installation of many parts, and chemicals that are good for your car. A typical day at consist of install batteries, headlights, taillights, wiper blades, and air filters."
bad,"Auto Zone needs to go back to the management style they had when I first started. That was when you got hired you had to have at least two years with them, before they would promote you to a store manager. Since then, they have gone to we going to hire from outside the company with no automotive experience and no knowledge of the Auto Zone culture. They became the Walmart of the automotive parts business."
bad,A stagnant company to work with for with little regard to the tenure system. Also the stores are over staffed with not enough hours to go around.
bad,"I learned a lot about cars and I crossed trained in many different areas, which was wonderful. I even learned some of the managerial work."
bad,"•	Develop deep product knowledge of tools in assigned functional area"
bad,the saddest company ever work forgo good for nothing no good for nothing they treat you like you were nothing
bad,"This job started off good. I was learning to talk more with people and more about parts. This job pushed me to learn more about cars so I can answer my customer questions. I worked very hard to become a manager, but my manger just kept hiring people off the street for the position. My manager wanted me to train the manager that were coming behind me. I wanted to move up, but he just held me back. I grew tired after working so hard for the position and still never succeed it. Then I resigned."
bad,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers with their needed auto parts, handling cash registers and keeping the work area clean and organized. Management was a little complicated situation due to favoritism and everyone feeling like no one wants to work as a team, especially the manager. My co-workers were always very helpful to an extent since Auto Zone customers are very hostile but i still dealt with it the best way i can, which was always being professional and courteous. I did acquire the skill of learning how to adapt to things pretty quickly. Every day i learned something new. Before I started working at Auto Zone i did not have any knowledge what so ever about cars or auto parts, but gradually i learned and made my way to the top when it became to sales and quotas."
bad,"The big boss are never happy. I run in the top of the whole company, every year and they are never happy. They always want more more more."
bad,A typical day at work increase my automotive knowledge and increased my management skills.Every day is a learning experience.the management was allways willing to help when a problem occurred.My co workers very helpful when needed.The lon hours are the hardest thing the most enjoyable thing working with others.
bad,"the management above the store level are rude, in the 6 years I worked there I only missed 8 days of work which was mostly death in family and 4 days in the hosp,"
bad,"Auto Zone was a good P/T. Co-workers are wonderful people to work with. Management take authority to serious and try to talk down to their workers, instead of just asking them to do their job."
bad,"The work is pretty standard retail, the people I was surrounded by were all down-to-earth, great folks. That is, until any sort of higher-up came through. These corporate-cultured fellows were the very opposite of down-to-earth. They'll pat you on the back with a smile on their face while telling you that they couldn't manage to get you that promotion or raise. The Company itself doesn't seem terribly interested in taking great care of its employees, they do just enough to keep up appearances. I hope the corporate culture of AutoZone and other companies with similar tactics soon goes the way of the dodo. Here's hoping."
bad,A typical work day consisted of analyzing paper credit applications with a tremendous number of them to analyze daily. The management team didn't value team input or opinions.
bad,I was on the travel side of Autozone and we were continually going to locations that were not ready for us to be there and then re routed somewhere else. It was very highly stressful.
bad,"Open store, dealt with early bird customers, made sure store was clean. learned about inventory,customer service and sales.management was not great most store manager throw all load on workers. co workers were awesome and fun people to be around. hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers who want it us to fix their vehicles when all we did was sale parts. Best part of the job was helping the people that needed it the most and meeting all types of customers."
bad,"If you know about auto repairs & troubleshooting, then this will be the most rewarding part of the job, if you also like helping people. Typical days revolve around setup, sales, inventory management and meeting goals set by upper management. "
bad,"Enjoyable meeting and working with the various shops and individuals in those shops. The hardest part is trying to diagnose automotive issues over the phone. Management is very indifferent to the rules and procedures, as long as you are making sales."
bad,the company upper management beyond the district manager did not seem to care for you they only cared if you made sales if not you were  cut hours based the previous 5 weeks. also they would order stuff based on the last 5 weeks average and send you that amount  example wiper blades say we sold 50 one week and only ten the other 4 weeks = 90/ 5 = 18 but you need the 90 to fill the shelves so we cant sell what we dont have which in turn is hard to make sales
bad,This job is okay its just that they need to give out more hrs than what they offer.
bad,"Pull parts, cashering, inventory planograms, answer phones and deliver auto parts"
bad,"Being harassed every morning for not being ""fast enough for phone orders, and order picking"" as customer requests."
bad,a typical day at work for me is clocking in checking to make sure the store is clean help coworkers with customers. i learned about the diffrent parts and tools. my hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting off work.
bad,It was a fun job for awhile but every 3 months or so a new store manager would come in and also a new distric manager. Also some of the customers were not friendly
bad,"The AZ Corporate retoric is wonderful, & having toured the Corp. offices in Memphis, I do believe that they are trying their best to attain a very good working environment... The District managers, make the corporate desires almost impossible to achieve at the local levels however, & there is much pressure put on the Individual Store Managers, which then trickles down to each employee, thus making it a pressure-filled environment that is very difficult to manage in a possitive way & keep any kind of motivation in place to do well."
bad,"I wrote the schedule, interviewed prospective employees, waited on customers, maintained inventory, and recorded deposits. I was an assistant manager and the management above me pressured me just as they were being pressured. My co-workers were at best quirky but good people. The hardest part of my job was working up to 20 extra hours a week with out compensation. The job was not really enjoyable."
bad,the job is a great place to start out but not the place to advance in an career.
bad,"was good working for them in the beginning, but after awhile, you saw that advancing required being in tight with the manager."
bad,Made good money but my direct boss was hard to get along with and didn't listen. Used all kind of language that I didn't agree with along with made you look bad in front of co workers.
bad,"I worked there for about 3 years and not once did I get a promotion. I got a pay raise but it was only a 10 cent pay raise. The only thing they have that is good go for them is that if your full time you get health benefits, but if your part time your screwed."
bad,Employees are disposable. Salaried employees expected to work six days a week.  Pay poor for hourly employees. It`s all about numbers generated in memphis and not at the local level.
bad,I work for this company for 14 years. And I learned a lot from former employees. In the Automotive Industry. The company is not a good company to work for. I was look over . Many times for promotions. When I knew my job very well. If you don’t kiss 💋 up to the management. You will not succeed at this company.
bad,Working here had it's ups and downs. Things definitely could be a lot better! I also liked the challenge and the new element I was in because I had never been in a auto position before.
bad,"I have nothing to say, it's a job to make a paycheck, dont let the gossip and headaches ruin family life. Its retail and upper management will continue to remind you of that"
bad,"Good place to learn about automotive parts and diagnostics. "
bad,a typical part store not different from the others. most people will enjoy working here from the things you can learn to the programs they have to get signed up for.
bad,It pays ok how ever you are busy running around and have to run outside no matter the temperature which could be an inconvenience for health reasons being you don’t get any benefit or health insurance through the company
bad,At my location my boss was awesome and fun to be around. Pay was awful and tons of turn around. If the pay was better it would Be worth staying long term.
bad,"Tienes un buen ambiente laboral, lamentablemente el ciclo de vida de los trabajadores es lento"
bad,During my first two weeks of working there one of the managers pulled me into the office and touched me inappropriately and wouldn't let me leave. When I informed management I was told I wouldn't be treated any differently. The manager that touched me lost his job and then shortly after all my hours were cut back slowly until I was was only at 8 hours a week (once 30) and all talks of making me a manager stopped. One day I went in and they said my services were no longer required.
bad,"As a part sales manager for Auto Zone, I was responsible for driving sales at my particular location, including conceptualizing sales strategies to meet certain sales quotas. I was also responsible for working hand in hand with the commercial sales department in order to meet sales quotas by augmenting them with commercial sales. Although I enjoyed the customer interaction, compensation was very poor. Upper management was also corrupt."
bad,"There offer stuff and never doing that what offer you, the lack of compromise to the employees it’s absurd. The pay it’s terrible I start a 8.75 a hour, you have to work a lot for that miserable pay, a raise opportunity came on and when you ask for the money in the position it’s 10 a hour, that’s below any retailing job right now. Bad experience I lost I good job for this company."
bad,"job sucked: there was many heavy car parts to lift up, the hours were long and boring, answering the phone sucked when it was super busy. super sexist men came in all the time. not a good work experience"
bad,"Autozone have an extremely high turnover rate. Understand your just another number there. I was hired specifically for 1 store, the very next week, that store manager told me I wasn't on his schedule and that I'd have to find out what store schedule I'm on. Never experienced something like that before. There is some advancement there but it depends on your role. I was a driver,which meant, no real advancement there. I ended up leaving because within 2 months, I worked at 3 different stores, and eventually I had to take them to court for worker's comp. I was rear ended one day while on the clock, and AutoZone didn't want to pay my bills. I won my case, and agreed to never work for the company again. All in all, it is a job, which is fairly easy to do, drive and deliver parts. But the company itself is horrible."
bad,"Payroll hours depended too much on sales. When sales numbers go down, salaried workers such as me took the brunt of the work because hourly workers hours were cut. It's not a surprise that customer service is non-existent in these establishments."
bad,"The pay raises were awful, the leadership above store management was Machiavellian at best. I was told less than the truth by my DM about a work injury, told to not come in the back door by a Commercial DM while he was on his cell phone texting. If you REALLY NEED a job and the money, this is the place. It is stable and predictable. Your experience will be dictated by your manager and DM. I was fortunate to have an excellent store manager."
bad,"You know, when you really excel at your job and know more then others? Put more of an effort to get things done? Well guess what you get a 20 cent raise after a year. On top of working an unset schedule that changes every week. You never know what days you will and won’t work. Well join autozone then if that sounds like a place for you."
bad,Never received pay raise worked for over a year. Other employees were lazy. No one cared to keep store in a well maintained manor except store manager.
bad,"Company never sees you as a person, just as a number in their system.  They make you buy your own uniforms and expect you to buy more when they get dirty.  Turnover rate is way too high and I would get called into work alot because people would just quit without giving any notice."
bad,I have to work too hard and too much for what I get paid I deserve more and will be leaving soon if I don’t get it I have other job offers and if they can’t compete with the pay I’ll be at Napa or advanced auto
bad,It's a decent company. The pay is not great and some of the management is highly unprofessional. And will take full advantage of you. Or you will struggle for hours depending what store your working at
bad,"Horrible management. They assign you a truck for a run, then it turns out to be in the shop or red tagged w/no replacements. There’s supposed to be a manager available 24/7 (on call at night) & they never answer their phones. One manager in particular is a micromanaging idiot who has absolutely ZERO experience in trucking & can barely manage his dinner plate."
bad,"Cannot advance unless you are young and speak spanish."
bad,Never enough employees to handle the high traffic. Upper management expectations are unattainable in regards to add on sales. High stress physical labor without any pay increase if sales goals for year are not met no matter the circumstances.
bad,Check delivery vehicles help customers  on the phone and in person also stock and deliver while replacing head lights in the rain in the dark while making minimum wage
bad,"I was a very good employee that was always dependable and reliable when ever I was needed to perform my duties,loved the people but the people had a different aspect on the work environment and for that reason I had to leave the establishment behind"
bad,Not really any room for advancement. Low pay. Have to work like a dog just to even be noticed. They will call you on your days off and manipulate you to come in
bad,"O job training, they tell you their going to train I didn't see any new employees trained once,  break's no break's ,  schedule not constant. I say worst company ever worked for, Auto Zone bad Management  any way the store in Los Lunas"
bad,Pay suck. Very stressful for the pay. I wish I could speak better of this place but they work the good workers to the ground. I’ve been here for 4 years and I have gotten a total of a $1 raise
bad,"I was actually pretty excited getting to work at a parts counter for a change but this was not what I expected. The customers there are the most rude, entitled people I have seen in my many years of customer service. They either think they know everything to an exhausting point or they are clueless and angry at the parts person because they don't know what they're looking for. Having actual auto knowledge hurts more than helps with most customers. My biggest gripe however was the amount of employees hired that would not know (brake) shoe from potato. I understand its a part time job but this is the reason why every store has that regular older mechanic customer that has been shopping for years and laments at the way the service has gone down. Hard to agree with the old saying but at the end of the day you walk out feeling like a button monkey."
bad,"Bad management. Horrible district manager name is rj. The job is easy they tell you , you will move up the ladder but you will get stuck with the same low pay you started with because of poor managment"
bad,"This company does not care about employee culture , only sales. You can work as hard as you want, and a new hire will get the promotion before you. Hours are based on sales which they train you to lie for."
bad,"Minimum wage, work weekends, stacking parts, test greasy motors, go out test peoples cars, replace parts. schedule is made three days before it starts. Different hours and start times every week. Did i mention minimum wage."
bad,Good job if you are a people person but dont look for alot of praise or advancement. Like some of employees but dont try and be friends with people you work with.
bad,"Es una muy estable y colaborativa compañía, lo que deja mucho que desear son sus mandos medios, carecen de ética y congruencia respecto a las políticas que la compañía enarbola, esto redunda en una alta rotación de personal (ya que el culpable, siempre es el empleado nuevo; sea por inexperiencia o inaptitud); es la versión mexicana de una gran compañía, plagada de contradicciones.Deberian ser más instrospectivos, no todo en la vida es dinero o ganancias, ni es correcto sacrificar o destruir las carreras de buenos empleados sólo porque alguien se siente superior a otros."
bad,Offers almost nothing in benefits requires 12 months of fulltime working to qualify for fulltime status. Says they promote within and have yet to see one manager that wasnt hired from outside of the store
bad,Did to personally  medical issue I had to leave but management wants impossible things for one person to do and not want to get more worker to do it ..
bad,Sales targets are set high and you are hassled because they want you to upsell something when the customer doesn't want it. They would much rather hire in a person from another parts place for management that hire up their own employess.
bad,"My time at Autozone has not been the best. I do not receive fair treatment compared to other managers, I'm expected to work 12 hour shifts with no breaks. The higher up managers do nothing to help with task, there is usually myself and one other person doing all the work while 3 other staff members stand around, comment on us, and whatch us work. I would highly recommend asking one of the redshirt employees how is the environment there before applying for the job."
bad,"Autozone is one of those types of places where you could possibly move up but is is highly depending on who is your upper management. If you put your best foot forward and put forth above maximum effort there is a major possibility that it can be overlooked. Not to mention the politics that go on are no help, and a lot of things trinkle down and are more of a blow to morale when it happens in a store that in undermanned."
bad,McDonalds pays more for half the stress. What you're asked to do is beyond the pay grade especially when the store manager makes 3 times as much as you for doing 2 more things more than a psm.
bad,It was just the store manager and the sales associates.  They rather hire an outside person than giving an associate the opportunity to grow within the company.
bad,"Store Managers, for the most part, are completely useless. PSM's run that company. Pay scale is low for what is required of you. Hours are ridiculous especially if your store is short on people or has a store manager that stays high."
bad,"Typical big business that does not care about its employees.  Their only focus is on making money and everyone is expendable.  If you are looking for a job, find somewhere else."
bad,"There is absolutely no job security there. Autozone doesn't care about their workers and is more concerned with them using their discount to help family members out. I was made to spraypaint my shoes because there was a little bit of white on them, which is against dress-code. You can be scheduled 40+ hours yet be part time, so no overtime or benefits can apply to you. Upper management acts most elite."
bad,seems like with every passing year they expect more of you and give you less time to do it. seems like they promote people that talk more over people that actually work
bad,I really didn’t like the managerment there it’s a nice play to work there if u need parts n like working on car cuz everyone need they car fix. The day will go by quick there
bad,"Pros- "
bad,Work too hard for the corporates and no money for employee. A lot of employee and upper management turnover . Sales force Required to work on weekends
bad,"productive work place, thought this would be the company that I retired from. but the department i worked in, didn't believe in promoting within. I worked very hard, a team player, dedicated and dependable"
bad,The worst place to work in my experience they never cared about you they only look out for themselves and don't even consider how far you live. It's all about them
bad,"I was hired for a part-time driver opening at a local store, but I hadn't been there a week before I was asked to transfer to another store.  For $9.50 an hour I had to answer the phone, help customers, stock shelves, sweep and take out the trash, in addition to delivering parts to auto shops.  I talked to my manager about resigning, but he suggested I just transfer.  So I went to a hub store and became a hub driver, because that's mostly all you're expected to do.  The job itself was not that bad, although it was hot during summer and the routine became monotonous.  The scheduling was horrible.  I ended up working every Saturday, and then different days the rest of the week.  Each driving run was about 3 hours, and the shifts were about 9 hours total 8:30 to around 6:00 (the company schedules everyone for an hour lunch).  Then, management decided to change our start time to 6:45 a.m., so that we would have time during the day to do stocking.  This increased the total shift to anywhere from 10 to 12 hours.  We started losing people, and even though I was part-time there were some weeks where I worked 40 plus hours.  If a driver calls in sick, they call you at home on your day off to fill in for them.  I was called probably 10 times on my days off during a 6 month period.  Most of the co-workers were pretty nice, but a few people hazed me.  It seemed like we were always short-handed, and they had problems finding people to work there."
bad,"It was an alright place to work at. Most of the culture in this place is about receiving a grey shirt and becoming  ""important"" . The views of this place to work are full of meritocracy."
bad,The workplace environment is no better than high school.  Management talks a great game but is either unable or unwilling to back up their talk.  Constant behind the back talk and consistent threats of being fired make it a hostile work environment.  Change of management would go a long way in making it a better place to work.
bad,"I was hired at $9 hr to deliver parts, but they had me answering phones and waiting on customers the second day I was there. I didn't mind installing batteries or wiper blades, but having no training with the computer system to find the correct part, or knowing how to cash out customers (etc) created a stressful atmosphere. The employees I worked with were great, especially the commercial manager....but the man in charge was not. I have since left Autozone and would not recommend to anyone looking for just a delivery job, to seek employment here."
bad,"Commercial Sales Manager is responsible for driving the commercial sales within their AutoZone location. The CSM develops and maintains positive relationships with commercial customers by managing the acquisition and delivery of products, providing ongoing customer service, and maintaining expert knowledge on parts and inventory."
bad,Autozone teaches a lot about vehicles. I still learn new things on a daily basis. Its a good job for people entering the work force. It has a lot of learning experiances.
bad,"Manual work, no time to slack off. Depending on the position you get you will be picking orders all day. Walking down isles and pulling product. Easy job just have to remain constant with pace."
bad,"AutoZone is ok only if you want to learn about cars and need temporary work or you want to climb up into career management, my issue was i was hired at minimal wage (not competitive pay) with no insight on how to work to increase my wages, under staffing DM was bonus conscious so he keep busy nights to a minimum of 2 ppl total which lead to safety concerns, safety wasn't a priority to DM, many nights of 2 emeployees vs 8 - 12 customers in store at one time, with 2 working had to perform outside services leaving 1 a manager inside alone to multiple customers knowing he he to go pull parts from back leaving store not monitor including office, customers waiting for 30mins to 2 hours for a battery change, all at the same to you must restock clean and front face the store before leaving. If this sounds like fun to you then apply today."
bad,"	Auto repair sales by multi-line phone calls and good customer services."
bad,they liked to pick favorties to move up in the company based on friendship not hard work treated emplyies very poorly some store managers had no proper work ethic
bad,not a bad place to work for but they don't pay enough for what they make you go thru. They tend to choose favorites at this place so if you don't get along with someone it could be a problem.
bad,"AutoZone's culture was cutthroat. They offered some opportunities to certain people. There were days when this was one of the hardest job I ever had, but other were enjoyable.  I would recommend AutoZone to any young motivated person."
bad,They rather keep and give people that don’t do much  opportunity  Then actally people that do everything. They don’t keep up with sales they don’t keep there word they tell you something and wount do much
bad,Routine day of coming in to work 11 hour days. Helping up to 30-40 customers an hour fast pace physical and psychological work. Fixing customers problems by replacing part or giving professional advice. Building a group of employees to a profitable company.
bad,"All AutoZone employees, except for the store manager, are severely underpaid. The average pay (which is usually around minimum wage) is not equally representative of the amount of responsibilities and job duties that ""AutoZoners"" have. For example, employees are required to install car batteries, headlights, brake lights, wiper blades, test batteries, test alternators, test starters, check OBD 2 engine trouble codes, help customers find parts, answer store phones, cashier, clean the store, and stock the entire backroom and front of store. Also employees must have vast knowledge of car parts in order to be a good employee. Many times customers will come to the store like if we're mechanics. "
bad,working for auto zone was a great experience but not something anyone would like to do long term unless you became a store manager. You do learn a lot about  vehicle maintenance as time goes on.
bad,It is a horrible place to work you will not advance you will get a raise but your looking a 11 cents for the year you get worked like a dog so much so that the IRS kills you in taxes.
bad,"The environment is harsh. Angry customers, internal theft, and narrowminded management.  On the positive end, there is so much information available for the employees to learn about automobiles"
bad,"Most managers don’t care about anyone but themselves and will sometimes hire their friends even though it’s forbidden. They also will allow the store to look like garbage all the time and just blame the employees for it or make them do tasks the manager is responsible for. Blame shifting is also present. Some managers show unprofessionalism frequently and yell at customers sometimes. Schedules are never posted which leaves employees with no way of knowing their own schedule. Honestly, when you think of a bad manager that’s identical to the managers at autozone. Even new managers get offered to manage their own stores within a few months. "
bad,"I was an ASM and and one point in time loved my job. I don’t blame the company as a whole. In my particular store, only the SM could hire and fire staff. Therefore, when you have incompetent people that won’t work you are left to do everything on your own. The most enjoyable part was my customers. The most irritating part was listening to a loud mouth commercial manager that couldn’t get his sales to match his ego."
bad,"It's a job where you can get stuck pretty easily, there's no much advancement you can do. Salary it's bad. They employ a lot of part-time jobs which causes problems with the work hours for part-time employees. Only benefit of working it's a 20% discount card on any purchase that doesn't already have a ""special offert""."
bad,"Ever heard the expression ""This job wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the customers."" That's AutoZone in an nutshell.  They keep wanting to push products the customer does not want but management never wans to hear about how much the customer not want them  And they like to pit the stores against each other with selling contests even though the stores that do well often cheat to make themselves look good."
bad,"I work at multiple stores and I noticed the way that some store are run. Some do not care about store appearance or any protocols. Others did, those managers that cared, made the store and the experience so much better!"
bad,"day consisted of helping customers with their vehicles. selling parts and installing certain parts on cars. you work out side in all conditions. open everyday,"
bad,"Assistant manager then parts manager. "
bad,"I was working a full 30/40 hours a week when i first start at auto zone. I stayed when as and left later than needed. After a while my hours got cut to 7 hours a week and when my wife went to the hospital for internal bleeding during a pregnancy, they removed me from the schedule and told me i was fired when i called for the next weeks schedule, they didn't even have the nerve to call me. When i said i had the hospital notes. The store manager then told me bring the paperwork in and they could see what they could do but ti would be 3/4 weeks before the HR got back to me about coming back to the schedule, an it wasn't Guaranteed  that they would hire me back."
bad,"Good Place to work. Work Starts with hcustomer services and finding and aiding whatever partscustomer needs. Customer Expects you to be a ""Mechanic"" and fix their cars. Customer gets mad when other issue than part that they came looking for. Start off by testing battery, starting, and charging systems. Making sure all arts are restocked on sales floor constantly."
bad,The Manager is a clueless 23 year old with a point to prove that he is king S**t. Cant be botherted to train his new manger or answer his phone when anyone calls him for help.
bad,never have any problem no body i came to work do what i suppose to . and focus on the task as hand. i was apart time position so i did not received any benefits
bad,"I was eager to work for them, but was quickly disappointed.  They pay minimum wage and would not promote unless you were bi-languagel.  I worked hard but was always overlooked."
bad,"Not my favorite place, Long hours, rarely got a lunch break, due to the neighborhood low quality of clientele. Store manager was lazy and passed the buck as often as possible"
bad,"Hourly associate pay is good with good benefits. The management is TERRIBLE and rude!! The DC Manager is very rude, advisors are lost and confused. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Talk a good talk about a good culture, but don't display it at all!"
bad,I wouldn't really recommend autozone to anyone. Its a poorly manage job. If curious in auto sales O' rileys is your place to go. Overall autozone is a very bad job to have.
bad,It was great to start but went downhill relatively fast. Women are discriminated against and made to do jobs that are hard while men stand at the counter and more or less make fun of said woman that could use a hand from the men standing around doing nothing
bad,"It's okay if you want to have this position as a ladder rung to hold on for a better job.  Don't expect to advance much within this company.  Much expected, little given."
bad,Customers above all else. Customers have slowly been taught that they can raise their voice and get what they want. Even at the expense of getting employee in trouble .
bad,"You have to upswell everyone. No matter how good you do it's not good enough. The upper management does not care about you, only care about their bonus."
bad,"They hire people with no knowledge of the trade, and don't promote based on knowledge or work ethic. It's based on selling, even if parts are unnecessary or wrong. It should be based on selling according to the customers needs"
bad,It is a good job to have if you're in high school or don't intend looking for advancement. Very dead-end. Very apathetic management at every store I've visited.
bad,"The Daytona Beach location was in a ""low income"" area and thus plagued with angry, often drugged up or drunk customers. People ran illegal ""repair"" shops out of the parking lot. Often when performing maintenance on customers vehicles, would find used needles. Management was a joke, and ignored any suggestions on changes or management techniques. Employees often did drugs on the job. Some flat our refused to work, but were never reprimanded for that behavior. Requested time off was often denied."
bad,Convincing people to fix cars themselves and try to provide the parts they need to do for them. Ordered parts and worked spontaneous hours to be able to pay my bills.
bad,"Company has a great foundation. On the other hand managers get complacent and don't care very high turn over of employees witch let customers down, customers want to feel at home and confident in the abilities of the person helping them . I still would shop there the warranties are unbeatable. The main problem is store managers the are rewarded greatly and employees never feel good they get to see all the big rewards the people above get and have to live on little pay"
bad,"I do not wish to review my stay at auto zone, or its culture, as pertaining to my employment there.The opportunity that was presented to me not as I expected."
bad,"En verdad me toco un equipo de trabajo pésimo y muy hostil, de echo las razones por las cuales renuncie fue por el mal trato de parte de los supervisores"
bad,the manager of the store has support to the employees... in short the store manager is lazy!short staff and the work is so stressful.... and the manager that i worked with is not willing to work overtime.
bad,They work you like zombies for minimal pay and once you advance they do what they can to push you out! Only full timera get vaca...good luck getting dull time when they only hire part time.
bad,I was promised many different things but they never came true and no matter how hard I worked and no matter what I did my raise wasn’t enough I got a 3% raise while others who stood around on there phones got paid more then me
bad,they have to pay attention that high auto mechanic can try to up sale  if his honesty wont let him I was overrun by somebody that was stilling from the compaby
bad,"Pays great"
bad,"I learned that this company has its good stores and bad.  I moved to this area to help open he new store in Procorville, OH.  Although I learned much about the company I would not recommend working there."
bad,"Autozone csr position consisted of assisting retail customers on counter with parts,advice,recommendations and part time driving on busy days..slower days were mostly restock days.."
bad,"This company pays little and has no respect for its employees. They are always pushing you to sell products to customers that they don't want or need. As an employee they expect you to be a customer service/assistant, parts lookup, automotive diagnostic, stock and receiving, janitor and anything else they can get you to do."
bad,"i enjoyed this job but the management was poor and advancement was very low. i witnessed the store manager hired a new sales associate and then within a few weeks promoted him to part sales manager and knowing that i had more knowledge with the system and automotive as well. he wasn't very nice to the customers either. due to his poor choice to promote the wrong person, sales dropped and we also had our hours cut which i could not be able to support myself and family with a pay cut like that."
bad,"It was a good job, had good employees. an a good manager, just had to relocate for school so im looking to get another job something more slow paced an with a scehedule that can work around mine with classes"
bad,"Not a happy place, fast paced sometimes slow. Lack of respect and good advancement opportunities. Cut throat upper management. Salary is a joke and no proper training."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone work for Autozone because they do not know how to protect their employees.They do what's best for them instead of the people that makes the money for them.
bad,I really did not enjoy the company its was poorly managed. no direction and  information always given. salary was poor for the manager role and hours were very long.
bad,my manager would blame other employers it was very sneaky working there you could not trust anybody there they would pass blame on other people to get out of there own mistakes
bad,It depends on where you are in life at 25 auto zone wasn't the place for me it's not a bad beginning but if your trying to move ahead in life it's not the place to be
bad,Big place a lot of space we work until 8:00 am until 3:00 pm we had short lunch breaks and long hours. The pay was awesome we made $13.00 hrs for 8 hours a day
bad,"customer service. dealing with customers who ask meaningless questions over and over expecting different responses. management constantly complaining about poor performance, and never complimenting good performance"
bad,"This job does not require you to know a great deal about auto parts. They train you in that field. this is more retail than anything else. They cut hours if you are not selling but wait there's more... they do NOT pay you commission  for what you sell whether youre selling a lot or a little only the store manager gets a cut. unfortunately the store manager i had was awful she never helped and was always in the office doing ""paperwork"" yet our schedule was always jacked up. Plus she would cut hours and then have the store understaffed when we had people that needed hours it never made sense. Also if you are looking for fullltime look elsewhere they will start you off at part time for a while until you either brown nose or just sell sell SELL. Id say go to oriellys"
bad,"This job can be fun and there is a lot of things to be learned, unfortunately my experience was not the best due to management and the ratio between responsibility and paid salary. The job it self is really fun. Any individual can learn just about everything about cars but also consider that there is a great deal of up sale, I personally do not mind it, but it is not for everyone."
bad,"very sexist as far as the customers and employees. Its hard working there as a woman. Their were a lot of challenges i had to over come to survive as long as i did. The only thing positive i can suggest, that if you love cars everything about them ins and outs that's the place to be."
bad,At the beginning when I started working as a commercial driver and customer service it was ok but not perfect. There is always more and more work some co workers did not even do their jobs a racist place to work!
bad,Dont want to talk bad about any business.................have nothing to say............get in the zone.......................nothing else to say about autozone
bad,location where I worked did not have security and it was not a fun environment to work at. Would not recommend this work place at least not at the location where I worked
bad,Poor pay . high turnover of employees. Unorganized.not very flexible schedualing. Doesnt offer very good benefits . doesnt offer good traoning for new management and staff
bad,"As a salesman I worked the floor stocked items front faced products and test batteries, I rang up customers and looked up various auto parts on the computer and told where to find them, I performed OBDT test as well on vehicles."
bad,"a typical day at work was sales sales sales, how much money you could earn for the company not what the company could do for you"
bad,"At autozone, there are more managers than assosciates.  The store that I work for has a manager that severely lacks integrity.  The store manager is salaried and yet he refuses to pick up the slack when the company needs him to.  He is the first one to put the responsibility on everyone else.  The company itself does not offer one on one training when hired.  The leader of my store is the laziest employee there."
bad,"Worked there for 4 years. Never was able to move up, always hired out for open positions. No bonuses  or compensation for all the extra selling they want us to do"
bad,"Working at Auto Zone is not the ideal job for someone who has a family. The hours are undependable. The schedule is made and then later changed and even when a person has days off, the management team texts and calls (with no compensation for hourly management) and calls employees in last minute. You cannot plan anything because of this. Management skills are also poor. The manager yells, screams, and cusses at employees during meetings and in front of customers. He criticizes employees in front of customers as well. The employees do not have a positive morale and it shows in their customer service."
bad,Muy buena empresa muy buenos balores pero muy mala administracion
bad,My experience here is aweful i hated working at autozone i was the only spanish speaker so i did most of the talking to spanish customers and the other employes dont know anything about cars they sell a bunch of junk that breaks but has a warranty to back it up pay isnt great and people should tip but thats not allowed by the company but i installed a heavy dangerous battery in your car getting minimum wage basically you stop caring about the company and the Customers
bad,"Another generic retail company. Not a lot to say. Middle management has their eyes upward, except when something goes wrong. Upper management seemed to not care. Standard operating procedure for store level. Demand more productivity while slashing hours. Not the worst retail company I've worked for, and not the best."
bad,"It was a good place of employment, and the people i worked with, we did not have a in store manager for most of the time i worked there ti'll Corparate came and starting to change are routine we built to keep store running well. People started quiting Hiring employees that did'nt need to be working in a auto parts inviroment and is the reason i quit and moved on cause of managment changes."
bad,If you have a interest in cars then this is the place for you. Okay place to work. You get one on one time with customers and there cars.
bad,I had the worst experience working for AutoZone. I experienced the death of mother and my manager did not allow me to leave to take care of my family business. Then when I had to bury my mom I was threatened with termination for not making it to work. I will not and never will ever work for a company like that again. They do not take care of their employees and do not treat them fair. AutoZone is a SLAVE Driver!!!
bad,"Worked there for 2 years as parts sales manager, then promoted to a store manager. Moved to accommodate this, which they did not want to pay for, but even said they did on the website. Was store manager at 2 different locations. Thought this was going to be my career, I put 120% into everything did there. Had shrink awards, extra-miler awards. Won a lot of challenges they had. Bottom line, I made a mistake w/ a check out challenge (which is forceful selling) they terminated me on that. 8 years and they just tossed me aside like nothing. Even though I increased sales month to month and year to year. Also had meets and exceeds expectations on all my evals there. Did not stop them from just kick me to the side."
bad,when I come to work it is usually something to do but after half your shift of a ten hour it is slow and you have a high chance of getting send home. which in turn you are lose money that you use to take care of yourself .management is hard to work with at time make job difficult when it is simple.
bad,"You are not allowed to have a life outside of Autozone. You work enough to have two full time jobs but only get paid for one. As a parts sales manager the pay is not the best but the hours are more flexible. The store can only hire drivers over the age of 21 and yet are not willing to pay much more than minimum wage, or for people who need full time jobs. This leads to a very small pool of applicants who are willing to work for the company."
bad,"I have worked there a little over a year and was considered part time on paper. Which meant no benefits, holiday pay, ect that the full time employees got. However, there were weeks I put in 40+, some days working 14 hours. Its never been appreciated , the extra time and hard work I pour into this company. They could careless, and see their part time employees as irreplaceable at any time. Even though i did manager stuff, and worked my butt off there. Definitely an unprofessional, unappreciative company who punishes and cuts an employee's hours/relocates them...all for a store managers harassment!!"
bad,"A typical day at worked is helping customer answer questions as well as any and all other needs for car parts, fluids, bulbs, ect. I learned how to give great customer service. Management was unfriendly and rude. My co-workers were amazing individuals that i learned everything from. Management was no help. The hardest part about this job was dealing with my manager. The most enjoyable was helping customers and working with amazing co-works."
bad,Learned a lot new skills and got to develop new relationships with clients and coworkers. Developed my communication and written skills and also got to develop my problem-solving skills
bad,"I was promised a Parts Sales Manager job, right I was suppose to supervise the red shirts, my first day was stocking parts, not training as a parts manager, right from the start I was mislead, management stinks, they are always on vacation, the other gray shirts boss the new gray shirts around, no communication, none of this job has been enjoyable. Bad Bad place to work, too stressful. I have been here 1 month and was thrown to the wolves to close the store with no training to be signed off first."
bad,Auto Zone is a nice place to work. It does have limited outlook for their employees. I worked in a Houston store when red shirts(non-management  people had more hours and were full time employees and had benefits. The Eunice store was pat-time employees with no benefits and had a  few hours.
bad,"From punch in to punch out the day is full of the unavoidable stress of the job but also the unnecessary stress of drama, disorganization, and poor management. Individuals are not cared for by the corporation and are made to feel guilty when asked to be thought of more than just a number. Opportunities to advance are available, however they are usually not given to those who deserve it most, and promotions from the inside are hard to come by. Multiple times other managers have been moved into stores, or new hire ons are made managers instead of those individuals already in the company. Tasks are focused on way too often and customer satisfaction, although preached, is not always number one. Employees are not protected by the company the way they should be and are not taken care of regardless of how often an individual takes care of the company."
bad,Not a very skill involving job. I would recommend this as a beginners job to just gain experience only as a temporary job.
bad,This job is what it is. No growth and if you don't come in higher than a shift manager that's pretty much where you stay. Shift manager's get the butt of everything.
bad,"Worked at the distribution center for less than a month. Shifts were 12 hours and I was not able to keep up. Worked 8pm to 8am,"
bad,"I started working here in 2013 as a part time red shirt. Here is what the daily life of a autozoner looks like.. You clock in.. Help customers, of course, and work on to do lists in between. You are basically forced to sell recommended items and check-out challenge which wouldn't be so bad if that would benefit us in any way. There are no incentives.. You work for minimum wage because this muti-billion dollar company is that cheap. You do not get any commission. You get one paycheck every two weeks of minimum wage. Yet you get yelled at for not offering a recommended item.. Oreilys gives some sort of incentive based on monthly sales.. Napa starts off at around 14 an hour.. And then there is autozone. I have worked her long enough to find out there is nothing here for anyone. It is not worth it. I was promoted to a PSM recently and am still waiting on my $1 raise.. Autozone is the most greedy company you can work for. The only person to get bonus checks are the store managers. Just remember, you will get minimum wage.. You will deal with some customers that are already in a bad mood because their car broke.. You will install batteries, wipers, air filters, etc. for free because you can not accept tips (policy) and you will be forced to sell sell sell with absolutely no incentive. Wait I lied.. My store did win one selling contest and received a $10 coupon to spend on uniform.. That reminds me.. You buy your own shirts, shoes, and pants. Autozone provides you with nothing but a name tag. I feel like I haven't said even half of what is on my mind. But there's my 2 cents. Take the"
bad,Not a good place to work. I worked for this company with hopes of advancing. The company overall is just draining as a whole. The dont teach you anything about the parts. Always busy not enough staff.
bad,"managing employees, pleasing the customer, meeting our set numbers daily. fun place to work and very up to speed. moves fast and promptly and always something to do."
bad,"I started this job as a commercial driver.  I learned to run the front counter and registers, as well as the commercial department.  Did this affect my pay or advancement, nope not in the least, after working there 3 years my pay was 8.90 per hour with all ive learned and done, what a joke."
bad,"It's an ok job for students wanting to work part time or anyone that wants to make a little extra money."
bad,"If you're looking for a part time job with AutoZone, you can expect to work about 6 hours per week. Managers work up to 40 hours a week with very little help. Busier stores keep just as many employees working at any given time as the slower business stores. Upper management refuses to staff their stores with more than a couple workers at a time, so if AutoZone if a place you want to work, consider a slower business location."
bad,I never really got many hours while working there but the people were always nice to me. You do have some difficulties with some of the customers cause they don't know what they are doing and they expect you to diagnose their car like a mechanic.
bad,"This job pushes multi tasking to the next lvl as you ring a customer out you greet a customer coming in pointing them in right direction and look up a part for the guy you have on the phone before greeting more people coming in and pointing them in the right direction as you walk to the customer that came in while you were ringing out a customer make sure he has right item for the job in their hands before you take another call (phone never stops.) look up parts for the Lady on the phone while on the adjacent computer look up a part for the guy standing in front of you go pull all those parts and place parts on hold for the lady on the phone, then go to register to ring the customer in front of you out. Rinse and Repeat for 10 hours. and on mondays all of this while you put your shipment that came in away. =)"
bad,"Autozone is a decent place to work.  Wages are lower then most of the competitors. Benefits are ok. Overly concerned with KPI's(key performance indicators), which is selling the customer as most as you can."
bad,manager was creepy i liked to help people with there cars that was cool but looking up parts and calling stores was a bit much for 8.25
bad,"I learned more about cars in the 3 years I was with Autozone than I had my entire life. Coworkers were great, the people who came in everyday were great, even my store mangers were great. The district managers were terrible. Very poor way of teaching employees core values, and giving them and understanding of work ethic. No respect for hourly employees at all. Not only myself but other employees were treated quite poorly. Not worth it for the pay. Would never work for Autozone again."
bad,Good place to work for a teenager's first job.  Pay isn't much and no benefits for hourly employees.  Hectic work day and multiple responsibilities not always applicable to job description.
bad,"not so good management, medium pay, balance shifts. fast pace environment. not the best job that i had. needs to improve in management."
bad,"Is typical retail.  Pay just above Walmart.  I was store manager so $40,000 plus bonus.  Told to do unethical things to workers concerning firing.  Ran by District Manger."
bad,They wouldn't give me enough hours and I felt I was the only motivated employee there. They really need to step up their game on every level.
bad,management not good no good or enjoyable day at all helping customers with their cars the co workers were ok but not the best time at work
bad,"I pulled orders as required by my headset.  I worked with a great crew, and enjoyed it being a fast paced job.  Working for this company was good in the respect I would be in different places pulling orders, keeping me from getting complacent."
bad,Pay is low treats you like a number and not family it is deffinitley a a place where you  need them not them  needing you i wouldn't allow my worst enemy to work here
bad,"As a business that offers free services to customers, AZ has attractive features for shoppers, but fewer for employees. A comprehensive computer system offers support for workers of little knowledge (such as a myself), though product information is somewhat scant. The corporate policies are not flexible, although the management is reasonably sympathetic to schedule needs."
bad,"Store manager was awesome, DM not so much. Once you leave store management you never knew what was going to happen. Being promised things if you keep working hard and trying to help store manager get the store in better shape but not getting the backing of DM and on up the line was a downer."
bad,"The fact that this is a customer service job, and autozone is a multy-national company, it should have a competitive pay rate."
bad,"I enjoy helping customers with car parts management is good co- workers are very helpful nothing hard about this job, I enjoyed meeting ne customers everyday"
bad,to many contridictions managers act weird when an employee ask for help its really not good enviorment
bad,"Knowing your job and what is expected of you and doing it.  One has to be versatile sometimes unexpected things arise.  I learned to use the computer to look up parts.  I learned about auto parts and other products, cash handling and customer service.  Most of the co-workers were team players, which made everything better for the overall of the store's success.  Managements was great at the beginning, but my last year was with a new manager, and I think it was lack of experience on the part of the new manager.    Management was no doing too good when I left the company, that was one of my main reasons why I left the company. The most enjoyable part of this job, was working mostly independently.  I knew my job and enjoyed working with customers."
bad,Same and the previous.  Corporations are the worst.  Same Same
bad,Most employees did not seem to enjoy working at Auto Zone nor did they seem to care about attending the customers in the store. To make matters worse employee relations where terrible and management did not seem to care about any of the staff. To make matters worse in the case of an injury to an employee the insurance company would quickly try to discredit the injured employee and deny any benefits that might have been due to any injured worker. Overall this was the worst company that I ever had the displeasure of working for.
bad,"My typical day at work would be showing up at 5am to pick all the parts for the first four runs to head out to the regions AutoZones. This would take about 2 hours to complete with one other person. After that I would scan all the parts to stickers that would be dedicated for the store that they were supposed to be shipped to. Then I would back down the trucks and fill them up according to the run that they were suppose to go on. I would then get in my truck and head out for the first run, then once my run was completed I would have lunch and then come back to pick more parts for the 3rd run of the day. "
bad,I love this company managemant is good co-worker ok the hardest part
bad,worked with chemicals all day. good staff but the place was unhealthy
bad,"Plus side: they will never fire you unless you don't show up for work or if you steal from them. "
bad,"A typical day at Auto Zone was working from open to close and getting an hour break if there was a slow period in the day. When I first applied, I didn't know much about cars, but I slowly learned new things each day. Even though it was not the best managed job, thing still got accomplished and we did satisfy a lot of customers. I liked working there because it was my first job, however, the company has a lot to work on."
bad,A typical day at work was based on inventory and assisting customers.
bad,"To supervise seven departments helping mentally challenged individuals seeking independent lives back into society. The management position included: administration, client safety, department effectiveness in meeting goals and client improvement. Co-workers in location worked as a team and focused on the clients needs. Greater challengers were in the main office communication and duty methods. However seeing client improvement brought the greatest gratification to me."
bad,I enjoyed interacting with new people. My co-workers were fun to work with
bad,"had some issues with co-worker turn over but learned a lot about the car industry. co-workers that stayed was great, management was good to work with. hardest part for me was learning the ropes of the job and the best part was my customers"
bad,Didnt mind the long hours but managment was not very organized
bad,there's no future to grow in this company not enough income to get by short hours and lack of leadership skills.
bad,"Customer Service is who I am so I never have a problem with my customers, however the current District Manager has extremely poor management skills to the point that he has fired or driven off many very good employees and managers who have been with the company for over 10yrs."
bad,"There $ are over price, and really low on inventory, and they make you sell ""little accec. people do not need.."
bad,the company dose not have very good benefits nor do they have very good core values
bad,"Working at lower level retail position is very difficult without the proper management ahead of you.  It only takes one domino to fall for a store manager to be doing a district manager's duties which makes lower management have to do a store managers job with no more compensation, along with their own job.  Add in some incompetent sales people and literally all the responsibility of the store is on a PSM due to a lack of training and leadership of upper management. The passive-aggressive expectation of high turnover is very overt and can be frustrating."
bad,You can receive some good experience / training for entry level management 
bad,enjoyed working with the public. Really had the opportunity to learn more about cars.
bad,over all nice lol dam people dont like to show up to work good bins all ways there 
bad,"Around 300 customer visited the store on a daily basics, as a manager I had to help customers with parts a cash them out make sure the employees I had were helping out the customer get what they needed. Also had to make sure inventory and truck was being done, that sales goal for the day was being reach."
bad,"Overall the company was ok to work for, the hours of retail work are never pleasant. The only negative thing was HR let me go over a B.S. accusation that they had no proof of and just wanted to make an example out of someone."
bad,"Its not a good work place at all. you have people looking over your shoulder at all times, and the pay suck."
bad,unless you make customers buy products they dont need you cant advance your made to make a simple job expensive
bad,"I was none stop, If i wasnt checking someone out at the cash register I was helping customers find part, answering phones or stocking parts."
bad,"Autozone is the Wal-Mart of the autoparts world. Bad pay, mass sales, a disconnect from everyday people. Pressuring people to by items was required. The people I worked with were good people for the most part. There is almost no requirement to know anything about automobiles to get a job there. Advancement and pay is terrible."
bad,"As a sales associate, the main priority is to help the customer with any questions they may have during the course of the day. The job at times can get frustrating, but overall it is a rewarding job. It is an okay part-time job for extra spending cash."
bad,Supervised up to 7 employees daily
bad,"enjoyed every minute a a part sales manager, worked with customers on a daily basis. learned how to interact with people of all ethics"
bad,"Everywhere you go it has its pros and cons, but I'm looking for something different."
bad,"This company will tell you everything you want to hear,and then turn it's back on you.Nothing about my time at this company was rewarding."
bad,"Way too strict on dress code.  Just an overall bad experience.  Poor training, high overturn, understaffed.  Not user friendly computers at all!! No reference material, or technical support.  Poor management."
bad,When i first started working at my location i loved my job..after being there awhile i started noticing how upper management treats their managers and it made me not want to be one... These managers need better training they paying them all this money for them to do nothing and some of them worse then the red shirts
bad,"Very enticing job, on paper. Very political in how you are treated within. Very quick to change policy and procedures from top down. I worked with some great people, the biggest reason for the high turnover rate with drivers is the corporate decisions and they ways that driver's performance was acknowledged."
bad,Terrible management at the regional and district levels...  The store managers are great but they are overworked and under paid..  It reflects greatly in the store.
bad,"The ones you work with immediately are good. Management is reactive only to what the tier above dictates. They create a whole set of problems to solve a perceived issue. Bonuses are given to managers to meet bottom lines and so they create dictates to preserve their own pockets; rather than what is efficient, cost effective and prudent."
bad,"management sucks sometime they would hide from you, ask to much to be done in one day. they don't know about parts . I know more about parts then some of the manger"
bad,I worked for Autozone for three years I had 2 great store managers and the last 2 we’re terrible they had no idea what they were doing  the good employees always get terminated and the employees that don’t work or know anything always get promoted
bad,"Not bad place to work in transition or along with another job. Very understanding Bosses and flexibility. "
bad,Not a bad place to work. If your a good worker they will just give you more work while others sit around and do nothing. A great job for kids that live with mom and dad. And your manager makes all the difference if he’s there when your new because you will have a lot of questions hard to get 40hrs
bad,They do promise to advance you and give you an opportunity to make more money but it's a long drawn out process.  It's also employees who steal from this company and think that others aren't aware. A few of the zones act like high school children when they are adults. Overall my store is great. Yes we fuss and stuff but we talk about it and move forward.  I feel like the pay for zones could be better because we ate in these stores daily
bad,"The work culture at Autozone made it very difficult to return to the job site every day. There was constant ridicule about how poorly the DC was doing which was directed at the hard working employees as if it were their fault. The management seemed to enjoy each time they had bad news for the team, and there was enough mandatory overtime there for me to be sick of it for a life time. The racks we had to retrieve products from were constantly unsafe, which even if no fault of your own would then become your problem in the next lecture you'd get. The rate is so absurd that you can win a marathon and still not meet their quota. Over all it was just a terrible place for anyone with a sane mind to stay at for long."
bad,Hours are terrible for making any plans. And upper management isn’t the best when it comes to having an employees back. The store itself is great but the structure of the company needs to change.
bad,there needs to be a better way to train people. most of the time you're thrown to the wolves with little to no training. you get basic computer training but not much else till a problem arises. there has to be more insensitive for better productivity other than just a pizza party. real money bonuses/ raises that are more than 25 cents as an annual bonus while store managers get thousands of dollars. Psm and associates do 80% of the work but reap no benefits.
bad,"The company in itself is not horrible to work for. However, poor management skills and lack of consideration for issues placed on your plate everyday make it very tiresome and more like torture. Overtime is back to back and you never know when you will get out on time or be required to stay."
bad,I work for them about 1.5 yrs and it was great at first but if the district manager didnt like you and your were nor from her store she would take for ever to promote you. And if she like she would let you ve lazy and just be on your phone. There was no equity or fairness. God forbid I did something wrong because then she would use me as an example and write me up. I had to work harder on my responablities because they had no one else who spoke spanish.
bad,A typical day consists of helping customers find the correct parts for their vehicle as well as solving problems that might affect their vehicle down the line.
bad,If they had better management and had a better work in environment and your hours  were more stable it wouldn't be a bad place to work you have different hours every week and if you say anything it just gets worse you think they would treat there good employees better but they don't the better you the worse they treat you
bad,"You are expected to enhance salesmanship, deal with customer abuse, install batteries and wiper blades among other ""courtesy services"" for a whopping pay of minimum wage."
bad,"Autozone is all presentation ,and nothing to back it up. The managment is always over worked, There is no limitations to how far you should help a customer with there vehicle so things can go bad and suddenly you/ the company owes the customer a new part."
bad,"Nothing gets fixed or replaced at the stores like the A/C that hadn’t been working for about a year so it’s 80 degrees or more in the store. Manger tried having people come to fix it and autozone didn’t pull through. Store managers can be great or bad, I happened to get one that over-staffed and gave very little hours. They expect the world from you even though you get paid minimum wage. They don’t give a uniform you have to pay for it. Uniform gets holes frequently from battery acid or you get grease stains so hard to look presentable. I was supposed to become a part time manager and never happened so empty promises. Depending what area you work in the customers are terribly rude. Overall, not worth the headache and the insane amount of effort it requires to try to keep yourself happy working here."
bad,"A lot of experienced workers not doing their jobs, some employees that have been there many years, hide in back corners on their cell phones half of the night, while watching the temporary workers being worked to the bone, and falling behind in various departments, in one department ""Toteline"", this very slack behavior often results in a dangerous situation, as heavy totes continually come down the conveyer belt to be loaded on trucks, but instead are stacked up to 10 feet high due to lack of manpower on the toteline. These totes are often damaged, and stacking them so high often results in them falling over, and these totes filled with auto parts, can easily fall onto the temporary workers on the toteline, but this is of no concern to Management, or the veteran employees who peek out from behind their phone screens with a smile."
bad,boring at times you have to stand their for them customers to pick up the product. they mostly because of the waiting heavy lines but good place to choose work
bad,I didn’t like the fact I wanted to move up and they didn’t push for that. They allowed people to work that weren’t qualified and made excuses. I had all the right knowledge but they didn’t use it. So I left them.
bad,"Low pay."
bad,"Manager is great but the stores are run with a skeleton crew so pulling 10-12 hour shifts is normal to cover vacations and callouts. Long shifts aren't the problem, its the compensation. 10.25 an hour for commercial driving and DIY, that is just too low"
bad,the stores are short staffed the class are to much for one day management is far the stores are ok the people are hard to deal with sometime but the pay makes up for it
bad,Autozone tries to hard to force you to sell addons to customer. They put so much pressure on an employee that they scare them with termination if they don't do it.
bad,Auto zone was a really good job i learned alot there like how to change brakes put oil in car and other kinds of problems vehicles can have it was good experience
bad,You have no work/life balance. You are required to work nights and weekends even Sundays. If you are shorthanded for any reason you will work that employees schedule and your schedule for the entire time. Many 7am - 11:30pm days. Many of the District Managers have unrealistic goals and will yell at you if you do not meet.
bad,"-Weekly schedules"
bad,"Flexible scheduling, minimum wage, Not the best, but it is Flexible with your schedule. great for school/ college students. not really for grown adults trying to make a living."
bad,"Still, no comment. I have to pay my bills. So I have to do the best I can with what I got. So why complain, because same people have to beg others to get by."
bad,Not a good job to work a. Everything is put on you to do if you don't meet the requirements that are set up too high to do your hours are cut down. They make you do everything without managers help to help you when you are new.
bad,"always short staffed, and wanted managers to work for 2 or 3 people. had some good employees but turnover really high.  you would train new and they would leave right away"
bad,I love dealing with my customers.I like doing inventory and planograms. Making sure customers had the correct part.I was also a commercial sales manager. I love dealing with bodyshops and dealerships.
bad,"Unfortunately this job sucks the life out of you and Managment is extreamly temperamental. A lot of great people work for this company.....just not for long. Turnover is extremely high.  The pay is low. Not a lot of atta boys by the people who matter.  The first sentence from the missions sTatement is a lie ""our stores look great""  "
bad,"Just a typical job . I wouldn’t recommend for lifetime job. I consider it as a temporary job. Management there was okay, flexible hours & you could get overtime as well ."
bad,"Advancement  seems  to  be  touch and go, depending  on politics at that moment. Loved the learning  process  and customer  service  part. Did not like being  bypass  for promotion  because  I  was  not  a manager  best friend. I'm  there to  do  a job."
bad,No matter the situation the customer was always right even though you could prove to them they are wrong or was being dishonest. The upper management never listened to their employees.
bad,"This place apparently is a great company to work for, as long as you  aren't in california."
bad,"Truly for the young high schooler or coming back into the workforce adult. Hours are not consistent, lack of proper pay for the work that’s expected of you to do, no training provided that helps you in your day to day operations, poor leadership and stressful conditions."
bad,"The lack of management training is a joke, lets show you the basics and let you go to town. A typical day is what is going to happen today is the outdated computer system going to crash is the safe going to cooperate. Is my boss going to come in and complain that something isn't done even though we are very short on staff because no one is allowed to work because of payroll."
bad,"Low level employee work. Stocking shelves, Cleaning floors, selling autoparts. Nothing special. Monthly company training required, weekly up item sales goals."
bad,If you were sick they gave you a hard time. I would never recommend anyone to work here full time. They promise you promotions and then do not deliver.
bad,Autozone does not have a lot of room for advancement. They have a very unorganized way of managing and it makes it hard to maintain the store. They should offer their employees more benefits and more pay.
bad,"On a typical work day, customers are stressed but respectful. "
bad,Worked wild hours and covered more than my assigned job. Easily will dump all the work on the good employees. SOME managers will stand around and hand you all the work.
bad,"Typical day at work involved me going in and getting clocked in. Delivering parts throughout the day to commercial accounts, looking up parts, cashiering, and occasionally installing batteries/wipers/headlights without proper/extra compensation."
bad,"it was always a fun place to work you got the chance to meet many people who were very passionate of their cars and i got the chance to learn a lot in the automotive field with this job, the only downside was the managing was terrible with a store manager who didn't care about anyone but himself and a district manager who cared more about her reputation"
bad,I would work here again because the management allow you too be harrassed and also went to human resources and it was the same thing so I would recommend anyone work here.
bad,Aat first this was a good company to work for but turned around real quick afyter working there for a short time. This company does not give you enough hours and if you have a second job they will make it as hard on you as possible until you quit because they dont want to work around anybody elses schedule. It might just be the management doing this. Nevertheless i had a bad experience both times i worked here
bad,no help stressful  and poor management .  i worked a swing shift with little to no help and found problems all the time . reported problems to right person and got canned for it.
bad,"They don't care about their employees, whether you're there a short time or a long time.  The longer you're there, the higher the risk they will get rid of you.  There's no incentive for giving them 100% on any given work day.  The customer contacts and some of the co-workers were the only enjoyable parts of the job."
bad,The store manager is a good person. It is all the other managers above him that have ridiculous goals and views of how things work. If you want to work for a company that treats you like garbage but yet brags how good they are to work for this is your place.
bad,I hated my experience at Autozone. I was a manager there and employees were ghetto and uneducated. Many of them stole from the company. You work long hours with little pay and no recognition!
bad,"I work for AutoZone for 11 years period at the end of 11 years I only made $11 an hour and was treated the same as people who been working there 6 months. The job can be fun at times depending on your co-workers and managers but over all this company does not value their employees, even the most dedicated."
bad,I like the job itself because I enjoy learning about cars and learning about new parts. But the coworkers it self made it not pleasant. Good for people that need a work/social life
bad,"A typical day at Autozone varies. Sometimes things go smoothly and others there are rushes and stressful situations that has everyone on edge. I learned a lot from them about general life skills as well as automotive care. Management is a hit or miss, sometimes you get managers that enjoy their job and want everyone else to, and then there are those who basically make everyone else miserable because they are. Hardest part of the job is simply learning everything and trying to retain it, as well as trying to keep yourself and others cool when a customer comes in and is inconsolable. The most enjoyable part of the job honestly is working with coworkers who enjoy what they do. When they make sure they have your back the job overall becomes so much easier. That and the look on the customers face when you solve their car troubles and its one less thing they have to worry about in their busy day."
bad,"The best part of the Job was the employees, and helping customers problem solve issues with vehicle repairs. "
bad,"Basic 8 hour work days. Help customers, put away stock, and clean."
bad,Company has a business model that works really well. Though they think software replaces talent when it comes to auto parts needs. the company cares very little for the staff in the stores.
bad,"I was quite a very stressful environment to work in. They hardly gave me any hours. They also made me buy my own uniforms, which were not cheap. Overall not a great place to work."
bad,"The job itself was ok (Parts delivery driver)"
bad,"Way too stressful.  Doesn't matter how good a persons work ethics are, if you don't produce a certain number, you are always in jepordy of losing your job."
bad,District management set impossible sales goals then reprimand and demean you when they are not obtained. Constant job threatening. District management don't live up to incentives made to employees.
bad,"Started out working there, it was nice. All depends on the people you work with. If you enjoy sitting down, don't work here. Turnover rate is pretty high."
bad,"I don't think that this is a very good company to work for. They have long hours, entirely too much required of their employees, and not enough time to get the work done. Their upper management is out of touch with their store level employees."
bad,AutoZone is a job that is very demanding but low paying . Would be a good job for a first time employee or if you are looking for a good part time job and enjoy working on cars.
bad,"aprendes bastantes cosas: servicio a cliente, mecánica y uso de aparatos de diagnostico etc."
bad,sucks real bad i have a ton of exsperince working on cars and they do not pay nor will they work with you on days off all the way to the district level
bad,"The company likes to say that their culture is a driving focus but it's inaccurate. It's about as corporate as corporate jobs go and anyone who says differently has drank the cool aide and is delusional. They say they 'Care about people' but that's just not the case. People get promoted who aren't qualified so the company can tell their board that they are diverse. It's just not the way a business in America should run. But hey, their stock is at $800 a share so what do I know?"
bad,La verdad me gustaba este trabajo hasta que te ponen a hacer de todo incluso cosas por las que no estabas contratado
bad,"A typical day at work for the most part very relaxed."
bad,"Originally I thought since it's AutoZone i'll get to fix and work with cars and possibly learn something, but reality was you stock shelves for 4 hours and move what you had already stocked the day before to a new location, then stand there the rest of the day waiting for customers. There were many employees so each only got a 4 hour work schedule, unless you're the manager. A half day work schedule 5 days a week instead of a full schedule takes a lot out of your daily life and still leaves you with no money."
bad,Finding the hard parts for the customers. Enjoy my co workers and my boss. Learned that upper management cannot be trusted.
bad,"autozone is a good starting off job , but they do not take care of you in the long run. they work you bone dry with litttle to no pay"
bad,"a good place to get into management but its a very numbers business ive never worked for a company that seems to show such little interest in reducing turnover, competing companies (oreilys,napa,advanced etc.) pay alot more and have better benefits"
bad,"All of the same duties that I did at Oreilly's, I did at Autozone. Working with customers is ok. I like trouble shooting."
bad,"Okay place to work, management is really disorganized. When I was hired on I was told there was room for advancement, almost been there a year and have seen nothing. Wages are low. Small raises annually."
bad,"Not all that great like they claim to be, Just another money hungry corp that really does not care for anyone but themselves. even if you have high knowledge in the automotive field like myself (Mechanic) they pay you almost minimum wage and you get the same pay as somebody that has no knowledge what so ever about anything (First time jobbers,ect) BUT there is always a ray of sun through the storm. I do work with some of the best people i have ever met i love them like family, My managers personally in my store are amazing people., Co-Workers are just as amazing we all support each other, i love being around my Co-workers and i love being around the customers just the same. Typical day at work is with any customer service related job. Ups and downs we have all dealt with it. Hardest part of the job is telling a customer no."
bad,"Just another place to work. There's nothing special about the place. Depending on which one one chooses to work for they are all different. The work load is normal. Working graveyard is good, but after a while it'll feel like you're working for nothing. Red shirts are treated badly. There is no equality amongst the workers."
bad,"It is a lot of hard work, and you have to be very fast, but they pay decent and the benefits are okay. If you enjoy manual labor, it's the place for you."
bad,"Worst IT management I ever worked with. Managers/Directors usually don't know, what DBAs are doing. Therefore, the outcome of the appraisals at the end of the FY has become unpredictable. "
bad,"At first this company was a blast to work for, but now that the company has a stock purchase price of $680 per share, the companies view leans more towards its share holders than their employees."
bad,"Obey traffic laws and follow established traffic and transportation procedures."
bad,need higher pay rate and also employment. my experience there was fun but higher pay always make path a different course in life
bad,"A typical day of work consists of check engine lights, battery replacement, selling parts, and advice to customers. I have learned about our parts we sell, our people we sell to, most of our customers always come back. We treat customers very good, never less then the best. But our employees, dont get the best of it. Management could care less about how you work or how you perform. You will work just about any and every weekend , no excuses. Family time does not matter to autozone, and if your lucky youll be closing at midnight even on a sunday and be expected to come back to work the following morning at 7am."
bad,"I am only working part-time, when I wanted a full-time job. I am making $9 an hour, when I could be making more with my certification as a Business Administrator. So I am pretty much working to pay for daycare..I need daycare to work, but what's the point of working if I can babysit my kid for free.."
bad,"Hours not consistent. One week you might have 30 hours, the next you might have 10. Learned the names of parts I didn't know."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of either opening or closing the store, stocking shelves, operating the register, doing returns, and looking up parts for customers. I changed batteries, headlights/tail lights, and wiper blades for customers as well as checking engine codes and testing batteries, alternators and starters. I learned how to find parts through the system database and how to read planogram numbers. The management was really nice and easy to work with. My co-workers were also very friendly and helpful and great at being team players. The hardest part of my job was doing return swaps and trying to figure out the right size brake lines for different customers because brake line sizes vary depending on the vehicle and their location. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the shelves when it was truck day."
bad,"I did learn quite a bit about care parts and such while working at Autozone. My store manager really could not be beat, he was a very easy going but strict manager. Most of my co-workers were very easy to get along with and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was answering some of the customers questions, because I am not a mechanic but I did the best I could and referred them to a shop that could help them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,company needs to learn how to treat their employs better!! Also they claim to put their customers first but management tells you other wise.
bad,This job is good for part time. A lot has changed with this company within the last few years. I would only recommend someone who is looking for part time to work here. Management and Employee turn over is high.
bad,"In my opinion they are not an EOE employer. I liked my co-workers, but the majority of the management is not upfront about what they can do for the regular staff. They promise things that they know they cannot make good on."
bad,"To much to really put light on AZ, but all in all you have to be careful with everybody in the building,everyone is all about self."
bad,"okay place to work , room to move up in company, little pay. nice people to work with"
bad,I walk in answer phones. Look up parts and deliver them. I am on the phone with commercial accounts trying to figure out the cars problems
bad,Working at AutoZone turned out to be a job where you work to live and live to work kind of job. I found very little time to have a life outside the workplace. I would not recommend this for anyone with a family.
bad,Not worth the effort. One is completely overworked and undervalued. Hadf I to do it all over again I wouldnt have tken the manager position. I would still make about the same without all the politics and headaches involved.
bad,A job is a job...no room for advancement several days with no lunch.
bad,"     Autozone is a decent place to work if you are just starting out in your career, but their promotion and pay policies are second rate. Their marketing abilities seem mediocre and belong in the 19th century. It is time to step up to the 21st Century. "
bad,great job for some one that knows about cars and wants to make some money
bad,"My personal experience was negative because of the management that was there. I received many compliments from customers and was well liked but the management didn't due their job. After the original manager left, whom I really liked, there was a string of new store managers who couldn't schedule correctly and when I took a medical leave of absence I was let go."
bad,"AutoZone as a whole is a good job if your mid management and up. Store could be a lot better. Starting off with a full staff of workers in the store. I worked at a inner city autozone, so your dealing with rude customers and high risk of being robbed."
bad,"When I first started working for this company, I was a college student who was personally interested in automobiles as a hobby. Along the road I've learned a few things about AutoZone."
bad,"As a former Parts Sales Manager I was very, very disappointed with the quality of training from the Austin store located at 1819 west Parmer Blvd. The manager was terrible. The experience was even worse. Plus they are not cooperative if any medical issues pop up. Such as having an amputated toe and unable to walk. They state you can sit down for any length of time for as long as you need. This store doesn't even have a break room for it's employees. Let me pose this question to all readers. When was the last time you saw any employees at any AutoZone sitting down at the counter while assisting you ? Or not going outside to check your car diagnostics or, better yet, changing your battery ? There is much to be desired at AutoZone so I'll take my chances at Advance Auto Parts. They are nice guys there..."
bad,"Combination of typical retail and repair shop atmosphere. Extremely fast paced and stressful, with very long hours. High pressure tactics from district and regional managers. As a salaried manager, you may be required to work anywhere from 70 - 90 hours a week. It takes a special skill to handle the customers correctly because they are already angry when they come in the door because their car is broken. However, you do get a sense of satisfaction from helping people who can't afford a mechanic fix their cars. And the company does promote from within, so you can move up to management fairly easily if you work hard. Pay and benefits were much better than similar retail jobs."
bad,easy stock shelfs unload truck cool co workers have slows days did alot of cleaning
bad,"Learned greatly how to deal with all kinds of people, time management. Liked the connections I made, and knowledge about cars, boats, lawnmowers. I did not like going outside in 100 degree weather to work on cars for free or in stormy weather."
bad,I have worked at Autozone for 8 years. There are many ups and downs to automotive retail. Hardest part about the job is difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and working with my hands.
bad,bosses mostly called out only wanted to work when they did.hours were always everywhere because of this. no life outside of work. as a part time employee u would work 39.5 hrs no overtime no benifits no thank you.
bad,Not enough compensation for knowledge and responsibility expected
bad,"This is a retail company that gets it all. With 24 hour stores available, customers can either be glad you're open or upset they're there."
bad,"It's a cut throat job. Doesn't matter if your're a red shirt or a grey shirt. You can't trust anyone. No matter how long you've been with the company. If a fellow employee can find a reason to report you for the simplest things (and they can come up). you can get fired! If you can survive this, it's not so bad."
bad,I have no life here. As in I have no home life. Upper management doesnt listen to problems. I'm scheduled open then close or close then open a lot. I really wouldn't recommend this job.
bad,"Pay not good enough. For only 8 a hour management has favoritism.  "
bad,Job was okay it would be alot better if they actually trained you. From when I started they didn't really assign someone to train me I had to learn hands on but it was very difficult because there would be a lot of customers so you have to help them out without being trained properly.
bad,"Very fast paced, always on your feet unless you're a delivery driver. Alot of teamwork. Constantly dealing with customers, cash handling, answering phones, answering questions. However some language barriers between employees and customers."
bad,Auto Zone is a great place to work at. However it is not a very female friendly environment. Most of the customers are male and are not as respectful as they should be.
bad,"Working in autozone all days are a little bit different of another but the payment is really the minimun ($7.25), for that part this jobs i consider temporary or complementary with another job to balance your account."
bad,Wouldn’t recommend anyone work there if they are taking automotive career seriously. Waste of my time and knowledge in a company that didn’t respect or appreciate it.
bad,"If you’re just starting to work, this is a good entry level job for a part time. If you’re willing to go full time parts manager, you need to be open to open availability and fully committed to the brand."
bad,"The work environment is horrible. The policy allows people to walk over the employees and treat them terrible, and all they ever have to do is call corporate."
bad,"This company is for a kid fresh out of High School with no responsibilities. I  am a Parts Sales Manager but I carry out duties of an assistant store manger. I am underpaid and overworked. The pay is mediocre. I only make 13$ per hour, full time, but only work 30 to 35 hours per week due to budget constraints. Only Store Managers receive bonuses for sales but Part Sales Managers do all the work regarding sales. We do not benefit from anything!!"
bad,"No hay organizacion, todos hacen de todo no estan definidos los puestos, no aprendi gran cosa porque nadie te capacita, el gerente tiene sus privilegiados no es profesional, tiene muy buenos cursos pero no se aplican en lo laboral, lo mas dificil es que si se equivoca el jefe te hecha la culpa a ti, no me gusto para nada trabajar en esa empresa"
bad,The people here are great and some of the nicest you will meet. I believe that the training and advancement could use some work along with real goals.
bad,"Although the people you work with are good people, the customers are the biggest challenge; 1 out of every 3 people who come in looking for car parts are already in a bad mood as they've been either under a hood or laying in the dirt all day and do -not- want to be even mildly in a good mood. It's an okay job if you're used to dealing with stress, but the majority of customers come in either not actually knowing what they need and expect you to know off the top of your head what kind of car they drive and what part they need, or don't know what they need and think you're a mechanic when you're just a parts salesman. Many customers like to think they know more than you do, argue with you, then come back later blaming you for giving them the wrong part when you had spent more than an hour telling them it wasn't."
bad,"Were it not for the store manager for my job, I would have hated my job and would have left long ago. Upper management in our district and region was borderline tyrannical.  The district manager ran the show like a dictator, reprimanding any store that failed to meet the companies ridiculous quotas for sales. All the stores were understaffed and underpaid for the amount of work the average employee put in.  Not only were the entry level workers treated like slaves, the managers in all the stores were treated like they were expendable as well. In other regions, the upper management treats their employees well. For example, buying managers lunch at inventories or gifts for holidays. In our district, the manager does nothing for the employees and the manager gets a bigger bonus because they spend less money."
bad,This is a boys club. Hard for an older more experienced man to move forward at least un this location. Other than that I did enjoy the work atmosphere and co workers
bad,"Nationally AutoZone is a great company, I can see where they would be a good place to work, this is not the case in the North East region, they are plagued with a shortage of good store managers and District Managers.  Some districts have gone without District managers for over a year, some stores are being run by assistants while they look for managers"
bad,The pace was very slow with a lot of standing around.  Store was not very busy.  I did learn some of the new parts on vehicles.  Management was fair enough.  The hardest part of the job was waiting for the next customer.  It was fun to meet new people as customers and employees.
bad,"As time goes by the stress level rise. The employee turn over rate is ridiculous. There is only a handful of employees who have been there 2 years or more. There is much of lack of communication between all departments, tossing around the blame onto others, and mixed signals as to whether or not what your hours will be. "
bad,Great place to work if you like doing your job plus the other managers jobs as well. You must must like working open to close at least 3 times a week.
bad,"Long hours with only 1- 2 person crews with a lot of tasks expected.  sales, sales  and analytical numbers expected weekly . Upper management not real supportive at District and Regional levels. A lot of stress with customer , Commercial business , phone service and helping outside in extreme heat and cold with customers vehicles."
bad,"production environment. Overtime is sporadic. management is poor in relating to employees, Training program is lacking."
bad,Huge amount of luck involved in what manager you will work with. A good manager can make this retail position tolerable in the short term while a bad one will make your life terrible.
bad,"helping people is probably the best part of the job, even teaching them if they don't know what they're looking for, some good opportunties to learn from online classes that you do while on the job and to get parts certified"
bad,Management can be bipolar most of the time. The people that usually advance in the company are close to management/corporate. I have never received a single compliment from the store manager in the 9 months of working at Autozone.
bad,Although I acquired a previous managers issues I was expected to completely rebuild the commercial parts section of the store myself with minimal help and resources. Also was told I would make target bonuses based on performance but was not told that even if my commercial business met it's targets if the retail business did not then I would not receive said bonus. Also was expected to speak to a mostly Hispanic clientele with no ability to speak or understand Spanish .
bad,Met and continue to have friendships with people I have met a AZ. Loved helping people with their automotive needs. Never a dull moment when working there....
bad,I love this job. It was very clean for it be an automotive parts warehouse. Management can use a bit more adjusting. The turn over rate is a bit high.
bad,"Terrible and Horrible place to work, The management treats you like garbage most times and the upper management is worse. If you don't make their numbers there is no constructive criticism, they just call or show up and take over the store. Questioning employees who are trying to attend to customers and interrupting the flow of business. I've seen then use people as a scapegoat for an issue they couldn't get themselves out of. As far as pay goes, for the amount of work they ask of you at any level does not correlate to the rate of pay."
bad,"Not enough work hours. If your a student working for auto mechanic and looking for experience, auto zone is good for learning about car parts. Alright"
bad,"The store managers and my fellow employees were some of the nicest, most helpful people I've ever had the pleasure of working with, and the customers were less consistently unbearable than the ones I encountered working at a supermarket. The average work day was effectively painless, and the workload remained more or less consistent throughout the day--the first hour after opening and first before closing were usually pretty dead, but beyond that, the store was pretty lively. All in all, the work itself was actually pretty good, for what it was."
bad,"Extremely stressful to the point of unfair to the employees. Failure to hire a fair amount of employees to cover the assigned workload was the problem. I believe in working a full day and giving my all, but the workload was excessive, with no intent to hire enough employees required to cover the assignment. Management was very demanding of those employed in order to compensate for the lack of employees necessary to cover the department. As an account receivable representative, you were responsible for your department as well as any other area of credit due to their failure to hire. We were each assigned to a large number of accounts, which in itself was overwhelming. At the time that I was employed in accounts receivable, we had monthly quotas. I was always with the top 3 at the end of each month out of an average 14 accounts receivable representatives, but still was under continuous stress. I along with my fellow employees were very committed to the job, therefore it was not necessary to constantly press to the extent that management insisted. The turnover was tremendous, and as I have notices over the past few years since leaving, it continues to be tremendous turnover in that department. AutoZone as a whole may not be an undesirable place to work, but the accounts receivable department was absolutely awful and poorly managed."
bad,"If you are into cars, it's a good place to start. I am not sure I would recommend it as a full career move but most of the people are good people and fun to work with."
bad,"I would not recommend working at a auto parts store unless you are going to work in the automotive field.  I learned most of my automotive information while working at AutoZone.  The customers can be pretty ruthless when they find out you have no idea what you are talking about when it comes to automotive questions.  I learned a lot while I was there but was always constantly stress out, especially when the rush would come in and we would have a line of 30+ people needing help."
bad,"As a person new to the work force or looking for something in between Autozone is fine. Once into management, the company tends to put the screws to you. Let's just say I have been paid equal or more for far less stress and demands with other more notable employment."
bad,Working here has been stressful due to management not knowing what to do on just about everything.  Things change on a daily basis.  Advancement to manager is a joke.
bad,"A typical day at work included many things. Main thing was always putting a big focus on sales. If you had to change a car battery or change a light bulb to make the sale they wanted you too. I learned how to greet customers, how to do planograms, how to stock properly and do go backs. I also learned how to manage a shift and be a team leader. The management wasn't very professional in my store. At times if I voiced a complaint about a coworkers performance or lack there of the manager would tell the people directly who brought it to his attention. He would than dismiss the complaint if they started to complain about me or someone else."
bad,"There is little room for advancement, but if you work hard enough you may get promoted from a sales representative to a part sales manager. It is always busy and requires great public skills."
bad,"Hours are long, customers have unrealistic expectations, upper management have unrealistic expectations.  They flaunt many financial incentives but deliver few (401k, tuition reimbursement)"
bad,"Its your typical retail place but dealing with car parts."
bad,"the job isn't too demanding but the management is, the pay is minimum wage and the responsibilities they put on the normal employees they should pay them more."
bad,The only advantage is being able to get 20 -30% off of your parts purchases at any AZ in the USA and be able to return them to any AZ if something is wrong with them. They have the best warranties of any parts store chain.
bad,It's a part time job with not enough employees.  We have five phones and two employees working  the counters.  The hardest thing about the job is having 4 or 5 customers and having to answer phones..
bad,"Low paying company that does not appreciate the work that is performed at the retail level. Company very much a male dominated field, and women rarely promoted past store manager position. Schedule very inconsistent and not posted more than 2 days ahead. Full time employees not allowed to participate in 401k program for ONE YEAR after employment. Ridiculous. Training modules were performed by mgt and not employees, creating an unsafe and untrained workforce."
bad,"learned new skills and gained knowledge, underpaid for what its worth. rude clients all the time, very stressful environment. all about the dm bonus and money instead of its employees."
bad,"Inventory, managing employees, commercial accounts,"
bad,They would hire any type of management out of no where with car vehicle or parts experience. which causes a problem when the sale man doesn't know what they are looking for or what they are selling.
bad,"They threaten your job if you don't sell small packs of grease. They write you up if you don't answer the phone within 3 rings and if you have a good reason as to why you didn't, they don't care."
bad,"I most enjoyed the customer interaction and learning planograms. The hardest part was locating various parts throughout the store."
bad,the store I was at wasn't the best store. we had over five different managers in a year. So at times it was like the wild west. the gm didnt really seem to want to fix this issue
bad,The work load expected of each worker does not correlate well with the amount of hours projected to need on the scheduling program.
bad,A typical day is changing out a vehicle's battery. I learned how to restock the store with parts arrivals. Management is easy if you are effective. Co-workers had an moderate attitude. Hardest part was scanning store for all items  for accountability. The most enjoyable part was meeting people of different walks of life.
bad,"its very hard to get ahead at autozone. I did however, learn a lot about cars. the hardest part of the job is how unevenly the work load is spread out."
bad,"In all honesty my experience would've been fantastic had it not been for poor management. My particular store manager passed all work down to his PSM's which meant we were working close to 55-65 hours a week while he was working 50 hours a week and enjoying his 2 days off. There was also the scheduling issue, we had two shifts at my store, either 7:15 AM-7:15PM or 10:30AM-10:30PM, we generally did not have midshifters because we were a very short staffed store, people would get hired and leave within two weeks."
bad,"my typical day is checkng the vehicles every morning before making any delivery's  "
bad,Fast working place no room for advancement the job switch you up the task so much you don`t get a chance to finish nothing.
bad,It is a soul deadening place of work if you let it and is not for the faint of heart. You will be chewed up and spit out by customers and fellow employees. It tends to be masochistic after a while; And for some reason they are always short staffed.
bad,"Ok place to work, did lots of driving. Its a stocking job.  Pay was a little under what it should have been and didnt really have very good benifits.  Management let associates run store while they sat on their phone and did nothing"
bad,"dealing with customers in person and over phone"
bad,"management is not good all "
bad,I don't have much to say about Autozone....lets leave it at that
bad,Lack of appreciation for employees. Poor pay that doesn't match the amount of work required by the sales associates.
bad,"Company is good to work for."
bad,Closing shifts are typically 12-9pm in winter and 12-10pm in summer. Closing preparations include auditing the day’s transactions and preparing the store for the following day.
bad,People there can be either really laid back or too up tight. Strict on the smallest things that can be pointless.
bad,"Your expected to work un realistic hours, complete tasks while maintaining a high level of customer service with a minimal staff count. The store manager is just a title so they can hold you accountable. Very limited decision making. When trying to hire quality, qualified individuals you are very limited in what is offered to pay. The benefits are good"
bad,"This is a good job to start for high school students that are looking for a pay check and nothing more, and if you aren't looking to accomplishment anything fulfilling in your life as far as career options this would be the place to start."
bad,I worked at a store that was three times the size of a normal Auto Zone.And upper management couldn't figure out how to make normal store procedures work at that store. No one in upper management could think outside the box.
bad,"AutoZone is a good example of a company that runs lean and rewards management for profits. Unfortunately, you are expected to do the work of at least 1 1/2 to 2 full-time jobs so productivity is minimal...you're constantly in reaction mode versus being proactive or innovative."
bad,There is no perks... Raises are given annually and you don't know what to expect.
bad,It was ok. Every job I had before was better pay for the amount of work. A few nice people but they really didn’t care a lot for everyone. If they gave you even a couple dollars more it would help but it’s to much information at once and not enough pay.
bad,The company only gives full time hours to maybe one employee in the store unless you are a grey shirt manager. Low pay and too much work for peanuts. The company wants you to install batteries wiper blades air filters and head light bulbs but only pays minimum wage. Good job for a student
bad,"Worked here while being a full time college student. They were very lenient with my rescheduling as commercial driver as they are always in need of responsible drivers. This is from commercial experience and not so much on in store, what they call DIY section."
bad,I feel they lack good management and skills and equipment 2 do the tasks that they need to do their jobs! N no chain of command I feel is being fair! Needs my structure
bad,"Honestly, I enjoyed my job so much. The biggest downside is that it is really hard to advance in any way if you are a female. Also, if any kind of medical issues happen, it is a joke trying to get through the red tape of short term disability. They don't really care how good of an employee you have been. They will give your job away as quickly as they can."
bad,"Autozone in general is a great stepping stone for opportunity  if you are in need of a job. Customer service in terms of dealing with people and their vehicles is frustrating. Please do yourself a favor and HAVE AUTOMOTIVE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE APPLYING! "
bad,"Co-workers are great, we have fun while at work.  Customers are usually grumpy, rude and demeaning with the exception of a few regular customers.  The company doesn't pay well.  As a ""Part Sales Manager"", I could make more money at any fast food restaurant.  Standard non manager employees don't make much more than minimum wage."
bad,You are dependent on the local management for things like hours and enjoyment of job. Corporate doesn't care. Make sure you're not working with gangsters.
bad,There is some great people. Great coworkers. Unclear expectations when it comes to customer service. Short staff all the time. Always excuses for raises and a big load of work and responsability.
bad,If it wasn't for my awesome coworkers I honestly wouldn't enjoy working here. The pay is horrible. No commission for upselling. Have to sometimes deal with rude impatient customers. You get few hours when you're working part time. I do not see myself working here long term.
bad,The people I work with have become fast friends and I have a great time working in the often fast paced environment. However the pay scale for the responsibility expected is not good and the benefits provided are actually costing me more than they help me and my family. Additionally the regional level and above do not treat their subordinates like people but instead only focus on sales figures
bad,"i would go in and wait for customers to come in i would help them find vehicle specific parts as well as help put on wipers, battery installs,check engine codes , light bulb installs.I learned a lot about auto parts . Management was okay just did not feel challenged in any way .Hardest part of the job was not seeing myself growing in mechanics .I enjoyed the fact that i was a part in helping someone get there car fixed."
bad,"Low salaries, excessive workloads, not enough opportunities to growth."
bad,"At autozone, sales are focused around including supplementary items with the customers purchases. Those who can push these often unnecessary items are rewarded and moved along the advancement path. You could break your back every day walking through that door stocking, handling customers, and running the retail front but none of that is valued as highly as meeting sales goals and pushing product down the customers throat."
bad,"If you are considering being a manager be prepared to not be able call in during hard times , work double shifts when people call out . Be prepared to work in harmful weather conditions doing mechanical work on customers cars . You are basically an underpaid mechanic but the customers brighten up the day , oh yea never accept a tip"
bad,"A usual day at work includes long periods of time working with lines of customers, most who don't know what they're looking for, and refer to an extremely technical part as, I quote. ""A thing, y'know, the thing that connects to the thing with the electrical connectors on it."""
bad,Store manager was never there. Short staffed. Expected to fill in for anyone who called in didn’t matter what your plans were with family or anything.
bad,"The ambition you need to show just to get hired there does NOT pay off in monetary compensation."
bad,Not the worst place to work for a side gig or if you're going to college. The worst things are dealing with rude customers (which is a lot of them) and the abysmal pay. The positive side is you get to learn about auto parts and how they work.
bad,"You only earn minimum wage for a job that should have a higher wage. The people that do stay longer than a year don't get a raise that you could live off of.  Unless you were scouted from one of our competitors like oreilly's or car quest then they give you a good deal to hire you on."
bad,"The company gave me a great amount of experience however, the region(s) I worked in provided a very poor management ladder, with poor selection of general staff."
bad,to demanding for the work load and pay not competive. work schedules are very unpredictable and hard to make plans for days off. poor management support and development.
bad,"too stressful, hate working with a point system, management was terrible, they lied about company cross training and expansion. The only good thing were the pay and benefits."
bad,"The store i work for has poor store management who cares little about anything other than themselves and leaves early very often, even if it means you have to stay over your scheduled shift. Plus the pay and benefits are very poor and uncompetitve."
bad,"A typical day is to clock in and get right to work. I learned a lot about car parts, how to detect problems, and troubleshooting vehicles. Poor management. Hardest part of the job is the companies lack of integrity. The most enjoyable part is growing relationships with the continuous customers. Almost like becoming a part of a new family."
bad,"fast pace, management expects the highest demands and with the lowest base type hired employees they get high turn over, low results from the new employees."
bad,"Poor Management we typically had a lot of issues with our build and water. However, they were slow at fixing the issue and it seems like they don't really care for their employees"
bad,"I learn about brakes , learned about different types of sensor on car, learned about starters and alternator."
bad,"If you're looking for a job because you don't have one, this is a good place to start.  As a manager you are giving a lot of responsibility right from the start, which is fine, however it leaves the door open for mistakes to be made due to lack of adequate training...which in turn leads to disciplinary action instead of training."
bad,"It was OK first starting out after about 6 months in it becomes repetitive, and you realize the company cares more about the customers then their employees"
bad,"The company started out great, and when the original ceo retired it went down hill quickly. It became all about the stock holders and nothing about the employees."
bad,"I was all in for the company culture until a new manager arrived and wanted me to start lying to customers about parts and deliveries, I refused to do so and knew it was time to leave."
bad,was there 8yrs and was never given the chance to advance although i was a great worker and very reliable. I saw many people get passed up for advancement while i was there. Schedules were always changing and they sent peolple home if not busy. they only had 2 people working for the last 4hrs of the day which made it hard to go outside to assist customers.
bad,My manager was pawning his tasks off on other employees.Other employees would preform tasks poorly causing you to work even harder to keep the store in good shape. Also I dealt with the most irate customers I have ever seen. Mostly caused by some other employee that gave them the wrong part.They will take it out on you even though you were not the one that sold them the wrong part.
bad,"Honestly this job is more than a regular sales job. They force you to sell objects that people dont really need and when you dont they cut everyones hours making it harder to work. Where do you know where 2 people 1 being a CSR and the other being a manager have to run the whole store by themselves including checking batteries,check engine lights and helping people with car parts. Its crazy hectic and at the beginning horrible since people expect you to know whats wrong with their car."
bad,I have seen a lot of favoritism take place within the time I had spent with the company. People are sleeping with each other and there is more drama than you can believe. The management is a joke they do not care about anything and will turn a blind eye to everything.
bad,"Days at work are long and arduous. I learned that a large percentage of consumers do not know much about automotives."
bad,Its okay place to work its a get by job. They pay okay but it can be a lot better . You want move up in the company any unless you know someone.
bad,"Well if you want a place were you could be yourself and make your own schedule then this is the place to work the pay is not much, company car, and discount of parts is not bad,,"
bad,High pace fun place to work. Auto Zone offers a great platform for there customer to complete simple and complex automotive tasks.
bad,it is a job not a career. for the most part it is the same thing over and over again. i do enjoy helping the customers but i feel that there are too many obstacles that you have to go through when it comes to the paper work side of the job to get a result that really only needed one simple step to achieve it.
bad,the company is great the parts are awesome and have a lot of good people working with this company but the upper management in the particular district i worked in sucked the dm would curse you on conference calls with your peers and in the store with those working under you undermining your management athority
bad,"wants you to enforce company policies, has you written when customers make complaints when following company guidelines on returns, exchanges, warranties, then terminates your employment for not following company policies"
bad,Relaxed work environment. Easy advancement and a great learning experiance.
bad,"I was hired with certain promises if I would join AutoZone as a professional. All of the promises were broken. The pay was decent, but the treatment grew steadily worse as I was reorged until I ended up working under a particularly bad director, bad manager, and bad team lead. The benefits were good. The pay was good. The technology was outdated and they showed little interest in moving out of the past. The software culture was fast and wreckless, fling it out errors and all and then let someone else deal with the consequences. Contractors were treated horribly badly. For everyone else it depended on what department you were in and who your boss was."
bad,"A typical day at work is helping out others. What I have learned is that there are companies who won't work with you when one is furthering ones education. There are many obstacles that keep us from achieving our goals. I have also learned that I enjoy working in management and helping out others, giving advice, delegating, and having responsibility. My co-workers are great, each one different in their own way but I enjoy working with them each and everyday. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help every customer out with their problem, but I do enjoy helping those that I can and enjoy how much one can appreciate ones help."
bad,starting wage is not good at all if you do not start as supervisor.
bad,Good for people who want a nice part time job. Have to be a people person though and know at least a little about cars. Those are just recommendations though.
bad,"If your looking for money,this is not the job to find it. But if you're looking to learn about parts come this the place,"
bad,going in getting my RFready finding were your going to be at maybe i would be on the floor and maybe on a picker . then its was so hot and very cold in the winter and the hardest part of the job was lifting 80 to 100 pounds when you didnt have any help
bad,"I was a driver, it was a great job. Typical day at work was ok, I worked hard no play time. I learned alot of different things about cars. Management wasn't ethical, but outside the job the boss was ok."
bad,I loved working with people and handling their concerns and problems to the best of my ability.  I loved being able to diagnose problems and order right products to keep customers happy
bad,"Autozone showed me how greedy corporations are, first hand. For example, at xmas time, when corporate cuts your already part time hours, to beef up their XMAS bonuses. So for the month of Dec, you work 0-7 hr /wk. Instead  of your usual 15-20hrs @$10/hr. They did allow some $ for us to have a xmas party every yr, it was enough to buy a large pizza for ALL the employees to  share!"
bad,"The biggest annual pay raise you’ll see is probably three cents, i started at $9.50 and left six years later at $10. Most management is extremely lazy."
bad,"When I first started, work life was fun competitive and flexible. Now there are so many tasks with very little people and negative upper management. We work 10-12 hours a day and still aren’t good enough. We see our store more than we see our family and still DMs and RMs never ask if we’re happy. It’s always “you knew what you were signing up for” and don’t even think about calling HR because the way it works is upper management sticks together no matter what."
bad,"Same as most companies: call you in on your off day, expecting those who make the least to do the most work. I worked here for three years and got little to no recognition from upper management. There is room for growth, but even if you love the job like I did, the support is not there so eventually you get tired of being the only one running the store. Turnover is terrible, Autozone doesn't want to pay red shirts so management will be in the store 6 days a week, putting away the truck, running sales and audits, and doing planograms AND inventory matrix so everything won't get done. There is a handful of solid managers but most only want the big bonus at the end of the year so they won't hire new employees, meaning the store won't be properly staffed, MEANING its you and one other person on a busy Saturday night; all of the returns won't get put away, people will be stealing and leaving open packages because there isn't enough staff to cover the sales floor, and there will be upset customers. "
bad,"Work place was a dream for the about 7 months, new management came in and place started to fall apart. People tend to leave due to pay, management & unnecessary drama."
bad,It’s a very fast paced job most of the time because we have a lot of customers at our store location. Sometimes it can be stressful but the managers at the store make it way more stressful than it should already be.
bad,"There is never an easy day always short staffed."
bad,This company will make big presentations to make themselves look good to the public. They do not care about employees. Scheduling is not flexablie even though they say it is.  Management only looking to better themselves leaving the smaller folk to fend for themselves.
bad,"A typical work day started off by waiting hours to receive calls for customers ordering. It was very slow paced and we mainly spent our shift restocking and cleaning the store instead of being actual commercial drivers. The work load was easy, I enjoyed the flexibility they had with my school schedule."
bad,Interes x clientes y poca importancia ensu pesonal
bad,Looked up parts and helped people find info on there vehicle.Ran cash register.Did bank drops Did online training as necessary.Delivered parts to shops as needed
bad,Made you feel like you didn't belong with the company. Under paid you for the work you did/do even though you've had several part stores under your belt.
bad,Not enough hours everyone is on part-time under the amount needed to receive benefits. High turn over of employees. Friendly people though good manager.
bad,"I would not recommend this place to anyone, but if you need a job they are always hiring. I wish I had better things to say. They are always hiring I wonder why...."
bad,"It’s a decent part time job if you’re in school, but working full time for minimum wage isn’t going to cut it if you want a career. Management is always flexible with scheduling if you have something pop up to do too."
bad,A normal associate part time will usually make minimum wage but a manager who is full time will make usually a dollar more than minimum for 10x the work. Management should be paid more in the future. This company makes big profit on the parts. All parts at Autozone are re branded. Just look at Rockauto and you'll see what I mean.
bad,"the compensation for management positions are not up to par with today's cost of living. So you'll have a manager with high responsibility, higher stress and he or she can barely pay to live comfortably. the qualifications for bonus are also flawed as you have to meet a minimum set amount to qualify and a percentage above last year to determine your bonus. Sounds great unless youre in a low traffic location or your store is in a saturated area. youre ability to make a bonus for increased sales becomes harder to obtain. "
bad,what I learned at auto zone would be the sales experience and working on the cash register. it would also be working with customers. auto zone is good for experience.
bad,"A typical day at Autozone was normal, and I've learned a few mechanical skills. The management was Alright. The hardest part about my job was customer service I couldn't handle the tempers and personalities that were thrown at me."
bad,"After working in a parts department, I thought i would like this job however i found it hard to get along with some of the people there and they made it hard for me to work."
bad,"when I started it was a great job with a lot of career potential, 12yrs later it had become very political, it became all about the profit and loss, knowledge and experience are no longer a must, if you can learn who to use a computer that's all you need."
bad,You will need some warehouse experience in order to make it at autozone. Tough place to work. Very hot in summer time and chilly in the winter time...
bad,"A very fast paced business that puts customer needs before anything else.  The work is enjoyable but time sensitive and labor intense.  Traveling to other stores was fun also, but demand is high."
bad,I liked auto zone the hours the team members my duperviouser the breaks the everything I didn't to much like the pay but overall it was a great experience .
bad,I like the job but I don't get hardly any hours. The employees and management are very friendly and good to work with. They schedule you to work then they call you and tell you not to come in that they don't need you.
bad,"driving store to store delivering car parts picking them up from N.Y. to P.A. you get to use their company vehicle,stocking products helping costumers finding car parts."
bad,was alot to do very busy with all the places in the store . had alot of accounts which was nice enjoyed staying busy all the time when i was employed wth this company
bad,I learned a lot here and with this experience I came along to also supervise another company which was Advanced auto parts being able to manage two different stores made me gain a lot of learning experiences.
bad,The only reason to work here is to learn about car parts. Management is usually awful and the stores are always in shambles.
bad,"Provided positive customer care for hundreds of customers each day."
bad,"Changing, and testing batteries was part of a typical day for me."
bad,"Its okay. Auto-zone really works with you, and the employees are fun to work with. But there is no room for improvement. And the hours suck, is seems like your on call all the time."
bad,"I begin my day by driving out visiting a store in one of my markets. We have a conference call each morning to talk about pervious days results and goals."
bad,was a good job just didnt like the management. was in service at the time and they didnt wanna work with me as much as they had said.
bad,Autozone was my first occupation and I learned my people skills and administration skills there.
bad,this is a job where corporate tells you what you are gonna do without having any knowledge of what the store is like
bad,"Its retail, if you dont have a high tolerance for ignorant people then its not a job for you."
bad,"Is very difficult to have professional growth in this company, because for  advancing  to another position , is depending on managers opinion and not  professionals skills needed for it."
bad,"help customers"
bad,If they would get off your back on the red prairie rate things would b better ! The hard workers is the ones who suffer and the slackers is the ones who mess it up for everyone !
bad,"I just recently started working part time as a hub driver for this company, the job it self I love it’s common sense really.The thing that bothers me is that the managers at the hub and some of the store managers at each store.They look down on you some of them are very nasty and sarcastic.Its horrible  to say but you can never say you love this job because the managers make fun of you for it."
bad,Working at Auto zone is good because of the environment and the work with the people. The job tasks that are asked at auto zone are not hard as it may seem even when you don’t know anything about cars.
bad,"It's a okay job. It's an easy job. If you are people's person, you will work well there. You get to learn about different parts that you've never known."
bad,Apply and find out for yourself. Be ready for interesting situations. Under paid for what they require as an employee. Better off going to get a position as a service writer or tech
bad,Your starting out at 8.75 and every raise takes a year and it’s only 25 cents don’t do It to yourself and if you start out as a manager good luck on training
bad,I appreciate the knowledge i picked up while working at this job and i can't complain about working for tis company.. the hardest part was the way i was doubted or overlooked by some customers because I'm a girl.
bad,I thought my overall interview was really good I told them what I was expecting for wanted them to be comparable to my current job $14.00 an hour they offered me $12.75 an hour benefits would’ve been great through Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota but nobody can afford to go backwards let alone take a pay cut life is too expensive
bad,Some stores are like family if you get the right one. Then some stores are so uptight and do not work together as ONE TEAM as it should be. Some managers think they are above everyone else and talk down to you and treat you like you don’t matter
bad,"Was hired as a Commercial Parts Delivery driver. All was good until they brought in a new manager who is a company troubleshooter, he just changed all the work responsibilities.  He wanted way more work from part timers than what you were being paid for."
bad,"The underline company motto is AutoZone before anything else. In my district, the company comes before your family, health, and education. I ended up falling ill with the flu at work, was asked why sales were low for the day stated I was sick and waiting for another employee to come on. This was all before 11 am, upper management stated that if I stopped acting sick then maybe I could do my job. Another employee had to take his baby daughter to the hospital for having trouble breathing they stated that he needed to schedule this 2 weeks out. This is just the top of the iceberg, what happens with the warranty systems concerning commercial accounts is laughable. I've seen a starter fail from defect and the company passed it off as improper installation or mechanic error so as not to pay."
bad,"I started working for a new warehouse in my area shortly after it opened. The management was horrid. No consistency among managers, everyone would tell you a different way to do things and then you'd get in trouble for doing it one way instead of another. Everything done wrong was usually due to management incompetence but somehow it always ended up being the workers fault, even though we were just following orders. Hopefully it's better now, but it was terrible when I was there."
bad,Just don't. do it to yourself. My autozone you work alot but get little out of it. If you never worked before or just came to the country and need a little spending money cool go ahead. But in my experience its not a place to make a career with in.
bad,"a typical work day would consist of approving returns, making a bank order/change order be accountable for schedules an employees. knowledge about the sales an customer service an also planograms. i learned alot about customer service, sales, an management. District manager typically mistreated employees an set a bad example in my opinion. The culture was comfortable an clean thought. I disagreed on the pay an manager"
bad,slow job management was loony be doing things bass ackwards. lazy mangers that would sit around district manager to busy brown nosing to notice or he just didn't care
bad,"Wasn't paid enough, got trained for management, district leader forgot who I was after our hour long interview together. Wanted me to work overtime for less than average pay for the job (driver) in the area relative to competing stores."
bad,Company does not appreciate or pays its employees very well.  The company culture says one thing but the actions are opposite.  There is no room for advancement and diversity is only a buzzword.  HR changes the rules as it suits them.  Pay is terrible and upper management ignores that issues.  The talk is about loving your people and other non-leadership nonsense.
bad,with the right place this would be a good place to work but there are a few things that I did not agree with but over all it was a decent place to work for
bad,"Not good at all, they just care about the numbers no the staff, Had great Managers in the past but the new one does not know how to treat people, he belittles them and micromanages so you never get to complete a task."
bad,"AutoZone is a decent place to work, helps one get there foot into the automotive industry. Learn something new everyday whether it be from co workers or even customers. Overall not too bad."
bad,"Unless you learn Spanish you will never move up with this company. Hard place to work. must be on your feet 8-10 hours a day. Unless you are looking for a part time job, not the place to work. This company has no value for employees and figures if one leaves, they will hire another."
bad,"I worked there in college, and really enjoyed working with the rest of the people there. The manager of the store (and district manager by extension) dictate whether it will be enjoyable, or terrible. I had one of each."
bad,"If you wasn't in their ""click"" you was treated differently. It was like a dating site/place for employees. Managers would not back up with what they said to you. Very rude while customers was in store"
bad,"Great place for younger people. Not very good pay and no benefits if your part-time. If your young and eager to stay with it for many years, it may pay off."
bad,Fun job if you are in to automotive repair need to know some Spanish to communicate with those that don't speak English a lot not a lot of room for advancements kinda low pay good hours
bad,I learned so much in customer service and how sell products in retail department  and commercial department. Through out the years I have made so many connections from different company's and showing what I am capable of.
bad,"the job itself was about what i expected, however, i quickly found out there was more of a salesmen side to it.  if a customer came in for a specific part we were supposed to try to sell them extras, some of witch were not even related to what their project was"
bad,A typical day at work included many things. Main thing was always putting a big focus on sales. If you had to change a car battery or change a light bulb to make the sale they wanted you too
bad,"This company will constantly ask more of you and add more work to your job title without giving a raise and/or compensation. If minimum wage goes up and your making more than that, you won't get a raise. Meaning a new employee is making only a little less than someone who's put a lot of time into the company."
bad,"Working at Auto Zone was a job that was not something I wanted to do but did it to make ends meet.  Working at the company, showed me how to adapt to different environments and people.  It also taught me how to stay focused on the end result no matter where I was in life."
bad,It's a good place to work the people are great to work with and the environment is good just do not like how slow it's takes for a promotion to go through
bad,"If you want to fill all of your time with a job, this would be the place to go. Hours are plentiful, although pay is not up to par. Benefits are quite good though"
bad,Auto zone can be a very fun place to work if you like helping people out with their cars. You can learn a lot due to your coworkers knowing a lot about cars. Usually the managers are horrible and only out for them selves.
bad,"a day at auto zone open store count draws (moneys), sell auto parts work with customers supervision of staff,  inventory control, accounting, deposits,"
bad,"wait for customers to come in the store."
bad,"i was working at the least 6 days a week with 10-12 hour days. very fast pace job, with very little help. my location was severely under staffed......"
bad,"The Management needs to look more closely into is the handling paperwork and if its done properly. If some one puts in for family emergency and is given the ok to be off. They should have to worry about getting there jobs back when they come back from leave, Nor should they have been fired for no call no shows when they should have been on the schedule anyway."
bad,"Poor management. Although work environment is fast paced, which is a great thing, management takes no notes. They don't do anything to come up with a solution. They think they know everything and never want to listen to the people actually doing they're job."
bad,"hours were not consistent, training was poor and or non existent. upper management was not in touch with the customers or the customers needs. Was able to learn about different vehicles which has helped in my current job."
bad,manager is great but dm is racist. if you are not Hispanic your not worth anything to the district manager. the store manager is an awesome manager with a great personality
bad,"The job is done with two associates on all the time, "
bad,"working within the tribal community, i was not comfortable working for this business. there was more tension towards non tribal workers"
bad,Was rear ended while making a delivery and was on work restrictions so the cut my hours so much I was forced to quit. They also lost my paycheck more than once.
bad,"easy work but you start as part time, minimum wage 20 hours a week  repetitive work if u don't like that type of work. learned about car parts and different cars, management is ok"
bad,This was a great job for a part-time college student for a while.  Then the writing on the wall became clear that the upper management teams do not care about the happiness or the morale of the employees working for them.  This is why I am currently on the hunt for a new job.  Morale is terrible and the wage is bad for someone who has been there for almost five years.
bad,Autozone would be a better place to work if there was proper training. they throw you on the floor instantly which can slow down productivity in others. In other terms than that its okay.
bad,"Mostly everyone is cool, but there is always those managers that want to blame others for the job not getting done, and a high turn over rate. I did a year was offered a management position, however I declined to due the low compensation (1.50-2.00) raise."
bad,I had an unpleasant experience at this job after coming from a couple of jobs that I really enjoyed. I felt it was a mistake to take the job after only a couple of months.
bad,This job is soley to earn money while passing time. Standing all day and breaks cut short for their own gain. The hours didn't add up on the paychecks. there was no structure or dicsipline.
bad,sold autoparts to the people who came into the store looking to fix their cars. i stocked the parts that came in the store from the warehouse
bad,"ok nothing exiting rally helping customers on daily bases, deliveivery are sometimes far depens on were you work... ive wondnt work there gain base on my experince"
bad,I'm not going to put anyone down but I used to work at O'Reilly Auto Parts for three years before i worked for AutoZone. The way they treat you there is just flat out better.
bad,"I personally believe this district is one of the worst districts I have ever worked for. The management confidentiality is nonexistent. You can't approach anyone for your problems, because instead of being handled and dealt with accordingly, they speak with you, hear your concerns then, for lack of a better phrase, sweep it under the rug. They are not interested in the advancement of the individuals who deserve it. They aren't interested in paying you for what you deserve, I have more than proven myself and my abilities to the company, yet there are individuals who make more than me and cannot perform on the level that I have. I would not, and will not recommend working for Autozone in the North Florida region. I have worked for other regions though, that I didn't have any complaints about. They were professional and they genuinely wanted to help people advance and become amazing employees to benefit the company as a whole."
bad,I learned how to manage commercial accounts and drive commercial vehicles the hardest part of the job would be the language barriers between customers the best part would be working around cars
bad,I did not like this job at all.  They are very unorganized and it is unclear if they care about making a profit or having great customer service.  They treat employees and customers horrible.
bad,As a temp the job was pretty simple. Once hired on it got a little more difficult.
bad,If you are in high school or a 13 year old looking for a job then this is the place to be.
bad,"Waste of time to work for this company. 80% turn around rate on new employees. Employees are used to let go constantly. Poor management from District Manager and up. Co-Workers in my store were sub par at best, Hired younger group of teens that did not want to work, With no real life responsibilities."
bad,running a crew and making sure orders are completed in a timely manner
bad,"Responsible for complete operational duties of the store and assigned daily tasks for store associates to complete in a timely and professional manner."
bad,AutoZone became very corporate driven with scheduling of skeleton crews making for very difficult work environment.
bad,Low employee morale; corporate makes rules for the sake of making rules; out-of-date technology
bad,Helped customers with problem solving with automotive issues.
bad,"A typical day at work would include servicing customers with all their autoparts needs, but also restocking inventory and keeping store area clean and safe for customers. I have learned how to sell and explain benefits on most products on our shelves as well as selling auto parts along with related products to ensure the customers does not need to make to trips and ensuring the parts stay sold. Management was great I always felt comfortable working around them and they always encourage learning and advancing within the company. I worked with some great people, some who hated their job, but the majority loved the job and loved taking care of the customers I always enjoyed their positive vibes. The job was easy no hard parts at all most enjoyable part of my job was applying my automotive knowledge to help customers with any question they had or choosing the right parts they needed."
bad,Check all accounts for new deliveries and orders. Deliver the orders and offer products to clients. Assist the team when shipment would arrive.
bad,Enjoyed working and communicating with others
bad,always on the go good peapole to work for laerned alot met new peapole
bad,It's a great place to work at and grow if you like the warehouse industry
bad,great to advance and again just will hold management resposible for things out of thier control
bad,"they don’t promote the hard working and dedicated people, they promote the arrogant and rude employees that give Autozone the bad name. There are people there that have been employed for 20+ years and I don’t know how they made it. They don’t promote the people that want it and will do well. This isn’t a job to stay long term if you actually want to move up and make money to provide for your family. The pay is a joke. It is barely enough to cover the necessities."
bad,"Not the best but it wasn't the worst either. i learned a lot about Cars even my own,the auto zone family is very influential to be better at everythin"
bad,The pay rates and benefits weren't competitive to other employers.  The staff and management was great to work with but I feel as if they were underpaid as well which put stress on them.
bad,Pretty hard to live off of autozone salary poor management but extremely good people to work with it is definetly a interesting experience. Looking for something serious and full time with better pay and hours and management
bad,No raises over a quarter in 3 years. No opportunity for drivers to get full.time hours. Cannot live off such low salary. Cannot predict hours you will get scheduled therefore never knowing what.youd make that week. You just knew it wouldnt be enough.to survive
bad,Enjoyed the challenge of finding the hard to find part(s). Enjoyed the majority of my customers. Most upper Management good but there was those that used you as a stepping stone to get a promotion. A lot of brown nosing!
bad,Good place to start off if you want to set foot in the auto parts industry. Everything is fast pace when it comes to learning and selling. Days go by fast for the simple reason that you will see high volume in customers.
bad,"Auto Zone was a fun experience, I launched several stores up in sales through my 4 year run, District Managers were paid bonus based on my sales, and took advantage as far as not moving me forward"
bad,Autozone is a ok company to work for if your looking to move up or just a parttime side job. Hours were decent and tasks were easy to finish. Even without car knowledge anybody can do this job.
bad,It was a corporate job so it stayed the same most days just only the gm was unfair would not give me days I requested off even if I had a month in advanced
bad,"I am very thank full to autozone they teach me everything that I know about the car nw from driving to receiving clark, dispatch,cashier and salesman."
bad,"As a Manager you have to start the checklist as soon as you dis-alarm the store your day is started; you get a max. of 3 min from unlocking the doors to dis-alarm, turn on the lights of the store, go straight to checking in/out inventory for loss prevention. Prepare the money from the safe that will be accounted for yesterdays work, and sign-off on a spreadsheet for misread calculations. With-in a 15 min time frame, the second person that will be working the morning shift with you will start @7:30. typically two people start the day and two people close the store; different associates clock-in midday. The customers were everyday people with minor to major issues going on with their car, it was our duty to check engine/alternator/test batteries if need be. And to assist with any further findings per car make/model basis. Look up car parts and either order car part if unavailable in stock, search other stores or places who may have the part, and give personal references of a valued list of mechanics, if necessary to assist."
bad,the most enjoyable part of my job would be working with the  customers. I love meeting new people and talking to people. the customers give me life and I truly am blessed to have them come in the store
bad,"If you love cares once again this is the place for you, I learned the true meaning of multitasking here to be honest. Very fast pace"
bad,"Company gives everything to customers, but doesn't take care of employees.  Minimal pay, and benefits.  Long hours."
bad,i liked my job but there was things that i got to higher management that got me fired
bad,Would not recommend working there if you don’t have knowledge of cars. Customers frequently get rude as they expect you to be able to fix their car for them.
bad,"Typical day at work I always battled with my sinus simply "
bad,I learn a lot about more about car and parts.. more of the time I was driving parts to different store.. its not hard job.. you just have to learn adreses and store that u going be carful driving they car
bad,It is a very fast paced job you are graded by production but is it is very hard to meet. The Managers were friendly and tried to help. very hard to meet production.
bad,"Mala organizacion en el rol de horarios y descansos, lo que vale rescatar es la inducción al buen trato al cliente"
bad,You can see why they are number one in auto parts retail.Good people .
bad,"The workers at autozone in my experience were great to work with. They dont belittle you, they are not ""pseudoprofessional"" meaning they like to have fun and are genuine rather than put on a hard @55 front and annoy you, but the corporation is just like any other and only care about generating money. Low wage :("
bad,"I am a current employee at autozone in outbound, I love my schedule mon-thurs. But the hours suck along with the pay. The longer you can try to stay your able to get your raise thats when its a little beneficial, but they cut your hours. Schedule time is 7:30am to 5:30 pm for my shift.  Never know if I will clock out before or after 5:30pm not a set schedule but as soon as you hit 38hrs for the week you get kicked out... Absolutely alot of favoritism, very few will be able to work more than 40hrs and offered overtime. Very strict on production so you have to work very fast to keep your numbers up or recieve corrective actions until you get terminated so far surviving 1 year and a half. They claim to offer lots of opportunites get promoted off the floor and offered to travel to different az dc's but only if your pretty... Rare if your an actual good hard working employee. My schedule and benefits are the only reason I have stayed this long very hard to find this type of schedule. But as far as the co-workers on the floor, few are annoying, majority are awesome and make work bareable"
bad,Fantastic job I f*** love being a hub driver buuuut the pay sucks 10.00 is not enough to live off of ...I really would appreciate a raise like I was supposed to get but az doesn't follow their own policy's
bad,The people I work with are awesome. I'm part time while going to school so the low pay doesn't really affect my life but they pay their long term full time employees jack. My manager works 70 hours a week on salary (so they don't have to pay him overtime) and it comes out to a little under 13 dollars an hour. He's never complained about it but I'm a Snoop and I did the math. They treat good employees poorly
bad,My typical day at work would consist of unloading truck at the hub lifting heavy car parts and sorting organizing them in the order the store management design the satisfaction for customers.
bad,"•	Motivates store AutoZoners to provide WOW! Customer Service, enhance productivity level and market products to improve sales and profits."
bad,I work at autozone for 3 weeks and I only got one 12 hour training day (paid I’m told) and then two 4 hour days they never told me if I was full or part time and they never paid me I never got any hours anyway though
bad,"Escuchar más a los empleados, no humillarlos y sentirse superior"
good,poor place to work honestly I  wouldn't advise anyone to apply out there I would never go back and the turnover ratio is just super crazy and they say safety is number one but I dissagree
good,No one will ever care how hard your working.Your told you got 90 days to learn your job .Thats a lie If you cant keep there rate in 2 weeks Your fired. There rate is beyond what you can do Overtime in 60 days and you have to do it. Dress code red shirt black jeans pants skirt black sneakers only Very hot aloud drinks Pay every 2 weeks When you start it takes 3 weeks to get a full pay.They claim they care about safety Several got really injured A lady had huge hole in ankle Wasn’t even taken to hospital Dont be there next victim The work is very hard.They do pay you good money They fire 20 people a night Yes it is this bad.Very long process to also get started working also Even the best cant survive this place. You will be treated poorly They Dont care Pick the cart metal . Even loading trucks You will be in lots of pain. There are companies beating there 16.15 salary for nights around Who do care about there workers
good,They laid off to much to keep from giving benefits. Do temps and use them to get work done and then when they should be moved up they laid they off to keep from giving benefits to worker.
good,"If  you have no place else to work, it's a job. But hard to survive of the pay, and hours. Pay is not that great, and turnover rate is high. Hard to keep people if you do not pay them a living wage. Also to many managers,and not enough workers."
good,"I was very happy appoint as customer satisfaction manager but I wonder their is no roll to perform as a designated post. my experience from past and education is more then enough how to promote sell and satisfied customer with their need and advise them the necessary inputs but here is lacking of few major things mutual respect and coordination.   "
good,"high demands, under staffed, not a set schedule. When it was scheduled it would be a day before the next week started. preference over certain individuals."
good,"Not a bad company to work for if your a male, in my case I am female and had to work to times harder to prove myself to my co workers and upper management. Cooperate managers have no regards for their employees or their health and are mist concerned with bottom dollar."
good,"if you have experience in automotive parts, you'll do well, if you don't this job can be intimidating, but the staff is willing to help you learn what you need to know."
good,"If you can't sale they are total jerks to you, employee discount is not enough and they refuse to give you full time no matter how loyal you are to the job."
good,"steady work, retail inside environment is tollarable. rotating shifts to the benifit of the company, which means you cannot get a part time job at another company."
good,Has been very interesting to work here.  Learned many new things about automotive parts and service that I never knew before.  Hard to get things changed due to corporate management so staffing is not always the best.
good,pay sucks and this job requires you to do so much extra work that leaves you tired all the time and stuck in the same job with no real benefits
good,"Lot of customer complaints about previous staff from customers."
good,"while my initial experiences at autozone were positive, i quickly learned that advancement was difficult to attain, management did not care for its employees, and many qualified people were passed by for outside hires"
good,The manange over sells the career opportunity and grossly under delivers in the training and opportunities that they provide for an individual to have the type of career that the present. The main issue is complete lack of work life balance.
good,Great for those looking into getting to know basic vehicle needs Parts & Chemicals. Good retail experience as well as putting forth good customer service experience.
good,Its a good starting job but not good for a career.depending on what store you are at the management can be very poor or very good over all it is not the best place to work
good,Work to many long hours daily; and weekly.  Not given any credit or recognitions for a job well done.  Discriminatory comments and gestures.  Could've been a better place to work if they followed their culture and mission statements.
good,Nothing to say about AutoZone. More of a high school kids job. Pay wasn't great and management either agreed to take a certain positive position and the whole script flipped.
good,"Your typical job, mangers feel that they aren't required to do any work  so they leave it to you to do. You will be told your being hired for one position, but once you get your foot in the door your being told something else. You don't get paid enough to deal with the BS that goes on there."
good,the company has very high standards they want every store to meet. you are constantly compared to other stores in the area. hard to maintain 40 hours a week for most positions. they demand you up sale every customer. you have multiple products they want you to push on every customer at all times. they don't like to promote people or give raises. health insurance is costly and they don't cover much. constantly had to call insurance about not paying
good,"The hardest part of this job was to see the light in the end of the tunnel. "
good,long hours no respect your just a number no future  nights weekends no time for family or hobbies no over time work every holiday very seldom to you get any breaks expected to work on your lunch off the clock
good,"A typical day was usually awesome, fun, easy, energenic. But then those times when you would have an issue, managers wouldnt listen, would lie to your face, and sometimes even talk about you behind your back! They tend to pick and choose favorites, whether the favorite had good work ethics or not, it didnt matter. Basically you will be overworked, under paid, unappreciated, and overlooked."
good,"The work environment was good, but management could have been better. I worked in the commercial department, and when we were busy up front the parts going to shops had to wait so i could help with customers in the store. I thought all customers where important."
good,This job does not pay well or offer benefits but to managers. Also there is not enough hours or days. Sometimes the atmosphere is hostile due to rude and inconsiderate customer's. The management is okay. The hardest part is when people are demanding things. The enjoyable thing is the other employee's you work with.
good,It was a great  work place where the practice of customer service was a every day practice. Management of the store did not properly trained new employees
good,Working at AutoZone was overall very frustrating. The management team was uncoordinated. While working at AutoZone for a year there were 3 different store mangers and 2 different district managers.
good,"Open store do morning paper work, assign employee to tills. push sales and make sure they are being offered."
good,"Auto Zone is a good company, but they treat their employees very bad.  The hours suck especially for me cause I am I single parent.  They would never work with me and cut my hours.  If sales were bad they sent employees home and I never seemed to get my 40 hours."
good,"auto zone started off a good, I would clock in and help customers get what they need and walk around the store and clean stuff."
good,Upon taking the job you go into the MIT program as a manager there is no support for your training there is no clear sight of the training or that it is training you  following the training manager aroundhelping them just do their job
good,"Auto Zone is the worst company I’ve ever worked for. The pay is horrible for the work that we’re expected to do and the hours aren’t great unless you’re a full time Commercial Driver/Sales. Don’t expect to move up in the company unless you’re in good with the DM and other managers, they will have you in “training” for months having you do the work but offer up excuses when it’s time to move up."
good,Me contrataron para venta de autopartes y como tengo mucha experiencia de años no les cai bien a los engendros supervisores que me hicieron la vida imposible. La primer semana tran quila y despues te ponen quehaceres varios como lavar baños limpiar pisos limpieza general de partes y estantes cajero vigilante carga y descargarga puf
good,Excellent customer service... environment could use some brightening up ...as well as systems as matrix could be updated...overall it was a easy paces place to work out
good,"It was an alright job, definitely not a career type. Worked at a 24 hour store, but schedules and all aspects were chaotic and unorganized. Loved the schedule and work when first started out, but after the first month and a new manager, work, home and school life where becoming a problem. Did not respect my school schedule and respect me as an employee or even as a person. But all stores are different and your experience will vary."
good,"Very little understanding of the work life values from the company, "
good,I have been on third shift since the start. They have a lot of promises but nothing ever happens. At the end of the day only the select few Autozoner's have to stay late and pull slack from others who couldn't pull their own load. The ones that have been around since the beginning are tired of it but it seems to fall on deaf ears of management
good,"Working for this place was good at the beginning, but quickly became unfair as to the favoritism that happens daily. People aren't expected to do their jobs but seem to be rewarded anyway."
good,"The pay is the only thing that is great here but management not so much. Don’t communicate well, rude, and don’t like color be asked questions about doing everyday tasks."
good,"Autozone used to be a good company. Lately, it’s all about the numbers you make. Corporate doesn’t care about staffing issues, and expect you to hit your target even if you only have two people working per shift."
good,Too high expectations on selling. Trying to push products the customers do not want. Open too late at night (9:00pm). Customers expect for you to have all the answers for repairing the vehicle.
good,Autozone was a good place to work to learn more about the auto industry.Which helped me to be prepared for when i own my own vehicle.I learned more about car parts.
good,it was a temporary job. long hours on your feet. short lunches. lots and lots of overtime if your into that sort of thing. pretty good money but not my cup of tea
good,"To many hours, not enough help for customers. "
good,I didn't have a great experience working here. I got treated unfairly by the GM and got sexually harassed by the district manager. I quit my last job that I loved because I was promised a position that I never got. I was miserable and my hours were not consistent.
good,High turnover and poor management.  Selling auto parts is not rocket science and should be a lot of fun were it not for the imcompetence of leadership at all levels.
good,What I enjoyed mostly was getting out of the store and talking with the community members.  Gaining their trust on my store services and then providing them with excellent services from my store to their company.  I was very successful for my District.
good,"Working for Auto Zone was a challenge. Auto Zone promotes their mission and values, although they are not followed. Auto Zone puts high importance on small packets of lubrication for various items and Auto Zone rewards cards. They make it sound like your job is on the line if you don't sell these items or get every customer to sign up for a rewards card, which takes the focus away from customer service and taking care of them."
good,Job was okay to much rough clientel in my area was something more comforting I enjoyed working there just something with better pay and better benefits
good,"very unorganized and employees really do not know anything about automobiles. they just hire any one who they think know something about cars, if you want to learn about parts then its a good place to start off."
good,"Every drop off was timed. I would drive out of Fresno several times and had to be back by a certain time. that wasn't including traffic, accidents or construction. Balancing two job was easy but it wasn't worth putting my life on the line because there was so many crazy drivers on the road. Also I was be driving out in the country when the sun went down with no road side assistance available."
good,Never felt welcomed . management wasn't helpful. Work was nice helping people and seeing them relieved when we were able to assist with the product desired.
good,Very busy and fast paced work atmosphere. I was put in charge of many tasks and management relations and excelled in every aspect of the job.
good,Just another job. Moving up or getting raises are hard to come by
good,Dealing with the general public and sales. I didn't really care for the company much after I had a 3rd boss who just had it honestly out for me. I had it at that point and got in with their competitor and was definitely worth the transition. Autozone was a waste of time in my book and knew how to run the store with my eyes closed and was still was not part of management.
good,"	Perform administrative functions for Senior Management."
good,No recived any promotion. For acended any evaluations
good,The job itself was fine. Just the people working there were very rude! They would start unnecessary drama. They accused me of accusing someone else for something and then they trash talked and treated me horribly! Even the manager cut my hours after I was falsely accused. No matter what I said or did she still cut my hours. I was down to 4 hours a week! No way you can live off of $50 paychecks!
good,Recent cooperation changes made the company hard to work for. None of the changers were for the better of the company. All it did was make current employees look for other employment .
good,Do not go into upper management positions if you actually like the job and want to keep it. Any parts sales position is great if you have an open availability.
good,If you violate one of there employment polices you can be terminated. As for the company (at least the store I worked at) they don't care about employee or public health by breaking OSHA  rules  and regulations.
good,"This job is perfect for military retirees and people who really like cars, but for everyone else there are better jobs out there. Lots of empty promises and moving goalposts on a corporate level, store level has rampant nepotism and favoritism, leading to poor morale and high turnover. Pay is below average and hours are hard to come by. There are benefits available, but full coverage for a single Male with no kids takes at least a third of a full time paycheck,  every check"
good,"It is good job. But you never knew your hours and never was told things until to late. I feel it is good for younger kids for starter job but to advance at , its who you know"
good,"The only benefit to Autozone that I found was the actual employees who seemed cool (at times) and I learned a variety of things about cars that I will never forget, hence is a great skill to have that I appreciate."
good,Al menos donde me tocó trabajar le daría 1 sola estrella porque el trabajo es súper pesado la paga es poca y los genes pesimos
good,I feel like they did teach a lot. But the training was not long enough. They should have a few days of training before they throw you out there especially with no experience.
good,i like the old autozone not the new autozone the people they bring on to no nothing about cars but they look good and the playing with cell phone at work is wrong both red shirt and gray shirt!!!!!!
good,30+ hrs one week 12to15 hrs the next week. Manager set on cell phone all day taking selfies and what not and got mad when he had to get up for management approval.
good,A normal day at work consist of fast past and tedious work. Ive learned how to reduce the work load in a timely fashion. The managers are very cut throat and lack respect for others. The workplace is pretty diverse and everyone respect ones space. The hardest part of the job is not being respected . The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid and seeing co-workers.
good,Helping people with car trouble was great no thank you i would rether find a job that pays well and makes me feel good about my day live long be happpy
good,Management was not reachable when needed. It was very slow paced and not much room for improvement or advancement of my career. Not understanding of personal life.
good,"I didn't learn any management skills. I had fun learning how to fix cars and learning about them, Not a very good workplace though, I wouldn't advise working here unless you don't want to grow."
good,"AutoZone is a great place to work if you have a good manager. The customers are challanging at times but no more than anywhere else. I learned a lot about cars that I did not know. However, Management was horrible!!! The work load was placed on 3:8 employees while others either watched you work or turned into a ghost."
good,"I left Autozone in 2005 after 3 years, part time then full time. I just retired and went back to Autozone for a part time job just to supplement my social security. I was offered a part sales manager job for 5 cents more on the hour. So that's a nickel increase in 13 years. Just doesn't make sense."
good,it was a fun job I got to met a lot of interesting people smiling faces well atmosphere I will go back to work there i like working with people and help tem
good,"Management was a revolving door and often changed within a few weeks. I had constantly asked to not close every single day but my request were often ignored. The hardest part about the job during the day was when the rush came. There were sometimes 20-30 people needing hard parts or just to check out. Often times this would also happen at night...when there were only 2 people working. At the beginning the work life balance was easy but towards the end it became harder and harder to manage due to not being able to go anywhere after or sometimes having no time for personal stuff due to having to open the very next morning. The people I started with are what made the job enjoyable but when they all left, it felt very different."
good,Good job for teens who are trying to learn about automotive. Not the job for someone who is trying to maintain a family or pay for college. Good for extra cash.
good,Lots of hours. Store managers are expected to work 50 hours a week. Bonuses are rare. During the interview process I was told I would make at least 10% of my salary per quarter in bonus. I was with the company 9 months be for I saw a little bonus. Management above the store expect the stores to make 20% increases on a annual basis.
good,"Good place to start a first job of you know a lot about cars, managment is horrible at the district level and a lot of store managers. Usually fun around coworkers but there is almost no path to go up in the company"
good,"You are required to do and learn so many things on barely above minimum wage. It is tiring work and you don't get much out of it. Your a Cashier, stocker, sales representative, minor mechanic, and janitor at the same time."
good,Commercial Management is not familiar with parts. has to depend on people with more parts experience to meet job requirements. So scheduling is done to meet that need not to time of most customers.
good,"In my first store everything was great. my day was good and my manager, coworkers, and I all got along well and we looked after each other. It had been my favorite job."
good,"they do not follow policy, management doesnt look out for there employees, long shift, horrible when it comes to sick hours, unfair to employees when they are trying to follow policy"
good,"Overall, it was great during college but the management needed to improve because of lack of motivation and self discipline. However, there were other managers that did make the shift much easier and were great to work with."
good,Advancement is a little tricky. Relocating can be a hassle as well. The pay is poor and the hours can be long if full time. 10+ Sometimes having to work double shifts and opening the next morning. Training is key to everyone's success but it is overlooked if the store doesn't have the manpower to overcome customer needs. It's a great place to start your career but don't get pulled in. All part stores operate like this. AutoZone is one of the best ones out there. They all have flaws!
good,For all the work you have on your plate you are being underpaid and given headaches because of all the tasks your must complete during the day. Most stores don't have enough hours to distribute properly and management gets switched every couple months. Everyone wants/expects something different. Too stressful in the eyes of a manager.
good,"Working here was okay.. then management changed and everything went downhill from there. It was pretty awesome at the beginning but then every shift was dreaded. Some co-workers were very well thought out at the time of hire, but some were not."
good,AutoZone is not an employee friendly environment you will be faced with extremely hard work the work is doable but  management is a tricky situation you will feel underappreciated at times so just be cautious not something I would make a career out of
good,The store managers treat you poorly and take advantage of you when you tell the district manager that things are not okay nothing is done about it. They relocate you whenever they feel like it. They do not care if you have other things in life that need attention you are required to drop everything and come to work when called. You deal with some of the nastiest people. A lot of times you will not get a lunch because there is never enough coverage.
good,Extremely poor management. No room for career growth. Broken promises by management pertaining to advancement in position. Lack of team work and no encouragement with management. Flexible work schedule.
good,"store management in barre VT in very poor, the store manager has the attitude of what do you want OK get your stuff pay me and leave. he doesn't bring anything positive to the job and is very rude. not customer friendly at all, does not encourage employees to go the extra mile or do better. makes the work atmosphere very stressful. has no team motivation skills what so ever, very arrogant, doesn't like to help employees with problems."
good,"A typical day at work,consisted of delivering parts to commercial accounts, assisting customers in store and using the register. We also made sure that the store was ready for the customer to come in and have the ability to find everything they needed easily."
good,"This is a good place to grow and learn fast with great people work around. Most of the people that I worked with were very fun. On the flip side, the people higher up don't care about you or your job, and you can tell. Managment with the stores, pay, and people being hired is awful. People constatly quit due to lack of pay increase. HR matters were very slow to be resolved. Promised benifits we not given. Glad to leave."
good,"Not a bad place to work if only they had management that actually cared about employees. Holidays you work with no time and half and the only holidays you have off are Christmas day and Thanksgiving but you still work Christmas night its disgusting they also have no system for if you are sick, you are forced to work sick and after surgery."
good,Autozone has some goods and some bads about it. The management needs to be fixed there are people that shouldn't be managers much less touching peoples cars.
good,Auto zone was fun and exciting some days. The managers were nice and always willing to assist. The company seemed like there were plenty of advantages and room for growth
good,"Environment is enjoyable (co-workers and customers)"
good,"A typical work day at autozone starts with comeing into the store geting the cash register reddy for the day and other opening tasks then unlock the doors customers may ask you to do the following check the codes on there car there battery ,starter,aternator customers may also ask us to replace headlight,tail lights,battery's,wiper blades you wait on customers look up parts give advice on different stuff with there car there is alot more to it aswell"
good,"i like it but sometimes i don't, management complains that they dont get paid enough and they do, they do a red shirts job and gets paid as a grey shirt"
good,"No help, complicated reports, pointment of sale system outdated and more just terrible , 20+ reports to keep you in the back, then they tell you they want you to sell and your team to handle all the workload ,plano gram and truck etc."
good,"Autozone will gice you hours if the person in charge likes you. They will ignore your complaints and try to squeeze you out if uou dont suck up to the people who talk yo you inappropriately. There's no justice if your not in a friendship with someone incharge. The atmosphere can seem so hopeless. What work for someone else doesnt apply to the average Joe, etc."
good,the company pushes you to sell junk parts.the people where rude  they forced you to do thing. the co-works where stupid and argient.
good,Management staff at autozone was not good . They did not train very well or have good working procedures to make things easy on the people. I did not like working there.
good,No room for Advancement.... wosrt case scenario..if management doesnt like you especially when you stand for whet you believe in...you are heading up the creek..........
good,"It's a retail store that only cares about making money ad could care less about the employees. Management cares only for their monthly sales bonus and how to anger a customer.(At least at the store I worked in). I love shopping at Autozone, but I won't work for a retail store again."
good,Typical day included breaking down truck' helping customers with searching auto parts or cleaning at the end of cleaning at the end of the day to ready the store  for the next day. Learning more about auto parts and cars  in general. Hardest part would probably knowing exactly whats going  on with a persons car there could be a number of reasons that are past our knowledge and customers usually come to us  before going to a shop but we are not mechanics or not all people have that type of background
good,"My very first job. We had great staff for awhile. Their turn-over rate for employees is really high because of their ""points"" policy. You acquire points when late/tardy, so it is very easy to just be picked off if you have a busy life. When scheduling my manager didn't really care what was going on in your life even if you told him/her 3+ weeks in advance that you needed a specific day off. I was constantly working passed my time to clock out because no one liked to put up truck."
good,"They dont give us enough hours to satisfy all the customers they have.We have to install items in the pouring rain,snow any condition,sometimes I am there by myself due to understaffing,I dont receive my schedule before the last  one expires,I am the only one to set planograms,and keep track of inventory,no in-house advancement."
good,I was not im pressed with auto zone. when i worked there the uper managment didnt care about their employees they. always was woried about their paychecks and who they liked. i felt that to be promoted you had to be a part of the good old boys club.
good,"A great company, but management team was a little shaky. A lot of problems surrounding downsizing and working at the corporate office, you weren't sure if it was your department or what department."
good,"culture is portrayed one way in reality another"
good,"At first it was a great experience then after the first year you would see the flaws with the staff and company. Bad work environment, staff isn't helpful, and to deal with customers attitude 24/7."
good,"management is not that great, could use some improvement, usless rules that don't get followed by everyone, good store just bad leaders"
good,Started off in customer service and got promoted to sales manager where I started realizing how much this company suck. They don't care about you.
good,2 days a week off never the same if employees don't show up which is very common you fill in for them the never fire people that don't show up then as a manager if you do terminate some one another store hires them
good,"Day-to-day was good, but it was made much harder at times due to poor Management. In Waco its rare for store managers to be replaced, or even punished for not completing their duties, Instead they place all blame on their employees resulting in their termination. Meanwhile they continue to do what they have always done. The DM (district managers) change pretty often allowing them to get away with this. It's sad that our society has become this way. Seems that nobody is accountable for their actions anymore. That being said all else at this company was pretty good."
good,"Typical day at work was either hectic or not depending on the day and the weather outside. I was at AutoZone for 3 1/2 years and I would learn something new everyday. My co-workers were amazing people to work with and were always there to lend me a hand if needed. The hardest part of my job I would say was keeping the customer satisfied, that also goes for the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Simple work, customer service based, bad management, zero growth opportunities, terrible pay and hours."
good,"At Autozone, I would work anywhere from 9-12 hours a day, sometimes even 7 days a week to fill in for the coverage they did not have the right employees for. I liked the atmosphere, but I felt like my whole life was working for very little pay."
good,"Part-time only, work 3 maybe 4 days per week and no more than 6 hours per day. Great costumers and commercial accounts, learn new  things in the Automotive Field on a daily basis. In-store Management very helpful and understanding."
good,"Sales /Parts/ Customer service"
good,"A typical day was very busy at all times. I worked with a lot of mechanics to ensure warranty parts were correct for exchange. I searched and pulled parts for vehicles. handled cash, credit, and debit transactions. I learned a lot about the automotive industry and how to take proper care of you vehicle. My co-workers were very up beat and cool to work around. Every three months there was a new manager, I even trained a few managers while working there. The hardest part of the job was trying to find the correct part for a specific model car. I also had a situation where for example, the system may say we have 3 parts in stock but if the parts associate does not call the other store location to make sure the customers become irate so I had to offer as much service possible to ensure quality service to all guests. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customers come in frustrated and leave out happy and relieved."
good,This job was very fast pace and you learn alot about auto parts. i liked the team members thtai worked with. the major parts of my day was dealing with customers and assisting them with their needs. i also trained many employees.
good,"There is not a process for advancement, or if there is one, it's very vague. Most days are the same, helping customers find parts, offering to install batteries, lights and wiper blades. One day a week is set aside to put away our restocking truck. Seems to be a reluctance to cross train associates, at least at my store. My previous store in Florida was much more organized."
good,A typical day at work showed how well your customer service skills were.
good,At Auto Zone i've learned more about customoer service. I've driven auto parts to many places in PA. I get along great with my coworkes. I learned how to use the computer system completely.
good,get bounced from dept. to dept. with little to no training . Thankless job with little chance of advancement. manager shows no concerns and is on average available three and a half to four days a week. 80% of the employees are under the age of 25 and are delegated athourity to run the store and its the main hub for central il. I do love cars and working with the customers that is the most satisfiying part of the job.
good,Work beyond expectations dedicated to my work do what in told to do never late never miss a day of work in 9 years live to work give good customer service
good,"you get to learn alot about different vehicles an auto parts throughout your daily work hours, pay is very low considering job requirements, and management is very rude."
good,I enjoyed working there until being overlooked for promotions that I felt were gender related (I am female) even though most customers would ask for me specifically.
good,Autozone is an ok company to work for. Dont expect much pay out of them. Dont expect to be able to pay bills working for them. Do expect to work crazy hours never having the same schedule and expect people that have worked there for a little while to not respect you even though you hold a higher title than them.
good,"my experience with management wasn't the best experience because of how they treated me in Durham,NC with almost trying to fight me but I left the job and Im better off without them now!"
good,The management staff are very great and full of energy and I currently under goin the management training but the management training is sub par other than i it's a good job
good,"Bones holding up a hot suit of skin. You don't have to know what your talking about, as long as you up sell the WITTIDJR.  Lifetime warranties are a great selling point. Most people don't own their car for more than 7 years, and corporate knows it. Stock holders are happy when you make the numbers. They rarely sell performance parts. If you have a passion for the automotive industry... DON'T WORK HERE!"
good,I decline to review this company at this time due to most recent changes in regional management. An applicant (especially one who is still employed with the organization) should have the option to submit a review.
good,I really loved working there i enjoyed the customers and learning new things worked there for 9 years due to upper management alot of workers left....
good,"Everything is about selling extra items to the customer, not about what they really need. There are always checkout challenges that change monthly, when the store doesn't sell enough add-ons, it and the manager, gets dinged. They pay is subpar as are the benefits."
good,But I liked driving and delivering my parts from the store to the customers. The only time I loved it there was when I was getting s proper amount of hrs. and I had deliveries right away and was gone all day. I loved that.
good,"works alright, some sh1t customers, say bye to vacation, and a social life, along with your hours, great for the guy living in his moms basement thoug"
good,I left the job due to poor management. Manager wasn't in the store most of the time. Overall with out the poor management I had a great time working at AutoZone. Learning new parts and meeting different customers
good,"no, i dont feel comfortable leaving comments about my management as they chose to sleep on the top of the parts shelves during work hours of the day. shortly after i left the location."
good,working here was fun and I learned something every day. most of the store was management and all but the store manager was nice. the hardest part was putting in car batteries in 120 degrees or 10 degrees weather.
good,"Love my job under my old boss, but managment changed and turned south. Needs to internally promote and move people more often. Needs to stop hiring outside managers from competition."
good,"Do there chant in meetings 3 times a day imagine the village people dance. Pledge allegiance to auto zone. The pay is 14.05 an hour to start but work you 30 to 34 hrs a week. Pay is Biweekly so about 800 after tax maybe if your lucky. advisers walk around all day and do nothing and start out at 48,000 a yr."
good,"This place sucks for employees. They cut your hours all the time. You never have a set schedule. They prefer to promote outside rather than within. The company runs backwards. The turn over rate is crazy!"
good,"Retired, looking for something to do, have a lifetime of experience to offer and you are definitely not compensated for that, only person in store with mechanical knowledge, (50+ years), former business owner, none of this taken into account. Closing stock price for AZ over $800.00 and pay the folks who make the money a penance. Management tries to micro staff, all concern is place at pushing useless garbage at customers that they don't want or need, this is to keep high commissions coming to RMs, Dms and store managers. dictatorial on dress code, I like to look professional but some can't afford to replace clothes as often as they say because they are not paid a decent wage, impossible for anyone or a couple to make a life on wages offered or paid here."
good,"A typical day a work was right just another in a auto part "
good,"Auto Zone makes a lot of promises and they usually don't pan out, so that is a disappointment to the employees and brings down the moral in the individual stores."
good,didn't really like the environment due to wo coworkers. so I decided that I  didn't not really enjoy the environment due some employees being racist to the Hispanic never really said anything.
good,"AutoZone, in general, is a good company to work for. However, current local management makes it very difficult to maintain a desire to stay employed by AutoZone for the long term."
good,Regional management was hard to get a hold of and often gave very vague direction. Several times only two full time employees were scheduled for Sundays
good,Lots of promises and commitments made by regional management but no support when it comes time to act.  Management does not hold all positions accountable for mistakes made.  Has a tendency to hire employees just to have a body in place.
good,"For meeting minimum wage requirements and bonus for additional knowledge they are too serious for the limited pay offered. It started off well with the online training classes. When I asked about going back to school, I was given an ultimatum advising against bettering myself. While I did not take time off like more of the associates did, I did not appreciate the advice."
good,This is a good company to learn how to multi-task and be extremely efficient with time management.  Very goal oriented environment with plenty of knowledge to gain.
good,"Might be an alright place to work, just not with the management staff they had for my area.  Had a bi-polar, indecisive and insecure individual for a boss that caused more issues than he solved.  Constantly changing schedule makes having any kind of home life near impossible.  I enjoyed building up the business and building business relationships."
good,"With all my year's experience, it was hard to advance, even after jumping thru the hoops they asked me to jump thru.... total waste of time. I am better than they give me credit for."
good,love the job because I'm a mechanic by trade but would be better if the management system had fixed hours and the people who produce profitable sales could be on the floor longer rather than a newer employee.
good,"performance"
good,"lreally liked my job but do to actions that werent  my fault i was let go. most of the people were cool i thought,then found out differently.learned not to trust people just dfo my job that i enjoyed very much."
good,My hours ranged between 8-10 hours a day. I learned about car parts and installation an testing. Management was shaky and slacked off.  I loved truck.
good,"Poor management, favored women and minorities. Slow-paced job. learned about many different auto parts and car companies/vehicles. Had to install batteries and headlights in freezing cold."
good,"Autozone was a fun company to work for, however, the amount of work I was told I would be receiving was far different from the hours I was actually given. I was promised over 30 and obtained less then 25 sometimes less then 20."
good,Bad people working there. A lot don’t know much about cars. Super bias work place at times. Not great advancement. You will be making 9$ an hour for at least a year. Then MAYBE it’ll go to 9.50 unless you become manager. Then it’s 10$
good,"New Employees Hours Are Based On Sales, Management Is Constantly Asked To Step Up Sales And Make Sure There Is No Overtime And Keep Store Nice And Clean And"
good,"Autozone Corporate wants more for less and are willing to inflict that on their management team, caring only about the numbers rather than the people that make the numbers."
good,Always had opportunities to get new certificates and licenses.  The work is good. Meet a lot of different people and learn quite a bit from some. A lot of times shifts are understaffed but during peak hours you stay very busy
good,Auto Zone generally is probably a good place to work its just our store in particular is not a very good place. Hard to find good employees from around here.
good,"Promotion is based on who you know, not ability/performance. Upper management makes it quite clear that everyone is considered easily replaceable. Bonus is in reality unobtainable."
good,"We need get all team members working together. The team has a lot pressure to hit the results. Autozone needs to work on promoting people based off skills, knowledgable and proven track record."
good,"okay if you're fine with part time"
good,thought the environment was not enjoyable.  worked 3rd shift and hated the hours. not worth the pay in my opinion. high turnover rate as with a lot of jobs.
good,"In the job field of CSR at AutoZone, you are the bottom of the ladder. Good luck being promoted if you're part time. The store I work at is so backwards that the manager at any level can't tell their butt from a hole in the ground."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. I learned many things along the way. Management was not ideal but the store manager was a great guy. Sales was very stressful within this company.
good,"Like working with customers & helping them find the parts the needed, smaller store always need extra help & was always hiring, made doing things like truck a little harder on the 2 people working on it."
good,"I was a hard worker at this job, I worked hard because I was eager to learn. But this job was not a run in the park, I faced difficult people and had to learn ways to encounter them nicely. The work pay was minimum wage with no benefits. It was not worth it because it was a sloppy job with low pay"
good,"I loved working here, Aside from unprofessional management. This is not the place to work if  you're trying to make real money. But if you're just needing a job to make some extra cash or whatever, it isn't bad. It's retail, so obviously you'll get whatever hours you get. They'll typically hire  you as part time for obvious reasons. "
good,I enjoyed the team we were at Autozone. The hours are not the greatest but helping the customers in need made it worth while. It's a good job but the pay does tend to be low even at a manager poaition.
good,roller coaster ride of problems. customer problems IE theft and rudeness. computers fail to work on a daily bases and tech support will not fix or replace them.
good,"not a very good place to work to much in house drama, and not enough enforcement of polices, some good people and ok pay. did help me get where i needed to be for not but other than that not very good."
good,Modern Corporate environment. Bottom line was the most important objective and employees treated like they were disposable. The manager I worked with was amazing.
good,You are gonna have fun at work and it's not hard at all but the managers all on ur back for nothing when you are doing exactly what you supposed to do
good,All the employees were nice and fun to work with but there wasn't any room for growth and they didn't want to work my schedule with my availability due to having three children.
good,"Typical retail job, lots of pressure to promote and sale items that a lot of shops did not need because of contracts with big chemical companies.  Items that were on ""sale"" were still priced higher than other competitors."
good,The equipment was good. The trucks seemed to be kept in good  condition. The other employees were nice. The sales managers were really informative.  It was a decent store. Management leaves a lot to be desired though. There EOE guidelines seem to be a bit skewed.
good,"Fun, enjoyable environment but feel the benefits and promotional terms are unfair. Feel as if in order to be promoted, it goes off of likeness instead of learned experience."
good,"Not a bad place to work. The manager was supportive, gave ideas, and welcomed all ideas from his staff. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and learning about car parts. The hardest part was some people did not know what type of car they have and would get angry about it."
good,"Great company to work for if you have a plan, I was at the store level and started as a commercial driver; eight months later I was promoted to back up commercial manager. just three months later my commercial manager was promoted to store manager and I was promoted to commercial manager. in other words you can get promoted quickly based on your work ethic and relationships with your superiors. Everyday you show up to work be prepared to deal with customers that know nothing about cars but are so cheap that they rather take a chance to fix whatever problems they have on there own and probably make the issue worse. What I disliked most was truck day where the store was under scheduled all the time so it made work harder especially when people call out. The hardest part of the job was having co workers that just show up to work not having a clue whats going on."
good,"first, they will underpay and overexpect, not like most sales jobs where all they want is more and more sales, but that they expect Mr.minimum wage to do literally everything in the store. the manager doesnt know how to make a schedule, theres a lady who is a legit manager and only works to put stock away and scan stuff. please excuse my language. the company will market you as a person who will fix your car but when people ask for help they get angry that you will not know how to fix their vehicle, than you get grilled by a District Manager for making ONE unhappy customer. but no matter what you do they will not fire anyone. it took 3 months for one employee to get fired after legitimately doing nothing."
good,It is a great to deal with customers and help them with there automotive issues.  However dealing with the unreasonable expectaions set by the district manager is ridiculous.  You are supposed to answer the phone and ignore customers that are in the store.  They worry more about selling the stuff that customers don't need then making them happy so they come back again and again.
good,"not a bad first job. flexible hours, laid back environment to work in. great people who are willing to help a teammate out."
good,"management was lazy and did not care for there job, or employees. when they did have good managers the district manager got ride of them."
good,"This was always a stepping stone for me  into the work force. I started working part-time and went to full-time after the loss of my wife, now I'm stuck and working around 24 hrs a week."
good,The Management in auto-zone sucked and I did not receive any training. They complained about me not making deliveries fast enough but I had to go the speed limit.
good,"Very educational in the areas of stocking, front facing, product display and placement. Co-workers are usually friendly, most are helpful. The hardest part of the job is providing personal advice and maintaining a professional appearance while conversing with difficult and irate customers."
good,i have had some laughs with co-workers. I've also learned a lot more about cars i didn't already know. its kind of easy you punch in the car info then go fetch the parts. worst thing is having to put your password in a lot of times & then having to ask for a managers password
good,"this job/company is ok to work for long hours, training could be better. within this job u do have alot of different levels of management/positions to move into"
good,"He you learn what each automotive part is called. If you are in a bilingual community, then you get to learn what the part is called in two languages. This was a great places to learn about the parts world. Every team is as good as its leader."
good,Terrible scheduling and you can lose your job without a moments notice for no good reason.
good,"Opening the Retail store side, stocking product, filling the overnight wholesale orders that were placed after hours. helping customers with getting what they need. Delivering the parts to the wholesale customer."
good,I really enjoyed working for Autozone most of the time.  As a Store Manager the expectations were unrealistic.
good,"would help out customers with parts they needed, and would give advice on installing parts as well as stock up hard parts.  this job is not stressful"
good,auto parts delivery. I have learned auto parts retail and great customer services. Management is moderate and there to handle problems that exceed my expectations.
good,"Worked for a long period of time. Company/store was flexible with my schedule for the most part, especially while I was in school. There was or seemed to always be a lack of team support for the work staff to customer ratio at times was an overwhelming imbalance."
good,"Ok job but they can be a mess. Hard to keep people to work. I was a manager and was under paid, and can be over worked"
good,"job was very hard, pay was good but too much work in the sun, late hours, co-workers never showed up on time. always asked to stay late and work up to 6 days a week. would not suggest a job in Auto Zone for anyone. "
good,Excellent place to work for teenagers and young adults to gain experience.
good,i was a senior sales representative there almost for three years and i have to say the previous manager was one of the best managers i have worked for.when he left the store we got a new manager and it all went down hill from there.all my co-workers was great to work for and never had a problem.this job would be ok if they get a new manager cause insteed of giving somebody else a higher prosition she would just hire somebody off the street and make them a higher up insteed of taking care of here current workers.
good,Most employees only get to work part time. There is no set hours for part time workers.
good,"Fairly good work effort with most of the employees, but poor judgement from store managers, creates high turnovers and sometimes low moral from employees. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction I get from helping someone solve a tough problem they are having with their vehicle. I like that feeling, and I guess that's what keeps me in this field."
good,Enjoyed going to work due to the people I worked with. Upper management wasnt exactly true to their words. I managed to learn much knowledge by hands on experiences and fellow workers.
good,If you do not know anyone working above you don't plan to advance autozone is an employment oppurtunity for favorites.
good,AutoZone is an ok stepping stone job. The wage for the work is considerably low and the upper management is just short of non existent.
good,A typical day at Auto Zone would be very very busy non stop moving and assisting customer's find the right parts for their vehicles. restocking shelf's and inventory daily.overall i learned alot about cars boats atv's and other things. my co-workers were very helpful easy to get along with. management was good for the most part.
good,"usually opened store.. ordered parts,sold parts,made deposits,dealt with alot of customers..and closed store..etc"
good,"I open the store, lay down the mats and rugs then turn computers on. Start woking with any customer that comes through the door, make sales and also make them happy with customer service. Answer phones through out the day, sometimes I drive to drop parts off to shops. We will do overstock, truck and clean, we also do planos, front face and retag certain items. Everyday is pretty much the same except for thursdays because that is truck day. I learned computer skills and phone experince. My co- workers are great. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the unhappy customers but I just listen and try to help. The most enjoyable part is making people happy and driving."
good,"Assist all customers that come in, get parts for them or find out which store has them. Management is okay can use improvement, they treat you like you dont know anything even after you tell them your going to school for it and you can handle the problem, they are more into selling parts then actually solving the problem. The hardest part of the job was listening to co workers sell people parts they do not need costing them more money then they really need. The mose enjoyable part of the job is actually helping and educating customers more about their transprotation and helping them fix the problem and having them come back and thank you for the information."
good,"great place for a person interested in cars, even if you dont know a lot about cars you will learn a lot with in the first month"
good,A company that has way to many employee turnovers since so many people are seeking employment
good,"I enjoy working at Autozone compared to other places ,but the we don’t have enough people to makes sure we aren’t over worked. Some people want more hours ,but that isn’t possible when we can’t find people to work. This makes the job hard. Which is unfortunate."
good,Same treatment for all regardless of race and gender. It is all about clear communication between the employer and employees. Work environment is very stressful
good,Auto Zone inc. is a fully diversified company that could offer many workplace opportunity. Working for this company has gained me experience and networking opportunities.
good,"I was offered a full time manager position, but would be considered part time in the system until they could fix it. Over a month later I am working full time hours with part time benefits. There is no rhyme or reason to the scheduling, days off are entirely random. I would hope my experience is not typical of Auto-zone as a company and more an issue of the store I work at."
good,Understaffed and still not in the best standing with the community so it's pretty high stress. High turnover rate leads to longer lasting employees feeling even more stress and pressure while new comers are in training because our task list grows significantly.
good,Not getting enough per hour and not a lot of room for advancement. Auto Zone has a tendency to hire outside of the company without assisting in advancement for current employees.
good,My particular store was amidst a staff change when I was hired. Which led towards bitterness and a hostile working enviroment for all of those involved.
good,I was a delivery driver and I loved the job. Making mechanics Happ and their jobs easier was my satisfaction. This was a great work experience and I love the hours but the pay was low. I was part time but worked full time hours . So no benefits and if I got hurt I was on my own. I shortly resigned from this company
good,Autozone is no longer about its employees. You run on a skelton crew and you are expected to answer the phone  within three rings... even if you have a customer right in front of you. You are phone shopped and secret shopped in store. If you want no work/ life balance you will love working here. After 5 years I'm about done. Every district is different. Be careful. Gossip all around.
good,"If you like cars then it's not so bad. But, there's a lot of people out there that think they know something about cars when they don't know squat. You work 5-6 days a week, but for only 4hrs a day; unless you're management."
good,"When I worked there, the store manager was not a very good store manager. I will say now that they have a new one, it looks a lot better and I believe their sales are up as well"
good,"A typical day would consist mainly of assisting customers who enter the store, ensuring they find the parts or materials they need for their vehicle. I learned how to change a battery and how the brake system works through this job. However, the district manager consistently undermined all the hard work and effort we put into the store. We had gone from nearly last in our district, to almost first, and now back to last again. Many of us are dissatisfied with how upper management has been treating us, and are planning to search for greener pastures. All that aside, however, the job itself was not difficult, and was certainly educational for me."
good,Company sucks they can upgrade there management team throughout districts all of these guys are old been around to long & actually needs a change of scenery
good,"Stores are never ready and if you run behind due to truck or weather then they give your run away and replace it with a garbage run...."
good,little concern for team members and customers. quantity over quality. they have a religious accommodation policy but do not follow it. they ignore labor and civil rights laws
good,"Was hired under the pretense that I would be trained to take over the facility as manager, only to be told by the same store manager that its unrealistic for anyone newly hired to be promoted to store manager in less than two years. In addition to that the store manager only spent 2-3 weeks of training time that was one on one. After that your expected to learn from your coworkers and by taking and passing all of their in house training course's that are available on their corporate training site online. "
good,"While I appreciate given the opportunity to work for this company, I feel that many tools that I needed to ingrain myself with company culture were not provided."
good,Autozone owned you if you were in any kind of management capacity. They would relocate managers without much notice or regard for how far the relocation was.
good,Auto Zone is the right place to work if you can be on your feet for more than 8 hours a day as well as lift very heavy objects . It is a fun place to work if you want to learn about cars .
good,For those who don't know much about vehicles it's a quick way and place to diversify tour knowledge. Lots of helpful tools and characters to learn from.
good,"Depends who you get.  There are lots of managers who really don't belong in management.  Especially the ones who think it is okay to scream on the sales floor, steal from the safe, etc.  Keep in mind, this is not everybody."
good,"This company only cares for itself. Thank god i was at a decent store which i enjoyed. The company is very on top of up selling. one thing i didn't like was the scheduling! I would find out my schedule 2 days before!!!(find out thursday or friday for sunday thru saturdays shifts) I couldn't plan ANYTHING like docs,dentists ect!!"
good,auto zone started off great with first store manger but as they started changing managers things started to take a turn for the worse for me. all i can say is becareful.
good,"I worked here part time and learned a lot whilst here. I didn't receive any raise while there and since I was the only female there, experience a lot of harassment. I didn't feel comfortable enough to raise it to management."
good,AutoZone is a large company and as such they do not truly care about the individual employees. The management was terrible at setting up a proper schedule. I worked for a years at a wage lower than I had been promised. They realized that without the agreement in writing there was nothing i could do. Opening the shop and unloading parts from trucks before 6 am was without any real coordination was difficult. Poorly run operation at my location.
good,It's hard to advance. Holding people accountable is one sided. The managers play favorites.  The customers are unique and you don't know what you're get from one to another.
good,Not a bad place if your in college or high school and want to start learning about cars and parts. Would reccomend for a career but was fairly easy job
good,-Does not embrace change
good,In charge of unloading delivery truck and replenish empty shelves. Assist customers' in troubleshooting there automobile malfunctions. Test batteries to ensure proper voltage levels to start vehicle.
good,"If any pride in yourself, you will be embarrassed to work here.  Company culture is all about profit. Employees are dispensable. Common practice to dangle the carrot in front of young people's face and never reward for hard work."
good,Promised a promotion that took four months to happen. Management was better at bullying than leading. Coworkers we great. Manager could never keep people or treat the good employees right. Promoted to manager and received a dollar raise. Trained people that made a higher amount per hour although they had no experience and I trained them.
good,"There is no advancement at Auto Zone..only red shirt to grey shirt. After that, there is nothing. They don't seem to look at the ones who have been red shirts the longest. They will hire someone out on the street before they think of upgrading a current employee."
good,"Working at AutoZone, was fun for the time being, The management was not at all professional., and did not appreciate their team members. The scheduled lacked consistency, and order. You could open the store one day, the very next close, and due to lack of customers, be completely removed from the schedule for the next few days. As a commercial driver, you drive from one auto body shop to another delivering parts, if there are parts that need to be delivered. If no parts need to be delivered, you are helping the other cashiers with the customers up front while the customers ridicule you for the lack of auto jargon."
good,"it's good for somebody part time. stay away from management (grey shirt). you don't want it. part time gets the same benefits as full time, including discounts, but you can have your availability set for another FT job. you will be nearly forced to move up into FT / Management, dont take it. they force people into positions they are not ready for, which creates this culture of managers that have no idea what they're doing, and create chaos while figuring it out. stay part time, learn about cars, parts, and get the discount for yourself and friends' car parts."
good,Not much room for advancement. They were constantly understaffed leaving it to fall on present employees. High expectations but low returns to employee for good performance.
good,"employees have no respect for management, need better training, not very diverse, no communication skills, some employees are very respectful and willing to learn and grow and others are not willing to learn or grow. There was not too many team work"
good,"Upper management was horrible in their policies, and hiring. They had no care in the world about anyone under a store manager. They didnt listen or follow through with complaints, when you do they let you go for insubordination..The job itself was good. Just management made it unworkable."
good,"Some employees for the company should be kept with a close eye, but I was able to grow with the company for the time I was there. I was at two locations while working with AutoZone, along with being a Loner Zoner to a third site."
good,"Stocking parts, cleaning, maintaining store in order. customer satisfaction and service. Management never fair, never work with you or set example of a manager. hardest part was to do everyone job without having the title."
good,"What can I say I appreciate the opportunity granted to me by AutoZone. In my opinion it's recommendable to have at minimum some basic car knowledge. You're suppose to be able to assist customers & be able to hand out friendly advice. So if your going to choose between a fast food joint & you consider yourself a grease monkey, then AZ is the spot for you. You will get greasy!"
good,Horrible communication and could never get any help from the higher up just run around. Hours were long and schedule was never posted on time. Stuff was just dis organized
good,It's an alright job fast paced at times there's always something to do there's always customers in the building and always someone to help. It's a pretty good company.
good,maybe because the store was new they  security which ked to theft issues with the customers and the employees. The it came to  POINT where we had to call the district manager.
good,it is a good place to work if you have the right management it is flawless the best part of the job is helping others and meeting new people throughout the day
good,"Awful work environment, incompetent management, enough said. Your employees will be alright but it's sad having to watch them get mistreated by customers only to have the stores policies be on side of the customer at all costs. I literally took a transmission filter to the face to which my regional manager laughed off as a learning experience."
good,The district manager will tell you that he is advancing you and promoting because he knows thats what you want to hear but does not follow through. Was hired for a Parts Manager and within my employment that never happened.
good,You can grow within the company but it all depends on who likes you and how much personal time you're willing to sacrifice for your career advancement
good,I enjoyed working with people and driving and learning the city while doing my job. the job was easy to learn. The hardest part of my job is getting guaranteed hours.
good,"Work would have good days and bad, like any other job. when work was good, it was really good. However, he bad days, even though fewer, outweighed the good. Having to deal with customers that treat us like a free labor force at their beck and call is quite annoying. Instead of autozone having our backs, they just tell us that if what the customer is asking you do to can be done in 45 minutes or less, do it. Having to change batteries and wiper blades in the pouring rain should not be expected of us by our customers nor the company."
good,"Support from upper management is greatly desired. Often times, store managers are set up to meet unreasonable deadlines. Employe turnover is constant because of poor non-competitive wages."
good,"People you work with are mostly good, Management not no room for advancement unless you young female. no training, Management is in flexible, not a great work environment."
good,It is easily noticed that as an employee at Autozone you are not really appreciated. For the amount of work you do there is no compensation. Hourly rate is not a livable wage for any home.
good,i personally think that auto zone was a good environment for me i like to work on cars only thing was that the management was not all that good they really didn't tech me anything i had to watch and learn. other then that i loved the work but the hardest part of the job was being outside in the heat trying to install a batteries.
good,rather not leave anything here. it was an experience that i do not want to go through again. it was a good experience the first month but i was bullied and picked on  by my store manager
good,Your hours rely on sales and when sales are down you struggle to make any money. The company will return almost anything which leads to profit loss. Not too much room to move up because they would rather fill positions from people with no company experience.
good,I had a rare store manager that was actually really nice and laid back but I had worked for others who were much less pleasant. The company does not care about the safety of the workers as they do not have any cameras to deter the constant stream of thieves. I watched my shift manager wrestle with a drug addict for a battery he was trying to steal.
good,"ok job not career unless you know someone no one care all about "
good,"Deliver parts to commercial accounts, assist in store with daily store needs as time permitted from deliveries. Training for various aspects of the job was available but difficult to access with time constraints and poor computer programs to use for doing the training.  Upper management in store made promises never kept in terms of hours, etc.  Pressure is put on all employees to do more, with little or no support.  Everyone is in competition with each other, and failures to accomplish tasks are put in an area where everyone is able to view shortcomings.  Getting training done in a timely manner is difficult, helping customers is enjoyable."
good,"While it wasn't my favorite job it was a job. I suggest getting familiar with basic car knowledge as it'll make your job so much easier. "
good,"I had a hard time at this job, the management team was very hard on the employee for no reason and when I got sick no one at the job cared enough to call and check on me. I learn that manager didn't care for their staff and had a big turnover because of the bad management."
good,"It is good for people who like cars and can lift heavy objects and do high heights. If you have as trick school schedule you cannot do this job. If you need help, they are friendly to help you."
good,Management was not pleasant.  I was the only employee in the store that has good work ethic.  I also was the only employee that was customer service oriented.
good,its a fun place to work and learn about cars. managment team is usally good of being on the same page with all the workers. treat everyone equaly and with respect
good,"While a good company to work for, pay is not one of the reasons.  Hard work may be acknowledged, but sometimes you have to make things happen. Part time employees work hard for low pay and no benefits."
good,Work was good manager shows favoritism to certain employees does not treat all employees fairly I have run my own business in this manager does not know how to manage an AutoZone and its employees
good,"To start of this job was very hard, it was a 3rd shift over night job I would start the night of by finding a double rider drive forklift get some pallets and then start picking up oil crates or batteries for whatever store I needed on average I'd pickup around 3500 batteries in a night or 1800 oil crates a night. The managment was very helpful  very supportive any questions I had they'd not only give me a answer but give hands on help. The culture was very serious all about safety it was a dangerous job alot of heavy machinery moving around. The hardest part of the job would definitilely be having to lift heavy objects all night it wasn't extremely heavy and by no means am I weak but lifting 20-40 pounds repetively all night became very challenging and tiring along witht that it led to me injuring my back. The most enjoyable part was the team honestly alot of very nice people always around."
good,"I was a (PSM) at Autozone for almost a year, when I was fired. I had 2 points out of a 12 point system. I had no write ups, & no customer complaints. They say i was fired because of mismanagement of money, but they wanted me out. Its funny because, two mouths ago I was offered an Assistant Manager Position. So you explain to me how we go from that to fired?"
good,"A gestão brasileira tem dificuldades na  implantação de projetos  , porém acredito que com o tempo e supervisão dos americanos encontrará o caminho certo."
good,"AZ is just another corporation looking at the bottom line.  A server at Applebee's could make more and that's why the turnover is so high. Management makes no attempt to develop employees and ""autozoners"" are treated as endentured servants.   I am embarrassed that AZ is based in my home town.   "
good,"ok place to work . not  long time carrier due to poor pay and long hours , but was a good place for building customer service skills."
good,"It always busy, the work days are very long . We often get in replenishment about two or three time s a week and working with the commercial business as well."
good,One week I may work 35 hours and the next I'll only work 10. I found it impossible to structure my life around such erratic hours and more difficult to pay my rent.
good,this job was kind of fun for me until the newest store manager mostly good people to work with little to no benefits store manager wont let you explain stuff without interupting
good,It was good experience working with customers. Learned a lot about dealing with high pressure situations. Learned to deal with management and co-workers. Hardest part of job was trying to complete all management required duties in time allotted.
good,I was temp was called back after short lay off. most of my supervisors were great. never missed a day. tried many times for fulltime. They hired less able employes there full time now. i am working elsewhere. did want to work there many friends and just a mile from my home. other than that it would be perfect for my needs
good,"As a person with parts management experience watching the current manager at the time hire girls he wanted to date and damage the structure of his staff, I had to leave the place as soon as possible. Rather than hire people who were knowledgeable and had experience, he kept hiring cute girls who didn't even know how to operate a register, much less provide customers with any automotive advice or even capable of looking up parts in the catalog. The store is across the street from government housing, so people getting robbed outside the store and in the same businesspark is common. Before I was hired, the place was robbed at gun point 3 times within one year. The store is small and there was no room for advancement or a raise."
good,"Helping customers can be enjoyable. The most difficult part is that there is no training. All learning is ""as you go"", that is the worst way to learn, especially when the customer is expecting you to know your job."
good,"it was a time in my life where i needed money, the company is horrible because you have 1000000000 responsibilities but the pay does not equate to proper compensation."
good,"A typical day would start when I would open. Make sure all the computers are up and running. Then I would move the trash cans outside, and check to see if the battery chargers were functioning properly. Next I would move to the commercial side and check to see if everything was ready for calls from the commercial clients. Usually after that customers would stroll in and I would assist them in whatever products they needed or questions they had. When it would be slow I would have to walk around the store and make sure our overstock on the shelves was in sync of what the report from the previous work day said. Then when I would work for the commercial side I would have to deliver parts or pick up cores around the town from our clients. Also a mediator between the clients and Autozone."
good,"this job is ideal for anyone who does not have monthly expenses above 400 dollars. i was a parts driver to and from local shops, with a clear driving background, and i was only paid 10 dollars per hour, at 15 hours per week. not proudest moment in my life, but wicked easy job though. you pretty much just googled up car parts."
good,"the costumers are a big priority, and  they usually forget the employee that takes a big part "
good,A typical day at Auto Zone is taking care of the customer. I have learned alot more about cars working here. My co-workers are like family. We care about eachother like so. The hardest part of the job is being yelled at by customers cause of wrong parts. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get to know the customers!
good,good in between job. slow days. short breaks. a lot of free time
good,"Its like a family, co-workers are fun to be with. Management is not identifiable with the rest of the team."
good,"A type day consist of answers phone, looking up parts, and maintaining a clean and safe environment. I learned that management  consist of organization, and plenty of overtime. The most enjoyable part of the day was the customers"
good,"of for a beginner job but dont expect to be paid much, and expect to work hard"
good,Auto parts store near university that had flexible hours to work but was not worth for minimum wage while studying for degree.
good,Ok place to work.  If you don't know someone or have full time availability you will never be promoted.  They tend to over look the most qualified individuals.
good,Not as bad as Tractor Supply. This place had No real ability to grow with the company.
good,Typical day is sales and customer services due to credit cards not a lot of cash handling involved but enough to keep you busy and on your toes.
good,"This is a fair workplace, the hardest part of the job is trying to not running out of stuff to do in the slow times."
good,"good place to work, actually enjoyed working there but the schedule really wasn't good found out what we were working a day before the scheduled came out"
good,"What you would imagine at an auto parts retailer.  Good days, and long ones..."
good,The customer is able to come into this establishment and lie in order to get free or cheap parts.
good,I enjoy working with the customers that I have. Most of the employees are great to get along with also.
good,Making sure all orders were delivered accurately to all clients. Got along well with my co-workers and management. The hardest part was working the front counter.
good,The store manager had admitted mental issues that were not handled or taken into account when dealing with employees. This caused more problems and lack of professionalism than almost any job I have ever worked before. Drama was an everyday part of the environment that made for a hostile work environment. There were cases of open prejudice with some employees regularly using racial slurs with no action taken.
good,"I was a driver for Autozone. My job included taking orders by phone from outside Auto Care and Repair Shops. I would then create an order threw computer systems, gather all parts ordered. After this is done I would load the truck for deliveries and drive to the different shops to drop of the order and get paperwork signed. I learned alot about the different parts to vehicles and how to repair certain things myself to save on repair at a auto shop. The hardest part of my job was being the only Full Time Driver employed at the New Hope location and only having one other part time driver who only could work during the day hours Monday-Friday. This left me to work every weekend for about a year. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with so many different people. Every shop had its own vibe and work flow to it like no other shop. I got to learn and ask questions from many skilled auto related workers to help me in my personal life with my own vehicle."
good,"There is no organization to the one I work at. Not to mention, there is a lot of drama between some of the employees and the store manager. If you work commercial then expect to stand around the store or make petty deliveries, if you work DIY then 2 or 3 times through out the day it might be busy. "
good,My typical day starts at 5 am and ends at 8 pm. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 10 to 15 hours a day.  
good,"Fast paced, very low rewarding job. Pay is not that great and the retail part of the company gets in the way of trying to please customers. Having a good relationship with customers is key, and sometimes, trying to get the sales or money goal for the day ruins what we try to create with our customers (mechanics)."
good,Loved the job and intracting with people and teaching people things everyday however upper management has favorites in the company and dosent make it so fun when your the only one who cares.
good,"I was the driver for the auto zone that is the parts dept. for carmax in duarte, ca. At first it was good.. driving to different auto dealers getting the parts and bringing them back. But after a while it got to be to much, driving far and in rush hour traffic was not good."
good,"I work in a commercial Auto Zone store which not only sells automotive parts and accessories to everyday retail customers but also sells the same parts and products to local and nationally owned automotive shops in the local area around my store. I work as a Part Sales Manager (PSM) which is the 1st level of management in the store. I supervise one or more employees in a retail environment ensuring all tasks each day are completed and that customer service and sales goals meet the high standards set forth by the company. While the benefits are good, salary compensation is not as good as it could be. Advancement is limited especially for the commercial side of the business. Its a good starter job but not one I would recommend for a career. To make decent money you have to be a store manager and promotion from PSM to a store manager is rare and if it does happen you have to be employed for several years before you will get a serious opportunity."
good,"Rarely backed in mgmt. decisions i.e., punishment for no-shows and tardiness=none. Compensation is not what I was told it would be($1 a year raises--highest I've gotten was $.40) NO bonuses."
good,If you like cars-it's ok. Job security/Management leaves alot to be desired.
good,"A typical work day would be, taking orders, answering phones,ordering parts,delivering parts to shops,cashier."
good,"fast pace work place, no real support for questions, poor manger support, limited training,"
good,Never trained me i learned as i worked delivering car parts in our commercial trucks to mechanics shops
good,"Upper management from the store manager and up could really care less about the employees of the store. They wouldn't promote from within, only hired family and friends of family members, always ask employees to come early or stay late and then would take those hours away so you basicly worked for free."
good,"A normal consist of mainly assisting customer with their automotive problem, parts, and inquiries. We also are responsible for setting planogram that corporate send down to display new and seasonal product. I have learned a lot about routine maintenance and diagnoses problem with different vehicles. The management on the store and district level excellent very hands on but upper management is lacking in many area such as communication with the store level on products to highlight and compensation for tenure employees and employees that excess their goals. The employees are great not only at my store but all the surrounding stores with helping getting product to customer but lending associate it another is under staffed. Most enjoyable part of the job is just learning something different everyday while meeting new people."
good,I liked to work at auto zone but I didn't like the management staff
good,Difficult work environment.  Unsupportive management and upper management. Not flexible in hours. Difficulty for advancement within the company. Lack of training given.
good,Great place to shop and work. When the inventory and staff is on point this place can really save you a lot of money as long as you're willing to put in a little effort and elbow grease. All in all a cool place to work and learn as well.
good,If your looking for good paying job that you can handle the stress of autozone is definitely the place for you even though it might be hard to go up on the totem pole it’s a great place to work.
good,"I'm not a behind the desk type, but I do thank auto zone for the job opportunity. But when I work there it was a lot of gossip an behind the back talk, didn't seem friendly."
good,"Considered an advertised as a part time job ,with no benefits involved most employees come and go in a short duration and bever return,  not a totally bad job for someone seeking better opportunities or employment,  opportunity  for hands on learning  and training."
good,Not enough pay. Not enough position advancement. Most people don’t do their job so get ready to do yours plus someone else’s. Just go for managers position straight from the beginning. They will hire you no matter what!
good,Its a good starting point if youre young and looking to build up connections in the automotive industry (extra bonus if your store has a commercial department) but underpaid and not a real sustainable career opportunity. O'reillys pays more also
good,fun place to work with coworkers but seemingly no chance for advancement. the work environment is very good but the management or store managers dont seem to give much direction for employees.
good,"The work was easy, the people cool, they grade you on a point system like a child however. There seems to be a disconnect with corporate and stores. It's extremely easy work if you don't mind the political bias for Democrats."
good,"Trabajo bueno en cuestión de aprendizaje, buena cultura laboral, paga semanal muy pobre. Es lo único malo. Hora de entrada si hay , no respetan la hora de salida."
good,"I was originally excited to learn new things here, but nowadays it just kinda feels like a chore more than anything. Some days can be very hectic as its not usually a simple checkout like a grocery store. It takes time to look things up or understand what part the customer needs, this can cause other customers to lose patience and get rowdy. However, putting up the inventory in the back is very enjoyable. It's quiet and you can actually relax."
good,"I did not like management they like to micromanage you, the pay was okay for the job. it is average for most warehouses at this time. it is a physical labor job"
good,"There is no overtime at Autozone. Autozone is constantly hiring. When"
good,There is nothing hard about the job. Its a nice place to work and the people are nice to work with. The management are nice and help full.  The enjoyable part is the lunch break's.
good,"work was good, management handled things poorly"
good,"A typical day at AutoZone as a Parts Sales Manager will include working 10-12 hour days. You will work 2 opening shifts, 2 closing shifts, and 1 mid-day. You will be scheduled to close (10:30-11:00pm) and open the next day (6:30am), even though the company handbook clearly states you are to have 12 hours between shifts. Your personal life will suffer, regardless of your ability to balance your work/personal life. Promotions are based on favoritism in lieu of ability, knowledge, or skill set, Raises will most likely not even be up to the cost of living increase, regardless of your hard work, attendance, sales numbers, willingness to help whenever needed, or good customer reviews. The pay is abysmal for the amount of work you will be expected to do... Non-management employees of other retail establishments make more money than a Parts Sales Manager at AutoZone. Upper management is completely out of touch with their team, and usually can't even remember the names of their employees.. even after meeting them multiple times. Depending on the area, you can expect around $10 an hour, with zero commissions or bonuses. However, despite all the bad, the customers somehow make it worth it, short term. But eventually, even the most loyal employee grows weary of the lack of ability to grow, the terrible hours, and abismal pay."
good,The hourly rate in my area is just ridiculous with the management happily paying all new hourly employees an almost siminly mandatory  $10/h .  Starting pay should be $12 with more for personel with experience . Trust me after dealing with those customers you will see what am talking about.
good,"will definitely give you managerial experience if you demonstrate interest in learning and taking on new responsibilities. glad I took advantage of all their resources, I'm more knowledgeable for it."
good,"I enjoyed my time with this Company, the only problem was that they didn't want to pay u for what u were worth, speaking on my behalf, I brought alot to the Company and was Severely misused. Had I been compensated, I would still be with the Company."
good,"It's customer service so be prepared to meet a lot of different people, which is the most interesting part of the job. Going in you might think Autozone as a company cares about people, that is not the case. They only care about their profits and nothing else. The only thing that keeps the company balanced enough that it remains existent, is some of the great people they hire who generally care about people."
good,It's a job but need to offer more money a cost of living once a year it's like any other company the employed people their some have a lot of the biddy system
good,"A typical day depends on the store. I worked at a flagship store, so everything was ship shape, which for me with a military background was perfectly acceptable to me."
good,As i stated above this is a great company to work for if you know about cars. I would rather you find a well organized store to work in that’s in a friendly environment.
good,They promote the worst people.  You can move up in the company if you kiss a lot of butt if you have a mind this is not the place for you high Spanish environment
good,I enjoyed working as a Manager at Autozone but there were a lot of things that I didn't like. The rules were never followed and it was pretty chaotic.
good,Company is not very strict about it rules or processes. Co-Manager was scarce at most always on phone or standing outside smoking instead of helping customers
good,"Nothing to say, the work is ok but the pay does not match the work load, the are no types of employee incentives, no paid time off, and a lot of extra hours"
good,It was slow usually. Good work environment and managers. Horrible pay. Horrible hours. No advancement. A good temporary job to get you started in a workplace.
good,"Let's start with the bad:"
good,"My experience at Autozone was good and taught me a lot about customer relations and satisfaction.  But, quickly realized how nieve I was towards the greed of customers and the disrespect you get as ""sales associate"".  I realize Autozone is a retail business.  However, you have to deal with rude and disrespectful customers as a normal daily routine and frequently admit you are wrong when you are right."
good,Most days is the same thing over and over again. The store manager was only choosing people who sucked up to him in order to get a promotion or a pay increase.
good,Was a very decent place to work. They take their company policies very serious! Hard work for little pay although. Great part time job for someone going to school.
good,"AutoZone is an employer that while good when you need work, is by far not a good career path. The management communicates poorly to the store-level, store-level goals are handled by people disconnected from the store operations, and training and scheduling is an absolute farce. However they do match charitable donation, they do have an assistance fund, and the pay is not horrible, but they do play coy with hours quite often. Overall? Look somewhere else unless you're in a bind."
good,"Typical retail sweatshop.  Not a good fit for some people. Need reliable transportation, and better holiday pay situation.  Wouldnt be a good fit for single parents."
good,"Was a commercial driver and the commercial manager was great to work for but got a new store manager and the store, hours, turn over rate was horrible."
good,"Autozone as a company could not care less about you. There is little to no advancement, there is only <5% raises yearly, the hours can be ridiculous, and the benefits are impossible to receive. That being said the people who work in the stores are great, friendly, helpful people."
good,"Falta de vision y caracter, siendo victima de la demagogia de gente viciada."
good,Clientele is outstanding. Upper Management  usually has unrealistic goals that are next to impossible to meet. Pay and promotion scales could use some work.
good,"The job is not hard, you get paid great for the work you do. The Distribution overall is like being in high school though, everyone knows your business even if you haven’t told anyone there yourself. People knew things about me before I even started."
good,Auto zone definitely is a nice place to work. You can learn about auto parts and how they work. As for myself I wasn’t looking for that at that time. As a skilled repair man already plus the low pay that auto zone offered didn’t make it a good fit for me.
good,"Pros: helps get you experience in the working world"
good,"It's not something you want to do forever. Just something basic so you can pay your bills on the way to something better. The schedules are pretty flexible, so it's great if need a part time job while in school."
good,"The company is a good place to find quick employment, gain experience and a paycheck if you still leave at home with your parents. Huge company that can not retain good employees because they don't run the stores efficiently."
good,Work 3 days out of week sometimes 10 hour shift on one day other 2 days are 4 hours each day to make 18 hours a week even that get cut on slow days everyone critizises everyone by putting them down or making fun of them name calling ect they aren't like team work at all so unorganized to me I say
good,Not to bad to work for flexible hours pay could have been better had to work multiple stores in order to support my family and pay Bills would have liked to advance in the company
good,"It’s a good company at times .The daily routen was stocking ,working the register ,getting parts ,and cleaning up.Tye part I like most is working with the same custuumers"
good,Not a physically demanding job but the customers stress you out and the payroll is bi weekly so that sucks and there's very little chance of overtime..
good,id go back as a driver but the tore had very poor managers. and they would change the working hour without telling us. i love driving a hub van for the but working in the tore want easy.
good,Not stable hours or enough money for the pace you have to work.no health benifets offered for part time employees.other then those issues it wasn't a bad place of employment
good,"Good job out of high school or for full-time students. Promotions often come from within, though the promotions are rarely worth fighting for. Training is extensive and regular."
good,"The hours are pretty flexible, which worked well with my school schedule, but pay isn't very high for the workload, and the managerial pay raise is barely more than working as an associate, with many more responsibilities."
good,"Too much to type. They make a policy and they threaten jobs if policy is not followed, yet on a daily they make us do the opposite of what the policy states."
good,good for students if your looking for a few hours of work this is the place for you. only few get full time status. fast pace work with customers that are there because of a problem therefore moody
good,walk in the door clock in see where they have me for the day. most the time i worked to front desk and took care of people as they came in. When we were slow i would front face the store and put away trunk.
good,"easy going day, low stress. there is however a lot of tedious work that sometimes has to be done. Depending on the place management could be poor, relaxed environment."
good,The pay could definitely be better for the stress and the physical demand of the job. It was a lot of heavy lifting and driving. The company is good and the environment was very friendly.
good,"I learned how to handle money as a manager and how to deal with customers as well as the employee. the most enjoyable part of work was the people I worked with, helped me succeed and grow. hardest part of the job was having to answer the phones in a fast and helpful way to not end up having upset customers"
good,I liked autozone for getting parts for my cars for a discount. workplace was always fun. The only thing was that autozone pay was not to exciting and hours where always different.
good,"i been there for 10 years never. the company has great benefits, need incentives. They can improve on hiring more employees for fast pace stores vist."
good,Good High school job. Advancement is not very accommodated and they typically like to outside hire for management positions. Pay was alright and covered COL. No benefits though.
good,Left because lack of advancements and managers were worthless. management wouldn't help out when having issues with stuff. They are disrespectful to employee.
good,"Not a bad place to work but it is only part time pay and hours and you will not be able to make a living with this job, more of a supplement to other income."
good,"This job is very fast passed and requires a lot of details, knowledge, and expertise. You have to be focused and always prepared to get dirty on a daily basis."
good,hard working people and good environment all around with right management friendly co workers but not all AutoZone store are them same. but I work hard
good,"It's an easy part time job, just sometimes being short staffed made work stressful. Closing shifts were definitely difficult at times. Management was always in and out."
good,"Auto Zone is a thriving business with customers demanding your attention every minute you are there.  If they don't know what they need then you can assist them with an adequate network, However; that takes time and time is not something you have so mistakes will be made, a lot.  "
good,"I delivered parts and that was fun be able to be out and about while working, the customers were very nice, the Problem was that everyone was part time so that they didn't have to offer insurance,hard to pay bills working 25hrs weekly."
good,"I liked the independence of my position, but the lack of teamwork and the dishonesty I was expected to support wasn't ethical in my view, so I left this employer."
good,"It was a learning experience. I was able to gain a lot of knowledge about automotive parts. And when things got really crazy I was able to keep my composure, and calm down who needed to be. I can work in a fast pasted area but the work team as a whole must be on the same page."
good,"Didint really care much for the job. The district manager was horrible, My child was in the hospital and all they did was give me points so that they can terminate me. Though my store manager fought for me to stay i decided this place was not for me. I refuse to put a job before my child. I am a single parent."
good,"no chance for promotion, poor benefits, part time. not a bad place to start out but not for a family man needing money to support my family. All in All not a bad starter job"
good,Overall experiences with this company was fine. Being looked over for a promotion by someone that lacked customer service and merchandise accountability was a slap in the face.
good,"stress ,how not to a good work day,to many changes in people,very stressful,trying to get people whom actually wanted to do what ever they wanted to do and not what auto zone corporation made guide lines for them to do,never really had an enjoyable day at work"
good,"Management is all over the place.  There's an unfair bias present.  Some can get away with most anything, while other are held accountable for the smallest of infractions."
good,I met some great people at this job. I learned things about cars that I never knew and I made some great connections with some of my costumers. If you love working with people and making them happy then this is a good job.
good,If you were a full time employee they would treat you like gold but when part time they will cut your hours just because you didn't do something right. worst company to be part time for
good,"Autozone is fast paced. You have to be able to multi task in order to progress in the company.  You also have to be a fast learner. After orientation day, you're basically on your own."
good,A typical day at work starts off fast and then the pace slows and speeds up at various times throughout the day. I learned a lot about many different vehicle parts and mechanics.
good,the company does not consider how to keep the good employees resulting in a high turn over rate. but the joy helping that one guy in need was thegrates reward
good,"Leadership at the very top is enthusiastic but looks to the past for success.  They are sure that the future is Commercial but stuck in the past and not strategic.  "
good,they want you to do multiple jobs for one pay or pay you small pay for a high paying job. it is a lot to do everyday its something different. also people trying to steal from you all the time is worrisome.
good,"mgmtt was great, the higher up mgmt i never met. I was told i would have an opportunity to become a manager that never  happened and never got a raise"
good,"It's a very busy place, you can barely take lunch breaks. It's not enough pay or not enough hours to have a decent paycheck. The work is easy, but the pay and the hours given are not enough unless you're a manager or a supervisor."
good,I had to help assist customers on finding the parts they needed.  I did refunds on Items as well online orders. I would recommend This job for young adults that go to school.
good,Its what you would expect. You get wjat you put in. Not too many advancement opportunities. Dont knock it till you try it. Many do make a carer of it. Not much knowledge needed.
good,"sell, sell, sell. If the customer needs it or not you must make them leave with product. upper management does not care about you in any way other then as a possible lawsuit. If you are looking for a career that you can possibly move up then you better already have an in with the company or have some dirt on a district manager to get anywhere."
good,I belive autozone is a great job i like helping customer in need regional manager not a nice guy talks down on his employees and using cuss words store could be ran better also store manager stilling from store over all people i work with were really nice and good to customer i would work for another autozone but diffrent stores and better pay
good,Was a great experience at first but management quit  and the store fell into the dumps and dragged employees  with it . Was promised full time but never officially got it on paper had full time hours  but didn't get the benefits of a full time employee
good,Great company but horribly organized. I cant tell you how many times they used me to close the store and then open again which is illegal.  One of the reasons I left.  How can someone put their full effort into their work when working with little to no sleep?
good,Mediocre job. No job growth. Management is sub par. On a usual day we have about 150 customers (not busy) and about 120 come back with the wrong parts. Workplace is manageable if you have the right team beside you. Easy work if you know something about cars already. Only hard part is the heavy lifting.
good,"Started out as my first job, loved getting to learn more and more about cars and meeting cool people. Very redundant job, doing the same thing over and over and constantly saying the same thing. Forced to upsell products. They say they will promote people in order to keep the turn around to a minimum."
good,This is a place where it is great to start off at to learn about vehicles while fixing your own car. The culture depends on the store location. Some are more strict on rules and regulations than others.
good,"A typical day at work includes assisting customers with finding parts and getting them off the shelf, answering questions on the phone lines and keeping the store in top shape. I've learned a lot about auto parts being someone who did not know much and it is very helpful being a car owner. Management is good, their position is similar to regular employees but they have the responsibility of counting registers, the safe, scanning in returns and approving returns and other actions of employees. Also keeping the employees on task is a key part of the job due to employees just standing around. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the computers which always crash or have a mouse, keyboard or scanner not working properly and is very frustrating when assisting customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you got the customer the exact part they needed and everything worked out find with their car job."
good,good strong company. unfortunately leadership above store level is unorganized and fickle. hard to get fired so there's a lot of people that shouldn't be in position.
good,I enjoyed some of the costumers I dealt with while working here. Depending on the Store and district manager your experience can vary store to store. the store I worked in has one of the laziest mangers in the district and his boss knew but wouldn't fire him that I why I left. The pay and raises were no good either they expect you to bust your butt so they can get their bonuses while you get nothing. Overall if you are looking for easy part time work or just want to learn more about cars it is a good place to start.
good,"The store manger at my location acted like a high school kid,  had his favorite personnel and didn't care about anything but getting his paycheck constantly getting on to you even if he just praised you"
good,"Autozone was an amazing place to work for, But the management was some what lacking is certain departments, i believe due to the fact that some managers were moved up in their positions to early, i left because one manager decided that they didn't want me their and proceed to try and train me improperly and refuse to let me talk to the store manager about moving up into a position as commercial driver. A big con i also had was it took almost two months for my background and MVR to come back, and i've never lived out of my state."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Auto Zone was helping customers get through bad situation with their vehicle's needs.
good,"When I first joined back in my hometown, AutoZone had a different vibe than it does here in Florida.  I don't know why but down here the pay is too low for the amount of stress you deal with"
good,Decent pay i guess. management is shady. They play favorites and you may get the bad stores to pick while the favorites get the easy ones and they make production while you do not.
good,While working at AutoZone I felt like I didn't have the backing of my other Managers. I really enjoyed the customers and working with them to solve problems. I also loved learning about cars.
good,"I was a parts sales manager at autozone, the job was not hard I have automotive knowledge so it came naturally to me. Management staff could use some fixing no customer service very poor on their behalf. The workplace was fun because I would make our job a pleasant time wen I was there."
good,I enjoyed the five weeks I worked. I was making $9.00 hr and got a check every week. It was nice. I only had one man working with me directly. I hated that the position was let go cause I enjoyed warehouse work.
good,The communication is very important to me but not at Autozone. There is a lots of coming and go part time hiring just not to pay for benefits when i have asked on my very first day at work for a full time but never happened after 6 months.
good,I worked for autozone for almost two years and was a part sales manager. If you aren't constantly trying to sell folks stuff they really don't need you get a talking to. Hours are based on stores sales....at least that's what they tell you. The store I was at hired three new people all while cutting me to 5 hours a week...claiming it was sales not the three new people we didn't need getting those hours....just alot of two faced behavior from upper managment.
good,"Typical Day: Varies"
good,"My job is to handle call in, and walk in support, and also install various parts on customer vehicles. I also perform the closing the store."
good,"ok company, you get to learn a lot about car parts and how parts work. short staffed after 6 pm which was really bad because you have a long line of people waiting and only two workers  maybe(rarely) 3 people  really bad pay, micromanaged and the raises given are horrible, we are talking in cents.   Other locations are better than others and others are worse."
good,Auto Zone is a nice Part time job For High School students who want to make a little extra money.the room for advancement is a little hindered by favoritism and the hours/and compensation rate is not equivalent to the work drivers do
good,This is a good place to work. They strive to have no accidents and accomplish this daily. We also have good morning stretch sessions to help us prepare for a long day at work.
good,"being an employee at autozone is like being a slave. While your work environment and the people you work with can be enjoyable, your compensation for your work is minimal. they don't work with you on the hours you are available. They want you there all the time or as they put it- open availability"
good,"this job was just another part time job I dealt with auto parts "
good,"Its a pretty laid back job, if you like working on cars you'll love this job. my manager was cool, but the store manager was a lazy guy that never even came to work and never did the schedule when it needed to be done."
good,"Shifts or days are never the same, co-workers normally were good to work with but pay was very low with no benefits. nightshifts were the most stressful with only 2 employees working when 3 to 4 were needed."
good,Auto parts industry in retail environment.  High turn over work place but can be fun with the proper team in place.  Growth potential is slow and the pay is not very good.
good,"Anyone who knows cars knows they brake down and when they do most people want the easy way out and i feel that's when Autozone truly plays a big roll in. Needless to say with great need there is great profit and its a company who has been able to successfully increases there revenue yearly with a high turnover rate. How so? Unless its because of employee relations I can't seem to rap my mind around how they could treat employees lower than than fine print. My beef with this company is its false sense of corporatism as well established  as it may be I feel stores and districts are managed as if they were paternal twins in a string of mom and pop stores. My skills and experience got me a top notch promotion within 5 months of employment but as with any new guy in a new position compensation is ""DOE"" not depends how great you do so I was (underpaid). My position required an assistant which I never received  forcing me to work harder at a non competitive minimum wage leaving me overworked. With talks to managers an corporate affiliates I could not get them to budge on pay or help forcing me to leave for injustice and pay. My logic was being underpaid and overworked constructive a commercial department from scratch and exceeding all my goals and projected profits monitoring my losses, employees expenses and most of all the paperwork for it all I gave it my all  and my department thrived and exceeded expectations I was sure my weight was being pulled and with enthusiasm. Though knowing it was more then enough they were oblivious til I was gone and numbers, customers, and employees"
good,Store was crazy and the manager was not very organized. Everything was way behind on time jobs needed to be finished. Hours where not what i was offered
good,management was terrible but customers were always the best part of the day. Would i work there again? Yes in a different store; 0661 No
good,"It is not that Auto zone sucks, but more so the promises of promotions. I have been promised a dollar more for over a year, as well as a promotion to assistant store manager."
good,Underpaid with no benefits for PT employees. I'm a PSM and only make $10 hr. Also the constant pressure of selling CoC that no one really wants along with those packets. We are always demanded to sell those and if we don't we get hounded by the higher ups.
good,Was OK Just enjoy more of an office environment not much for the warehouse environment most of my jobs consist of working on a computer
good,"Bad scheduling cause no home time"
good,Good job.  Bad scheduling.  Learned a lot more about vehicles.
good,"Auto Zone can be a great place to work. They have great job security"
good,The Autozone by Walmart. It is very slow and boring but you have to keep finding things to do. The computer always says the part is in stock and then when you go to find it. It is not there and your the one that gets chewed out by customers. Autozone only hires part time now and its not enough hours to make a decent wage.
good,"A typical day consisted of trouble-shooting car issues, finding parts, installing wiper blades and head lights, and stocking. The best part of this job was learning about automotive parts."
good,"overall,good atmosphere.learned alot from fellow employees with there experance overall.co workers were great"
good,"A typical day at work would be the same as Car Quest. I've learned about car parts, how to put them on, and what to loo for in a car. My co-workers were professional. The hardest part of the job was staying clean. The most enjoyable part of the job was my fun co-workers."
good,Great company to work for very nice people very easy work and easy sechudleing
good,While I was working at AutoZone things were not running properly with upper management. No communication between zoners and management made it difficult to work with co-workers and customers. The hardest part of working their would be the pay for the experience necessary to do the job accurately. The most enjoyable part of the job would be assisting customers with personal vehicle needs and knowing they're satisfied with the information offered to them by an informative AutoZoner..
good,"i learned about different car aprts. Also I learned about teamwork,operating cash registers,and great customer service skills."
good,if you dont have kids to feed its a good job. but if you have kids then get a higher paying job.
good,It was cool but there was a lot of politics in that company and there wasn't much room to grow.
good,"Autozone was customer based.  A typical day at Autozone included customer service, looking up parts, locating parts, and cashing out the customer.  I learned teamwork and customer service at Autozone.  The managment was very helpful and experienced in employee and manager relationships.  The hardest part of my job was to know the parts that are needed for the customer.  The most enjoyable part was the different types of customers I encountered."
good,"Very busy days, asked to wear a lot of hats. I learned that  I would rather work for dealerships because the atmosphere & clients make the the job less stressful."
good,had no benifits there. Management was alfool. No room for advancement. Really a dead end job.
good,"I was grateful to have been given the change to Manage a Store.  I worked hard, long hours for 6 years, only to be let go because of employees (who had only been there less than a year, were lazy when it came to doing things around the store when not busy and didn't like working for a woman) made up false accusations about me.   Upper management has no clue what Store Managers have to put up with.  They tell you, ""its' your store, you control it"", yet when you write up employees or leave notes for employees to do things when your off, employees cry and complain that they are threats and the Managers are mean.  And upper management does not back up the Manager at all.  Yet they threaten the Managers all the time that we will work 7 days, etc. if we don't get the sales up.  You can't make customers buy things they don't need or don't have the extra money for.  You can suggest extra products, but you can't force them on a customer.  And policy?  What's that?  They change the policy to fit their needs and to fit the people they want to save, especially if they are buddies with someone else in the family.  The money was okay, you can get a bonus, only if the store works together and does their job.  They expect you to work with only two people on the counter, to save money, which is impossible sometimes, when you have one outside with customers, lines waiting at the register and inventory management and other things that have to be done to run the store productively.  And then to top it off, they lie to unemployment and deny it, because they don't want to pay anything.  After all"
good,"This was a decent job i enjoyed it , but if your not in the click your out !"
good,"opening and closing of the store and paperwork. I learned a lot about what it take to manage a retail store. Store management does not like to do their job so, it makes it harder for the Sales Manager to do their job. The co-workers always complaining because their lazy. I would have to say the hardest part about the job is dealing with the customers that have no idea on what parts their looking for and then gets upset at you cause you don't know what their talking about. The most enjoyable part about the job is when I get to clock out."
good,"I work 50 hours a week and was off on Sunday and Wednesday."
good,"Over all It is a good place to work, if you have the experience to give accurate advice and and can solve problems quickly. People in general do not want to wait. They need it solved right away. It is a good stepping stone for some who wants to make a life of it. Unfortunately the company as a whole does not compensate the  people in the company as tho they should . It is a job not a career. Autozone is so big and profitable for two reasons high turn around and lack of pay in the right area's. Its is also a place where all mistakes never go unnoticed, and good things done perfectly are very rarely recognized. They do not try to help the ones that help them. Advancement in the company is promised and rarely given.  You are expected to live, and breathe Autozone. If you want to further your education you will never make it past Part-time. You are expected to give up everything and even asked to in order to get a raise. The raises come once a yr @  0.10 cent's to 0.25 cents more per hr capping out at 11.60 an hr unless you have been with the company for more than 10Yrs. In short if you looking for something for the next year or two while you scrap the bottom of the barrel just to make rent here you go. If you want something to further your future stay in school, and get payed for your hard work and expertize in your field of study and If its automotive, I will tell you the truth.  You will never be payed what your worth with this company.  They simply will not do it, they would rather invest in commercials then their own people, unless they are already at the top. The people at"
good,"A typical day at Auto Zone is quite simple. I have learned quite a bit about auto parts, sales and the general daily processes of a store. The management is average. The hardest part about the job is learning which of the three ways you are taught to use the computer system is the correct way."
good,"I am available from 7:15am-9:15pm, Monday-Saturday and 8:45am-7:15pm on Sunday. My schedule changes every week. I am looking for a schedule that is more family friendly. I enjoy managing the store and helping people."
good,Come in and do sales and run the cashier. Stock on truck day. Work real hard. Only received a 10 cent raise. One time never late. Did my work and did not accomplish anything.
good,"answering phones, different functions of cars and trucks, management was ok depends on who you worked with, co-workers were ok made some new friend that I still talk to, the hardest parts was listening to customer complaintes, the best part was learning something new everyday."
good,Decent part-time job was promised FT position and haven't received it yet I am an outstanding worker there
good,Working here doesn't require one to be particularly good at working on cars or be a natural born salesman though those traits would be helpful. It does require one to have the patience of Gandi or Mother Teresa though due to sales number obsessed managers and customers that obviously feel that people that work behind the counter are there to absorb their frustration over what ever is ailing their poorly maintained vehicles at the moment.
good,i was a parts rep for customers that came to the store or called in
good,"Fast paced fun work environment. I enjoy working with the customers, especially the regulars. However, management is poor. They demand quite a bit, from employees from their rediculous dress code to silly little procedure that make your job twice as hard with no real positive effect. There is also no positive reinforcement and they have no problem cutting non manager employees hours to pad their report without thinking that we need our hours to support families. Hours of operation are good, no crazy start or closing times. Over all not a horrible place to work, better management would go a long way."
good,"I was promised a certain amount of money to work for the company and have not received that amount thinking coming into a new store that I would receive it eventually, and still has yet to happen. Great management crew in the higher end, but there are also some managers that have no right working in the automobile industry."
good,"My co-workers at Autozone are great. We have built a relation-ship in customer service. Helping each other so as to provide the best parts, at the right price. Helping the consumer to understand the parts,(how they work), and helping them to find qualified service techs in the area. By doin this i have created a return customer rate second to none. Every day i work i get calls from customers thanking me, or asking me my advice. I see them outside of Auto Zone and always get a smile, and a kind word. This to me is what customer service is about, treating every customer like he, or she is important. Building a strong return customer base ensures that the business will grow, thereby creating job security for me."
good,I did cash handling
good,Good job to start with. I enjoyed the people i worked with. Sometime tough dealing with alot of the customers.
good,This Job has no recognition for hard work done individually. When one person does all of the work the business is successful but the whole team will be recognized.
good,Today will mirror Yesterday
good,horrible management. the schedules are ok. co workers were fine.
good,I do not believe I will work for Autozone again! I did enjoy the company of 2/3 of the people I worked with.
good,"In the years I worked for AutoZone it was O.K., I wanted advance and there was no room or they would hire outside of company instead of promoting existing employees. The work expected from you was a lot more than they were willing to pay you for it. The store I worked for the store manager had favorites, which Is unfair & very unprofessional. I was a very hard worker and never missed work, at times it could be stressful but, I could handle it. I just think at times it could be so much better had the manager been more professional & fair. We were suppose to be a TEAM! Also the store I worked at was not busy enough for me."
good,"One of the main reasons I work at AutoZone is due to the fact that the hours are very flexible. I am a full time college student right now so this aspect of the job is very crucial for me. Also at this job you do learn a good amount of things about how auto-parts work and where they are located in vehicles. On the hand, a negative aspect about AutoZone is the pay. Employees that work there are handling harmful objects daily and get paid a minimum wage for it. Not only that, raises are rarely given out regardless of how long an employee has work for the company. If you want a job and have no job experience, I would recommend AutoZone."
good,"The only fun part about working here is dealing with rush hour because it keeps you busy and on top of your work. Otherwise, workers and management have a distant level of relationship."
good,"I applied for a full time position and was turn into part time , with very low pay. I did t have a job so I had to accept. My hrs are all over the place never remaining the same or even close."
good,"My review is base on present store."
good,"The people are good to work with, but the staffing and training are not the best. They do work with you on hours and family stuff when it helps them. They didn’t train very well than yell and get mad when you didn’t know what to do cause you were never trained on how to do it."
good,"Pay is not so great, but fun to work at. If you are motivated, you can do very well there as it is an entry level job. Some immaturity between customers and staff."
good,"little training given, long hours dealing with coworkers that don.t want to work, so they hide from the customer in the back , forcing a few to do most of the work."
good,"PSM is responsible for assisting store management team with customer service, exceeding customer expectations and muse be able excel in a fast paced environment. Delegating and completing store merchandising tasks and assisting management team with password authorization to process returns, price overrides, and resolve customer satisfaction situations."
good,Not a great place if your looking to move up. They are set on flexibility and will not work with you if you need it. Other than that it’s a paycheck..
good,"there would be days where it was too slow or days where it would get out of control, there was never in between. the managers at times did not know how to work with their employees"
good,"The management at the location I worked was some of the worst management I have ever come across. Even the district Managers wouldn't listen or care for the cries of help that were asked multiple times. Never seen a manager work the Bare Minimum or less before, just awful."
good,I worked at a store with great management that cared about the employees then I transferred to a store in another city and all the general manager cares about is getting her bonus. Pushing rewards cards and check out challenges repeatedly to customers ultimately making them kind of upset with the constant asking.
good,I love being a manager. I started as a red shirt and worked my way up to a gray shiry. I love helping people and customer's. I love the team atmosphere.
good,"Employees are forced to push certain products on customers and are punished if unsuccessful. Autozone is a company that really has little interest in the experiences of their employees and only focus on their sales. Employees are essentially expected to prioritize the company over all things (family, personal life, school, etc.) The most enjoyable part of the job is mostly the relationships you establish with coworkers and management."
good,Was a secure job but employees are just a number management was disrespectful and rude to all staff. Duties were easy to perform and work load was not stressful at all. Management was the problem here.
good,"Good place to work if you know your car parts.  Store team is generally supportive and collaborative.  But, since retail environment, pay is not that great."
good,"Good place to work if you have interest in automotive repair. You will gain knowledge pretty fast. Management is on hand to help and development is fast. "
good,"Could be Better, is a great job , only thing they need to check backgrounds when they hiring manager s, the manager is suck they treat you us slaves, hated people, for not reazon, hold grudges to you for nothing only because they wear a gray short, but they're lacys, bully s,"
good,"They ask me a few question regarding car parts. They explain the job role. They also explain autozone culture and why its a fun place to work for."
good,"its not bad, but the employee turnaround his way to hi due to the pay and they want to run a store with hi traffic with only two employees specially on a weekend. they want way to much out of employees."
good,Nothing special about the place and if you get  stuck working with a store manager who felt that he was the only one who needed time off this would be the perfect place for you!
good,"The people are good people for the most part. Hard to make great money here if you're not close to the higher ups, but show up and get paid for your hrs."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job,in my opinion, is the opportunity to be around different customers. Need to be a people person for sure. Fast paced at times.  Good Communication skills is also a big need in this type of business."
good,A decent place to wok but does not pay much and let the store manager push there work onto other manager. Stand around when truck comes in. Store manager are very lazy
good,"The job itself is not bad. It's upper management constantly making demands that change from week to week. Customers are customers and you can work through that. The pay is enough to afford rent and some groceries, the pay raises were below standard. Work hours are long and you are expected to help other stores even if you are short-handed. You are required to push sales all day long and if you run the store you also must make up the commercial business."
good,"The management was fairly decent and the manager was very respectable and friendly. Very inconsistent hours and pay with no overtime whatsoever. You were lucky to get 20 hours per week. Other than that, not too bad of a work environment."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to solve customer problems by getting their merchandise in a timely fashion. More so I loved being able to assist them in solving the problem by using my knowledge to provide solutions or product advice.
good,Working at AutoZone can be okay if you're okay with hating where you work. Apply somewhere else. Experiences very from store to store but it's a bad company to work for me ver all. Waste if 9 years of my life.
good,"If you are a store manager, there is no work/life balance. Upper management was good at talking about helping out and fixing things but weren't so great about actually doing so."
good,Auto Zone Inc. has a top notch mission statement. The culture is very rich. And the knowledge that you could gain in the automotive industry is exponentially great. I just wish it was a more symbiotic work environment.
good,"You need to split up work responsibilities and employees, have certain employees focus only on freight and stock. And have different employees focus on sales and customers. They don't give you 40 hour work weeks and the schedule always varies(open and close)."
good,"this job is extremely fast paced and it can be long hours during their peak season (tax season)n and inventory of every piece in June. "
good,"Training and sales software not easy to learn quickly. Parts organization was fair but could be greatly improved.Most of the commercial accounts were satisfied at the higher tier levels, but the smaller shops not so pleased."
good,My coworkers are very friendly and respectful as well as my manager. I am always getting called in to fill in for people when they do not show up or when they call in. I am always getting asked to stay later because someone is running late or called in. I am very fluent in Spanish and in English and they have not gave me a raise. I feel very unappreciated working there.
good,"Great Place To Work If You Love Selling Car Parts Helping Solve People's Problem, But The Rest Was For The Birds. Management are the only ones getting paid enough to make a good living but even the assistant manager's pay sucked. No benefits All the management did all day was duck work. Stay away from the slave zone!"
good,"Unrealistic expectations for sales, no opportunity for advancement, too routine, raises are typically a quarter but no more than 80 cents at a time, too much duties for not enough pay."
good,"Was alright from the start, I was pulled to do a changeover cermony for a general in the army, when I returned, my hours shrunk every week, until I wasn’t on the schedule at all, and was forced to find other employment."
good,When I started with this company I was excited and moved up quickly. My store manager was great but the district managers have unrealistic goals and want you to not ask questions or input.
good,"I mainly pursued a job at AutoZone because I enjoyed all of the items they offered so close to my house, and it was always convenient to shop there. Unfortunately, working at AutoZone is kind of a mess. The store I world at was low volume, which meant that we couldn't put on as many part time employees as we should have to cover weekly truck shipments. This was exacerbated by the fact that we had the same floor area as other stores, so even though we sold less, and thus could take on less employees, we had to manage the same amount of floor space as the high volume stores. The end result was that we were never caught up on truck, and we always had more stuff to put away. I ended up quitting just after the Christmas season when my hours approached 4-5 hours a week. At the time, I was being pushed to constantly be moving while in the store, and it was obvious they needed me, but they didn't have the hours to give me."
good,"Started out fine.  20 or so hours/week.  As time went on, the hours increased.  I was hired as a commercial driver, but now I cashier, put batteries, light bulbs, and windshield wiper blades in all sorts of run down vehicles, and in all sorts of weather.  They expect you to wear a uniform and expect you to pay for your shirts.  Never had to pay for a company shirt before.  Expected to stock parts, pick parts,  work the floor, cashier.  Antiquated computer system.  Constantly changing work schedule.  Training is haphazard at best.  Low pay for the expectations.  Broken equipment.  If you prove you will show up on time, you will be called to fill in for those who do not.  Meetings take place late at night or early in the morning.  Customers expect you to have supreme expertise.  Tested on a monthly basis.  You are your own janitor, as they have no janitorial service at stores.  Took them a week to fix a broken toilet.  I’m a retiree,  so it is different for me.  For someone younger, stay in school, learn a trade, so you do not have to resort to this."
good,"Great culture in my opinion, turnaround rate is a bit above average. Management tends to transition quite often, but tends to revolve around core values based on company policy."
good,"Customer service comes first then everything else follows. If youre looking to be micro managed, but want a discount on car parts or youre a felon or you are bilingual. Autozone is for you."
good,"Auto Zone is not the place to be if you want to be creative and bring your own ideas.  They are very ""corporate minded"" and while working there you are nothing more than a clerk doing what you are told and nothing else."
good,Management is lacking and room to improve is low they rather hire a new manager then promote a person. upper management will hold things not work related just so they wont have to pay a person for the quality they actually work.
good,Fast paced environment in which was sales focused and driven. Very high involvement with management. Can become stressful sometimes if no plan is made.
good,"It's an alright job,good customer service,hourly pay needs improvement.better employee communication with upper management.better benefits for part time and full-time employees"
good,Job is pretty chill but management is lacking in backbone. Everyone smokes right outside the door even while customers are walking in. Gives our store a bad reputation.
good,Easy job if you know parts. For those coming in outside with no knowledge you would have to motivate yourself to learn the job or you will not like the job.
good,It was very good work. Nothing too hard but a good challenge for your brain every day. Once I stepped into management they had me work every store in the district. Basically ran myself dry for money.
good,Company is a good entry level company which can give you great titles with little pay. Nonetheless it will be a good gateway to get you into the automotive industry and to see the way that one of the biggest parts companies in the USA operates.
good,Everyone is very professional and gets their job done in the best way they can. They are very helpful and knowledgeable. They take care of the customers very well.
good,"sucked. great knowledge taught how to be a great company for customers not employees.The hardest part was being away from my kids and not recognized for the sacrifice. It is a ""what have you done for me lately"" relationship."
good,"no set schedules or routes, must have a flexible schedule to work here.  Some managerial attitudes with other managers on a daily basis is very childish... management afraid to fire people for fear of lawsuits."
good,"More for someone who needs something casual as a way to bring in some extra cash,but unless you are a manager or higher,dont expect a living wage.Expect to be micromanaged by corporate, but excellent work is recognized and rewarded."
good,Great place to learn about customer service and sales .  Its not a very good career choice. If your looking for great pay and benefits ..they are reserved for upper management .
good,typically we deal with a lot of customers helping them with the parts they need for their vehicles plus the knowledge they need to fix said vehicles to the best of our ability.  I learned a lot about different car parts and how they work in unison to help keep the vehicle operating ideally and the safeguards in place to keep the vehicle operable and the owner safe.  Management expects the world from us however everyone with the exception of the manager and assistant manager makes minimum wage.  There are no incentives to sell nor are there any upward advancements in the company.  The hardest part of the job is advising customers about virtually every vehicle on the road with the accuracy they need.  I enjoy the down time with my coworkers the most.  They almost make it worth staying around but I deserve better than minimum wage.  Especially at my age and considering that I live in New York where the cost of living is so high
good,It was good for the time I was there everything went smoothly but I wouldn't recommend working there if you are looking for a set shift job. They pay was okay but not enough for all that we did.
good,My typical day at Autozone is fast pace from the beginning to the end of the day. Giving my very best customer service from start to finish. My opinion on management could be better and more hands on. Hardest part of the job is to satisfy a dissatisfied customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is make our sales goal for the day.
good,"The ability to meet new and exciting people daily and gain auto care and parts knowledge. Due to daily travel assignments, must be able to manage time and unsupervised."
good,was pretty boring overall then when it got busy it was like you did all the work with no help. Got treated poorly was told to do certain jobs all the time when it was suppose to be broken up between people
good,"Work / Life balance was a little off, but that's to be expected with a retail position. The company required ongoing training for new products, and would pay mileage."
good,"Upper management very spotty - I worked with great managers & quite possibly the most inexperienced & aggressive  manager I have ever met. "
good,Its a very good company to work for if they had good leaders leading a team. They seem to hire people that look down on their help and second guess anything you do. Especially the territory sales manager for the north Florida region.
good,I had to work for the worst manager I ever had.  Emotionally abusive towards myself and other associates.  Would proposition female customers.  And district management ignored it because he was good for sales metrics.
good,"A typical work day is very long.  I have learned many thing about retail and the business side of this operation.  Management is very concerned about small detail that at times, hurts operations."
good,"Very male dominant atmosphere, limited promotions and raises or benefits. Difficult environment for females. Not family or life balance geared. Complaints against management not taken seriously by human resource department."
good,"AutoZone can be a great place to work but as of late, things that are supposed to be company policy do not apply to certain individuals. There has been a lot of employee turnover as of late, including upper management."
good,Autozone is pretty good to work for but the money and hours suck you cant live of it will need a second job unless your coming in as management you do learn about the basics of cars
good,"Solo me desempeñe como practicante, iba en horario de estudiante, nada pesado y hay buen ambiente y trato."
good,"Lugar correcto para trabajar,excelentes lideres"
good,"Its a good place to work for part time kids coming out of high school and or people who are working and need a second job. However, its hard to move up and its not the absolute best place to make a career out of."
good,Everybody from the Regional Manager to the Store Managers literally use profanity  at other employess.. No one decent wants to work or can thrive in that  type of environment.
good,"Expect to work long hours, if a full-time employee. There is no balance between work and home life when working in the store, AutoZone's needs come first."
good,"A fun place to work. Customer service and Technical support can be painstaking. The worst parts of the job are the pay scale, lack of opportunity, and variable hours."
good,"up sale every customer with what they need to buy for the right job. "
good,"Slow paced on most days other days it is fast paced.. On the days that it is fast paced it is enjoyable to work because you are staying busy; though, on the slow days a 4 hour shift might feel more like 8..."
good,Good part time job. Learning something new every day. Selling people parts they don't need. Not great for full time. Employees aren't looked out for. Customers are more important than employees
good,each day was pretty much the same I would go to the phone/computer and wait for customers to call and I would answer the phone and try to help the customer with prices and how to work on their vehicles
good,"This is a job that is fun and relaxing, but the absolutely worst part is the customers. Almost everyone that walked through the door talked down to you like you were a uneducated slave because you don’t know what size the bolt is that the customer through away."
good,Very fast environment angry customers all the time be prepared for it people also don't know anything about the vehicles including staff so get used to it
good,Finding knowledgable counter people has become increasingly more difficult.  I feel that I learned a lot about automotive as an employee.  Continuing education in the field is lacking.  Many people leave this job because of lack of advancement.
good,I relocated and that's when the work environment was one that I could not tolerate.  The people were not managed so it was chaos all the time.  I tried to implement things that my store manager may agree on but showed no effort in actually managing his team
good,"Corporate seemed more interested in retail consumer walking in the door buying small items than they were commercial customers. this was leading to low sales. cars now more than ever need to be taken to a professional vs a backyard mechanic."
good,"It is a very relaxed work environment. There seemed to be a ridiculous amount of gossip at autozone. If you like to work on cars or are a car enthusiast then this is the job for you, dont be expecting much pay though"
good,the people I worked with where okay when they didn't call in and force you to work an open to close  management was horrible most people didn't seem to care about there job
good,Customer Service is very key in this job. You have to be able to handle and deal with the stress of working with customers who know absolutely nothing about vehicles to the ones who think they know everything. While doing this you have tasks that need to be completed on a daily basis which can be difficult with a high customer count. The people that you work with make it worth working for Autozone.
good,enjoy the job but management lack of advancement and pay is a huge problem people are lazy and it seems if you don't do it it wont get done. I cant garuntee that's for all autozones. you eventually have regulars that know your name and just come to talk with you.
good,"overall day was pretty quick pace, very little down time, loved running the commercial account and dealing with customer/shops,also liked the discounts."
good,"High turn around rate, low wages. High expectancy to up-sell without incentives or commission. People skills are needed, as are computer skills and basic automotive knowledge."
good,"Days weren't terribly fast, they were rather relaxed and steady."
good,Great place to work excellent benefits in the job training good workout people help take care of one another feel satisfied at end of day management has an open door policy
good,"if you know nothing, and you want to learn? definatley come to autozone.. Its a great start. they educate you on everything from  fluids, brakes, and rotors, to starters, alternators, fuel consumption, ac, belts, and you can get your ASE. You get out of it what you put into it."
good,"pretty relaxed place to work but upper management is always cutting hours so hours decrease weekly. Management (gray shirts) is not very inclusive of red shirts (regular associates) and only looks out to provide hours to other gray shirts. Advancement opportunities are practically non-existent. Once you are a gray shirt there is no room to grow except to someday be a store manager. If you work in commercial department there is even less room for growth than in the DIY department. Positions available in commercial department are: Driver, Commercial sales assistant manager, commercial manager and theres few opportunities available."
good,"I hate this job and I'm seeking for a new one quick. This job is not a job it's torture to me. Everyone that goes into that store is just rude and nasty they don't know how to respect and then when you get rude and nasty back they want to fight and send the District manager a complaint about you. They also want you to do everything for them things that we are not suppose to do in peoples cars and it has to be now like, they want you to leave the customer that your with to help them."
good,It's like any sales jobs. It has its ups and downs. It's an okay job for a person that doesn't have much experience. Even better job for an auto student.
good,"honestly i didnt really enjoy my time at  autozone, it  just didnt pay the way i wanted the hours were weird, some days 6 hours other days 12+ hours some weeks 40 hours other weeks 20 hours"
good,"Working at Autozone was sometimes fun and sometimes very stressful just like any other job. You get to meet a lot of great customers, and get to know the people in your area very well as a lot of people come in for auto related issues and purchases. "
good,"You get a paycheck and get to talk about cars and car related things which is fun. The autozone in potsdam,ny has a terrible manager that doesn't keep up with inventory or know how to manage."
good,"Worked with good people at both locations, enjoyed establishing the new location, and developing commercial accounts, stealing them from the competition who had become lazy. Store management was pretty good, however district management was the worst."
good,The job is a awesome job however manamen makes things a good job very difficult. The workers are great however promotion is impossible if your not liked.
good,"Environment and practices varies store to store. You end up dealing with allot of people who want you to diagnose their car problem and recommend how to fix it sight unseen over the phone, all the while there are 5 people on hold and 10 angry customers standing in line. Doesn't help when there is only one other person working with you and they are in the parking lot replacing some hot girls wipers and taking his time doing it. Lost of questionable business practices as well that I won't go into."
good,I loved the work I just didn't recieve enough hours and pay. I probably would have still been there if I could have gotten more hours and a raise. I have to support my family.
good,"This job is better fit for people who are well experienced in mechanics. Unfortunately, employees with this kind of experience will not take time out of their work to help you. Their computer program to refresh your memory about how the company runs is of no use at all either."
good,Have to know someone to get ahead or you have to work really hard management never does their job. Just hire the correct ppl and ppl would love to stay here
good,"great place to work, great staff, good products, trained well. possible long shift but also possible short shift, customers are usually rude but management would handle it."
good,"There is an employee stock purchase plan that allows all employees to purchase stock at a 15% discount  However, management is very resistant to change, and the company culture encourages sticking to old/antiquated ways of thinking, so innovation is not encouraged within the organization.  This has reflected in the stock price over the past year, as we are unable to come up with strategies to compete with companies such as Amazon who have moved into the automotive parts sector. "
good,"Enjoyed the day to day. Helped customers, pulled parts. Store manager is fantastic. Employees are fun and good at the job. District manager doesnt understand"
good,"I Start as Stock Controller and hen do Dispatch,Warehusing and sales then i do Recieving.Apply for Manager Position but it seems if you are not friends with the bosses at hesd office your application went to file 13"
good,"A great environment, fast paced and always moving industry.   customer interaction and problem solving skills are greatly nourished and built upon in this environment."
good,"The job was fairly simple in its scope. Help customers. That's what I did on a daily basis. I was pretty good at it as well, no complaints from customers or management on my work ethic or style. By the end I was the only employee who had been at that branch since the store opened and so there was an entirely new set of management and coworkers there. I learned that at the end of the day you should work hard not because your boss tells you or because its expected. You should work hard because that's what you should do. When you work for anyone, put in your all and expect nothing extra in return. Overall, working there was an excellent learning and working experience."
good,"I am one of four Parts Sales Managers. I take instructions from the Store Manager, which involves helping to maintain correct inventory counts, and processing customer orders, and returns, and helping to put away truck shipments.  I communicate our Sales Progress Reports and other reports pertaining to store operations with the Customer Service Personnel.  Part of my duties include auditing the cash registers and preparing the deposits for the daily sales, and reports pertaining to them."
good,used to be a fun work place all of the good advisors left. Now to many lazy people and low moral.. Its a good job but if you are not a favorite to plan on moving up. Pay is decent but don't get stuck there try to move on with the skills you gain from there.
good,"This job was good, I like how you're always busy doing something. But I think that the pay is too low. The management is great and efficient. It is a customer service job so there's always a chance a customer will be rude."
good,I really liked this position for a lot of reasons. My boss was a good family man who I could respect and be proud to work for. On the other hand the guys working around me were the type to talk negative things behind the backs of anyone who wasn't on the clock. As well as they all had a decent amount of problems with drugs.
good,I enjoyed my job. It was fun and I got a chance to meet a lot of people from all different walks of life. Solving people's problems is probably is by far the best feeling you can have in reatil.
good,"Worked for 2 years and moved all the way to ASM. Low pay, and long hours. Its a great after school job as they do not train except on your first day. They also treat their managers horribly."
good,Autozone is a good fast place to work.  Great customer service skills and a drive to learn and excel will help advancement.  Good leadership exists in most all of our locations.
good,"This is the perfect job for someone who is passionate about cars and their parts. The downfalls are management and their lack of care when it comes to their employees, and also the pay. For being a competitor with places like NAPA, their pay is bad."
good,"Clock in check the overstock list, open the store service the customers needs far as installation, returns management issues, commercial sales and delivery of parts to dealers and mechanic shops and for a relationship with the staff and management."
good,"I was a part-time worker, but would regularly be asked to work full-time hours and then some.  They weren't even very accommodating to my school schedule, I had to either skip class or call in sick to work more then a few times because of this."
good,"My manager blocked every opportunity for my advancement and took credit for my success.  This is why I moved on.  After I left, I found that my manager was being investigated for fraud and internal theft."
good,Great place to learn new things and work while studying. if you work hard you can move up fairy quick onto higher positions
good,"It was a good job until I had to have my surgery and I needed to go part time for a while. That's when my boss said I wasn't scheduled, but really had me on the schedule."
good,landed a management position with something I love to do.  But having the politics made life for all of us difficult. upper management refuses to see the problem.
good,"Great place to work but pay was horrible, people can't live on minimum wage. After one year of service I got a 25 cent raise. I was very disappointed. I was trying to find a seasonal part time job to assist with Christmas and one of my co-workers told my boss who then let me go. I hadn't given my notice or intended to quit. Came at the same time as awful raise so I didn't argue, just moved on."
good,If you enjoy working with your hands and anything auto related.  Then AutoZone has great opportunity to learn and advance your career in the auto industry.
good,"Allows you to keep up to date on the most common parts needs of consumers. Offers benefits and competitive pay. They also pay for ase certifications. Also offer training to employees so they stay up to date on the latest information. Also offers a 25,000 life insurance policy"
good,"AutoZone had a fun work place so it made my job easy to do, the pay was not good but its a job where people can move up in there position at a very fast rate."
good,I got along with everyone there and am missed and still associate with the workers.. we would handle every situation on my shift as a team and knock out all tasks  ..I enjoyed my workers and customers because we all joked around and made it a fun work environment and we still got our jobs done.. I couldn't ask for a better team because they are and always will be my friends even though I quit...hardest part was learning where all the arts were and the names of certain things an what they did but I learned quickly
good,Good place to work part-time poor upper  management ask for a lot make fake promises don't stand behind their word. no overtime no real benefits  poor hiring practices
good,"A typical day at Auto Zone DC, starts with exercise. After you do group exercised, it is time to start the day. Grab your Voxware! At Auto Zone  DC you must make rate weekly or you are terminated. Co-workers are great. Management, not so much. The hardest part of the job is trying to work around others with skids and pallets to make rate, as many accidents occur."
good,Management is always on you to sell. Supervisors are always pushing quotas on products and don't appreciate the work of the workers. Fast paced when there is work.
good,"A good typical day at work is making sales, getting our to do list done, helping our customers by installing their new battery, wipers, etc. Learning more about auto parts, testing about parts. I started two years ago, and what I have to say about being an autozoner at Autozone, is amazing. I love learning about parts as I go. I never knew what a ""tune up"" was, now I'm telling the person what they need for a full tune up and I must say that they didn't even know about two parts or so. Being a female at a auto parts store is fun for me, because some customers prefer a guy to help them, and sometimes even that co-worker turns around to ask me for help. I enjoy the co-workers I have, they're very helpful, and funny, they're easy to work with. "
good,"I worked here as a college student. My boss was able to work with my school schedule, and I got enough hours to get by with living expenses as a student, but only just."
good,"Like working with the associates, and helping the customers to repair there vehicles. "
good,Autozone has a quick path from sales associate to Assistant Parts Manager.  Additional responsibilities were available if you asked for them.  Each day at work was different and the variety provided a positive environment for all.  Although corporate management was not always immediately responsive to the individual stores.
good,"I am not to much a talkative person,"
good,They have favorites that get all the rewards for low to minimal work being done. the credit that should be given to the hard workers tend to go unseen.
good,newest auto-zone in the pacific northwest. working there since July 2015. management turnover is high. training for new systems in vehicles non-stop. being a female in a auto parts store is a challenge and customers would like to speak with a man.
good,ok company to work for pay is below the pact management in the NE region are not all that great but do-able job security is not that safe
good,need to work a lot do a lot of sale keep al the time a mechanic place clean with out oil tapered and swapped the floors windows.
good,I typical day was spent running around looking for parts that were not on a shelf but in the computer because someone was either to lazy to put them up right or they had been stolen.
good,"Great place to learn more in the automotive field, but not to make money. Very over worked and the pay isn't there. they ask a lot of there employees and not willing to pay them what they are worth. highest rise anyone I know have received was $.25 and that was once."
good,"en cultura y pagos no es la mejor empresa, falta de mas flexibilidad para el desarrollo de los miembros de la empresa, si no eres de confianza te puedes quedar en el mismo puesto por años, limitan un poco la creatividad de las personas, la atención al cliente es muy importante asi como las pruebas técnicas que se realizan solo no salirse de las cosas que nos capacita la empresa, ya que hay personas que no cuentan con todo el conocimiento necesario en la misma para realizar tareas fuera de lo que la empresa pretende"
good,I am currently a receptionist and a sales associate. there are no benefits in this workplace. this is why im looking for something more fitting
good,it would be a great first job. its just not the career i am wanting for my life. i have been grateful for the opportunity though.
good,A big chain auto parts store. Most co workers had some automotive experience. Promotion to management was usually from within.
good,Great culture and great intentions for customer service. Insensitive to personal life at times. Poor management at certain times.
good,"- some good days and bad days."
good,This place would be so much better if there was better management and if the company actually cared about its employees.
good,"A typical day is very busy if you are in a key location store (there were at least 10 car shops within a mile radius of my store). I learned customer service skills, people skill, and car parts. Management was not consistent, i a year span we had 3 different store managers and various employees came and left. There was not much camaraderie between employees (most of the staff were young adults and that was their first job). The hardest part of the job was stocking. We had to do all in one day (Sunday) while customers where coming in the store, that would slow us down since we had to take care of their needs before we resume stocking duties (we had about 1500 car parts to place in shelfs before the day was over)"
good,"Started part time in 1985,quickly promoted thru hard work and dedication. I was the youngest Store Manager at the time, and was sent to troubleshoot and fix different stores in the district. Promoted to District Manager in 2000 and held that position till 2004,when I stepped down due to personal issues. Transferred to Schenectady location to fix a store that was broken and lacked management and salesmanship. Made store profitable, and improved sales and customer service along with training all staff on company objectives"
good,"Really lacks on compensation , and commitment to employees. My store manager and psm's have always been good to me , but the district manager I felt has been biased in his decision making . I was told to meet a standard to get a promotion , a promotion I never received after being accredited of meeting that standard , by both store and district managers."
good,"You work a lot of hours and the management is not great.  It is very hot in the summer, and cold in the winter.  I seen a lot of people get fired for things out of their control."
good,"very stress full, waiting on management password is a hazel, to much arguing and employees go unnoticed for the great job they do every day."
good,"Only a small portion of the Staff and Management carry the store to a successful operation. Not everyone is enthusiastic. Store lacks in good organization  too much time is wasted on superfilous tasks for instance the repetative testing.  However the challenge of diagnosing automotive problems for the customer and giving them sound and honest advice is exciting, especially when they return content and thankful."
good,"Its a simple job for most of the company, but they can mistreat there employers daily, fun people to work with, thats basically all"
good,A typical work day was to count petty cash and tills for before opening. Print reports to set sales goals and expectations. I learned how to run a business by reading profit and loss reports to maximize revenue while reducing shrink. Upper management does not allow a person to be autonomous and practice creative skills to promote business. My co workers was a diverse group that work hard to drive sales while maintaining company standards of cleanliness. The hardest part of the job was consistently meeting sales goals with a minimum amount of associates allowable. The most enjoyable part of my job were the associates I hired and worked with.
good,"the location in California I worked @ was a lot friendlier than the Nevada location. but I was able to advance in my career more here in Nevada, but no job security"
good,Peers are willing to help. Management tries to work with your schedules. Inconsistencies with training and protocol.
good,"I open the store with the manager. Counting the registers, cleaning and dusting register counters, and promotional kits are among my duties. I deliver commercial orders to shops and collect payments. Parts counter sales and automobile advice are also included in my duties. Learning is a constant part of my job. I have learned basic maintenance of automobiles and diagnostic techniques to understand how to resolve problems. I have had three store managers in one year. They have been good leaders but I feel there is not enough stability in the leadership for me. My co-workers are wonderful. We all work as a team regardless of our position. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is keeping updated knowledge of automobiles. As auto companies manufacture newer and better vehicles, they need to be cared for differently. I enjoy the interaction with the customers and being able to impart on them the knowledge I have learned working there."
good,This company allowed for advancement. The scheduling system was great and allowed for flexibility if needed. The benefit package was also a good one. The customers were amazing.
good,"The job is not hard, just really boring, Of course I do work at one of the slower stores with no commercial. A typical day consists of waking the store and front facing to make sure everything looks good. The company offers some product knowledge tests but in my opinion I feel like they do not help because working on cars and becoming familiar with them is a whole different way of learning rather than reading about it in an eight slide PowerPoint and taking a test about it, My co-workers are nice and easy to get along with and depending on your store manager is how the work environment is.The hardest part is figuring out where everything is at, after a while if you keep asking your co-workers where a certain part is they get annoyed because they'll want you see take an initiative to walk the store to get familiar with it. What i enjoy is helping a customer out, I take pride in my work and on some occasions they even bring you back some lunch or buy you a drink. The thing I do not enjoy is that no matter who you work for they will always want you to sell more than what the customer needs, if not then the entire store staff gets a write up if they do not see the numbers go up."
good,"I enjoy My Job at Autozone. I work hard, But seeing any advancing in The Women in the Company. Needs more Recgoniziing of the staff members who work hard."
good,This place is a good work place for a college student due to the flexibility of the weekly schedule. Training consists of teaching every employee to go above and beyond for the customer.
good,love the eviorment  the lunch breaks too short! well management my co-worker help alot!
good,"I enjoyed the local environment of the store I worked in. The manager and other employees were the greatest. As far as autozone as a company, they leave a lot to be desired. It seems they consider all new employees to be a thief until proven otherwise. So much emphasis is placed on policies and methods of operation designed to prevent employee theft, and ways to get information that may lead to employee wrongdoing, that it makes the employees uncomfortable and a bit timid. Also, Autozone is ""proud"" (their word) of the fact that no employee is allowed to have steady, consistent working hours or days off. Each employees schedule must be different from week to week. Schedule comes out on Thursday for the next week, so you only know your work schedule and days off for one week in advance. Makes it very difficult to schedule personal events and appointments. Also, wages are insufficient to support even a single person let alone a family."
good,"A typical day would consist of assisting walk customers, stocking shelves with products, and answering phone calls. I learned how to supervise and delegate job duties to my crew. Also how to take the right approach with unhappy or unsatisfied customers . The hardest part about the job was unsatisfied customers. Each one has to be handled differently in order to make things right, and to make them happy with the overall outcome. My most enjoyable part of this job was also the hardest.  I enjoyed helping customers and making their shopping experience a good one."
good,"Exigen mucho mas de lo que dan."
good,"Provide customer service face to face or via telephone, deliver commercial parts to commercial shops. Overall it was just a job very with little to no advancements the co-workers and most mangers were good people the hardest part about the job was not getting deserved pay but the customers made the job enjoyable."
good,"The trend here seems to be that the people that hire you will promise you one thing, then not provide it. Like salary- I was told this job would meet my salary requirements. then I was told, well yes, if you over claim your tax with holdings so you owe at the end of the year, then work 8-10 hours of overtime, then it will meet your salary requirements. And then you're not allowed to get overtime. The job functions themselves seem to change and you just have to deal with the fact that you're not make as much as you were told you were and doing a completely different job. The company itself stands for many great things, and the ""AutoZone Culture"" is one of the unique qualities that seem to have given the company it's longevity. "
good,This company is pretty basic. Pay is the same as a regular position with any experience at a restaurant.
good,"I learned a lot about cars here its not a bad place to work, but the pay is just not that good."
good,the job was decent i don't have a problem with the company it was the management staff that henddered me from enjoying or even advancing in the work place.
good,very interactive with commercial store accounts learned to manage money and accounts from different auto mechanic shops management worked together co-workers were easy to work with. hardest part of working was end of day when morning shift management was gone and having to take on work load alone but most enjoyable was getting along with fellow employees.
good,"a day at work was helping every customer find parts for their cars. testing and diagnose problems the customer had. I learned a lot about automotive repair and maintenance. most co workers were great people, very friendly. Hardest part of the job was trying to understand what people wanted when they didn't know and getting overwhelmed by so many customers with not enough help. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping a customer in need and making their day great."
good,"Overall, I would say that Auto Zone as a whole is good company. But thats more or less it, unless someone is intending to make a career out of working for them, its just a job."
good,Was promised a Commercial Sales Manager Position Upon hire within 4 weeks after training along with higher wage within 4 weeks of start. Worked for over 3 months and never received any of these promises.
good,It was a dead end job although i got the chance to work with some great people.
good,A day at Autozone was basically providing the right automobile part for the customer and then checking them out. I learned a lot about cars. I didn't too much care for the manager although my co-workers were almost like family. The hardest part about this job was the learning process about different cars and their parts. I mostly liked interacting with the customers.
good,Helping customers with a required part for their vehicle and making sure the part was correct.
good,A typical day of work would consist of helping customers and making sure the product was all on shelves.
good,"Dealing daily with answering phone calls from customers, getting their parts and orders delivered."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of helping customers identify auto related issues and find a solution to the issue, perform daily routines such as open and close store, balance cash drawers, safe, and petty cash, and special order parts as needed."
good,good place to work customer service is very important I have good job security but I don't like working nights
good,"Although I currently have a laid back schedule, I am extremely over-worked.  I have several systems that I am solely responsible for and I have a difficult time finding time to take vacation days.  What I do love about my current position is the different technologies that I am learning.  This opportunity has allowed knowledge progression.  Management is not concerned about the issues that I present daily and this is my main concern.  Career advancement is my priority and this is not an available option."
good,Workplace was often disorganized and poorly staffed although most co workers weren't bad to work with. Received poor training and expected to work in an enviorment  that wasn't productive.
good,"I worked there for almost a whole year and in my time there, I set up 2 stores for a commercial program and did the inventory and cycle counts for 6 different stores in the district along with going to numerous stores for weeks on end to work. I was never advanced or praised for doing all of this and my pay never raised. All in all, if you need money but don't want to like what you do, go there."
good,"Typical day at work was opening getting the day ready for operations, daily managerial work duties, setting work tone and goals for the day, but my biggest thing was working with the customers.."
good,"As store manager I am the only salaried employee at the store level. I am contracted to work 50 hours a week, but it usually ends up being 60+. It is an extremely demanding position due to the hours and all the tasks and responsibilities. I must manage inventory, personnel, schedules, resolve customer issues and deal with product recalls and resets - all while covering the counter. "
good,"Typical day you provide excellent customer service by knowing the inventory and being able to ask probing questions to help diagnose issues and make recommendations on necessary parts for car repair. Gives opportunity to learn different automotive issues and practice critical thinking skills. "
good,Every employee has a lot of jobs to complete on a daily bias. Can be a bad place to work if you have bad upper management within a region.
good,"The company benefits were great, and the people I worked with were personable and friendly. The only issue I had was that I was not given the resources needed to accomplish goals that were set. When the goals were laid out I as asked what I would need to make it happen. When I gave them  the minimum requirements to meet the goals they were not provided."
good,"the overall job was ok. it was gret to teach and help people."
good,"Not many great things to say about this place.  The was the usual front facing of shelf merchandise, cleaning counter tops."
good,if you are looking for something to just get by but dont fall for the promotion things they try to tell you
good,"it was fun and the co-workers were fun loving ,,family environment"
good,standing 99%
good,I was in charge of running and operating an auto parts retail store. was in charge
good,"Good if you need flexible hours to work with your school schedule. Anyone can me manager if you stay long enough, easy job once you get used to knowing the names of car parts."
good,An average day could consist of anything. Today i started by rebuilding a mangled security gate and ended by running a tennant floor scrubber through the DC. Not knowing what will happen through the day makes it more interesting to me. I am over the people on my shift so if one misses i have to do there job as well as my own. Work four 10 hour days and off three. The maintenance manager works my first day i am on my own the last three. I have a great crew. The hardest part of my job is knowing something needs to be fixed reporting it and being told to rig it due to low funds. I take pride in what ever i do so that really bothers me. the most enjoyable part of my job is all the cool people i work with.
good,Deliver parts to local shops. Handles invoices and returns.
good,"customer service, learned management,HR,staff is awesome"
good,"Good company to work for, just poor wages. no life balance"
good,I loved this job for the work with cars and people . I feel that if i knew more spanish then i would till be there.
good,"I really enjoy working at Auto Zone, unforntunately they have their picks and chooses."
good,"The store managers are generally fair and easy to work with, however it is increasingly difficult to communicate properly with the higher positions should there be a need. Communication is full of misunderstandings and is inconsistant at best."
good,"The average workday consisted of assisting customers with product knowledge and establishing rapport, inventory placement, as well as custodial practices."
good,Store managers have to work a minimum of 50 hours. But you work more like 60. Plus they keep track of days you leave early but don't keep track of days worked over scheduled time. Also as a salary manager your not paid for lunch break.
good,"typical day was restoking until a customer or phones rang."
good,Management is stuck to their old ways and is not open to new ideas. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their problems and giving suggestions.
good,These company’ goof for diversity and opportunity but.     They don’t have a good values as a company anfurtunaly   It has revolving door policy. Management is Allways moved so hard to.  Is not a family atmosphere. Employees are assets not person that what socks  abouth these company if was not for that it will make a great places to work but is not is ok temporary
good,the company priorities the customer over anything. at times don't have the employees best interest in mind when making some decisions. expect a lot from there and employees but don't reward them for it
good,Auto Zone is A great to work for but as far expanding in a career Auto Zone is where you dont want be. to be passed up for better opportunitys multiple time ist just not a company for me
good,Management is basically clueless and upper management only care about their bonuses but are otherwise useless to individuals. Benefits were good but sometimes you have no idea about your schedule even the day before sometimes. It's a job in a pinch but not something you wanna do in the long run.
good,"Managers are often not well-selected and the change cannot be made from an employee perspective, so we are often stuck with awful store managers that don't know how to properly make a schedule or make use of their hours. Everyone except the store manager has been great though, and they all work hard and try their best to make it feel very much like a family. The pay was not great, though."
good,"Load car deliver parts, return parts, paperwork, I learned about parts and customer satisfaction,hardest part was lifting batteries, most enjoyable part was the team I worked with."
good,"store manager was a stand up person but the district manager would lie, hire people behind the store managers back, and say you are getting a promotion but hire someone else instead"
good,I Will Start Off By Saying I Do Not Make Enough Money For The Tasks I Have To Do. Some Of The People are Really Amazing However Some Of Them are Not    If I Made More Money I Could See Myself Possibly Staying..
good,They expect a lot with little recognition or compensation. Always understaffed and over worked. Lacks adequate upper management support at store level.
good,This place has alot of stuff to learn and keep learning helps alot if you know cars you don't do just one job fast paced takes long time to learn job get to help people
good,"Rude Manager, doesn't know how to speak to customers or employees, cuts hours too much, best part of the job can be your co-workers, fast paced but sometimes very slow days."
good,"You get thrown around to different"
good,Too many part time employees. If someone is really wanting to learn about the company and move up then they're going to need to have full time positions for other employees besides management.
good,"unorganized store, most people just play on their phones while the ones who actually worked got no recognition, not a fair work environment. good people is what kept me there and the customer relationships"
good,Its a hit or miss with autozone..it all depends on who you talk to...what managers you work with as well..if you actually get promoted..you will be kinda under paid for all the hours you have to put it.  And if you say no..good luck getting what you need..
good,"I worked at AutoZone for a while, and I have mixed feelings about the overall experience."
good,"Company has seemed to lose it's site of the importance of its survival..good help is not cheap, and cheap help is no good...lost a lot of great managers for the arrogance of a non appreciative upper management group..."
good,"Not the worst but not he best job I’ve had . It’s fast paced i work at busy hub so that explains why it’s stressful the job itself isn’t difficult , sometimes it’s managers depending on who it is , at this hub store it’s short staffed and busy so you could easily see why it’s stressful there is a high turn over rate because of the pay 💰 it’s a good company with decent benefits , the perks of working here is the employee discount , and getting paid every two weeks , you will meet some decent people here and a few people that are bitter but overall as long as you come to work and put in your 40 hours it’s not too bad . Also if you work here mostly likely will be required to work weekends ."
good,Its an alright job. They just need to give more pay to their employees And they need to start your vacation and your sick time soon as you get to working for Autozone.
good,There are alot of good qualities in working here provided management os good....seems to vary by location...as if they will make anybody the manager. Takes focus and determination to succeed here.
good,Good company to work for and learn new things and places in the motor and auto parts industry you grow your self within it and knowing more about cars and how they function
good,"I liked the work environment, customers were usually pretty decent. The hours were decent but i don't feel the pay was worth it. The computer system is easy to use and very helpful when it comes to finding parts for a customer."
good,"Not a bad place for a part time job. I was fortunate to have a great manager. Very easy to work for and flexible. Pay and bennys for part time is not very good. No benefits beyond a discount. Nothing. Low pay no paid time off, no health ins"
good,I worked there as a teen and it was a great job to have at an early age but the pay is extremely low and there are no benefits from working with their company
good,Low paid not enough hours you don't find out your schedule until the end of the week and other than that it was a good job to work at I've met some nice people my only problem is the pay
good,This is the cool part time job just something to do for some extra money.  It was nothing to  strenuous.  You greet the customers and help them find the parts they need for their cars.  I would definitely recommend this job for someone that needs extra cash.
good,Some managers are very rude to customers and employees with disabilities. While most customers were amazing there were a few rude ones. Employees also need more training on computer systems and are not given the time to complete online training in timely manner so managers would do it for the employees.
good,"AutoZone claims to ""Always put customers first"", but it can be really hard to take care of customers when the employees aren't being taken care of. When stores are short staffed, workers are unhappy and tend to jump ship. Pay is decent especially once you start moving up, and if you get put in a fully staffed store, things can be great, but if a store has staffing issues, they receive no help from upper management."
good,"I had some fun while working, but they seem to play a lot of politics when it comes to upper management. To become a store manager, you have to already be one and get directly hired to it. They offer great benefits, no issues there. If you want to change areas within, there is very little chance there."
good,Not a bad place to work if you don't mind pushing yourself. Managers sometimes do play favorites among employees. Lack of fixed schedules makes having a home life terrible.
good,"This job was a good work environment but the pay was minimum wage and part time.  There is really not room for advancement, and full time is only for the manager and assistant manager.  I had extensive mechanical knowledge that helped me on the job dealing with customers, but it isn't a requirement.  It's pretty much your standard retail part time job.  I used it as a job until I found full time work so that I had some sort of income."
good,"I am a female. And Auto Zone doesn't like females. I was treated as less than a male. Men were hired on at more than I was making after 3 years. Also, the customers hated me. I would answer the phone and after hearing I was a female, they would ask to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. Also, I was sexually assaulted by a customer, several times. They finally, after reporting it several times, banned the customer from the store."
good,"N/a"
good,provided no to little work personal life balance. consistently worked 60 to 70 hours per week. manadatory minimum of 50 hours per weeks required. bonuses goals was obtained but little bonus pay
good,It is a place to waste a few years of your life.  No opportunity for advancement unless you can live on your knees.  Some managers are much better than others.
good,"counting the safe, managing inventory, counting and reconciling registers. hardest part of the job was dealing with customers. most enjoyable part of the job were my coworker"
good,Good job for high school or college students. The work that is required is not worth the pay and they should really take care of that. The hub drivers have faulty vehicles that stay in the repair shop and with those drivers being on the road all should have cruise control which some don’t and it’s a shame
good,This job is great if you get in a good store. Upper management pushes packets that no one ever buys and then come down on you when they don't sell. If you're not friends with some of the management team then good luck advancing your career. The hours are inconsistent but overall it's pretty laid back.
good,Good position for a single person who likes lots of hours and flexible. Too much pressure placed on store managers to make sales with minimal staffing.  A very high stress position.
good,"The store I worked at was a little bit of a train wreck. Management didn’t know what to do and would consistently mess with your schedule. If you couldn’t work a day they would still schedule you then get mad at you for their mistake. Very unresponsive to questions and concerns. Lots of people quit and they promoted and or hired any idiot who walked in to be management over people who actually had some knowledge and knew the store forwards and backwards. Empty promises. Just bad management in general. Overall though, the job itself isn’t bad, but they need to work on better pay and better management to make it worth your while."
good,"Most of the day all the managers were just doing the general manager's job and he would stand all day and watch YouTube Videos. Despite the general laziness it was a decent experience, everyone on the team was welcoming and helpful."
good,It was fine at first but then as weeks went on things just got complicated and unprofessional. They didn't manage a fair schedule and a happy work environment.
good,It's ok but they dont pay very good.  It's very fast pace and sometime pretty stressful place to work.  I enjoy the people I work with at my store.  I work at a hub location which is very different from a regular autozone location.
good,Empresa internacional excelentemente establecida con bases solidas principios y valores.
good,"Was assistant manager, customer service, cashier, stock. managed 1 to 4 employees at a time. helped customers find the right part to fix their vehicle and maintain it."
good,When I worked there the crew I worked with was great we would get out job done but have fun at the same time. Always helping each other in areas we didn't have enough knowledge in.
good,"Depending on your job position it can be either easy and comfortable.  "
good,"when things are running smoothly the job can be good.  However the staff tend to come and go rapidly, resulting in under staffed shifts.  Management also change often resulting in an ever-changing work environment, sometimes pleasant and productive, but not always."
good,I was placed there through Resource Mfg. I liked the job but only a few people were hired on at the end of the season. I think that they should have given everyone the same chance to be hired on. I think that would have been a job for a career.
good,I think some departments are a great place to work and offer a healthy work environment. On the other hand there are several departments that have horrible managers and directors and the company continues to lose good people.
good,"Managment was good some slow paced and fast paced moments. Co-workers were funny and cool, hardest job was dealing with bad attitude customers that don't know anything about cars. Most enjoyable was the jokes us co-workers told each other, and the slow paced enviorment."
good,"Low pay, but makes up with raises every eight months. Raise depends on performance and size of the store. A lot of politics are played in this company."
good,"daily sales goals hard to attain most days,could not get customers to buy extra items, too many hours worked for salary pay/"
good,I think it’s pretty relaxed at automate. I don’t get much hours which is cool. But I’m sure if you were full time it would be a lot better. There’s not much business off of 132 and q. I’d advise knowledge if you wanna work there.
good,Worked there for a long while and started to realize that I was going no where. Seeing how I like outside jobs Autozone’s lifestyle was just not for me
good,Overall the employees are okay but you can not be financially stable even with a full time job at this company. The work is overwhelming for the pay because you would need a second job to get by.
good,"On a normal day at auto zone I would come in and usually put up truck. While I was putting up truck i would stop whenever a customer needed assistance. From this job I learned that you have to be understanding to be in the customer service area. The hardest part of the job was working and keeping a smile on my face knowing that management thought they could mistreat me whenever they wanted. Nevertheless, I most enjoyed sending customers out the door with a smile on their face."
good,the hardest part was doing all the jobs with not enough staff. District manager was a micro manager and had his pets from other stores that he put on a pedistool.
good,A company based on favoritism. The ones that know the most and do the most typically don't move up. The ones that are the best at talking a good game move up.
good,Go to work early in the morning and load up your van with parts for other stores. Drive for 9 to 10 hours a day dropping off parts at outlying stores and pick up returns for hub store.
good,"The pay isn't that much and the hours can seem long. I learned a lot about cars and parts. You deal with a lot of impatient people and will have to help people outside, even in the winter."
good,For the type of work and service you provide its not worth the pay. I'm not comfortable with doing heavy lifting and could be getting paid more at McDonalds
good,This was a second job for me while I was working a full time job during the day.  The job is interesting because you do get good training on the latest advances in the Automotive industry.  The down side of this work was many of the employees that are hired have no automotive experience and I had to constantly help them which is ok for a start but some of them never learn and rely on you to bail them out all the time.  The management changes constantly and you get tired of new rules and procedures every time a new manager comes in.
good,it was good but not great. i had good people around me working for me but nothing amazing. no advancement opp was why i left in search of a better work/life balance.
good,the job has good job security but under staffed especially in slower stores and tends to hire managers from different automotive companies so getting promoted can be difficult at times.
good,"LONG shifts (10-15 hour days). Administrative Tasks are daunting at times. Difficult to attract Quality Workers due to low pay and low hours, so Mangement picks up LOTS of slack. Turnover among Associates is High and causes frustration."
good,"Autozone does not care for its employees, it ask for too much, without out correct compensation for what they’ve asked you to do, after working there for over a year, and not receiving a single raise, after being praised by customers, they definitely do not act accordingly to employees"
good,Very fast paced depending on day and location. Pay starts at minimum wage and usually start part time hours. Very flexible. Easy job to do if you good with people.
good,District management and above don't care for employees. They just care about numbers. They don't care if employees are over worked in the store is under staffed . Always lawsuits going on with in.
good,Great company to work for. However more training is required to aid employees with the skills needed to succeed. Conflict frequently due to poor communication and management. Good starting point for those interested in automotive parts sale
good,I had a lot of fun working at AutoZone. It gave me a learning experience about automotive vehicles. But the management was poor. All the staff members were lazy at times.
good,"Most of the training is helpful in understanding automotive. Upper management does not care much about the employees. The wages are low for all employees that work in the stores and they give very little raises, they are less then the minimum wage hike every year."
good,"I had at least 4 different store managers at one location, with one or two interim managers. The last store manager I worked with was great, though. As a delivery driver, I had one manager I reported to directly who was amazing at his job. The environment could be pretty fast-paced at times, and it often felt like there was not enough employees working at one time. Delivery driving is the best because you can get out of the store and build working relationships with the auto shops in the area."
good,"This is a retail job, which means no set schedule. Employees are expected to be available days, nights, weekends and holidays. The work can be fun and enjoyable, but also stressful."
good,Your experience will depend ALOT on the store manager. Don't expect many weekends off or Saturdays or Sundays.... Pay was nothing special. Raises are small.
good,Truthfully your not so much over worked as you are just underpaid. they want you to push sells and try to add on to what someone is there to buy... yet only the store manager gets rewarded for the sales which they normally dont even sale. They hire people off the street that can't even change a tire and dont know jack about cars and then you get to deal with un-knowledgeable coworkers which makes working with them a nightmare. They bring in managers who get on a power trip and act like they are running a military drill bossing people around mean while they dont know anything about cars they are just worried about numbers and selling stuff...( Not all managers are like this where i work... but most are)
good,"This place is for teenagers, have a lack of organization. Rules are broken every day, poor management compromise. Lack of real training, Not enough time to do training."
good,The position I had as a commercial driver was very busy in which I loved. By the time I came from one delivery I was right back out of the door with another delivery. I enjoyed conversing with the people I would come in contact with while delivering
good,"Autozone as a whole is not an overall bad company to work for. The company structure is good, however each store is run differently depending on the management team of the store and the region. It's frustrating as a manager to try to stand on company policy when your superiors refuse to back you up and instead pander to customer demands which are not acceptable by the written policy. "
good,At times they would cut the hours a lot with out any notice another thing is that with overtime they didnt ask if you could stay they would just expect you to stay if needed.
good,"Helping 200 to 300 customers a day. I've learned that a good manager can lead a team through the worst store but, a bad manager can make the crew jump ship. The hardest part was being told to micro manage a team that was working fine. Helping the customer's was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I learned how to communicate with others 
good,Had to just move boxes on pallets. Had to make sure they were placed on the right pallet or you could send it to the wrong company and our company would get in trouble for it.
good,"Some of the stores are okay to work for, if you  work with good people. But in my case I had a bad group of managers that treated the place like a high school class. And the pay rate was horrible."
good,I enjoyed the customer relations and doing the inventory work.  I also liked working with the commercial accounts.  The computer systems at the time I was there were slightly outdated and made parts look up slightly difficult at times
good,A typical day for me at Auto Zone would be me clocking in and picking up from where the previous manager left off at. I would have to check the sales from the previous days and afterwards I would do back stock and help customers with their cars or any question they had.
good,"Being a store manager is the most stressful job in the company. You put in the most work and receive the least recognition. Your district managers don't care about you, only your numbers. Your employees are your only lifeline. Compensation is moderate, health insurance is outrageous and paid time off is minimal. Great culture and great intentions followed by poor executions and broken promises."
good,"-Leading and Managing new and current CSRs."
good,"Typical work days here were I answered phones, and greeted walk in customers, assisted customers with needed items with my knowledge of the computer systems and outside knowledge of vehicle parts. Some of my main tasks here included searching through customer warranty files to assist in swapping out damaged parts or adding in new parts under warranty. I placed orders for parts, set parts on hold, or give out price estimates over the phone. I also installed batteries, air filters, and bulbs. "
good,Los gerentes no siempre son los mas aptos o capaces para liderar al personal.
good,The management was excellent the job it’s self was good just not as much sales oriented as I thought it would be 100% but overall very good company to work for
good,"Wiper Blades, bulbs, air filters and ect are the Customer's right to have installed.  Fast Pace and lack of crew support.  too few employees with too many customers."
good,"Main focus is achieving sales. Customer always right mentality. Retail hours, therefore minimum weekend request. Many changes with upper management, not always approachable."
good,"Worked there for over a year and they fired me because I helped an employee out, resulting in a loss of $42.00 and I gave too many discounts, when the discounts were what helped us make as much as we made while I was there. We also didn't have a commercial program so there technically were no discounted prices, so I gave mechanics and hot rod guys ""commercial pricing."" Apparently AutoZone doesn't care about keeping those customers."
good,Working at Autozone could be fun if some of the managers were removed from the equation... Hours were flexible as long as it was set before the schedule was printed. work was pretty easy. atmosphere was chill for the most part. helping customers was cool too.
good,Great place to work but pay is not up to par. Was promised raises and advancements which I never saw.  It was extremely hard to get over 40 hours a week.
good,"a very physical job with false advancement pretenses. Management issues, things bein ""swept under the rug"""
good,I enjoyed my years there with the exception of some poor store manager choices. Advancement was based on knowledge. I believe pay was very reasonable.Through the years I was offered help with education. They will work with students to accommodate their class schedule. The only thing I would change would be more trading for counter personnel.
good,"it was a fast paced job, that had to be done no matter what the weather was like outside. they have a big turn over on employees. and the pay could be a lot better considering its a billion dollar company."
good,I enjoyed the position and role I played in the store. Management loved every aspect I brought to the table. The store manager themselves make the job difficult for myself and customers as well.
good,Typical day at work would include stocking inventory and helping customers. Hardest part is when there is only 2 people working at night it really sucked. Also we would get robbed a lot and had a gun pointed at me twice.
good,My main responsibility at Autozone was to deliever parts to the customers. My main goal was to make sure each customer recieved their goods on time and was satisfied .
good,Not a bad job to have. Meet a lot of new people and learn a lot about car parts and how they work. Hours are decent for students not so much a full time career
good,"Typical place to work, the employees can be rude and extremely self centered . Best part is being around car parts and car enthusiasts .Worst part is the favoritism."
good,"The shifts I got didn't allow me much time with my family, I felt like I was always working. Worked with great people, and made a decent wage, not what I thought was adequate for the job I was doing."
good,Ok place to start off at if you are looking to work while you go to school or if you are looking for a second job. There is a lot of different locations that are willing to work with your schedule
good,"If you like retail this is a good job, if you don't its not. Lots of facing product and inventory control. Checking out customers, answering the phones and doing computer training."
good,The customers were friendly and i learned alot with their systems and test but management was hostile to the point of feeling unsafe in the work environment.
good,"As store manager tasked with scheduling team members, and planing out the weekly tasks, managing inventory and stocking levels. An maintaining great customer service."
good,I learned a ton here. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help others. I love this place other than the management. We are so short staffed that they have us working ridiculous hours. I also started here when I was 19 but wasn't able to start a 401k with them because I was under 21 which I found to be odd.
good,Working at Autozone was a good experience but nothing significant. Mamagement works closely with associates and I learned a lot from upper management but it didnt help with advancement.
good,"Not enough employee or managers."
good,there is always something to do because you are constantly under staffed all the time.  if you like working with cars but don't want to get dirty this is a good job for you
good,Long hours and many many customers. Not enough hours to fully service all customer needs. Very little positive reinforcement. Upper Management very disconnected from stores.
good,"Management differs from store to store with what seems like a lack of conformity. The working environment is great but sometimes the mentality of ""the customer is always right"" can get the store into trouble."
good,"counter productive. Management would choose favorites and give better hours to those members, well the good workers work barely work. Upper management would not care what you had to do that day and just pile more and more on your plate to basically set you up for failure."
good,It's a great place to work it's just really hard to advance.  A great place to learn about cars and customer service. Hours are hard to come by for new comers.
good,"The establishment was a good place overall but however management was not willing to guarantee hours.  In addition, people often called in and required last minute call ins to work."
good,"If a manger has been in charge without question for many years and the higher ups decide to keep them unchecked, Then it is terrible to work there. There is no help from almost anyone if the store manager becomes the problem."
good,This is just a temp job in my opinion until you get something better. The pay is very low and the hours are usually all over the place such as closing one day and opening the next.
good,"I have worked at many stores in the district and each one is different some are ran well and fun others are a mess and challenging, over all Auto zone is not a bad company for some one starting our pay is not the best but just enough to make a living."
good,"Typical day could be really slow and some people get sent home, or it could be really busy and customers get angry for waiting. Management is more concerned about the number of hours people have than having enough staff present to cover the shift. You have to stand all day and if you don't work 6 hours, you don't get a lunch break, therefore no break at all."
good,"Autozoner employees with the international car parts retailer mainly work in a corporate capacity. Autozoner main job duties include customer service communications. Store support workers feature major departments like finance, human resources, marketing, store development, supply chain, and distribution. Autozoner positions also stay in touch with store employees, addressing all kinds of worker concerns. Most importantly, Autozoner associates help promote and spread the AutoZone brand name. Employment requirements for Autozoner applicants include previous corporate or customer service work, as well as relevant educational experience. An interest in cars and automobiles may also help with hiring consideration."
good,"Is an okay company to work with if in need for benefits(healthcare) for full-time; as for part-time, not so much benefits."
good,"It was an okay place to work. the pay was not very good and the atmosphere was bland. helping patient and kind customers with problems was really nice, but there were a lot of rude and aggressive customers who would make horrible remarks."
good,"started the day 730 am everyday five days a week, i learned a lot about cars through customers, management needs a lot to work on, workplace in my branch was not great, long hours and no team work, hardest part for me was running my department and helping the other departments with customers. most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the great customers."
good,"In charge of commercial sales.  Ensuring customers orders arrive in a timely manner and building new sales. Routing delivery drivers, taking customer orders and filling. Visiting potential commercial customers and existing ones."
good,It's a good place to work if you don't mind getting paid poorly. They don't like to give raises even when you do great and win awards. Work here if you don't want a great future.
good,Autozone was very accommodating to my needs. I learned quite a bit more than I already knew about vehicles. The hardest part of the job was definitely the costumers.
good,I enjoy working with people and cars . I've learned a lot working for the company I just didn't enjoy working with some of the co workers because either they do not want to work or use their position in inappropriate ways.
good,"District pushing selling so much that you will get written up every five seconds. They tell you what to sell and if you do not do it, you are treated like an animal."
good,Working for AutoZone was a nightmare. Any company that really cares about what color socks you wear has their priorities confused. Customer service has to be above policies like dress codes.
good,"As a manager at AutoZone, I experienced it all. Starting out as a full-time manager and being promoted to Store Manager, I found that if you want a standard job that pays decent and gets you involved with all types of customers, then this is for you. Upward movement is extremely slow after a certain point and the expectations are high with low level of upper management assistance. Expect chaotic scheduling and minimum wage."
good,Pretty laid back place. Learned alot from the older co workers. it was alot going on at one time which caused for work to be a little bit of everywhere.
good,"Most of whom I had worked with consisted of good open people. "
good,"They have unrealistic expectations, for little compensation.  They want you to move up for little pay and you have to fight for the pay you want.  I was passed up three times for a promotion simply because they didn't want to give me a raise until they got desperate."
good,"I was lucky and started my career with the company under a great store manager at a part time sales associate position.  He taught me everything I needed to know about the business and before my third anniversary I was running my own store.  "
good,"Great job when it comes to improving and/or testing customer service skills as well as multi tasking. A busy day, constiting of about 300-400 customers, demands a fast paced working environment. The management can be a it overwhelming since there isn't much involvement with the district managers to the employees. Overall, AutoZone is a decent company. There seems to always be room to move up positions and continuously learn."
good,"Nothing to say really great for learning about car parts, service to the community that helps them find everything the need to fix there ride. It's a true learning experience"
good,"It's a really good employment opportunity when you're first starting out. Management at store level is rock solid but the higher up you go the more apathetic the management seems. Also, due to lack of advancement opportunities as well as lackluster medical/health benefits it becomes apparent after a while that the company doesn't have its store level employees at the center of its focus. I would still gladly get my automotive needs from this company though."
good,As a driver they seem to hold you more accountable than anyone else and home life is very limited.  May as well be otr driver.  Schedule is awful and drivers get taken advantage of.
good,The company doesn't really pay and the workers are not always on track not enough workers that are serious about working. Managers are not always on track a lot of slacking Co workers always need to be reminded to get on track
good,Even though the company offers pension funds ect. The company does not know how to first take care of their employees so that the employees can take care of the clients...
good,I would recommend this job to high school kids only due to low paying job and also they did not provide a lot of hours a week. The work was easy and staff was friendly. However the work shift was inconsistent.
good,"Interesting job, had work with heavy parts, often new locations with very little directions to get there.  Hours are varying week-to-week.  Car is nice and gas is on them.  Management was very anti-female and management prospects were few for females of age."
good,Low hours that change at management's discretion. Low pay and no benefits for part time. Chance to climb if you want to work there for life.
good,"Was great starting off, the more you moved up it seemed to get very political. I enjoyed the hours and the experience it allowed me to have."
good,"*  Fast paced at times."
good,Good place to work depending on your team. The company wants a member to become educated as much as possible on auto parts. Customer service is number one.
good,It will go one of two ways in my many year experience. You will either get your hours cut everyday or you will be expected to stay extra every day. This happened to me in multiple stores under multiple managers while working multiple positions. Payroll is the number one concern. The company is growing rapidly but cutting on store costs constantly. Many times we would have to cut hours everyday for weeks while getting farther behind on in store tasks due to not enough man power. Then we would get reprimanded for not finishing all tasks. I loved the job itself and worked with some amazing people. The company itself needs some restructuring.
good,I worked there a long time ago and i dont remember what a typical day was like. It has changed a lot since than. I dont have anything else to say about the company
good,A good Part Time Job. Hours are not the greatest.Be willing to have an open schedule. Physically demanding. No social life outside work.
good,Great job but not enough growth in company. Lots of broken promises and the only increase in pay is a 10 cent raise once a year.
good,"I have been working at Autozone for 2 years. I have many friends who worked with me from the start and some of them are friends I've known almost my whole life. Autozone doesn't care about you. The only way people advance is if the manager you work with is really cool and likes you. Even if the store managers and district managers say you're a good fit for promotions you won't get it. They overwork you and pay you nothing. They make you do extra work that car shops do for a cost and they don't pay you extra for it. When customers want to tip you, you can't take it and if you do take it then they fire you. Most store managers don't know what they're doing. They get promoted because they force people to buy things they don't want. They have a title as store manager but they don't know how to keep their team in sync. Autozone constantly hires and fires employees on a weekly basis and those who have seniority in the company hate the job but have to stay because they can't find another job."
good,"Es una buena empresa para laborar, un buen ambiente de trabajo, pero muy escasa promoción, todas las promociones caen en una persona y no hay examenes o evaluaciones para subir solo criterio de una persona la cual hace las promociones a su conveniencia y a su juicio, el salario es bajo a comparacion de otras empresas similares, los horarios son variables y casi siempre se labora mas de las horas normales y no las pagan, te deja un muy buen aprendisaje de piezas y refaccioneas automotrices ya que cuenta con cursos en linea y de mejora continua"
good,"They pull you in with a great 4 day schedule. The job seems awesome at first, but you quickly realized that the production system is bad, the 4 days a week turn into 5 or 6, and the management doesn't care about the employees. It's very political, management shifts around way too much, pay isn't really that great, and HR is NOT your friend. Turn away. Don't bother with this job, it's a dead end."
good,"Serving customers and making them happy, taking care of the customer and making sure they have the right product the first time."
good,Some managers were very disrespectful and did not know how to talk to associates. There was too much drama regarding employers personal life.
good,The customers are great and make the job worth it but the company as a whole makes it hard to stay there. You don't get much time with your family.
good,Its a ok place to work at if you are in school or have another job if you are not a manager but other wise its only a parttime job.
good,"Typical day at work I would come in an I would stand at the parts counter and great everyone that comes in to the store. I would then ask if they needed help finding something and give them help and advice on their purchases. If customers need help installing light bulbs, batteries or wiper blades I would also help with that."
good,Running parts to Auto Shops to in a timely and safe manner Great people great place to work at just needs better pay You learn about what parts are needed to fix and do the job right
good,"When I worked at AutoZone I had a working knowledge about the basics. The computer training fleshes that out for you and I learned a good deal about mechanics because of this job. Some customers were also pretty nice and would explain how parts worked if you seemed genuinely interested. If you were nice and treated people with respect, most customers at my location were perfectly fine and polite to deal with. Every customer service job will have it's bad days, but here it was something of a rarity. Truck days were hard, and you did have to multi-task often, such as stocking the shelves, only to stop and assist a customer, then answer the phone while helping said customer. The pit-falls of AutoZone are with management and the ability to get promoted, or a lack there-of. My store manager was a really nice guy, but we were understaffed and underfunded. Some items were rarely stocked, and the focus was more on how the store looked then how much money it brought in. I eventually got tired of being a wage slave, going out and changing people's batteries and whatnot. It's a good entry-level job for a college student or some kid who wants to know how to fix their own car for cheap. After you work the commercial section and hear local car shops call AutoZone and haggle prices on parts from our store just to sell them for more to other people (plus labor), it makes you want to just do it all yourself anyway."
good,working for autozone is alright someday are very slow but it is a reliable job with hours. Advancement in this company is low they usually hire outside of the company
good,Auto zone is not a good fit for a person that retains a high sense of family values . Schedules are not made in a sensible manner and employees are not treated with any type of respect. Patience is definitely something that you must have or develop quickly in this environment
good,"A typical 7 hour shift during the week is busy and fast paced. There are many different responsibilities to take care of through out the day and vary with each customer. For example, one can customer can request a battery and starter check while willing to purchase wiper blades or another item. A part from customers employees are expected to take out trash, mop, clean rest areas, sell ""check out"" items, assign reward cards, and constantly pull and restock stock. Some objects and products are heavy to carry as well."
good,"it is a fast food job, nothing amazing, a starters job. Maybe a summer job for young people. Staff is always friendly. Management its ok nothing out of the ordinary"
good,"Just customer service, pulling orders from shelves, sometimes searching for parts that were not where they should be. Answering phone calls for parts and pulling orders."
good,"I enjoy working with vehicle parts and customer service is very important in this position. There is a very high turnover rate. When you walk into the building, you are up and at it the whole time you are there. But, that is a plus to me. The hardest part of the job is trying to find parts and match them to vehicles when there is no information on the vehicle."
good,"Good: Working with Customers"
good,"Autone zone DZ has taught me many things.  When incoming product was shipped in details were everything.  Quantity, product quality, origin and destination  had to be precise so paying attention to detail has been drilled into my brain.  Its a very independent job with a team focus.  Its a very physical job.  Standing the entire shift while lifting 40 -70 lbs boxes.  It builds endurance with its physical demands.  The only sidebar is that there is no advancement for workers in any capacity at all."
good,"Customer's always first, we knows our parts and products. we have the best price for the best merchandise. the company is a great company that I would love to retire from"
good,Its a decent place to work hours are low usually 12 to 18 a week and the raises are annual but only 1 to 3%. Promotion are far and few between because management tends to stick around for awhile.
good,"Typical chain type retail store. The commercial parts department is a better atmosphere to work in than the front cashiering job in my personal opinion. Neither are terrible. You pretty much know what to expect. If working a job to just get by or while in school is what you want, I have no complaints. "
good,"Autozone is a good workplace with a really great customer base  that I enjoyed very much interacting with the customers "
good,Productive and busy workplace which could be less hostile supportive management.  The store and district management constantly push the importance of sales numbers more than personal growth and development.  You do meet great customers and co-workers which makes the job more enjoyable.
good,"Worked part time for years while employed at Ikon. Nights and weekend days to build my retirement. Thought that I enjoyed it enough to go full time. Once full time, immediately promoted to Store Mgr.  Good working environment depending on your District Leader."
good,Challenges are that there is no money until you are assistant manager. You can't keep valuable people without pay and the result is low skill level as the first face that is viewed by the public. Stores are micro managed by district managers. Scheduling can be challenging for management constantly bouncing between cut hours and we have time if you want hours.
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers out, stocking items and handling the cash register. Not only did I gain customer service experience but I also learned about car parts. The hardest part about my job was the commute and the easiest is helping customers."
good,"A typical day at Autozone as a hub driver was very routine and quite redundant. I learned to be consistent and accurate at all times, and to make sure that customer satisfaction was my goal when coming to work and throught out the day."
good,"My typical day at work opening and closing as required and preforming daily tasks. Everyday you learn new skills on how to handle different situations pertaining to various aspects within the store and customers satisfaction. The management team with this store I would rather have better leadership because we are on our own as far as training and daily work tasks. They need to be more involved as managers and assistant managers. Co-workers"
good,"overall is a good experience to learn about car parts, but not a job for a long time.  Good people to work with."
good,"Typical Day was Get to work and check in with My manager Greg and inspect the truck make sure gas tank was full. I would have a number of Auto Parts deliveries to deliver to different locations. I delivered to Auto Mechanic Shops like Firestone , Goodyear and some Mom and Pop mechanics in the neighborhood."
good,Part time only work in a retail environment. They continually hire more part time workers to keep from giving hours to employees.  No job encouragement to employees both past and future..
good,"*Update inventory"
good,I think this was an OK starter job. I don't think I could ever do it as a career. My mom has made it one but that job wasn't for me due to men wanting to talk to you all the time...
good,really don't like it there after years of experience no extra income and really not much seniority smh. terrible place to begin an job not good to make an career ever!!
good,"Tasks must be reviewed and completed daily. Paperwork must be reviewed and filed away. Store must be cleaned and stocked daily.  Autozoners must be trained and knowledgeable on parts and customer service. Teamwork is everything at autozone. Hardest part is training someone, best part is seeing them succeed."
good,"Helping customers find parts and trouble shooting problems on cars. You learn a lot about problem codes and which brands put out the best parts. The management is at it is at any other job. You have those that do well in their spot and those who should have never been promoted. The co-workers are great. Once again, if you love cars then it is the right place for you. The hardest part is having to deal with irate customers and then managers with very little training. The most enjoyable part are the customers and the co-workers. They can make a bad day good."
good,auto zone provided me with the opportunity to work with customers that came in upset because their cars were broke and i was able to use my passion to help find the problem and aid in helping fix the problem and have the customer leave smiling
good,Nothing much to say.  Typical pay for retail.  Lots of customer contact.  They will test you on your car knowledge before you get the job but you don't have to know everything.  I would work for them again.
good,"An average day on the job started with cleaning the exterior of the establishment, to create a welcoming environment. Next I would go around the store to ensure everything was on display correctly. By this time customers would come in and out of the store, they would be greeted and serviced immediately, while accomplishing my organizational goals on my idle time. "
good,"Delivering auto parts to local shops, I learned alot about cars, how to look up a part, test parts, etc, The hours were enjoyable, weekends off. Having the males accept me as part of the team.Meeting new people who needed help fixing their cars"
good,"Typical retail experience. There is a sense of arrogance when it comes to automotive knowledge, but not all coworkers/ costumers are like that. Commercial accounts can be disrespectful to new employees and reluctant to do business with AutoZone if their preferred team member is not available."
good,Autozone for me was not organized at all. They only cared about them self. Had a couple family problems and my daughter had tests to take so i had to be there and they laid me off because of it. They lie to you constantly and never had anything planned the right way. Was told i was getting a management position and never got it. They expect alot from you when they don't help you out on it. trainning was horrible.
good,"best part of the job is getting to talk to people from all over the world and the pay, that is really the only good part of working here"
good,"great company for high schoolers, but definitely a company out to just make a buck, always pushing customers to buy stuff that they dont need"
good,"If you are willing to put your life on hold, there is opportunities to be had at Autozone. I started with very little knowledge of car parts, but I learned a lot. The job is easy; there is very little about this job that could be called hard. There is a lot to learn at this job, so employees are often times given incomplete training. Upper management constantly berates workers to increase sales, even when sales are up."
good,A busy work place. Always something someone need done to their car. A lot of people I work with do not  know much about cars and then end up coming to me for advice.
good,"A typical day for me would be that I clocked in and began helping the customers, weather it was helping them find a certain item or helping them check out or even looking up parts for their cars. I learned how to become an Assistant Manager. My co-workers for the most part were fairly easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was to get the employees to do their jobs like they were suppose to, without being told.The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got paid."
good,"I absolutely enjoy working at autozone, the staff and the customers all got along. "
good,"I advanced quickly from a part-time employee with no automotive experience to a part-time manager capable of providing STAR customer service. I was well on my way to becoming assistant store manager within a year of employment. Auto Zone has good incentives but the overall compensation for everything you do in a day of work isn't worth the incentives. I worked at one the highest volume stores in the midwest. As a manager I had to maintain paperwork as well as help customers and maintain inventory and the sales floor. I was a full time student and worked there part-time. I wrote the schedule so I tried to schedule myself so it wouldn't conflict with class and studying, but I never left work on time (usually hours after I was supposed to get off) and I was frequently called in on my off days. I did almost the same amount of work as my store manager who was mentoring me but was never given a raise to compensate the amount of responsibility I took on despite her attempts on my behalf. Eventually I was fired for attendance because I came in to work trying to finish up homework that I couldn't do on my own time because I was always leaving work so much later. I complained about the constant overage in hours especially since I wasn't being paid overtime and nothing was done to alleviate the situation. This is not a good place to work unless you plan to become a district manager or something in the corporate offices where you don't deal directly with customers often."
good,"I really enjoy helping people with cars, finding the problem and fixing is a nice feeling."
good,"began working here while in school, very flexible schedule, great place to gain automotive knowledge"
good,"Co-Workers are friendly and helpful at all times"
good,Typical day starts out under staffed.the store is very busy so it is hectic. Store manager is usually behind on his work so he rides the other managers to take up is slack.most of the cow workers i have are ok but the good one have all been run off by the poor management.The hardest part of the job is trying to abide by the Corporate rules while running a high volume store that is constantly being under staffed.my most enjoyable part is a handful of customers and clocking out.
good,The management team was great it was just not enough hours for the pay.
good,"abrir tienda/corte de alarma, arqueo a caja general, arqueo a cajones de cajas registradoras (3) habilitar cajas registradoras (3), designar personal a las cajas registradoras, designar el personal para limpieza de de puertas de entrada y estacionamiento, supervision de los pasillos de ventas, revizar correos de tiendas (cat), asiganr tareas durante el dia al demas personal, manejo de desecho (basura), manejo de personal para actualizar estanterias y planogramas, manejo de personal para check de mercancias en 0, cortes de cajas, cortes de sistema diario, manejo de reportes de ventas (diario), cierre de tienda"
good,"fun work place, very different place to work for than any of my other jobs."
good,cutomers were great.Help them find parts install batteries and work on the computer also answered phones daily.
good,The typical day was about sales and store maintenance. Moving up in the company was hard unless you were the one to cover for employees who were absent. Autozone also needs to fix their late policy and abide by it because many employees are often late.
good,Staff controls Store Managers hours and days off they micro management everything you do
good,"Ensuring equipment and parts are displayed and assigned properly"
good,I love my job because of my regular customers and the challenges the give me. I help people look up parts and products for their vehicles. My co-workers are some of my best friends. It is a fun place to work. The management is uncaring and they make you feel replaceable.
good,"not a bad workplace retail is not for me."
good,"A typical day at work includes early mornings and long hours. This company is driven by the need to keep making money. There is no consideration for its employees personal needs or family needs. It seems as if management was randomly selected as opposed to who earned the position they have been awarded. The hardest part of the job is sometimes coming to work knowing that you are not being paid for the hard work and stressful job that you are performing. The most enjoyable part is just the interaction with the numerous costumers that sometimes outweighs the little consideration for the employees well-being. During bad weather, no precautions given to ensure employee safety."
good,"Decent hours of work, "
good,"I worked at AutoZone for about 18 months. While working there I learned a great bit about cars. Autozne is a ok company to work for if you didn't attend college. The pay is not great even though they are the U.S leading parts distributor. Also they wont more for less. For Example, install batteries, wiper blades, and checking engine lights in the rain.  If you don't like to get dirty then don't apply. All the customers expect you to know everything about cars. If your not a commercial manager or Store Manager you probably wont make over 40,000 a year. Ps your salary is based off 50 hours a week so if you are hired as a manager they expect you to work at least 50 hours weekly."
good,"Part-time sales manager, manages inventory and cash, adhering to company policy, practicing loss prevention procedures, providing customer service, strong automotive parts and systems knowledge, and leadership abilities."
good,"Auto Zone, another cooperate automotive parts giant based around the US. Some stores are badly run, my store was the exception."
good,very relaxed and easy going group to work for. always willing to work around my schedule.
good,"You will be busy helping customers, stocking, shelves, and cleaning. The work isn't difficult. There is room for advancement but be ready to follow strict company policies."
good,"Open store, count tills and safe. Process paper work. Answer phone.  Help in-store customers. Sale parts. Not a bad job to have. The hourly pay was great. I was blessed to start out with a high hourly pay. However, after 4 yrs of annual raises I still didn't have a dollar raise. The hours were great unless they where going through budget cuts. In almost every company the express that they offer room for advancement. Again, however, after working for 4 yrs and trying to advance at every corner I was still in the same position I had started in. The hardest part of any job will always be company politics; an underlying threat to the success of any company. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the people."
good,"A typical day would include counting all tills and petty cash, preparing counters and floors for business, interacting with and helping customers, and managing other employee tasks/shifts for store operation. "
good,"Sales and deliver of auto parts"
good,"As a manager the experience was great, having the responsibility of a store manager I've gained a lot of knowledge. At times during the start of my shift the store was unorganized, yet I never complained just completed all job task assigned to me."
good,Place is starting to be run by fear. Assistants get extremely low pay for the responsibility they have. Same for sales people.
good,"poor management"
good,Im a multi tasker and got a dollar raise for doing an in store promotion. The worst thing about it was swing shift.
good,"The type of characteristics for this position is dominant, workaholic, agreeable with Distribution Manager at all times. If you are a production employee there are so many positives. As long as you do your job, have great attendance there are so many added perks."
good,must have automotive knowledge. Front and face items when was low on stock housekeeping have knowledge of where everything is in the store.
good," At Auto Zone the customers are top priority, however, taking care of their employees is not a strong point. "
good,Good company culture but lacks advancement opportunity.  Typical day was 11 hours with a 1 hour lunch sometimes within 2 hours of the shift. The people are what really make the job enjoyable. Hardest part of the job was working commercial parts with very little training. 
good,"Typical retail sales position, Good amount of freedom. Most enjoyable part of the day are my co-workers, I tend to get along great with everyone."
good,"Very culture oriented, too fearful of becoming unionized."
good,"This company is high stress, high traffic, high turnover, low pay."
good,Has a lot of different position to offers with many locations.
good,I would start my day with talking to my supervisor to see what they ask of me. In the day.My main objective was taking care of the customers needs
good,"It was a nice place to work, I enjoyed the work, the customers, the over all experience , however I felt that the limited earning potential and advancement left a lot to be desired. You could not earn health benefits for the first year of employment."
good,"If opening manager I open the store, turn off the alarm, assign registers for the day, do my bank deposit and daily paperwork. Then i report to the counter to greet my customers."
good,A typical work day starts with a captain log which I make for my employees that consist of a daily to do list and goals.I've learned that without goals and task and follow up your job as manager is not complete.My co-workers make the job with any job you are only as good as your team and no one person can do it alone so it is critical to surround your self with good help.The hardest part of the job is to lose a part of your team and know that if you could have spent more time with them you might could have made a good employee of them.But the most enjoyable part of it is just the opposite to see someone that you coached be promoted to the next level
good,I learned alot about car parts and how they work. My co-workers were easy to get along with and fun. The hardest part of my job was remembering all the car parts and what they do and truing to help a customer figure out what was wrong with their vehicle.
good,Helping customers find auto parts desired.
good,"Typical auto parts retail environment. Staff is ok at best. Some are way lazy, whereas some are pretty smart. They are very advanced in their parts counter look up computer programs, but you need more than average intelligence to ""read between the lines"". Employees hand out the first part that comes up without checking footnotes...ie: a wheel bearing for a 4wd and 2wd truck IS different. For a person that knows nothing about car parts, their parts training may help a bit. Management at the store level changes between stores, but anyone District management and higher control how the store runs. DO IT OR ELSE is the way things are handed down. Sneaky techniques for add-on selling like grease packets. Hardest part of the job is they want to generate return customers, so everything is free. Free installations of headlights, bulbs, batteries, wipers, mirrors, hubcaps, check engine lights, etc...constantly leaves the stores with no employees in them. They're all outside, so the typical customer buying a gallon of coolant is left standing at the register calling out for assistance. They are number one cause they save people money by telling friends and family ""take it to AZ, they'll put it on free"". UGH. Most enjoyable for me was I made very good money by transfering stores multiple times and asking for a raise for doing so. If you wait for the average 20 cents a year raise, new employees will be hired for more than what you're being paid."
good,"I had a lot of great managers here who really cared about the welfare of their employees. The pay wasn't great and the hours were deplorable, but I had a great time working here."
good,"Job is a fun job if you like sales, learning and talking about cars. but recently hours have been hard to come by. i was promised at least 30-40hrs a week when i was hired, now im lucky if e barely make 10hrs a week."
good,"A typical day consists of morning deposits and paperwork, price changes, helping customers with finding what thwy need to do whatever they are working on, sales floor and hardpart planograms, stocking and taking inventory. My co-workers are a great group of people. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes it can be very demanding, physically and emotionaly. The most enjoyable part to me is the customers and how greatful they are when you help them figure out thier problem."
good,"Its a place where auto parts are sold to do-it-yourself customers. I had to manage day to day operations such as sales,payroll and customers ."
good,Pay is not good
good,schedule always varies never got the same days off or worked the same hours every week. For the most part management staff was good. co-workers we alright a bit last at times when there was down time in the store.hardest part of the job was unloading the truck during store hours and still giving the coustomers great service.The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of helping people.
good,"I was hired to work at Autozone as a ""parts service manager"". I had relocated from my previous job as an interim store manager for advance auto. I had alot of experience and interviewed with AZ store manager and was hired. I had to interview with the DM and was denied the manager position. I later found out it was because I had dreadlocks. I worked really hard in that store and was passed up many times for promotion to a manager position for the reason of my hair many times. I was there for a year and saw 3 store manager changes and 10-15 assistant and psm managers come and go. They had the look but did not have the skills. I have seen people with 15, 19 and 12 years quit due to stress from the DM as well. I dont think its a bad company, I just believe its a bad district. Being that I worked for AZ and AA. i would say that Advance pays way more. Advance is more employee oriented and Autozone is more customer oriented . There are some things that are in the ""rules"" of autozone that are stupid like hair cant touch collar of the shirt and you must wear dress shoes. Its hard to change windshield wipers in the snow wearing dress shoes! lol"
good,The day to day work was great and it was also a great learning experience. I am not happy with the way that upper management runs their program to reduce theft because the number one suspect is always the employees. The way they do it makes me feel like I was guilty of a crime even though I have never stolen anything in my whole life.
good,The hardest part of the job is that task/jobs can get repetitive. Management can be very supportive of workers looking to transition within the company into different roles/jobs.
good,"Fortunate 500 company that lacks structure.  Company's only focus is on customer service and little involvement into employee appreciation.  Hourly rates are not competitive, minimum wage for red-shirts(non-managers) and $1-2 over minimum for grey-shirts(Part Sales Managers).  You will be handling problematic customers, handling multiple customers with limited staff and also installing batteries, bulbs, and pouring fluids for customers.  Advancement is pitiful at this company, you have to put an extreme effort in to get promoted and there is not many opportunities because of the small staff of most stores.  This job is ideal for people that enjoy retail and are trying to get their first job.  If you're looking for a career, review a different company."
good,"Perhaps it was just my location. I found very quickly that as a red shirt I was expected to never miss work but also to be willing to pick up shifts, or else my reputation suffered. The work was fair, and the pay was poor. The managers were very human, often bringing emotions into work. It was clear that Sundays, when the general manager was off, that the second and third in line enjoyed their temporary power. However the team was nice to be around and often customers were pleasant."
good,"Very progressive corporation.  As such, profits rule.  I have personally witnessed the company stock go through the roof.  At the same time staffing was cut, creating a greater, less manageable work load for those that remain.  I watched as this created a much less effective customer service experience for walk in customers and unexceptable treatment of phone customers."
good,"It is basically the same as any other job. Dealing with costumers, Keeping the store clean and organize. You meet a lot of good people and mechanics. Which helps when your car breaks down at work."
good,"Easy job a delivery driver but pay sucks.. At my store the employees and managers were all very lazy... They were all very nice and understanding but i was the most ""optimistic"" person there when i was employed there."
good,"Dispite the talk, and the company cheer, profits are given priority over employees on front line, the ones in the trenches with the customer's demands and tantrums."
good,You are expected to provide perfect sales and customer service with no care to how much stress your management team is providing on a daily basis.  You are not supported and there is no accountability for them when they step over the line.  As a member of the management team I required more of myself and asked my team for an honest assessment of how I could be better.  I did not feel as though my upper management team was supportive or helpful.
good,"Pay is very low, otherwise it's a decent place to work. Management was pretty good, but unfortunately the pay rate and lack of any opportunity of overtime really is a bummer."
good,"Was a great working experience lots of great people to meet and plenty to learn!"
good,Would not reccomend unless you want to be store manager. The pay is not worth everything. Can barely keep anyone because of how low they're willing to pay
good,Got along with my coworkers but higher ups did not think we were pushing the products enough. so we began to feel like we were selling our customers more than they needed
good,"Good work environment, but not enough hours available. Good if you need a part job, but for full time hours fluctuate which makes it hard to maintain."
good,Unless you go into management and then you are expected to work 50+ hrs a week.  I was supposed to be a delivery driver but that only took up about 10% of my time. All the rest was working the counter in the  store.
good,AutoZone is a great job to work at. The management was just poor. The GM was so disrespectful to me and certain customers. But the work was not hard at all.
good,"I went into Auto Zone knowing nothing about vehicles, but came out more knowledgeable about the different parts of a vehicle. The only reason I left was because after being given higher responsibility, such as taking care of the store while the manager was out of the country, when asked for a higher rate of pay, especially since having a child, I was denied."
good,"Be a better place to work, if you could stay on one shift.i did not like working all different shifts, or working most of the holidays.If you are a manager, you have to work double shifts, if someone calls out.This happened quite often. Pay rate could be a lot better."
good,Help customers over the phone or in person.  Sometimes customers can be rude.  There are people that are more patient than others.  You just have to be very patient with rude customers while working here.  Starting pay is low.
good,Tienda de refacciones con personal con poco conocimiento automotriz y esto trunca los objetivos de venta.
good,"This is yet another job that is good if you need something to get you off of your feet or for a transition point. Autozone likes to boast that it has annual raises, but what you'll find in a year is that they don't have to give you a raise and most that I know if are around fifteen cents, maybe twenty if you really put the work in. Two dollar raises for a shift upwards in the chain of command. It is a job, but one that no one stays at unless they've committed themselves to climbing that corporate latter."
good,"Alot of running around doing tasks I was not aware of beforehand, such as answering phone calls helping customers who believe I am a mechanic. I know little to nothing about cars and barely know what we have around the store yet I'm expected to help people with information I do not have alot of the time the customers not knowing what problem they need help with in the first place. Applied for a driving job, struggling to understand car slang and help customers with no real training."
good,My work experience was ok we had some managers that didnt correctly do there jobs and workers that didnt want to do much but play on there phones but the store manager was amazing boss to have and the hardest part of the job is when I had to stop my job I was doing to help them
good,"While half the day was spent correcting mistakes by immature professionals, the other side could provide an environment to help customers and shops with any surprising automotive dilemma.  If the corporate pricing structure could relax from 40%-60% profit margins they could pick up many more local shops and be their sole parts supplier."
good,El ambiente laboral es bastante pesado y las promociones y crecimientos se dan más bien por amiguísimos o favoritismos más que por evaluaciones. Los sueldos son bajos pero buscan compensarlos con buenas prestaciones.
good,"High Volume on both DIY and Comm."
good,High turn over. District management over looks sketchy processes by top managers trying to hit goals. Diversity card played very hard making some conversations uncomfortable.
good,"I worked for my local AZ for a little over a year. The entire employment period I was officially only part-time, but for several months during he summer I was working full-time hours. And on top of that, AZ HATES paying overtime. I liked my coworkers, and learned quite a bit about newer automotive systems, but I hated dealing with the bad customers, and for the money I was making, it just wasn’t worth dealing with them anymore."
good,Managers need a good course on people skills. Customer were very polite had a good experience with the customer service position job was not that hard to do.
good,"I liked it for the first couple of years. My co-workers were really good people. I relocated to new store and it was awful. The same environment was gone , and it almost became counterproductive."
good,"They need to hire people that are more knowledgeable in automotive, not hire people just to fill positions. They need people that are willing to learn and work."
good,AutoZone is a great place to work the hours can be a little long at times but overall a decent job for someone who is looking to grow in an automotive industy
good,A good company to work for. They are flexible with your schedule. Upon getting hired it took a extremely long time for the process. They need to be quicker. Driver jobs are encouraged to not use gps witch i diagree with.
good,The company is definitely not a bad place to work. They are competitive and it's easy to move up. There isn't much of a work life balance. Sometimes you are required to work 6 to 7 days a week and as a salaried AutoZoner it's working for free.
good,"If your looking for a job that will hire you with no experience, this is it. Your hours and shifts will be all over the place. Most likely to work Friday thru Sunday. with no holidays off except Christmas."
good,"enviroment is satisfactory , management is horrible and very unstable, management provides no sense of direction or training, very unprofessional, hard to get raises and advancd"
good,"Decent place to work if you are serious about maintaining a job. Their training classes are educational,  when you can get to them. They dont schedule enough staffing to allow people to take advantage of the classes."
good,It a pretty good job.  But a little racist it also is a good paying job nice hours business always busy a lot of customers come in in out . Have good service
good,autozone was a fun and quickly paced place to work with that being said even my managers agreed they were not paid enough nor given much room for promotion or movement
good,Work life balance needs improvement and upper management as well otherwise a good place to work. Recognition to those employees with the qualifications is overlooked.
good,"New hires will do most of the dirty work if not all. Many times, managers will sit around while the red shirts are working their butts off. People closing have a lot of workload."
good,I like how autozone is I love how people work there how they do the safety how the work it’s done everything it’s good at Autozone but when it’s come to evertime working 6 days straight for couple week that no good Because people have family have to take care of them and it’s no good when they do that that’s why they losing a lot of people other then that I like how they treat u there it’s really good place to work
good,"I applied at Autozone mostly so I could get discounted car parts, and learn more about how my car operated. While I did learn a lot from both management and customers about how different systems within a car operate, the work environment was frustrating. Management had definite favorites among the staff which was based almost entirely on how well they got along. I remember one of the times we were unloading our most recent shipment, and out of 7 total employees myself and one of the only useful managers were the only ones putting anything away. Another guy would constantly either show up to work hours late, or never show up at all and yet it took them forever to fire him because he would go out for drinks with the managers after hours. This was at one specific location however, I can't say how it is at the other locations."
good,Good parts bad management overall.  Not concerned about the employees and pay.Good area bad management plan and stocks are dropping from competition. Bh
good,"it's an okay job. you get to learn a lot about cars, I also enjoy working with the customers. the only down side here are the hours, Sometimes you have to open the store at 7 and other times you have to close the store around 11."
good,Less pay for the job demand they want us to help the customer but won’t provide you with the tools to do so. Perform mechanic work at the pay rate you’re giving just to provide what they call customer service.
good,"a typical day at work would be to check in parts coming in,put truck load away and perform installations. The upper management at my location didn't do much about switching off weekends and had to close a lot of weekends."
good,"Moved up to management quick but that is where it ends"
good,"Fast paced with low pay. "
good,everyone is easily replaceable and autozone does little to improve employee satisfaction. work can be very slow and boring. mainly answering phones and putting away truck are your only tasks
good,Long hours and consistent overtime. 14 to 15 hour shifts very difficult.  Team is very friendly from the management on down but long hours for management and hourlies causes some friction.
good,really great co workers and teamwork. only thing i did not like was the management. I think if the part stores did better on appreciation to the employees they have. they would have such a high turn over
good,"A typical day at work is productive and busy, Each day I learn more about customer service and fiances. The management here is not good management. The culture is diverse. The hardest part of this job is dealing with unqualified supervisors and management. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with others and helping the customers and solving problems."
good,If you work there keep to yourself and don't tell no one your business. Get there on time and there is a grace period but don't abusive to where they take it.
good,"Constant pressure to exceed sales goal with zero help from management with staffing issues. Fast paced work, with short staffing causes everyone to be on edge. Used to be a good place to work."
good,Worked with a good team but they were not competitive in salary.When I had an accident on the company truck not my fault no one person from upper management asked if I was injured or not.After I returned to work they informed me I would not get paid because I didn't stay out 7 days I only stayed out 6.It was then I decided to look at Advance Auto.
good,It is an ok part time job but was not worth staying there long term. Upper management only cares about sales figures. Company does do a fairly good job at taking care of customers.
good,"I only worked about 3 months as the late nights didn't work with my school schedule but the job in general was alright . It seemed to me that the manager slightly used me to get off early as he would commonly ask me to come in 1 or 2 hours early to cover the last part of his shifts, although to his defense he was an older gentleman with health problems and I didn't mind the extra hours much. The stressing with add on sales was somewhat obnoxious but I understand the purpose of a business is profit although most of their add on items are way overpriced for what you get (specifically the little packets of anti-seize, bulb grease, etc.)"
good,Managing drivers pullin.parts answering phones the company is cool. I just need more money... the company is easy work just gotta follow guidelines and protocol
good,Working at Autozone you can learn a lot of things like new parts new people and new customers I would advise you to have some part knowledge when you go there
good,"its fun and fast paced but not much hours if you're a beginner and pay is minimum, also overworked and give lots of test but overall good for a part time job for students."
good,"Liked it here ok, the work is fast paced and i learned a bit.  the hours sucked, one week 330 hours, the next  15.  the pay really was not enough. But, the management eas good, lots of talented young people"
good,If you love cars but u don't mind drunk's and people who know nothing about cars being angry with you because they don't know what they want and smart mouth managers this is the place for you
good,Working here is very stressful and unless you are high management or part time you dont get to have a say in the hours you get scheduled for. Asking for strict hours when fulltime will get you moved to part time.
good,The company has a well thought out and implemented process for communication and adjusts well to the different personalities that it employs. There is a true open door policy and a effective team of personnel that work to ensure that all employees have a good work environment.
good,"great place to work at, flexible hours, but schedule changes every week. you will learn A LOT about vehicle parts and how they work. If you work for the commercial side you will find a lot of resources to find parts."
good,I was able to use my automotive knowledge and enhance them with new information that i have learned while working at Autozone. I enjoy working with the commercial accounts and local automotive shops.
good,"I've worked for better companies.  Even as a General Manager, my direct management was essentially absent from the scene.  Left to fight the pre-existing problems with ZERO assistance."
good,The job is a cut-pace job where you have to consistently be working non stop. We where always under staffed. If you are welling to learn about vehicles you will learn.
good,"Easy place to work at. Job demand was not hard. It helps to know a good bit about vehicles and parts, if not you will have a hard time with customer. WITTGTJDR? is a bit of a joke, but at rare times actually useful."
good,"Hire more people with car and or part knowledge"
good,"Worked at AutoZone for 2 years part time, enjoyed working there and the people I worked with. The hours were decent and the pay was competitive. Would recommend to anyone."
good,They have a lot of stuff to help train but are very robotic in their operations. Everyone is just a number trained to do what they're told. No personality.
good,"Every store manager runs things differently.  Most aren't even prepared or understand basic rules with regard to the difference between part time and full time.  The pay is not what it should be for all the work and effort that is put in.  I also think that the company should try harder to hire better employees.  We hire some people that you just wonder how did they pass the interview process."
good,very simple laid back work its a mix of customer service and or some warehouse work...staff may be short every once and awhile...little room to advance good work for students with no bill responsibillity
good,"The company policies made sense, however, the district manager did not properly stay on top of his job resulting in several issues. The biggest issue being a lack of training for his team while still expecting people to operate outside of their job description."
good,The company itself as a whole has no concern or care a lot about its employees concerns or safety. Nor do they have realistic value of any kind. management needs improvement.
good,The only problem about this job is the rate of pay and the cost of living in my area is very High. as a 21 year old man its not a good job too work at its mostly a teenagers job in college / high school looking for extra money type of thing . other than that the job is wonderfull
good,I've worked at some places that were worse . Auto zone isnt bad but they do not pay enough . There is good and bad at any job. I'm just seeing what is out there.
good,"This was a very physical, fast paced job that really took a toll on your back and shoulders.I never had any problems with the shift or the hours but you just did not make enough money for the amount of work required."
good,"Auto Zone was a job for me to get through school.  They initially worked with my school schedule to allow me to work the maximum amount.  It slowly changed to asking for me to work more hours during my school time.  Eventually they didn't care when I had classes with school and would schedule me to work during my class times.  There were many promises but few of those promises were kept."
good,it was alright. learned to handle big work flows. Manager was awesome. I was able to work with my schedule. I learned to be very independent due to being the only spanish speaker many shifts and handling large loads of spanish-only customers
good,"If you enjoy driving multiple short distances it is a nice driving job. Higher up managers ask for hard to reach quotas, but they do give nice incentives."
good,"This is depending on location and staff on hire. Just like any work place"
good,"Overall, autozone seems to want to stand by their culture but dont have the management or team to do so. Needs a better managment and staff team that actually knows what they are doing."
good,i make sure that all of my employees are working to ensure that customers leave my company satisfied and with everything that they need to get there job done right
good,"I learned more than I thought I would from every customer!"
good,"At first it was a dream come true. The first staff i was a part of was cut clean and efficient. After a few months of working with them I unfortunately had to transfer to a different store, with a staff that did not follow procedure. Depends on your staff, but management will never care about its workers, just sales."
good,"It was alright. It paid the bills and everyone was task oriented. Pay was a little lacking, but it is a part time job. Make sure you have good mechanical knowledge before working here. The customers we had to deal with came in with the most insane problems. That was the challenging part of the job. Also, some people would come in with stuff ripped off of another car that someone put on before and the new part wouldn't fit due to where the other person rigged it together. We find that out after the fact when they came back with the new part because it didn't fit and they brought the old one as reference. Now, we are either having to figure out a way to make the new part work or find whatever that part came off of. As a heads up, you can apparently put a older Mitsubishi fuel pump in some older Geo Trackers. Anyway, that isn't Autozone's fault or the customer's fault. I'm just saying a general thing that happened on the job."
good,I learned a lot about customer service and taking care of every person that walks in. Communication was a big help and improvement. The amount i got paid hourly sucked and it was not enough to have me work there.
good,"Waited on customers, unloaded trucks, put stock away, verified inventory, used RF scanner, done store setup, done store audits at different stores, ran cash register"
good,"Had a great experience here, if you work hard and focus on the task at hand there is opportunity for advancement.  I worked here for almost 3 years and made manager, I learned how to deal with a diverse staff and meet deadlines."
good,Depending how you like car or what you do there you might like it was bad and some part it was good friendly employees but not much of advance opportunities
good,"Some days are slow some are not. it kinda depends on the day. advancement is eh, if they want you they usually push you to get the job unless they find someone they like better , they then promote that person."
good,"Though this job served excellently as a means to get some experience under the belt, the room for advancement was pretty few and far between. Most importantly, though varied based on location, the management style of the company is not one to strive for. It's definitely a career where they point out your expendability."
good,Autozone is a great place to learn more about cars if you're into that and make a little extra money on the side. I've met people who've worked here for 11 years and still make less than 15 dollars and hour so not much career advancement here.
good,Loved the customers liked my job just needed to make a little more in my salary. The hours are very long and very few Holidays are recognized. I had to really adjust to how the scheduling worked it changed constantly. I also requested in my interview not to move a lot went to 5 different stores to clean them up.
good,Az is a fun place to work and at most stores fast paced. On the other hand they don’t want to pay the helper very much. That makes it very hard to keep people
good,Very fast paced world that is fun at times but daunting. Upper management is artificial and they have a hard time staying honest. Promotions above the Advisor level are hard to come by from within. You must be willing to relocate to advance in management; or so they say. Great hourly work force that could move mountains if the wanted.
good,"I moved to Tacoma Wa. based on my relationship employed with A"
good,"- Management had different views on how to run the store"
good,On most days it would be a pretty stressfull job to do as we had a specific time limit to deliver parts to customers and if we were not on time customers would complain. There was never much down time as when we were not dealing wiith orders I would be either helping out the front or stocking the inventory in the back. I did learn quite a lot about automobiles and how they work. The management at Autozone would vary from great to fairly bad. Some managers were helpful while others were lazy and made you wonder how they got to that position in the first place. I have to say the hardest part of the job was just dealing with the customers that did not understand that it is pretty hard to deliver parts at 4pm because of traffic or the customers that got upset because we delivered the wrong part even though it is the one they specificaly ordered. I can say thought that the most enjoyable part is the drving aspect as you can just listen to the radio while driving around. All in all not a terrible job.
good,Just come in and work and be friendly to customers and other team members and you plan on moving up in the company. show up on time in proper uniform.
good,The job was ok. I delivered parts to local businesses. Management was ok. It was chaotic at times. Management was pretty easy to get along with. I enjoyed being out of the store and talking with the businesses.
good,constant management changes. Core message is lost in translation from top to stores.Employees sre not given the time to learn and are thrown in the mix .
good,"My experience working at Autozone I noticed a high rate to turnover of employees and management not only at the store where I worked at but also at other stores in the district.  "
good,"AutoZone has a great business model and has been a very successful company. Bonuses and raises for upper manager is grossly disproportionate to the pay of the average worker. A pretty much relaxed atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is receiving the proper training for new employees. I learned several competencies in excel, word and presenting category reviews in a group setting."
good,"Siempre hay mucho trabajo, y la paga es poca. Falta mas capacitación."
good,"a typical day consisted of helping people with their problems and dealing with overstock and trying to keep the store clean"
good,the Job can Keep you Busy and makes the time go by fast
good,"Stressful, poorly-managed work environment. Good compensation/benefits. Long lunches. Taught basic automotive maintenance. Bad neighborhood. Nasty customers. Understaffed."
good,It was a good job that works around your schedule.  Be prepared to work when you are there. They will train you if your knowledge of cars isnt at a high level
good,It was a busy place to work with lots of things to do and many customers to take care of. The HUB was always looking for people and our store had plenty of regulars.
good,had to be very knowledgeable about automotive but was trained in areas that was lacking. Very fun and relaxed place to work but very professional. Policies were updated and assessed by the employees frequently.
good,"while the job is good, the hours are not that great. the employees are not always friendly and the upper management is shady. The manager we had for the sales floor was a blast and very understanding but the commercial manager needs to take a class on how to talk to employees."
good,Good place to work but lazy employees and upper management doesn’t do anything about it. A lot stuff needs to be done but no one take initiative. They drop 10 planograms on you at once and expect you to do all the planograms and take care of customers and answer phones all at the same time.
good,your job as an AutoZone employee depending on your title is to give outstanding customer service and to meet the sales goals every month. Also as a driver to be responsible do  the speed limit and follow all traffic rules
good,"Must learn how to play the game, and can be extremely stressful where you don't fit in with the status quo. There is upward mobility for those that fit in where all others are left to fend for self."
good,"Its all about sales, and theres very little downtime, its also about which store you work at, i had a good team at one store and we all worked hard and well with each other. and the store manager was awesome. then there have been other stores where the managers were not team players."
good,Always being pushed to build the numbers.  Low incentive to attain high business goals.  Corporate always looking for the negative things and not looking into the positive or strides in the right direction.
good,Management is over worked and under paid. Large work loads and expectations. All tools and means to do the job are not provided. There are opportunities but you must do the job without being paid first and must be willing to put in the time and patience.
good,"I have worked for Autozone for just over a year now and can say that it is a competitive, and fast paced place to work, we have fun with the customers and our co workers. Some days are rough and some days are easy."
good,only good place to work if u are a manager. I worked as a red shirt and a manger and the red shirts get bad hours. good place to start working but not much room for advancement. The store manager has to work a minimum 50 hours a week with hour lunches.
good,"Nothing super special its an average job where you can learn alot if you work with the right people and take time out of your self to do some research on why things work and how thing work for a car/truck"
good,Fast paced environment dealing with many customers and types of problems. Product knowledge and some automotive experience is deffinately a plus. Patience is a virtue
good,"At one time, a best in class company to work at.  Company culture revolved around team member satisfaction that would provide best in class customer satisfaction with great consistency.  Unfortunately, the company no longer believed investing in team member development added shareholder value."
good,"management is terrible! "
good,If you want an easy check this is not the job for you. They have training on their parts so you dont need to know about cars. You will learn as you go.
good,Autozone was one of my first real experiences working for a larger company. I don't feel like we were paid well enough for our workload. there is very little room for advancement
good,"I don't have a ton of experience, but it would seem that the store managers and above don't really treat the staff how they should. Additionally, AutoZoners really don't make enough money for what they are required to do. My manager was very willing to work with my schedule, that was a positive."
good,"I was a commercial driver , and would help out in the front whenever they needed backup. Overall the job isnt bad, but I do have a bad experiencing with the management. They expected alot from you with little help."
good,"This job allowed me to travel throughout the U.S. to set up new stores. The downside of this was that the pay was low, and the possibility of advancement was not good. As the new stores saturated the market, there was less need for my position."
good,"Your typical day of work is interacting with customers. You will be doing a lot of walking, some heavy lifting (batteries), and installing parts. The workers are usually humble and will help you progress if you try to learn. The hardest part of the job is when closing, there is only 2 people working and when a wave of people come, it is hard to work at a steady pace and keep everyone happy. If you are new to the store, don't expect to have a lot of hours."
good,It is what you make of it.  Different stores play by different rules.  I enjoyed working at the downers grove location on Ogden ave. I enjoy helping out the customer
good,"Working With lots of customers, helping them with problems an help them on the phone an in person. With there vehicles by putting on light bulbs, windshield wipers etc."
good,a very busy job at times but it can change to absolutely dead in an instant management could have been better but overall it was a very fair place to work at
good,"Autozone was a chaotic at times. Hours where not that good. Worker were okay to work with. Hard to get time off for personal time. But "
good,"Management often makes some poor choices and I felt like advancement is a lot more difficult to get than they claim. But you meet a lot of interesting customers, hear some good stories and learn stuff you didn't know before."
good,"There are a hand full of good jobs there. A lot of people I worked with were good people. It's truly the bottom of the retail food chain. Your expected to wear pins to work like it's a restaurant from the late 80's. Managment is hit or miss, if you get the right guy you could enjoy it but pick the wrong guy and you wonder why you wanted to work there."
good,"It all depends on who you work with. Arizona On job training was way below par and management was just as good. Added benefits were discounted prices on parts, which you will need because,"
good,"Computer system is very useful, even if you don't know much about how cars work, the system will tell you what is needed. Good inventory control. Good working environment overall, managers are cool and friendly."
good,"Field leadership is not helpful, often asks for unlikely results. Compensation is terrible, often doesn't hold up to promises made to the employees that they've made."
good,"Auto Zone is a great place to work and find parts the first time, very knowledgeable people. The customers are very great and co-workers help anytime they can."
good,"AZ is an okay place to work. a typical day was dealing with sometimes unruly customers telling you how to do your job. "
good,"Pretty easy and enjoyable place to work, only bad thing I have to say is that the management staff is awful. Store managers on up are literally the worst and least understanding people youll ever meet. Upper management loves to micro manage and nit pick everything. If you get a decent store manager Im sure its better but DMs and RMs are terrible."
good,"Come in to work the phone might be ringing and I help that customer, someone might come in and need a bulb installed ad I help with that. Overall it is a good job I leaned a lot it's just I need more hours and more money."
good,I was on the road most of the time delivering auto parts. I would also assist customers and check and charge batteries. I had different managers do each day would vary. Most enjoyable part was being on the road delivering parts.
good,"I really enjoyed helping people find the parts they needed to complete the job at hand or for their special projects. I unfortunately worked for some very unprofessional managers, ex. one manager was flipping his personal hatchet out where customers could see, talking big talk for no good reason. sometimes hours were scarce."
good,Mangement needs to be fixed. There are a lot of things that management is doing to this company that needs to be fixed. They are over seeing people that are displaying good work ethic and giving people who are lazy and unprofessional promotions.
good,Autozone was a great company ito work for even though we were short staffed at my location. I learned a lot about cars selling car parts that I knew and didn't know about
good,"I enjoyed coming into this job everyday knowing that I would have about 80% of the customers request my help. A typical work day consist of, supervision of others, accurate cash handling, making sure inventory is right on hand, etc."
good,It was very hectic alot of stock work always something to be taken out of box and put onto shelves so if your disabled it wouldake it a hard task especially when having to climb parts ladders and always have to wear safety belt
good,"•	Asked probing questions to help diagnose issues and make recommendations on necessary parts for car repair. Provided added value and up-sold customers by offering or warranties on purchases"
good,"I worked for Autozone for over a year and the first 8 months were great but then we switched store managers and it became a little rocky.  The first manager that I had was very flexible with schedules, was very honest and friendly to our customers.  After 8 months my manager stepped down and sure enough we got a new store manager.  The new manager began to show dishonesty to the customers and was unwilling to work with employee schedules, which made working for Autozone unfavorable."
good,"This used to be a good place to work. When I worked there, they sought the best and brightest and were willing to pay for them. They recruited us from other companies. Now, they don't want to hire anyone even full time because they don't want to play the benefits."
good,"If you enjoy retail and automotive related parts and products, this is the place for you. You are constantly learning about new parts as the cars get more advanced.  Being on the Management team has its difficulties at times due to extreme demands by higher-ups. But overall its a great place to work."
good,Overall a good place to work managers are willing to work with you on everything co workers are not team savy pay is below what you can expect you stay constantly busy your day fly's by
good,"Easy work, great  people, stretch before work was the best ever. I really enjoyed working for auto zone. A few bumps with the supervising but everything was uncontroll"
good,You are micro-managed and underpaid. The company has extremely high turnover rate and employees have very little automotive knowledge.
good,Largely political culture with limited opportunity for skill based advancement. Management ranges from ineffective to acceptable from district to district
good,The store i specifically worked for was wonderful. I was the only female and the men i worked with helped me a lot and welcomed me without hesitation.
good,"A typical day at Autozone would be show up at 5 pm and begin to close the store. I have learned patience and how to really sell products to customers. My management was not up to par. When conflict arose, AutoZone's management believed transferring co-workers was the solution. I learned moving the problem only prolongs it, it does not solve it. The hardest part of my job was getting my manager to resolve problems between co-workers and myself. Many times my manager would push the problems under the rug and tell me just to deal with it. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers with their car troubles. I love working on cars and I was always handed the phone when a customer called for some over-the-phone diagnostics. Many customers would wait for me to clock out just so I could look/ work on their vehicles."
good,"Bad district.manager had no room for advancement, no acknowledgement for job well done. Moved around to much without a choice, no pay for travel. Wanted to much from a 2 person crew with mismanagement."
good,was told i would be working close to full time but was mislead. all the people who work there a very friendly but the management doesn't realize that a person cannot survive working 10 hours per week
good,"I know qay too many people that thwy fired for stupid reasons. They were trying to help there rules actually, like check out challenge, but instead fired them, then later regretted it and tried to get them back. Laxk of communixation between highers and store level."
good,"Some days we would be short workers and have no one else to come in. This would lead to staying longer hours than scheduled. Management was poor at giving out raises to people that truly deserved them. It is a big corporation, but I felt it was not worth it. It IS however worth it to many others. I believe it is all up to personal preference."
good,"A typical day at work nothing too hard giving trustworthy advice to help customers, co-workers were helpful and had no problems answering my questions when asked"
good,Work load is manageable... work environment is good... i have learnt alot about different mechanical parts for a vehicle... actually have expanded my my views about vehicles.
good,"This is a okay company to work for. This job is meant for high school students due to the amount of hours they give you. One week you have 25 hours then the next week you will be given only 11 hours. If you're a very hard worker this isn't the job for you, you will be worked hard and receive minimum back in return."
good,I usually delivered parts and picked up money for commercial businesses. I worked front counter and stock parts in aisles. It was a good job.
good,A typical day at work is you clock in and basically help customers with parts and orders. Also to change batteries and to diagnose vehicle problems. I learned a lot about how to find parts for customers with foreign cars that are very difficult to get parts for and just to give excellent customer service. I was also responsible for inventory counts and returns.
good,"There are no typical days. Schedules can vary to the point of closing one night and opening the next morning.Daily responsibilities include assessing previous day's sales results, and coaching employees when necessary, to maintain goals, constantly coaching employees on customer service, handling store accounting which includes both auditing cash registers throughout the day and recording previous day's transactions for deposits, and managing inventory and floor displays. In this environment you learn to manage time effectively because customer service must come first while still being balanced with the additional responsibilities of managing a shift. Employees in this profession tend to be either young who require constant teaching or well motivated but less accomplished individuals who require frequent coaching to keep them focused. The most positive aspect of this position is the people you get the opportunity to work with. They tend to be, almost universally, blue collar personalities with solid knowledge of the field who have a positive attitude even on bad days. Management tends to be very sharp and focused on goals, largely sales, which is a positive but at times can create tunnel vision which dos not consider all circumstances such as low customer volume, the time period sales specials have been offered, or the challenges of working a volatile schedule."
good,Autozone is a great experienced with customer service.  The most enjoyable part about the job is interacting with different people.  The hardest part is lack of teamwork within coworkers.  I have learned how to communicate positively with all different type of customers and co-workers.
good,"Autozone is a cool company to work for as an automotive enthusiasts however you are stifled in what knowledge you can use by ever present ""management""directives on what to sell, how to sell it and when to sell it. Overall I enjoy working for AutoZone but there are definitely some things I could do without on the job."
good,needs more hours and better beneits but other than that a good company also could use more motivated people and people who are willing to learn
good,"Most of the experience here has been positive.  From the customer base to the immediate management.  However the opportunity for advancement is not as great as you would think in a company of this size.  Some expectations of overall building appearence are not attainable with the type of business this is.   Things will never be grease or dust free in an auto parts industry.  "
good,our main goal is to provide a great and reliable service to customers with car problems. being able to correctly diagnose a problem with a car and able to give reliable advice.
good,"Typical day was to clock in, look up parts for vehicles, and answer phones. Co-workers were ok, management could use some work"
good,not a bad job if you are happy staying at a low work level . would probably still be there if they provided more incentives to the employees.
good,"Working at Autozone was not an easy task. As a parts and sales manager I often found myself jealous of how what Autozone pushes at their work culture. I was jealous because I knew that Autozone would push this type of culture unless it actually existed. My time at Autozone felt like the exact opposite. My particular Autozone had a do more with less mentality. No one ever seemed to be on the same page. There also seemed to be an assumption that employees were stealing out of the store as well. This made for a very uncomfortible work environment for everyone. On a scale from one to ten, I would give Autozone an overall grade of 3 as far as job satisfaction."
good,"Dias buenos, dias malos, en cuestion ventas mas buenos que malos"
good,"Generally, a good company to work for. Being in mgmt., I didn't care for being required to work 6 days a week. Liked working in an automotive atmosphere."
good,"I loved meeting the customers, the regulars and the new customer. There rarely was a slow boring day. Never thought being on my feet all day would be so fun"
good,"put incoming freight for order selectors replenish racks  use of equipment either cherry picker or reach lift,single or double rider which every is best for the job assigned that day  rf scanner,production based  daily & weekly"
good,"A typical day at is pretty cool. I've to use their different online systems, and also had an opportunity to work all departments except Commercial. Hardest part is customers, and most enjoyable is clock-out time."
good,I get alot of hours and depending on which store you work at its a good place to work. the only problem is the pay. after taxes and health care your check would be gone. unless you come in at a hire position like alot of people this job if you like me and have a house family cars kids.. this job wont cut it. in a month i only make enogh to pay morgage and have $30 left to put in the tank to last two weeks....
good,"-Count cash from registers and safe."
good,"I started working here when I first started to learn about cars after high school graduation. Friend of mine was the boss, but work was work. Learned inventory and customer service skills as well as additional computer skills and testing equipment."
good,"help costumers"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, is being able to provide great customer service  and being able to provide our customers with the best solutions to their automotive needs."
good,The work if easy. You just have to make sure that your are very detailed when it comes to matching an application with a particular car. When in doubt use the vin number.
good,I would assist customers with there purchase and make sure they had everything they needed to complete there project.  I would also take orders from the local garages and delivery there parts and supplies as needed.
good,"typical day i help my boss run the commercial side of things. Answer phones,look up parts and deliver them. I love my coworkers but management could be better. They dont really help out and dont know how to run it well."
good,"Worked Sunday through Wednesday.  "
good,"When I was injured while on workers compensation. They tried to comply, but giving you a medal chair and makes it very difficult to maintain your job. A normal day was always rough. Sitting in that chair made it very difficult."
good,"Great job for those who really enjoy dealing with cars, diagnosing car issues and helping customers pick the proper parts for their vehicles."
good,Started out as a driver and worked all the way up to parts sales manager.
good,"Not bad job money not great but I met interesting people all across the state, The best part about the job I think is traveling all across state delivering parts."
good,"A typical day i would arrive 5-10 prior to shift and review anything that was happening and what needed to happen and start my day.  What I learned was the difference in military working environment and the civilian working environment, which resulted in increased restraint and patience.  Working with most of the employees was great.  Management was lazy and arrogant.  The hardest part was dealing with a lack luster management and a different set of rules of engagement.  The best part of the job was help the customer, either by just talking to them and giving them your product knowledge or going out on the cold rainy day to change their battery for them.  That is what made it all better for me."
good,"the stores were well stocked, and inventory was kept at a pro. level, however incentives, raises, bonuses, etc. were sadly lacking."
good,"a lot of information about car parts can be learned while working here"
good,"Es buena empresa, pero los lideres que tienen manchan la reputación de la empresa, son muy rudos con su personal, y no valoran los logros de sus empleados"
good,"*delivery parts to local repair shop"

Helped stranded Customers With there vehicles changed batteries on daily basis diagnosed customer problems recommending parts needed to fix vehicle. Store/Assistant Managers would delegated task but failed to communicate amongst each other without communicating with each other on how they wanted the task at hand done."
good,A typical retail job working the cash register putting stock away helping customers and just staying busy throughout the day...The toughest part is when the customer asks you to go out to their car and change a battery or doing some kind of mechanical work in the winter...The driving was the cool part of the job to get away from the chaos of the store on busy Saturday afternoons. The downside of driving was some of the people working at the shops were jerks and at times tried to make the deliveries tougher than they had to be.
good,"pulled and shipped parts to over a 100 stores in the Atlanta Region."
good,nice place to work as long as your not looking for a career...............
good,"It's a good job for a sales orientated individual. I've learned a lot on daily operations for a large corporation, enjoy working with others whom have some same interest. Hardest part of job is certain types of paper work involved with business."
good,"Typical day at Autozone included overseeing 95% of store functions including customer service, money management, managing Customer Service Representatives and general store up-keep.  "
good,"Learning Automotive was a great task, The management staff was pretty cool, and The store was always tidy."
good,"What I da there is put the Sunday delivery truck .It consists of approximately 5 skids. I break them down and put as much as I can away in 8 hours."
good,"I opened the store, supervised up to 10 individuals at a time, good communication skills and customer service skills, telecommunications skills, stocking, organizing, multi-tasking, security and loss prevention. I also performed bank deposits, change orders, refunds, and problem solving skills."
good,"AutoZone is great at promoting those who deserve it. Not my cup of tea, but not a bad company to work for."
good,"Responsible for increased sales of high end auto parts through effective visual merchandising,as well as layout and upkeep of entire store sales floor, parts counter and keeping cash drawer and safe accountable. Daily operations included front end, cash deposit, and inventory control."
good,Not enough money and hours to flexible one week 20 hrs next 45.
good,"I was hired here by an older customer of mine from another company. He told me I would only be ringing customers up and answering phones, because he knew I had no knowledge about cars. I was expected to answer customer questions about what could be wrong with their vehicles, and it would most of my interactions with customers would end up with them being upset that I had no idea what they needed to fix their car."
good,"You come in, help some customers great but for some obscure reason others, although very nicely you try to help them, seem to have a vendetta towards you. No problem, deal with them and give them what they want as nice as possible. And it seems that 99% of the angry customers do not take heed in policy or realize we can get fired for doing favors. No problem, keep smiling."
good,"During a day at work, you work with customers to get them parts and try to diagnose problems with customer vehicles by asking questions or interpreting engine codes with OBDII code reader. when not dealing with customers, take care of the store by cleaning, or moving product to make sure the shelves are fully stocked."
good,"fun job,great team ,my store was the best looking store in the dist. was always spotless we had a very good hard working team,head in sales and store goals"
good,"Its a job to pay bills to me and thats about it, i'm not a fan of the company and how they treat their employees, I have a decent General manager.  The best part of the job is probably getting the laughs and the social aspect of it. the hardest part of the job are the hours,  they are not set hours one day i can work from 1 to 9 and have to be in at work the next day at 7. My off days change from week to week, and so do my hours. i would like more of a set schedule so i can get my sleep schedule back on track."
good,Every day is different at Auto Zone.  You will learn something new on a daily basis. The clientele varies but of course you have regulars that will build a relationship with you and send business your way.
good,"Dealing with the upper management is the hardest task, employment here teaches you the knowledge of the automotive."
good,"When I first joined the autozone team it was fun, exciting and each day was enjoyable until the last years when departments started downsizing and changing roles."
good,love the job  but the management needed work But over all was fun
good,"Good atmosphere to work in, You learn a lot everyday, from installing batteries to checking alternators and starters. Co-workers were awesome, until my  boss had quit. The managers began to fight over promotions which resulted in total chaos."
good,"se desepeñan muchas funciones lo cual permite aprender de diferentes areas y actividades, en ocasiones esto puede resultar complicado por ser areas de atencion a clientes y dificultar un poco las actividades, el ambiente entre los compañeros es muy bueno, se encuentra de todo tipo de personal."
good,"A lot of verbel communacation, and car knowledge. I've learned how to run a store and handle problems calm and professional. The computer helps you a lot with the car questions you wouldn't know. The management was good but can be better, wasn't enough team work and communication."
good,no room for growth. management sucks.paid and hours are horrible
good,"Great co-workers."
good,"days were good. I learned lots about car. management and co workers was friendly. I would say the hardest was sometimes not getting car function, than I would get it. we all work as a cool co worker really good place to work"
good,"Work can get very hectic. Ive leaned how to properly diagnose and fix some vehicles. I worked my way from Csr to Psm within months."
good,Working for Autozone was a daily challenge because you would have to deal with every customers attitude whether good or bad. The majority of the time we would have to calm customers down before we could figure out what they were in the store to purchase.  I learned how to be patient with all types of customers even if I had to let them vent for the moment. Being a manager was the most crucial part of my experience because not only did I have to make sure my work was done I had to check behind other managers and staff members.
good,I went through a lot of district managers as a store manager and each one had different ways of doing things. Adapting to constantly changing job duties is not always easy.
good,"I will clock in and check in with my manger on the days task. I will then proceed to obtain all tools/equipment required to complete the tasks. The activities of the day range from: putting up stock, marketing/sales, or mechanical labor."
good,"The job was varied and never dull.  It opened my experiences"
good,"Good for job, don't expect high pay or consistent schedule. "
good,"Management was not very intelligent on products or how to run business, including they wanted you to work 60hrs/ week, however, would be upset for you working overtime. However, co-workers were very supportive and loyal."
good,busy at times encoutering all types of learning experiences about cars
good,just looking up parts for customers and pulling them sometimes changing batteries doing lots of plan-o-grams and just enjoying the day then go home
good,Working with people is the best part of this job. You will get some angry customers from time to time but its up yo you to make them smile by the end of the day. Enjoyed working there.
good,opening autozone store making sure all sections of autozone is clean and organized getting registers ready making sure all employees are ready to work and showed up checkin the P&L report for the day. checking cash drops from the previous day putting up the adds for the week/month I have learned the skills of solving problems for customers. Learned to listen good to customers so I can giving great advice to help them with product they want or need to do the job right. Hardest part of the job is to not take care of a customer. it in my nature
good,it is not a bad place to work there is just not enough hour in the week
good,"This company is a good company to cut teeth in and learn about different businesses. The company has many positions that are routine and low visibility which employees can have a good work/life balance. However, for the promotable roles, a high work load and stressful demands will be required. If you can be graceful under pressure and keep multiple things in the air while remaining focused, it is a good company to try. The major negative is the Memphis, TN area. Nashville is much more attractive in TN."
good,"Working as a hub driver often leads to long days but in the long run, less days due to longer hours."
good,"As a hub driver, I deliver to different stores all over the state. Learned about a variety of counties and towns. Meet new people everyday. My co-workers are a great group to work with. You will have to have a strong sense of self to drive for hours. The journey is the most enjoyable part."
good,learn how to work with many different types of people. the most enjoyable thing about working here was the flexibility on work hours while you go to school.
good,I really enjoyed working here. I have a lot of knowledge about cars and car parts. It wasn't difficult to understand customer needs. The coworkers helped me alot in how to run the store. The hardest part was trying to decide what part a customer needed.
good,Its a job centered around who you know instead of what you know.
good,"Must install various parts for customers i.e., batteries, wipers, headlights with little to no training. Told to run the store as if it was your own business but then told who you can hire and who you cannot."
good,all i have to say is make sure that your very knowledgeable with vehicles cause if not work will be stressfull
good,"typical day at work is help customers, and work on truck."
good,autozone is a good company to work but the pay is not good just want to find something better for my family
good,"I learned a lot about cars at this job it was necessary to have knowledge. This was a fast pace working environment, it was also busy. Management at this job were not working to their full potential in my point of view, and coworkers were also trying to compete for a higher position in between others. At times I did not feel it was a team oriented environment. The most enjoyable part of this job was the knowledge I gained throughout the time I worked there."
good,This is a outstanding company to work for . Great people to work with but upper management needs some up and time to understand people
good,A typical day was assisting customers and helping them with thier purchases
good,"Working for auto zone provides you with stable hours and flexibility if you are a college student. But that is it, if you are not planing to stay here for the long run it is only good as a transition place, if you plan to go into a career outside of retail you will gain no real experience working here, you could if you were management, but as long as you are in school they will not give you a management even if you work 40 hours. Ridiculous pay raises and evaluations, and zero incentives for the demand they put on sales."
good,i got into autozone as a 1st job it helps gain knowledge in autoparts and basic mechanics i was put in situations were i had to go look unde the hood and even though i did not have any mechanic experience you learn enough to be able to diagnose or identify minor issues wether it be a ripped belt or oil leak your able to determine thanks to everyday at autozone
good,My manager was a 19 year old girl that didn't know you could not use any type of coolant in any car. She was mean to me and when I told my manger he didn't even talk to her or anything. The store was gross and he wouldn't make sure that everyone cleaned up after themselves. I would do far more work than what was expected and in the end was lied to about being trained to be a manager even though I had more schooling and training about cars and car parts than the store manager himself!
good,Assisting customers with their vehicles can be rewarding. You get to learn about cars as you work for this company. As long as your enthusiastic about customer service and learning as much as you can about auto mechanics you can go far with this company.
good,It was a good job if you were a driver because you didn't have a manager looking over your shoulder all day. But it was alot of heavy lifting for little pay. And the days were very long becasue you wouldn't be able to take a lunch break until 7 hours then come back and work another 4 or 5 hours.
good,"How  each store is run and where they are located makes for a different experience. There is usually plenty to do if you like to stay busy.  Your schedule will be ever changing as they don't want it to be set in stone, you must work all shifts, days and hours."
good,I liked working here and the discounts and culture is fun! the only problem is it has a lot of entry level people that become management and dont know how to run the place.  good job for just going to work then going home
good,Great place to start out in the Automotive environment. Always stay on you toes and be open to moving hours around to be able to become management! Always room to move up!
good,"Wasn't looking for a job for real but filled out application online they emailed me, interviewed, got the job. You work show up on time do your best to take care of the customer and your all good"
good,This is a typical store where your  schedule changes day to day so you really can't plan for anything outside of work and the pay is really low as well as the yearly raises.
good,The work is sometimes easy and other times I am pretty busy. The customers are usually respectful. The store manager is good and flexible with my hours.
good,Everything about autozone was great. The driving is what I liked the most! I’ve been driving for a long time now and I enjoy every bit of it. That’s what I loved best about my job.
good,They hire and promote people without necessary skills or knowledge over ones that do have these skills or knowledge. Management puts people down don't listen.
good,"You can learn a lot about different parts and what they do, you get experience doing batteries, headlights, wipers and using a basic OBD2 scan tool. They offer opportunities to rise in the ranks."
good,Liked that i was able to work with helping customers and learned stock but not the best place if you are trying to move up. no matter how hard i worked my hours stayed the same and so did my pay
good,"Store manager and dm more worried about themselves,leaving store intentionally short staffed and not providing proper hours as promised leaving paycheck short and scheduling not as promised"
good,"Upper management will stretch the crew as thin as possible while still completing tasks. It can me stressful and busy trying to complete certain tasks while still helping customers, but the crews tend to be happy and helpful."
good,I like working for this company there is room to grow. Yes room to grow but with only favoritism and if the management dont like how you work then they move you or just keep you in the same position for as long as they can.
good,"Working at AutoZone taught me alot about my self and other people. It taught me how to install car parts and it also taught me how to use a cash register. The work was easy and the pay was fair, i just needed something more. AutoZone also tauvht me how to treat a customer and how customers treat you."
good,"It's a very easy job, but you do more work then you are paid for. AutoZone offers free services to customers, which is good, but employees never get raises, and most refuse to get promoted since the raise is not worth the workload."
good,Held to higher standards than the competition when using the the same payroll model and inferior systems.  This does vary based on area of the country and regional management.
good,"Loved the rush at my old location kept us way busy."
good,Managing stock opening in closing store paper work customer service its alot of things you can learn from the customer or just observing great job for learning new things about you car
good,"* Design and order products for retail sales"
good,"great job, if you like working till 10 at nite then returning to work at 6:45 am, retail job, you have to like working with public, not a job for everyone, but a great place to work"
good,It's a decent job and pay is decent just looking for something with more consistent hours and that I dont work every single weekend. They do have job advancements but Is a lot about who they like and not what you do in my opinion.
good,"great place to work but the management sucked.made you not want to come into work, really hard on employees and not really caring bout family. i feel like if there was a better store manager it would be better place to work."
good,"they cut hours big time I only worked 2 days a week"
good,"Even though the pay was good, management was very poor and disrespectful. They were very aggresive and were always targeting me. Also, a dirty work environment."
good,"Autozone is good for providing someone with no experience an opportunity to grow in the automotive sales industry, however growth within the company can be difficult management changed very often."
good,"If you are sales oriented, AutoZone would definitely love to hire you.  Pay is very low compared to competitors and moving up is usually facilitated by high turnover."
good,"I happen to work at a Autozone that was once messed up due to previous store managers but it is getting better. "
good,"Over worked and under paid!"
good,I worked there when I was young. It was a good job to have while in college. Definitely worked with my school schedule while allowing me to get the necessary hours.
good,"Tu dia siempre es activo, trabajas con muchas areas. Falta comunicacion entre corporativo y centro de distribucion"
good,"AutoZone is a good place to work. Flexible scheduling, collaborative environment, advancement opportunities. The pay could be better, and the training for management positions could be a lot better. I was not able to get the training that I needed to manage a store, due to the district manager relocating. The managers are good at helping you to learn what you need to know."
good,Spend a lot of time restocking products and helping customers with finding the correct parts needed to fix their vehicle.  The autozone computer system makes it easy to locate the correct parts needed.
good,New experience for me working in retail sales. Never done it before but I am learning as I go. the staff is very helpful and provide the need it guidance you need to perform your job.
good,Upper management lacks effective communication with its employees at the store level on key items that can and have lead to conflicts in the past. Not a bad place to work at the store level.
good,Hot as sin during the summer months. Other that that it's not bad pretty chill real busy some parts of the year also a good work out if your in the right isles
good,Availability of parts is frustrating. Schedules are changing frequently. Customers sometimes were rude but most of the time it was a good place to work for
good,Depending on the store its is a fast paced environment. Sometimes the people you work with are not the best some are rude but there are also some nice ones.
good,"Mostly employ part time, but the job is not difficult. Minimal training is offered. Pay reflects part time, minimal training. Commercial driving opportunity is offered."
good,"Overall I was indifferent about working there. While, yes it was a job, sometimes it didn't feel like much of one. Mediocre pay and inconsistent hours made it hard to get up and go to work every day, but bills had to be paid somehow. To me it felt like working for the ""Walmart"" of auto parts stores. The everyday routine did not feel very professional, and the workers didn't seem to want to be there. The employee discounts were laughable at best. If i were to do it again, I would go with NAPA, O'Reillys, etc."
good,Cambios importantes dentro de Recursos Humanos así como en otras áreas.
good,"Fast paced, good store mgr, most of the other employees are very helpful teaching new employees different tasks the job requires"
good,Nothing great or bad to say about working here. A typical retail job with typical retail customers. The pay was competitive for the area I was living in so overall average.
good,A typical day at work went by very fast. I kept busy but was always able to complete all tasks. I could keep the customers happy as well as my employees.
good,AutoZone Distribution is idea for one who is looking for a company that is yet to experience layoffs of full time employees.  Safety is at the top of the list and is implemented daily
good,"id recommend to a friend it a great place to work, if looking for a fast and sometimes calm environment with discount this is the place to be. training is offered and Awesome"
good,Very easy to advance. Long days but goes by quick. A lot of responsibility as a parts manager but the job is very easy. Beef to have patients with the customer's. Most of them know everything (of course they are always right).
good,"I had an enjoyable time working here, i was a driver for parts and a tote picker and really learned alot about team work and stocking systems as well as prompt delivery and overall would recommend autozone"
good,productive fun workplace with a ping pong table great team  cares about u nice management quality training descent pay great hours 10 hour days equipemt is fun to drive
good,Company is pretty strict and has alot of rules.  Overall if you are a good worker you will do just fine. Certain people get special treatment and are not held accountable like some others.
good,I worked for this company this year was a great experience until we got a new manager and messed everything up rather be unemployed instead of working for a company that cuts your hours.
good,"AutoZone is a good company despite its international size. Company is focused on customer service and sales. Rewards and pins are rewarded for accomplishments pretty regularly and upper management, for the most part, seem to care about their employees. Lots of opportunity to learn and grow."
good,I have learned quite a bit at Autozone but unfortunately it is not a career path I want to continue. Some flexibility with hours. There is not much growth at this company and it’s sad to see so many people with potential to move up.
good,"Job with decent pay, benefits, and good point system and PTO. "
good,"This company with the right people in specific places, makes it a great company, however 1 wrong person and it destroys the ""kingdom"" from within, again, a great company and only has up to go"
good,Good place to work. Very informative and helpful. Many options of areas of work. Managers are helpful and welcoming. I enjoyed all the time I spent working for this company.
good,"The main reason is they absolutely no decent pay. No matter what you do for autozone the store manager is only given 2 dollars to split up between his employees,  no matter how many he has. You might get 35 cents or 10 cents depending on how many work with you.  I actually feel bad for the management.  If they think you're worth alot more money. Autozone corporation will not give more money for raises. No matter what he says"
good,"AutoZone is a fast paced work environment. Always on the go with phone calls on parts or with customers in store. Everyone that works is required to know how to change a battery, headlights/taillights, and windshield wipers."
good,As a manager I was getting a lot of hours which I’m not complaining about however the upper management was quite lack luster and didn’t really take care of their employees
good,"Just be out going and know the Basic on cars and trucks, so you and help out the Customer on what they need. Have fun whit your job don’t let it get Boring."
good,It is a good place to work for a young person looking for a first job. Some stores are better than others but I loved most of my co workers and managers..
good,AutoZone is a great company to work with. the opportunity for promotion is always available. The management support has always been great. AutoZone also provides a good training program.
good,"Its a pretty easy working environment. Put up parts, help customers, simple stuff. Its when everyone is lazy and management doesnt do their job that it gets difficult. Empty promises, lazy coworkers means no enthusiasm when i come in. Its good for temporary work. 6 months. Or a year. Thats it. Get out after that."
good,Typical day starts with working on freight and stocking items on shelves. Helping customers find what they need. Computer system is a bit of a challenge to learn at first. Management is okay they are very busy and sometimes seem to be over whelmed. The hardest part of this job is the customers. Many of them don't know what they need or even want and expect you to find it for them. Overall I think it is a good company but it can be sometimes a frustrated place to to work because of the the schedule.
good,The area around this distribution centre was very country with the attendant problems of racism. At the plant the staff divided themselves into three groups and choose managers who competed among themselves for positions and attendant power. This was a most stressful place to work because I refused to get involved and that was frowned on by the fellow employees.
good,Particularly at the store I worked at. Pattern of people quitting by the next day. General manager was becoming unprofessional and always complaining. That could have been a good job. I had real good days when the gm wasn't there.
good,I was working two part time jobs and going to school full time. It was a generally slow paced easy job that help put me through school for the time being. There were stressful days but that’s bound to happen anywhere. Most of the time is was a good experience.
good,l enjoy working there but I do not like the inconsistencies that come with scheduling. schedules come out on Saturdays and no 2 weeks are the same. It is very hard to schedule any appointments.
good,"I worked here as a part time job as i was going through college. the hours were flexible which was great, but the pay was minimal, you had to work weekends, and the work is just bland."
good,"great company, needs better advancement opportunities. the hardest part of the job was lifting. everything else was enjoyable. I learned the importance of delivery dead lines and the importance of accuracy."
good,Great learning and leadership in directing employees and customers to help with them with there needs for there automobiles and selling them the correct parts the first time
good,"AutoZone is an ok place to work. Been here about 8 years. I close too many evenings. Plus, management and corporate do not know what they are doing to help vets."
good,"Overall working at AutoZone was not terrible, but the high work load(due to having to pick up slack from others). on top of the required up-selling felt like too much. This may not be a case at all Autozone's. it very much so depends on the area you work."
good,dealing with customers on a daily basis for their car parts needs. fun atmosphere management was laid back. the hardest part was sometimes dealing with unruly customers.
good,"I still work here so not going to leave a review. It has it's good and bad points like most jobs and my personal issues are not yours. Plus, it could be just this area."
good,"AutoZone was better than Minyards. Its still a part time job, but its good way to still gain some money. It is good as long as you get the hours. And you can gain more hours by traveling to other stores."
good,"it really depends where you work, who you work with. the job is low pace and nothing to stress about, only when you have a mouth breather bothering you does it get bothersome"
good,Ability to advance quickly if eager to. Often put in a position to be more than flexible. It often felt as if I was put in an unusual position with trying to meet stores hourly needs.
good,It’s very peaceful they have a great team likes to work with you they give you good hours and good pay you get paid every week on a Friday you can do overtime
good,A typical day at AZ will be clocking in and making sure that the store presentable for customers. The workplace culture depends on your store manager and co workers but I love my store culture but the company sucks. The pay is horrible and I have been there for 3 years and I still make under $10. They want you to work as hard as you can but no pay you. That is exactly why there is high turnover rate with this company
good,this was a great job for a younger staff 18-25 it is very fast paced and helpful for life skills. Especially for a female to have the skills to take care of and maintain own vehicle
good,at the store level the managers and employees were great to work with. When upper management came around all you heard was complaining and butt chewing. Never worked for a place that likes to make the store employees feel like that before. They are the face of the company and get repeat business because the relationships they build but corporate management cant see that
good,"Having to keep up with sales numbers wasn't too bad but constantly being pushed to raise them was stressful, that combined with higher-up management that was too disconnected from the ground work can make for a very bad time"
good,"Depending on the location, AutoZone can be a great place to work and learn.  However, the pay is not competitive at this time, and infighting within upper management can cripple a store or even region, to the point where all employees are overworked and stressed."
good,management is responsible for leading the team to meet sales goals. as a team you have to pick up the slack of team members who are not motivated. after moving from the bottom to management thats the top spot no room for advancement unless you move into regional and that dont happen average time in management is 5 years and no advancement
good,"decent job for learning new skills. if you pay attention and are willing to learn, you can learn a lot of new things from coworkers and other people that come in."
good,"Easy to learn, training if not experienced, benefits only for full time positions, not the best pay but always opportunities to grow in the company with promotions"
good,"Fun environment, flexible hrs...had lots of fun and great experience with my coworkers, did not get paid enough and was not my career choice but learn a lot about cars and time management"
good,Not the best but got to meet people that I could call family . Not great pay . Need to change some management to reach goals the where asking people to follow
good,"ping pong every day , every single day, ping pong . if you like ping pong you have arrived! the people there are fun and friendly and love them some ping pong!! Boy howdy is ping pong popular over there."
good,CSR. Worked parts counter. Money management. Flexible hours. Learning materials. Laid back. Team work. Managers need to be experienced. Employees are nice
good,In my district there is no respect for the workers starting at the DM down to the store manager. Scheduling always conflict with people every day schedule. For an example if you have to pick up your kids  at 1 your schedule would look like 8 to 2. Its ridiculous.
good,"Selling auto part's consists of gathering information from a customer and searching a database.  The only complications arise regarding inventory.  Easy business to work in."
good,"I have been an employee for Autozone for 2 years and although it isn't a horrible job, its definitely in need of improvements. "
good,"worked sixty plus hours per week for extremely low pay at the time, but to be fair that was twenty years ago.  I have no idea how they operate today.  Retail distribution"
good,"At Autozone, I was able to learn about vehicles and I enjoyed the job and learning new things. However, Autozone needs to work on management. at the time. My manager lacked the managerial skills to deal with things effectively."
good,"Have been working for autozone for 3 years now. You meet a lot of people who are important in the community and helpful in many ways such as business owners and other skilled trades. Entry level in the company starts out with low pay but if you show interest, reliability, dedication, and good work ethics you can move fast in this company with good to great pay. Example I have had 2 co workers recently promoted to store managers within 2 years of being with the company. Autozone is a huge company that is constantly growing and prefers to promote within over hiring outside the company. Also the company gives yearly raises and the amount depends on your yearly review."
good,Why do I have to write reviews for previous jobs and put myself out there. I want to remain anonymous and find a job please let me do that and let me get through this.
good,"The company needs to focus on all of its stores. Not just the ones that meet the sales goals. If they don't meet those goals, they neglect the store. For example, cutting hours."
good,I got a mixed bag working here. My first job and I was promoted to manager within the first year. Once that I was pressured to meet sales goals in a pretty arid environment. Finally I found myself working harder and longer than my subordinates and an accident later I was fired and couldn’t even file for unemployment because of a zero tolerance policy.
good,A typical day of work consists of you being your feet all day long. You basically learn as you go there is only bout two good people that can teach you the right way
good,Very knowledgeable staff. Easy to find parts you need to repair your vehicle as well as advice on how to preform the repairs on your own. Very friendly staff.
good,"It was a decent job when dont have responsibilities, as the job requires long hours at a minuim wage rate which can't pay bills such as phone and car insurance and even clothing."
good,"meeting different people helping with sales and returns and making sure the shelves are stocked with what the customers needs, managing the phone calls"
good,Pretty good company. Has it’s pros and cons just like any other place that you work but the pay was decent. You could make a living off the compensation if you were management.
good,"went from working 40+ hours a week 5 days a week to 8 hours a day 2 days a week. unloaded truck, answered phones, helped customers, cycle counts, planograms"
good,It was my first job and it was great. I worked part time there. It a great place to start out at. If you ever need anything all you have to do is ask your managers and they help you.
good,If your not ready for a fast paced environment this job may not be for the average job there definitely a lot of movement to be done so your always going
good,"This location was possibly the best jobs ever..."
good,Good place to work scedualing is in consistant and if yo work well you will get called in alot. Rhe people are freindly it can be fast paced. Overall ok job
good,"Customers are sometime rude and impatient."
good,"A day at autozone: Help customers, putting up stock, taking care of the store"
good,sin posibilidad a ascender de puesto a corto plazo con carencia de personal capacitado
good,"Good part time job with flexible work hours. As with most customer service jobs, you have to have thick skin and don't take things personally. Several locations for relocation if needed."
good,It has been over 21 years since I have worked at Autozone. Things have changed there and I could not speculate on how things are being run there. I would like to add that it was a family type atmosphere when I was with the company.
good,working for the was like working for fastfood places low wages slow career advancement not enough hours and hard to get benefits unless youre hired in full time
good,Micro managing and low pay make this job difficult to maintain. Takes years to work up to positions that are available quite frequently. If you do really well at your job plan on being there awhile.
good,"Typical day is to take care of customers and to stock products on the shelf. I would also unload the truck and get returns ready to go back to the factory,"
good,I enjoy working there and the people that I work with managers are pretty easy to talk to about did he do things in the workplace and other problems you may have outside of work working there as a great start to an automotive field career.
good,"Autozone isn't a horrible place to work. Relatively easy, but the compensation is minimal. This is more of a temp job for a student. I did however make lasting friendships."
good,"It was a a good environment at most times, not enough employees working, low pay for the work. There is room for growth in the company. Good benefits overall."
good,I was a sales associate for autozone and processed hundreds of sales. I was also in charge of stocking and maintaining a organized store. This particular job taught me a lot about cars.
good,Autozone is a good company for people looking for their first job. A normal shift for part-time workers are 4-7 hours where you help customers with parts and other minor car issues.
good,"Work none stop and always had stuff to do, never was appreciated no matter how many hours that a worker helps out with keeping the flow of the job. Many hours of overtime cause no one would actually show up or that of the lack of employees with in the busy store. The need for more employees for the job intitled was needed and never meet."
good,"Some of the employees were fun to work for and were really qilling to help teach you knew things especially being part of the commercial side, glad to have been taught how to truly help those busy mechanic companies find what they need and made sure they were happy with the results."
good,Very very good for learning about cars more in-depth if you just know basics. Need to be a fast learner to keep up with some of the mechanics that come in and ask for specific parts
good,"Working at AutoZone was a great opportunity. I really enjoyed working with my coworkers. Good work environment, although management development could of been better. I learned a lot in my short time with the company."
good,Great place They believe and live in their pledge to provide great customer service will bend over backwards for the customer there employees they maintain their stores they have opportunities to lead they have in a AutoZone fund that takes care of you if something was to go wrong
good,I didn't think it was a bad place to work.  Third shift is for single people unless your other half works the same shift. They should have three breaks its a 10hr shift. I also don't feel that you should have to wait a year to enroll in there 401k.
good,It was fun and I enjoyed it. That's about it.  Nothing wrong with it. Didn't get paid to much.  That's it.  ..........................................
good,great place to gain work experience or start if you are young. doesnt pay enough to make a living. good people to work with. cant afford benefits. overall decent place to work.
good,Really friendly atmosphere and easy to work for and the managers are easly impressed with outstanding work and work preformances . the company is easy work up to a higher position.
good,Learned a lot of things I didn’t know about cars. Some people are often mad when they come in because their cars are messed up others are often friendly.
good,"* Pay is on the low end"
good,I was a driver here and the job was fairly easy. The hardest part was probably having to memorize where every auto shop was at in the area and that didn’t take long
good,Auto Zone is a good place to work.It is hard to move up in the company they hire from the outside.The location i was at did have good management but it was very hard to get promoted.
good,a typical retail job where customer service along with customer attitudes control pace and flow of the day. no commission straight up how can I help you with the opportunity and advancement depending on location.
good,Could have been better. Pay wasn’t that great and never saw a raise. Underpayed for the task asked to do. And asked to work more than the job title said.
good,bathroom and cigarette breaks are unlimited if the store is slow fun people to work with most people pull there own weight some people need help as they don't know anything about cars.
good,"Working for AutoZone was a good job. It was a fast paced environment and usually kept busy. "
good,Great place to work at and great work balance and great bosses. I'm really gonna miss that place. Great benefits and schedule. What a great place to work.
good,"Very stressful, salary not accurate for the management positions. Very long hours no compensation. Upper management does not take care of their employees."
good,"poor management"
good,"Feedback is ignored and don’t have good dispatcher, "
good,I was pleased to work there when I first got hired. Then I realize it wasn't a place that I would not retire at. Man driven company but overall the pay was great.
good,"Funfilled work environment, management helped you excel at every level and encouraged you to further your education and job skills. The pay was okay and so on."
good,Many customers were mean and stole and retaliated toward staff by calling corporate and complaining about bad service. Work was busy and cut-throat and customers were very demanding. Management changed constantly and the change of staff seemed due to high turnover rate.
good,Always a positive setting to be apart of. Always face pace and learning new things to help better me and moving up to a better position. While working at this company I have learned so many things to apply to better adventures.
good,"It was a fun workplace to work at and enjoyed the time I was there. I went to advance, because I got a full time management position. AutoZone was my first job and would have stayed there if they paid more"
good,"Sacar reportes y discutirlos con equipo"
good,"The day starts out slow , then it picks up once the truck gets to the store.moving pallets breaking down the diffrent items that come in.helping out the guest when they neded the help, looking up parts."
good,"autozone is decent job "
good,A typical day at work was pretty much answering the calls from all of the nearest shops and help them to find the part they needed. After the part was founded I also had to drive in order to deliver the part.
good,"Good springboard starting company."
good,"The particular store I worked at was a fairly slow store, where most of the customers are regulars. The pay is far from great for those coming in for sales positions or even sales managers. To make real money at Auto Zone you have to be a part of the corporate team or become a store manager where there is opportunities for bonus checks as well as Salary pay. I recommend this place for young adults looking for a part time job while they go to college or for someone looking for a part time second job."
good,It was new and refreshing. I learned a lot information about cars and how to fix them. It was my will to want to learn. The customers were friendly and did not mind my lack of knowledge in the early stages. I asked a lot of questions to help me understand what my customers needed.
good,Autozone on a typical work day is really easy. The main part for working here is listen to customers and help fix cars. The hard days consisted of unloading the truck.
good,loved the driving  heated the sealing  the stocking a the coustodial work  lol lol lol lol  cant an on take a joke thes days im only doing this because its making me
good,"Although the work intensity wasn't always that bad, the management changes and short staffing made working there difficult and contained lost of uncertainty"
good,Overall it is a fast pace work area but you do have support with management. Though training for mangers can be better when being promoted since it feels hands on learning instead of a common guide.
good,"Busy, depending on where you worked at. You can move up to management pretty easily but it is a lot of work and responsibility for what you are getting paid for"
good,"You are under paid for what they need you to do. Guys get paid way more then the girls do also move up the corporate ladder faster then girls. Same goes for the raise every year! If you are pt. You get no over time and have to work holidays with no time and a 1/2 only managers get paid vacation,over time pay and time and a 1/2 pay. Managers just sit in the back on there phones. Or go out for a “run” return hours later. Then yell at the usually 2-3 csr in the fron as to why there is a line. If you are lucky you will get a manager that will work with your schedule."
good,"The work is their, must want to make it happen and be productive at all times. Must be able to reach accuracy goals as well and be safe on a daily basis."
good,"Upper Management cares a little to much about profits and not enough about the people that are most loyal to the company.  "
good,"Auto Zone is an ok company to work for, they will hire anyone who can walk through the door and can pass the background check. There are no raises or benefits."
good,"A typical day is dealing with the public who needs auto parts for DIY projects. I have learned alot about automotive parts and how they work. They is not confidential environment at my location. The hardest part of the job, helping consumers who has no idea about their own vehicle. I enjoy working with public and working people."
good,Great time there. Great people. Had a great experience. If you love Do-It-Yourself work on your vehicle then this is the place for you. You have the opportunity to meet different people and work with them as well.
good,"Very little opportunity for advancement, low pay.  No opportunity for raises.  Management does not care about low pay.  Impossible to support a family on the wages that AutoZone pays.  Benefits are poor and hard to get.  Being part time they work you up to 32 hours a week but provide no benefits.  Manager tries hard but has little training in how to properly handle his employees."
good,I was a great worker being promoted from parts to commercial parts. Management changed I saw different people getting fired or quitting then management doesn’t hire from within they go to O’Reilly management team. They weren’t very good or adapted to our culture.
good,Autozone does send you to classes to better your knowledge that can allow you advance if opportunity presents it's self. If you are interested in cars this is a good place that allows you to learn about them.
good,It was a great experience working for a corporation. Providing customer service for nine years teaches alot about other point of views. Management skills and training were challanging skills but very helpfull.
good,"Autozone had low pay and little room for advancement , minimal benefits and promised me a job in store and failed to provide me with it. i wouldn't recommend anyone to apply."
good,"it was a pretty good place to work, however you are often shorthanded and that alone makes things tough.  You are often left in the store alone while the other person is installing a battery, bulb etc."
good,"A great place to work if you enjoy working on vehicles and helping customers maintain their cars, also an awesome place to learn so much about vehicles."
good,"a typical day is different each and every day, some days you will be inside buidling displays and helping customers other days you can be outside installing batteries and light bulbs all day"
good,"AutoZone  is a entry level job that any high school student can obtain, no experience with cars or auto parts needed, there is no opportunity for raises or advancement."
good,"It's a fairly decent job. It's pretty patterned, making it easy to get used to. The big drawbacks are promotions, there's got to be an opening that hopefully doesn't get filled by someone outside the store, and then the raises that come annually."
good,A great job to have if you want to learn and gain experience with automobiles in and outside. There is times when business is running slow but when it gets busy you will need to increase your pace to maintain customer satisfaction.
good,Make sure if u have a back round u have back saying ur allowed to put (no)ur not felon cause u passed ur 710 probation with a100%satifaction to keep there job
good,"Maintained parts Inventory, assisted with merchandise returns and monitored loss prevention.  Assisted customers with questions and concerns regarding auto repairs.  Handled incoming calls from potential customers"
good,"The company promotes from within and pays better than most of the other auto parts retailers, but you live and die by the report information that is to specified most of the time"
good,I dislike it very much because the high management is very bias. You have to make them your friend in order to get the day of that you requested. They don't teach very much.
good,Not really a team oriented environment. Not a pleasant place to work. No assistance when requested. No proper training of employees. Very stressful. Not a very pleasant experience or fun environment to work in.
good,"I think everyone would like to know a little bit about cars, this would be a good start. It's an interesting place to work. The isn't pay is reasonable for the work and you get a chance to learn."
good,I assist customers for most of the day with finding the right car parts for their vehicles. I also take on some managerial duties as I am in training for that position. I learned more than my fair share about car maintenance and different part and their functions. Management is a could be more solid in my opinion but we are still number one in sales for our district. The work place culture seem mostly non existent but it doesn't take away from general progress. the hardest part of the job is knowing and understanding the operation of car parts having never been a mechanic of any sort. The best part of the job my co workers and customers.
good,It was nice being able to talk about cars and car parts but sometimes it'd get frustrating trying to sell parts because we'd be short staffed on the weekends and didn't have enough people to preform daily tasks.
good,I enjoyed working there because I like working on vehicles and the discount on parts was a plus.......................................................
good,I drove parts to automotive shops. The manager were very nice and helpful. The work is pretty easy for some people. I liked helping people find what they needed.
good,MicroManaged. Only care about pushing items regardless if the customer has been in multiple times per day. Under staffing is an understatement to say the least.
good,"I enjoy working at autozone great knowledge comes with this job as well as exercise. However I injure my self alot and being a woman i injured myself in ways the men couldn't, the job takes a tole on your body."
good,I had to come in clean the store. Help anybody find things in the store. it an easy day nothing to hard about this job or the people who work there. easy
good,The job was not bad as a Hub driver until summer lots of rotors. Same with picking and Inventory lots of freedom with inventory management. Would go back but lots of rotors = hurting back. Low pay and workers come and go alot.  Managers are dumb
good,THis is a part time position that i would tell everyone that is unable to get a job to apply for autozone. Pay is decent and workers are fair and kinda of friendly.
good,"I did enjoy this job, but if I were to be perfectly honest, the management has some issues that need to be addressed. The one largest problem was the constant shift changing, on a daily basis at some points, and never the same schedule from week to week."
good,I don't remember much about AutoZone because it has been over 14 years since I worked there. It was a decent place to start out in the parts sales industry. There were some really good benefits such as company match 401k and training programs to help people advance their careers.
good,its an okay place to work for . manager not greatest employees can not be best some times customers are good to get along with. some days can be the best ever other days make you wonder why you work her
good,A typical at the stores I worked was very fast paced. I learned additional information about the auto parts business. The hardest part of the job was working with limited help.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting people, and making new friends, and begin a driver you are in and out all day making delivery's, The hardest part of my job was lifting very heavy parts, like barriers, rotters, trying to get a engine in the back of the truck. I just need a full time job. My mom lives with me know and I promised my Dad I would take care of her.And I can't do that working part time and to financially take care of us."
good,"Is a good place to work but the salaries are not enough, and sometimes you see a lot of irregulars that is not fear for the employee. the only good thins is you know people that work hard."
good,"I was told that I could have full time work when I started. after a few weeks of me not getting FT work, I asked my manager, and I was told unless youre management, which would take a good while to be, I wouldn't ever see 40hrs a week. I didn't like being lied to so shortly there after I quit and moved on"
good,Management would advise myself and other employees to do a certain procedure only one way whereas they would not follow any of the official guidelines.
good,"Most days are predictable, if it is a truck day, unloading truck and stocking shelves will be your main focus, if its not a truck day, they usually will have you doing planograms. AutoZone seems to have the same problems as any other place, as far as store management and upper management goes, where it feels like no ones cares about the regular employees. For the most part the work place is good, usually tends to be upbeat. The hardest part of the job, for me, was the customers. You will get customers that just ruined their day because something on their car is broken, and they will come in a treat you like its your fault. Its just part of the job."
good,AZ does not pay their employees much more than minimum wage. Unless you are in a store that offers commercial sales they don't want to pay a decent salary for trained personnel.
good,Great job if you were actually paid for your work. Keep you at part time so you don't get full time benefits. Say your getting your own store yet ypu cover and fix the problem stores for them.
good,"i worked for auto zone for 7 years, good pay, good advancement, good management,wish i could of stayed but i had a different calling in my life they required me to leave."
good,"It was a fun job to have to learn about cars and how they work, but this was a very fast-paced job at times and could get stressful very quickly. It is definitely not for everyone."
good,not bad but they should treat there employs better red shirt dont get paid good for all the stuff you have to do i like it because your learn about part
good,This company is very good but they cant seem to keep many employees because they treat them with disrespect and they don't know how to make sure they are taken care of .
good,"Working for Auto Zone on a typical day was making sure that our customers got the right parts, The management was really good and informational. It was a pretty fast paced company."
good,I have no complaints other than the pay is too low.  I made 9.85 and hour.  Not really a wage to live on if you have a family.  It's a good job for part-times or 2nd job holders.
good,"Fun Envi, Great Team Players. Low Salary. I Was able To better Understand How Vehicles Work. I really enjoyed being ale to do small maintenance on certain cars."
good,"Easy pace"
good,"Auto Zone was a great place but pay wasn't very great for a big family. Although it was an average place, customers and team were very helpful in knowledge about vehicles and friendly."
good,"Without the support of my fellow co workers, things could have been worse as my experience went. We had a great core group of people, but because of upper management's poor leadership skills good employees were forced to leave or quit due to conditions."
good,Company likes to relocate employees when locations are shorthanded.If volunteering to work extra hours they may stick. Was personally changed to full time without my discretion or decision on the manner.
good,"My experience  at Auto Zone was great, I had amazing co workers and the work was fast paced and kept me busy and on my feet. It was also very competitive."
good,being a manager requires a lot of working hours. i have a family now and i do not want to be working nonstop. i enjoy to help customers and talk with them but it is always busy.
good,"great place to work , management was ok hard working place to work for always busy but I like the fast pace jobs so I never had a problem with working there"
good,It’s a ok job just don’t pay as much as you think but over all it’s. Good job just don’t pay much management was god just if u looking for a low paying job it’s for you
good,Autozone is a good place to work for temporary time. They have flexible schedule hours and most managers are very understanding. It was fun while I was there.
good,"ok place to work for anyone wanting to advance, diversityis a plus easy job for students as well.that is I wish to say.this is to be continued, thanks"
good,I was working at Auto Zone part time to supplement my current full time job at Murphy Security.  I recently left to spend more time with my young children.  I've enjoyed working with staff and interacting with customers.  I've learned supervising techniques as a (Staff Manager) while gaining confidence in discliping others in a male dominent profession.  In both jobs I'm considered to be a hard working and very confident in my job performance.
good,Crew was easy to work with from the first day I started they made you feel like you had worked with them for years never had a problem  working there.
good,in this company you get the opportunity to gain the different knowledge of vehicle parts and also the opportunity to interact with customers regarding their needs. this job is also very hands on.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo te enseñan a usar los montscargas y no se separan de ti hasta que sepas usar tus heramientas
good,"Always changing, goals and focuses. Very sales orientated. Never a set schedule. May have to work 16 hour days as a Store Manager if you have call outs. Your days off are not your own."
good,I worked part-time most of the people I worked with are good they are helpful fast pace job you meet a lot of different people some nice customers the store manager was ok
good,"Understaffed majority of the time.Company requires certain tasks to be completed,however its near impossible sometimes due to an understaffing condition."
good,"A typical work day is very stressful, you have a lot on your plate. I actually learned a lot, I had to, but I am fast learner, so it didn't take much for me to catch on. My manager was amazing. She has a lot of patience and she teaches really well. As for the store manager, well, he could use some people skills. Workplace culture was alright, could use some improvement, but overall it was good. The hardest part about the job is working with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning all the different parts."
good,Working at Auto Zone was relaxed and a fun place to work.  Worked as a team and the people were nice to work with.  We all worked well together which made it enjoyable.
good,I will leave this job can be very stressful they were Q 10 hours a day they want you to finish everything in a timely manner if not you get fired you can get fired very easy with this job
good,nice place to work  customer base is awesome  management in my locaction  lacked a lot  no imput to staff no advancements or training offered to advance  new store new location needs improvements threw out...........
good,excelente trabajo pero el gerente de piso pesimo no sabe oir solo quiere gritarle al personal es muy prepotente
good,Positive Co-Workers. With this job customer service is important. You deal with a lot of upset customers. Must multi-task. Phone/Computer/ along with in-store customers.
good,"Wish I could go full time and I would never leave,  They need to evlate the employees that they still have wright in the store that should not be working just hold up the hours for the good people."
good,I liked working at autozone.  I always had something to keep me busy.  I did not like the fact that other employees would not put in the same work ethic as me.  I also had low pay.
good,A women in a man's world. You have to be able to handle someone not thinking you could do certain things just because you are a female. I did enjoy learning more things about cars. I got hired on as a manager.
good,"Typically it is a fast paced place to work, with minimal help. The work is fun and easy. Very competitive place to work and relaxed as well. You learn a lot about the automotive industry."
good,in my 3 years with autozone ive enjoyed my time there but do to the low hourly pay ive decided to move on the task they have me preform are not worth the pay and for me it is time to move on
good,"Busy work environment"
good,It's a fun and relax atmosphere. You are constantly learning new things.  Finding ways to fix cars and what part they need for their vehicles. I love driving and interacting with my customers everyday
good,"Its a fun place to work and you meet a lot of great people and learn lots of new things about cars every day. Its very male oriented so its a bit tuff for girls or women, but if you have tuff skin you sure will learn to grow it there! there lots of pressure to sale certain items and sometimes there are issues with the way girls are treated there by employees as well as customers."
good,"I would have to say from my experience that working here was a little bit of a challenge, even though they arent exactly busy all the time they are not very efficient about getting there trucks back quickly. They are also not very nice to there security guards because when we just go with what usually happens they will call and berate us for doing something they didnt like. I would have to say that it was a difficult time for me to stay there because I was having a hard time as supervisor keeping reliable employees on my team so I would have to pick up the slack working 16 hours days and that was not what I signed up for."
good,Just help out customers with certain parts they need to locate for their auto jobs they have going on. Delivery was pretty simple and stress free almost. Really enjoyed just crusing around town and dropping off the ordered equipment to various vendors.
good,not too bad of a place to work for. decent hours and pay. plenty of locations and never going out of business. i wouldn't mind working there again if they let me
good,"delegate duties, advise public of repairs required, reset planograms, customer service, deliver parts, train new associates, coach existing staff, and secure company assets"
good,"I have enjoyed my time at AutoZone.  After leaving the military this was a job that provided me with the hours to attend college full-time. AutoZone has enhanced my management and organization skills, I am better able to prioritize my responsibilities as a manager and as a co-worker."
good,if you're into cars then this job will be simple to you but if you have no knowledge of vehicles then it will be difficult at first.  the hours are flexible if you let them know ahead of time.
good,Most of the job involves stocking shelves like any other retail store. They will train you to find correct parts for customers and answer questions even if you're not experienced in auto mechanics.
good,"Good franchise company to work for, available to relocate with company and great opportunity to grow, excellent atmosphere and good benefits. Several locations."
good,"All together it was just a slow pased environment  , lack of keeping up with hourly pay , sometimes didn't get paid at all. Employee's would leave food laying around."
good,"A typical day at AutoZone for a Hub driver is go go go, verify then verify again, load the van, verify one more time then run a good safe route. I learned how to transfer parts using a RF scanner. Level headed management and a mixed culture with gear heads, signal mothers and fathers, retired military, and people just trying to make ends meet. The hardest part of the job was the high level of efficiency. Driving and interacting with management and customers from different AutoZone locations around North Alabama was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Don't need to know much, anyone can learn. Management is tough on other management which trickles down to the red shirt employees. Part time job so can't complain."
good,People at Auto Zone only cares about selling whether the customers need it or not plus their management wasn't good at all. If you didn't selling what was on sell they would yell at you.
good,"Love helping others,just didn't get paid well ,and no signs of full time.Which really what was needed for my family and I.Co workers were very nice but I guess cause they were full time employees."
good,autozone is a good place to work. i would reccomend this job to someone looking for a job in a part store. i would reccomend this job again and again and again
good,"fast paced, customer oriented. must help with all aspects of car repair and parts aqusition. need for fasted simpler check out at registers is needed here."
good,"Fast paced environment, most co-workers were more like family than co-workers. enjoyed getting to know commercial customers, they became more like family than just another customer with a dollar."
good,"I worked here upgrading my computer skills, learned how to set up planograms, install batteries, replacing lights for cars, stock and receive shipments correctly."
good,"Autozone is a great place to get some Management experience under your belt, but has limited opportunities to advance in the company. Also there is no opportunity to advance inpay"
good,"Positive upbeat place to work, with lots of room for advancement. I enjoyed learning and strengthening my manager and relationship skills with this company."
good,"Could be a great place to work, they pay very well. Politics and very poor management by some DM's can ruin a district. I met some great people along the way, but also ran into some crooked ones. I experienced 2 DM's. One was great to work for and the other turned the store upside down."
good,"Not much to say really, not great wages, but it was ok, it was a great position if you liked driving but not so much in the winter as the cars were little and did not handle well in the snow!"
good,a typical day at auto zone would be servicing customers cars and processing customer orders.product knowledge is helpful when dealing with customers. If i needed to recall a part they also had refrences in store as well as in the auto zone system.
good,It was a god place for a short time. There was favoritism. Short staffed so hard to have adequate coverage most of the time. It served my short term need for a second job
good,"Upon employment I Wasn't properly trained to handle daily work activities. Some of these activities include replacing car batteries, installing windshield wipers, and replacing car light bulbs. I basic taught myself the required skills on my own time."
good,"I enjoyed working for autozone, it was a great fast pace environment . My strongest issue is that the last store I was at was ran absolutely with 100 percent incompetence. Money was missing from the drawers, people showed up when they felt like it and inventory was missing which led to sending 30 percent of our customers to another location which was unacceptable. I notified upper management but nothing was ever done. As I mentioned before, I enjoyed working for the company but due to the circumstance I had to leave because I refuse to allow my name to be associated with a location that does things incorrectly."
good,This is a great job if you are automotively inclined or just know basics. It will teach you a lot to get the ball rolling and let you learn more as you progress each day and how things work.
good,"the culture is ok, the management was ok, no job security, they do promote you, good work environment great benefits the work is not hard, no commission"
good,"The hardest part of the job was really nothing. Its fun easy and goes by fast with the crew. I enjoyed working at Autozone. Not only for a paycheck but I was actually learning more and more everyday. I learned about cars and their parts I have also brushed up on my espanol. Considering that the latino community was the majority of the customers, I made sure to make them feel as comfortable as possible. Management was ok. He was young an immature so the store was kind of a disaster."
good,It's a ok place to work the manager I have is pretty cool and believes in family so getting time off is not a big deal . Paid vacation after a year of working full time. Benefits are offered to the full timers. Can also invest in stock in the company . Many perks for full timers.
good,"I enjoyed being an employee for this company but I did not enjoy the geographical area that I was working in. It is hard to transfer out but I didn't seem worth the hassel,"
good,You are always learning something new being in retail. Providing great customer service is one of our biggest contributions. Get the customers what they need to get the job done was our reward.
good,Over my 12 1/2 years at my current job. I have learned to  take ownership of my own personal development . I have learned to deal with uncomfortable situations. Also to be a leader and encourage others . No matter what position I may end up in I will give it my all to exceed any expectations.
good,Autozone is a great first job. You learn a lot about cars and get to gain customer service experience. Management sucks because they treat their employees bad because of their higher status. Closing tasks are also a pain and lasts a long time.
good,AutoZone  is a good job for people they are going to school.  They did you the work experince took on the customer  Experience with customers Work as a  Team.
good,"Flexible hours if part time Good for management experience without too much responsibility"
good,your typical day in AutoZone can be determine by the day off the week it falls under. most days are smooth if you have a fullhouse. time frame is unpredictable but should have more autozoners in store at night times.
good,"Autozone is a good part time to work at if you are single and have not kids. I felt like the hours were crazy sometimes. The job was good, as long as you gave great customer service."
good,Just about everything you could expect from a retail job. Not a whole lot more one once say but definitely one of the better retail experiences I've had.
good,"in a tipical days work depends on the route assighned. short toutes were frustrating while long routes were joyous and easily managable. was fun serving  a variety of customers with varied backgrounds,"
good,"It wasn't the best job, but it wasn't a hard job at all. I think one of the reasons I didn't like it was because of how boring it can get. Obviously some people would disagree and like that. I personally like to stay busy."
good,"You can advance and move up in the company but they still don't pay well. Has a great family feel, but there is a lot of pressure to hit numbers and add ons."
good,Not a bad company.I did a lot with helping customers and making sure parts were right. Kept track of the register to maintain the income for the day and to make sure nobody was stealing
good,As in all retail jobs Auto Zone is very goal and numbers driven. I enjoyed the customers and helping them solve their problems. There were a lot of different management styles I encountered while working there some were very good and some were not all and all I enjoyed my time working there. I think that a lot of times the Stores are understaffed placing unnecessary stress on the store staff.
good,Need easier advancement opportunities for local teams.  More incentive at the store level.  The work day goes by fast.  overall not a bad place to start your career.
good,Value your employees more and promote within. Offer more full time positions with benefits. Be fully honest with when hiring an employee. Give employees more uniform shirts.
good,"If all you are looking for is a part-time job, this could be the ticket.  However, career advancement is slow and the pay is low.  The culture is good.  can be a fun place to work if you like helping customers with DIY automotive projects."
good,salary could be a little bit more but other than you learn many things. the manager that I had is the best one that depends on what manager you could step with your job will be awesome
good,the job is basically a man job because the men try to flirt with girls sometimes make it seem like you dont know your job. if you can deal with aggressive man then go for but i couldnt
good,"it was an okay job, the pay sucked, the management sucked. No room to move up.  There was many mangers that sat around not doing anything. I did management jobs, but couldn't move up for some reason. I tried to show I was a team player and worked hard but still no advancement."
good,The hardest part to my job was that I was required to do inventory with the rest of the store when it was time.  You get to learn about your local shop owners and their mechanics.  Best thing about this job was the driving around part listening to music.
good,this is ridiculous...i now know I can spell ridiculous very well I hope this is the last of this because I will just leave the sight...to be FORCED to do this RIDICULOUS!!!!!!
good,"custoemr service and sales supervisios, sales plans implemented. autozone is all about customer service and a great customer experience. great managment."
good,"Good customer service but too much corporation promotion of additional buys at the register. Semiannual reviews are appreciated, although constant annual profits were never good enough."
good,we went through so many employees but I did enjoy working there I learned a lot about the auto industry the hours were long because people always called in sick or quit
good,it typical day of work would be clocking in. Making sure products are stocked. I learned about different types of vehicles. management was pretty fine with they work.
good,"Our culture evolves around treating every individual as your only customer.  A customer can be a fellow employer, a person walking into a store, or any person who requires some kind of assistance.  It is our goal to satisfy every customer every time.  Therefore, we practice going the extra mile to solve their issue or assist them with what they need and when they need it."
good,This is a good starter job and can be a good career in the management area but just a good customer service position otherwise. Your pay is ok and the hours are flexible.
good,Good place to work unless you have bad management. Do not call HR on anyone they will drive you into the ground. Promise you this and that and never deliver. BAD MANAGEMENT!!
good,things are fair. Decent job. Work life balance so so but you deal. Room for advancement . Quick paced and but typically decent job. Other than that not to much.
good,Good company. I was stupid and left for a better job which wasnt better. I learned that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Hardest part was trying to teach someone something that they just were to stubborn to learn the right way.
good,management didn't really know what they were doing lack of infrastructure in management. pay wasn't that great more for high school kids looking for a part time job.
good,"Autozone is a good company that can use improvement organizing. Computer system can use an update, Associates needs more training. Nice company though"
good,Things could have been better with Autozone being a fortune 200 company the pay should be hire for its lower level employees. Hopefully they continue to try and make things fair for everyone
good,cool job to work at if you like cars. it is fun if you have cool co workers. the pay sucks. you get 50 cent raise a year. if you really want to move up and get a better raise you literally have to suck up to the district manager. even then they won't do anything about it.
good,"Had an interesting training, but after that the managers as for too much.They cut hours, and then customers wait in line for half an hour because there aren't any cashiers"
good,"did work that was outside my job description, taking on tasks from a management position. did not get a raise once my hole year and a half working here."
good,upper management is not for other employees use this job as a resume filler for next job. would not recommend making a career out of this place. power trips
good,i would take orders on the phone for customers take orders to customers drive to there company and drop there parts off and collect money from them and at the store I would put parts in place
good,"Autozone was a pretty relaxed job. While I was there I enjoyed helping customers install there batteries, test their batteries, starters and alternators, light bulbs, free-on... I also learned a few things on how to work on cars. I think this could be a good career for someone who loves to provide customer service and plenty more opportunities in that field. I think you can also get training on ASE certification with time. Not a bad deal.. :)"
good,The location I worked for was a great place.  The store manager was a great guy and did everything he could to help his employees. I loved being a part of this team and it was unfortunate that I had to leave.
good,"This is a great job to start with and make a career of, if you are in the parts industary already. Howver, it is very fast paced, and on job teaching isn't fully given. Its more a learn by mistake"
good,"Work at the Zone is constant and your level of customer service has to be effective. In this business the only difference between you and the competition is your interaction with the customer. Transferring that concept through training and development is the hardest part of the job. The best part of the job is building and developing trust with your employees and counterparts in such a way that the ultimate goal is met, which is not only to meet, but exceed all expectations set each day."
good,"AutoZone, is a pretty nice place, to work for. I would stay there, if I was Guarrantied, at least, 35 hrs, a week. Currently, not the case, and, bills will not be able to get paid."
good,"Fast Paced, Became a Parts Pro with continued training.  Hardest part of the job trying to complete a project while servicing customers at the same time."
good,Worked there for 2+ years it had its good times and bad times working the truck sucked because I'd be there til about 12 or 1 in the morning then have to open at 7:30 the next morning which sucked
good,Once you reach a store manager position it is like you plateau and it can take either a decade more of experience or returning to school for more knowledge in order to take that next step. And over course they only do school tuition assistance for positions higher than store manager because they want a contract signed to prove you knowledge will only be used for them before they will assist you will getting more education.
good,Good company to work for if you're coming out of high school didn't go to college looking again opportunity in a company to grow fast self-driven who are motivated will go far in the company
good,I started working here in my late teens and early 20's. Looked for better jobs as soon as I got the opportunity. Not great pay and low to minimal benefits. Would recommend this place if you like or enjoy vehicles only.
good,"Days are all spent dealing with customers. Giving automotive advice and upselling products that may or may not be useful to customers."
good,"I really loved the job, looking up parts and selling them to customers, providing excellent customer service to the walk-in customers, as well as the phone customers. "
good,"followed all company policies. in charge of inventory. did daily cycle counts. supervised 10 employees. handled all returns. handled all customer complaints , serviced customers."
good,You are being micro managed all the time on sells and you have to push certain products. Its a great job if you are going to school but not if you need to make a living.
good,"The only thing that kept me working for auto zone was my fellow employees and my passion for vehicles. other than that the whole upper managment doesnt care about their employees, and its all about who you kiss up to"
good,Decent hours but over excessive and over demanding work for part-time retail. I did not get promoted for the four plus years I worked there and the management is cruel and biased. I would seek work elsewhere since the I worked at cruel and unfair to me.
good,Its was not a bad place to work. You go in you go to work on time. I would recommend to someone who needs a job.  They are quick at hiring so you don't have to wait long.
good,Good environment place to work u learn so much working with the individuals in the warehouse and learn more than jus what ur working for like car things
good,Pretty cool place to work. It's a lot of hard work. I was not a stoking person and most of the time in the store that is what you do. My father has been with the company for over 30 years so it has been a great place for my life.
good,I liked the job. Didn't pay nearly enough for all the stuff you had to do though. Raises are ridiculous. I got almost the best review you can get and got 26 cents. That is pitiful for a billion dollar company.
good,"Their good, good customer service. Wish they would include more benefits. a con would be low pay and being over worked, and few hours. Overall it a decent place to work at if you're looking for a little bit of extra cash."
good,I worked there twice part time just to supplement my income. it was a retail job in automotive which I enjoyed because I liked working on cars. I created my own clientele
good,"Tienen muchas politicas establecidas pero son saltadas constantemente para complacer a unos cuentos o algun jefe. Las promociones no son valoradas equitativamente o con un criterio establecido y solo se basan en opiniones."
good,"The company as whole is a great company to work for. The people come there a lot because they know that we are going the extra mile to help. However, some managers do not know how to do their job properly. Maybe because they weren't taught, I don't know. Best part of the job is the customers."
good,Employees require no knowledge of automotive parts or operation. Employees aren't held responsible for mistakes or tardiness. Good job for those with some automotive knowledge that don't mind retail
good,Its all about who you know at autozone. Friend with a manager? Friend with a district manager? Well lets move you right on up the ladder. Its the only way to make any money unless you want to be a lifer and wait for your annual .06 cents raise.
good,Outstanding customer service and general knowledge of cars helps alot. I started at autozone with basic knowledge of automobiles. i have since learned so much more and advanced in my position there since starting.
good,"Seeking a position with growth potential for opportunities to maximize my existing skills and knowledges, while providing new challenges and learning experience for personal growth, added skill sets experiences and capabilities."
good,"the people i worked with was cool. our district manager was a pratt as well as the corporate wannabes above him. Hours were scarce and the pay wasn't worth it by any means. if you're absolutely desperate for a job, give it a shot. if you have choices, choose the other one."
good,"This company provided good experience for me to learn about how cars operate and the requirements to keep them running. You acquire some expertise about car maintenance. Also gained experience on running a business. However, you were on your own because senior management didn't provide all the tools to ensure you would be successful. Managers didn't get suitable training to promote lasting careers."
good,Bring products to designated locations. Take unloaded products to where they go. Pick orders for different stores. Make sure all products are where they assigned to.
good,"You will get paid pretty poorly but will learn alot and get a discount. People will want you to diagnose their cars and fix it for free. Freight day is rough, sometimes have to unload and shelf up to 100 car batteries."
good,The management could definitely use more training. They're over worked for such little bit of money. The hours are long and the employees don't get a lot of lunch breaks or breaks in general.
good,"Auto Zone is a highly competitive auto parts company that has good philosophies on helping the customer, but needs better training of employees to better serve the customer needs."
good,"Customers could be hard to deal with at times, they would come in mad and by the time they left they had a smile on their face. i learned a lot of customer service skills. I would say the hardest part of this job was the Manager at the time."
good,"Pay isn't good, not many hours. I loved the people I worked with and customers were awesome. There point policy sucks though and in my opinion is quite useless."
good,You have to be hard working dependable honest caring fast learner. You get a lot of training in parts knowledge. You always want to give your best and reach the management position is the only way to get full time in Auto Zone. Auto Zone haves a strong culture and the diversity is very important. The hardest part is to put away merchandise while still taking care of customers. The enjoyable part is working as a team.
good,"If you enjoy working on cars and cars in general then this could be a good starting point job for you. It is a typical job, stocking shelves, running the cash register and answering customer phone calls."
good,Huge amount of time must be invested to get to a location to make enough money to support a family besides that it is a good place to work for a part time job.
good,"its a great and stable place to start a career, but considering they don't offer many a real full time position, its aimed towards the young part timer. the income is laughable at best. i did learn ALLOT."
good,Autozone was a great place to work.  The only thing is they had so much to get done and space was limited.  This means there would be so many people in one isle doing different tasks at the same time that safety would be and issue because we are all on heavy duty equipment.
good,Always busy made time go buy.  Some daily tasks became dreadful but helping customers was usually satisfying.  supervisor could be somewhat demanding and had their favorites.
good,"Typical day at work . Is to make sure the store looked presentable , for our customers . My most enjoyable part of my job was ,helping people . Our work culture was laid back fun and friendly ."
good,Some times very hard but enjoyable. Learning is last but not least. Not that much good but adjustable. Vary according to the person. Nothing hardest & nothing enjoyable.
good,"AutoZone es una buena empresa para trabajar aunque del lado conservador en cuanto a las prestaciones y beneficios se refiere. También hay oportunidad de mejorar los planes de desarrollo del personal y definir bien el crecimiento de los departamentos a mediano y largo plazo- han realizado despidos por reestructura en los últimos 2 años. Salvo en algunas áreas de finanzas, son respetuosos de las jornadas laborales en la mayoría de los departamentos y su cultura y valores permiten que exista buen compañerismo y se tenga un buen ambiente laboral."
good,"Good job until a new manager. The new manager was not qualified to be a manager. People who had worked there for years, quite because of her unskilled approach."
good,If it wasn't for the under pay I would not consider leaving...  However I enjoy working at Autozone - it is more of a hobby for me - this is why I have not left.  the staff and job is awesome.
good,Provided customer service and sold car parts to the local businesses and common people. the hours was ok but they start everyone off part time. It worked ut for me for a while
good,"Learning about cars was the main objective into joining AutoZone. While working with AutoZone, I have gained more than I was asking for. Especially dealing with customers, explaining products, diagnosing cars issues, also working as a cashier, there were multiple sales goals on daily basis that we had to meet. Away from at end of each day i reconciled the register and tracked the inventory on hand."
good,It was ok I liked it sometimes. Sometimes it was stressful. Sometimes it was fun. Sometimes we had way too much work to finish in one shift and we would get in trouble for not being able to finish.
good,"Day started at 8 except for special projects and inventories,  Sometimes at the level of Regional Managers they tend to create there on world consisting of busy work and non endorsed company reports."
good,"I traveled the EC to maintain 48 stores from HVAC, painting, electrical, ect. It really gets hard because I missed out on my kids games at school, and so much more because I lived on the road all the time."
good,"Good people and strong company."
good,"The job provides employees with a decent set of skills that can help them in future job opportunities. But, depending on your manager, life  balance is pretty low because there is no real set schedule."
good,Depending on what you do it could be  a hard day at work. I have learned all the skills I need to move on to something better. The management is ok used to be a lot better. Doesn't not follow the corporate structure in advancing employees to higher or different position. Your time and skills does not matter. People are hand picked.
good,it was ok. customers were great. management in my store not so much. i probably would have stayed had i went to a different store with different team.
good,It is a great place to work if you love cars. it is retail so balancing work and a personal life is difficult at times but i learned a lot from the company and enjoyed my experience
good,Learned a lot about cars from other employees. head bosses of the company was more then willing to come into the store and help with questions and always were open to listening to employees on changes.
good,"Great place to work at if your planning on going to school and work at the same time. Safe working environment, loved helping customers with their car problems."
good,"I would help and refer customers to different parts and equipment that would help the customers with their vehicles. I also did inventory for things in the store, but I majority did inventory for car parts. Also, when customers had questions about there cars, I would help them find solutions. The hardest part of the job was rude customers."
good,"Explaining my knowledge on automobiles and auto parts to customers. I love working on cars, going the extra mile meaning helping customers put purchased parts on vehicles such as battries, wipers, lights, diagnostics etc.."
good,Cool place to work you will run into all kind of people working there some a little funny or whacky but you can benefit and move up the ladder plenty room for advancement.
good,My typical day consists of helping open the store and then getting started contacting my commercial customers to start the day.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with low numbers for the day when I know they should be higher.
good,This place is not a bad place to work. Payment leaves little to be desired. My managers were nice and my fellow acquaintances were nice. Just dealing with the public of course you are going to have some problems on a day to day basis.
good,Petty cash and in and outgoing of orders . phoning for outstanding orders . was over cashers had to check floats and . front of shop checking desplay . do tills when some one off sick in tzaneen work in despatch in and out going of stock and deivers and to bin stock stock taking
good,"Solid company, days can be very busy, co workers are great, focused on moving stores forward, on the job training with very little formal training provided to roles outside of stores."
good,"Friendly staff doesn't make up for lack of pay. Healthcare is expensive. Most of the people I work with are great. A typical day starts with pulling overstock, and immediately into helping customers. They want us changing batteries, wipers, headlights in most weather conditions. They want us to up-sell but offer no incentives such as commission or bonus pay for meeting or exceeding goals, until you become store manager, commercial manager, or higher. We handle sulphuric acid spills, oil spills, other chemical spills and are still offered low pay. We get annual raises but every year it's always poor. The most I've received was 1.50 after being promoted. The turnover rate has mostly been due to pay."
good,"Great company for employment, with great customers. If you have a passion into automobile this is the perfect job. The company has products and merchandise for various automobile."
good,"They are cutting down on hours in Puerto Rico , not enough room to move up probably do to bad economy. Employees were a pleasure to work with but there is pressure to sell more."
good,ok job not that grand long hours not very employee friendly does not like to work with employees when they need time off. way too paranoid about theft by employees
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers, and they scheduled me as much as they could, working around my school hours. I learned a lot about cars and I was able to meet and help lots of people."
good,Hours are scattered throughout the work week.  Some days opening to closing.  Some days a half of day.  Management plays favorites.  Hourly wages start low and do not increase very much.
good,I liked the place but I felt like I wasn't treated the best at times. I liked it a lot but didn't work out. Although I would recommend my family and friends to work there.
good,"Good place to work, but don't make a career of it.  Like always when working with the public be ready for anything.  Overall a pretty okay place to work."
good,This is fine as a job while going to school or gaining experience but it is not a career path. Pay is not great and hours are always changing because of the high turnover.
good,"Great job if you're single and live with parents.  This is the perfect job if you're going to school and don't have major responsibilities.  Auto Zone provides a lot of learning skills that are useful in other jobs, excellent stepping stone.  Upper management suffers from favoritism, unfortunately."
good,friendly work environment good pay schedules that work with you overall average work place upward mobility possible as long as strong work ethic is displayed.
good,"fast paced environment where customer service is a must "
good,"day by day learning new stuff, from auto parts to how to do it your self work, one day receiving truck next day working with customer service and driving."
good,it is a ok place to work if you looking to helping customers with car questions and concerns. also if your interested in furthering your career in automotive work.
good,"Its not a bad place to work, but if you dont have experienced in the world of cars and their environment your going to have a very dificult time the first to years at least."
good,"It's a good company if you want to move up. "
good,"Decent job, Pay is a little light for what is expected, would prefer more of a work/life balance. Good upper management with fair policies, but the operations of business ask a lot of store managers"
good,A typical day of work consisted of trying to sell customers things they don't need nor have any interest in. This is now how you appeal to people. I learned that an auto part place is more about sales than automobile knowledge unfortunately. Management was a pain in terms of trying to get sales in to compete with other stores instead of actually helping customers.
good,I came on as a manager having a crew of 8 employees. I learned alot in the position. I recommend anyone with retail experience to apply. A good and fun atmosphere
good,A typical day in a job here consist of mostly delivering auto parts to any mechanic shop that has an account with autozone. restocking any merchandise that is sold throughout the day. Ive learned how to handle any situation involving an angry costumer
good,It was a great experience. A very fast pace job that involved heavy lifting and bending. Production was a big concern working there.Managment needed improvement
good,"The employees and my managers were all great people. I love working with them, but the pay for what is required us robbing the staff of all autozones."
good,this place was alright I made friends with some really cool people I enjoyed talking with the customers fixing their mechanical issues with their vehicles besides that its like any other retail job
good,able to connect with everyone that works there or comes in to shop. Able to be stress free and easy going. Willingness of workers to help out higher ups is great.
good,in the comany their is always room for improvement. rules and regulations should be brought up to 2017 culture and tech. traing of new employees could be managed better
good,me gustaba pero pagaban poco y el horari oes muy matado
good,I enjoyed working here. I am appreciative of the training that I received and continue to grow on these experiences. I would recommend this company for anyone looking to work while in school.
good,"A comfortable working environment, plenty of learning opportunities day in and day out, flexable schedules, plenty of room for growth within company and working with a team ."
good,Not a bad place at all. Fun environment and nice co-workers. Simply not the position I seek and I seek to learn more. The advancement seemed to not exist.
good,"Good place to work at. Store manager was a bit childish but overall not much complaints. Good energy in the store. Most difficult thing was dealing with the customers. Maybe it was the area we were in but they were rude, shady etc."
good,This was my 1st job and i was still in high school learned a lot but about car care but not from my manager but from good customers we had on a regular basis.
good,Jobs had great hours then. They cut me one day a week. The job title had problems. Not very helpful. If people needed help putting a light bulb in we could not help and could get fired doing so.
good,Management was not the best but we always met our goals and did our best to get customers what they needed. People were great and the associates were very helpful to customers.
good,Overall a good company to work for while I continue my education.  They are flexible with my hours and gives me the experience with the auto parts as I work towards my education to become a diesel mechanic
good,There is nothing remarkable about this company. Revolving door of part-timers. Full-timers that are expected to do the work of the store managers. Good for people not wanting a career.
good,overall good company to work for and good people to work with made work day fun and very fast pace work place. always a goods day work.
good,"Its a good all around place to work. You get chances to learn an expand on your job skills. If I don't know about the auto parts someone is asking you about, you can ask a co-worker and they will show you and you can learn more about it."
good,"staffing is hard, pay is not competitive, long days at work, you get a 20 percent discount, love helping customers fix their cars, learned a lot about new technology"
good,"AutoZone as a whole is not a bad company to work for but with that said they tend to overwork those on the store level and at times upper management expect goals that are not realistic to the market that store is located.Also stores are understaffed and employees tend to have to do the job of 3 or more people. Mainly because the Management team is only looking at the numbers and are not around on a day to day basis to understand the real issues that are affecting thestore and the numbers. Another issue is It's stock holders first( which is understandable), customers second and employees tend to get the short end of the stick. Honestly I stood with the company as long as I did more because I enjoyed the team I was working with and finding work is not as simple as in the past."
good,"it is a good place to work for, if you have a district mgr who is not a pain in the behind, who likes to micro manage. the pay is a little better than the competitors, but still dont pay cased on experience."
good,Was fast paced great place to work if only need part time. Was easy work and hours weren't bad. I would return there as a part time job if the pay was slightly higher.
good,"Autozone offers good benefits, alright pay depending on state"
good,"this is a good company to work for, they just need to give more hours and more opportunity to move up in the company.have to help lots of customers and help fix there cars"
good,"High paced environment, workers were good, pay was good, hours were ok. room for advancement always an opportunity to work overtime"
good,"help customers find what they were looking for"
good,I enjoyed working for this company. Learned a lot more about auto parts and diagnosing vehicles. Also was able to do part deliveries.
good,"Nice place to work, sometimes its hard work, there stores are very clean and well taken care of. A lot of good employees on this end."
good,"As a Parts Sales Manager, I loved my coworkers as well as the customers I encountered on a daily basis. The only downfall to the job really was not a good balance of home/work life because of lack of enough employees and poor scheduling."
good,"A typical day at work would be doing inventory and stocking shelves to ensure that the consumers can get the desired products that they need in a timely fashion.  "
good,It was a learning experience to know and learn how the auto parts industry world. Gain some knowledge about DIY's and how helpful it can be.
good,It's a nice place to work at some location. Some if the coustmer are nic and easy to get alone with. I had a great time I just don't like the point system that they have.
good,"The company is a good company to work for the employees are friendly, and the customers are friendly. As employee you learn a lot about different problems that customer experiencing with their automobile and you try to assist them."
good,Worse job I ever had no cooperation in setting up shop very close minded and and create difficult working conditions.  Everything is done without any error or termination is sure
good,I like working for autozone and there's always someone there to help you and there are nice people that work there that will help in anyway they can help
good,"this company is not a company for long term work, but great for getting back on your feet. Low pay and no benefits. Hard to move up into any other position."
good,autozone was a very fast paced environment long lines rude customers but as a customer satisfaction specialist the customer is always right I tried any and all way possible to help solve the customers issues and make sure the left with a smile.
good,This was my first job and working with people and communicating with people on a day to day basis. It helped me by opening up to people and learning how to talk to people and interact with people. At the same time people can teach you about yourself such as correcting how to do something or trying it this way. The job environment here was a good one
good,"Great place to learn more about vehicles, management and team work. Helps build managerial skills at a fast pace. Focus on customer service is a priority and AutoZone delivers well."
good,helps customers in the need they need. they talk to customers in ways they will understand and not big words. always make it a fun day a work
good,"Due to a large amount of turnovers and moment in upper management, there was no form of directions and any opportunity for growth within the company. Being apart of lower management was not rewarding or self accomplishing."
good,"helped me gain experience in the management system, while scheduling and assigning tasks to my co workers, while providing customer experience"
good,"I like driving so this is a good fit for me. When I'm not driving, facing the products on the store shelves and assisting customers and cashiering when needed. It's part time with no bennies."
good,From open to close the drive to help the customer is high... You learn which cars are commonly breaking down and you also learn car parts names...
good,"In store management can range from great to very sub-par.  It;'s a retail job, so the top focus is sales and money, employee relations is fairly low on the list, and upper management rarely deals directly with floor level employees unless it is for criticism."
good,"Opened store, stocked merchandise, helped customers with their automotive needs. I enjoyed the individuals I worked with. Management was great and if any questions or problems occurred they did their best to accommodate me. The hardest part of the job was having customers go to the competition if we did not have what they needed."
good,The management could have been better at the store I worked at. The customers was the best part of that job. I loved the hours also. And the pay was good too.
good,"Everyone's experience is different with this company. Go in with an open mind and always strive for the best. As for someone who starts at the bottom, always greeting customers with a smile and having a can-do attitude is what helps get through the day. Following company policy is a must to advance within the company."
good,"Productive, and putting a lot of emphasis on seemingly only "
good,"Autozone is a busy auto part store. throughout the years I've learned to do minor jobs on cars, the place is dynamic and always ready to serve the customers. Management is absolutely straight forward just the way I like it, and my co-workers are easy going people. the hardest part of the job is on truck day because it takes time away from labor but the customer cannot wait to be help."
good,"selling parts, organizing, dealing with customers ."
good,"Good company to start with a challenge in mind, the harder you push the more you get out of it, Worth a try."
good,"Customer service is the main job in this business. As a part sales manager, my duty was to lead the team to sales and hit the daily target. From management, I have learned that you have to finish the tasks on time, this means finishing the planograms, cleaning the store, straightening the products to prevent shrink. One of the hardest part of the job was to get enough recognition by the district manager for higher paid position."
good,"Auto Zone has been a nice part-time job while I was completing my college degree. The hours are flexible and the management at my particular location is great, because he actually cares about you as a person. The pay is pretty low and things can be hectic at times especially when short staffed. Corporate pushes sales heavily, and if goals are not met then they start cutting employee hours. Sales can be difficult at times, because most customers that come into this store want free services or diagnostics. Instead of paying employee commissions, corporate drives the idea that you get to work more hours if you have acceptable sales numbers. This company would be better if they provided incentives and paid more."
good,good pay was not boring fast pace work that i liked but very hot. I learned to work at a fast pace and to do it accurately' i enjoyed the work. i enjoyed working for my advisors for the most part they were nice to work for.
good,"Everyday there is something to do, whether its helping the customers or keeping the store in good shape. I have learned a lot about cars almost more than the basics which i find helpful. The management is good and always professional and helpful. Luckily i got to work with productive coworkers. The hardest part of this job is dealing with people and their complaints over small things. Learning was the most enjoyable."
good,"You can learn a lot if youre just entering the field of automotive. It makes good for a part time job. Ive met some good people working here. You also gain othert experiences such: handling cash and credit transactions, about automotive parts, and customer service."
good,"decent place to have your first job, enjoyed being able to talk to customers about what they're working on or plan to. You got a decent discount on all car parts except things you used the most like oil, oil filter and so forth"
good,This was my first experience as a manager and I am extremely thankful to Auto Zone for the time and professional experience that I acquired during my time.
good,"Hay muy buenas herramientas para aprender más, pero falta el tiemo para aprovecharlas, las jornadas laborales se extiendes mucho, la supervision no esta lo suficientemente preparada para poder lidiar con varias situaciones laborales, me gusto que tiene excelentes prestaciones."
good,All and all the company is a good place to work at as long as you are full time. Part timers get horrible hours and the company doesn't care about you.
good,i would go into work and the atmosphere was very friendly from the workers to the customers. I learned that auto zone cares for their employees
good,"Working for Autozone was about average in all the previous automotive jobs I've had. I've had worse, I've had better. Management was not as professional as I would have liked, which resulted in employees getting overworked and underpaid in my opinion."
good,I was a sales associate. My job was to get the right parts that the customer was looking for. I also ran the cash register. I had to communicate with my managers to handle customer complaints or concerns.
good,My experience with Auto Zone is great. Work well with coworkers and meeting new people on day to day basis.  I like to help people with vehicle problems and rewarded with a smile and thank you.  Selling the right parts for the right job and going the extra mile/
good,"sale, as soon a I came in I was on the phone telling customers about parts and product sales that were currently going on, preparing order, paper work money handling,"
good,"If you open, you start at 7:15 am. Get the store ready for customers for 7:30. If it is on a weekend. You are going to be busy, weather and time of month play an important part. You will either look up parts for customers, process returns, if management perform inventories participate in conference calls, all employees help put truck away which is three times a week. You go outside to see customers cars to get a better idea on how to help them fix a problem. It is rewarding to save people money and guide them to fixing their vehicles."
good,A typical day on the job is long and tiresome. The hardest part of the job is lifting and bending for hours straight. There is lots of overtime for people who like to make money
good,women are the ones to take care of unloading the truck and stocking inventory. management doesnt help much. customers in the area are in my opinion worse than other areas i have worked
good,"Ran complete store operations, Sales , store stocking and presentation, Achieving daily sales goals, "
good,"El ambiente es muy volátil, rapidamente cambias a sentido de urgencia lo que te genera muchos estres."
good,cool place to be if you are into care an have grreat people skills dont mind getting your hand dirty have a lil basic computer skill nice place to start out if you are in school
good,"Great workplace to learn and develop my social skills by working with people and interacting with customers.  In charge of daily tasks which included: opening the store, training new employees, planograms, and cleanliness of the store."
good,A typical day at Auto Zone is very busy. A steady stream of customers through the door and on the phone. Plenty of training that's updated every quarter. That keeps you refreshed with information.
good,my time at autozone was ok but the management plays favoritism and the work environment is good co-workers where good and helped you
good,After working for Oreilly Auto parts I realized that Autozone is lacking in customer service and employee incentive/pay. Autozone was a first job for me when I graduated high school. I learned mostly about customer service and sales. The automotive field is sub-par in comparison to other companies such as Oreillys. Management within the store was great and easy to work with. Outside management was rarely present and not very supportive. The environment and co-workers are very enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was having to learn about automotive if you are new to the industry. The people are the best part of Autozone. I loved working with customers and making the right sales.
good,"Opportunities for several advancements, training, learning several different skills, such as planning, marketing, sales, and Inventory. Interaction with retail and corporate accounts. Family environment with management and co-workers. Customer service was the most important and enjoyable aspect."
good,AutoZone has a great history and progressive leaders. They have a culture that wants to excel in every area and have plans and goals to reach them.
good,"The job is OK. They are willing to give you a lot of hours as long as you work hard and are motivated. Phone calls to come in on your day off, and having to balance a short staff is a common occurrence here. The people that I work with is the biggest factor in why I stayed here for so long; I've met some really down to earth good people here."
good,"To much employee turn around, some have knowledge on parts, some have no clue. There is a large database where the knowledge is given and training is done. Benefits are decent, job security is there as long as you come in on time and do your job. Management needs improving within the  customer service and employee friendliness. Let me put it this way... The job is easy, all you have to do is clock in on time, do your job and go home when scheduled. I cannot say if I will recommend anyone to Autozone, as everyone takes this job very differently."
good,"En trabajo diario era repostarse , y la primera actividad era la revisión de la unidad asignada documentando esto en formato, al principio era divertido pero después de algún tiempo me di cuenta de que nadie le prestaba atención al reporte era un requisito mas. Ya en la operación era hablarles a los clientes para preguntarles e informales las promociones llevar las piezas requeridas, cobrarles y reportar el cobro al regresar a la tienda, con respecto a nivel gerencial ellos debían revisar las piezas que salían y firmar el trabajo era repetitivo y sencillo la parte que mas me gusto era la de tratar con la gente pues al ser diversas personas el aprendizaje era mas grande pues cada uno de ellos era un potencial cliente y había que llegar a ellos"
good,"With many years of working in an automotive atmosphere, I most enjoy assisting people with finding the right parts to do the job!"
good,"Very nice coworkers, just wish there were more hours for me to get. time for the most part flys by not hard job once you get to know the store and where all the parts go. I have learned alot about cars, the hardest part is getting to kow the store and testing parts. Co workers are amazing and very helpful!"
good,"I love the fact I have short shifts it fits my life style with an infant, but the pay is a really horrible, they say it is based off of experience but I have two degrees and still only make min wage,"
good,"It started off excellent, but I hit a ceiling for advancement and the compensation was poor for the duties I had to complete. The ""Incentive"" for selling was so corporate wouldn't cut your hours."
good,This is a great place to work with alot of fringe benefits. There was not enough employee's to cover the workload on selected shifts.  Weekends are mandatory for management and we were open almost every holiday.
good,"Hardest part of the job was when truck shipment arrives and the restocking is required."
good,Was in charged of selectors and had to ensure they was selecting the right product before shipping to our stores. I had really good Managers that showed me the way.
good,"The company is a good company to work for the employees are friendly, and the customers are friendly. As employee you learn a lot about different problems that customer experiencing with their automobile and you try to assist them."
good,You spend most of your time assisting customers find parts for their automobile. Another big part of your day is spent on inventory management.
good,decent work environment with a stable head of supervfisors. Days are not drawn out and dont drag. worst part is they are just some very long days.
good,"I am a Parts Sales Manager at AutoZone.  The job consists of attending to customers on a daily basis, answering phone calls, looking up parts for customers etc.  I deal with a lot with Customer Service mostly.  Answer any questions or concerns that customers would ask of.  We also get a shipment truck 3 times a week. There is typically nothing hard about my job.  I have learned to have a lot of patience and understanding with my position."
good,"Good place to work, very professional management personnel. Many ways to advance thru the company...Big Company with more than 5000 stores thru out US, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Brazil"
good,"Autozone is all numbers, but i did learn a lot from the company. I learn my management, inventory management and gained a lot of parts knowledge."
good,I enjoyed helping other student acquire their GED and also watch and participated in the students learning how to read. I enjoyed created news articles for the students and helping them anyway I could to make it possible for them to acquire their goals. As a secretary I prepared students records and made sure all the information for students and teachers was correct and accurate.
good,"long and exhausting for a new person"
good,"very fun place to work and management was great, never could get a day off but other than that was a very fun place to work, discount was very good as well."
good,It was a fun place got along with co-workers but it would have been more exciting for me if I was more mechanically inclined.
good,"Pretty good job. You learn to deal with a sorts of different people, while also learning about cars. Spent a lot of time on the computer looking up parts for different vehicles."
good,"the job itself wasn't to hard to do, but if you had a long line it was hard sometimes to find backup to help cut the line down, but the owners were awesome and would step in if no one else did"
good,A lot of work needs to be done on a daily basis if all employees work then your day goes by fairly easy and fun but in most cases management do not hold all employees to the same standard and some employees are over work while others are allowed to do nothing
good,"It was a good job at one point, but to say it in the nicest manner...the quality has been declining consistently within the past year or so."
good,"A typical day working for AutoZone involves working with many customers one-on-one helping to solve their individual issues regarding their vehicles, or make advancements on projects they are currently working on. Management isn't overbearing but there are goals that the company pushes to meet while trying to make the work environment as friendly as possible. Working for this company you learn a few things about different vehicles, working with a team and dealing with different personalities. One thing that I really enjoyed was the fact that all the AutoZone coworkers do what they can to have each others backs while trying to complete a job. Unfortunately, the hardest part about this job was the pay, while work was a lot to handle at times, often I would think to myself ""Is the paycheck worth what I am doing."" and many times it was not."
good,"no comment, upper management has to much control and does not care about there employees. lower management is overworked and way under paid. Company does offer great benefits to those who qualify. Yet, they choose to use mostly part-time help so they do not have to offer these benefits."
good,"plenty of room for advancement but did not pay enough, management is great for auto zone. hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers where co workers had made mistakes."
good,"I worked here about a year and it was a great job to start out if you have no knowledge of automobiles. The management crew taught me the ins and outs of how each of the parts of a car work and connect. But, when it came to more complex model vehicles, especially when it came to knowing the inside of an engine, nearly everyone that worked there was stumped in answering those questions. That was one thing I wished I could have learned more about."
good,"Autozone has flexible schedueling, is a good job for students. Not a bad place to work, you are never going to make a career out of this place though."
good,"Fun job, lots of interesting people and a sense of satisfaction at the end of the day.  Challenging, plenty of chances to solve problems and genuinely help people."
good,If you are looking to advance quickly this is for you. Management can be verbally abusive. The company is all about sales. The bottom dollar is the main goal. If you are not a salesman this is not the atmosphere for you.
good,"I enjoy helping others, it bring some leveling in my life to know I have the ability to help other that's in need. This job helped me with my people skills"
good,I really enjoyed working at Auto-Zone because I like to help the customers getting the right part for their vehicles and also delivering parts to the auto shops.
good,"Typical day of work would consist of answer phone calls, help customers directly in person with their automotive needs. Also giving advice on products and solutions always feels great."
good,"t's a good company to work for, they very dedicated and willing to help anyway they can. i really don't have any co-workers at the station i'm located i'm the only person working their"
good,"Depending on location, it's not too bad of a place to work. You have general open/closing duties, you are given daily and weekly sales numbers to hit, and they recently changed the truck deliveries from one huge order to three smaller ones, making it much easier to finish throughout the day. I was hired with a decent knowledge of cars, and definitely learned something new every day. There is no commission or other incentive for putting forth hard work, they just want sales, sales, and more sales to make the company money and therefore giving more hours to the store. In other words, if you want to make decent money at this job, you have to work 50 hour weeks, and that's if they allow it."
good,"It was not a bad job just worked 12 hour shifts 5-6 days a week and it gets tiresome after awhile, the benefits where good but you have to work more than a little bit which takes away from your personal lift"
good,"The only thing that is great about AZ is the fellow employees."
good,Working at Autzone was very fun.They taught me a few thing about vehicles that i didn't know. Every morning i would start off by checking the registers then proceeded to make sure that the store was clean for the customers. The hardest part of the job for me was having people cover shifts when one of my co-workers called out sick. What i enjoyed most was at the end of the day everything ran smoothly through out the day
good,Ok place to work. I want to move because I do not like being at the Registers. I see it as a very dim future for anyone wanting a career  with life long benefits.
good,Decent place to work with a nice environment. The bad part about it is that they will give you good hours one period and the next they'll schedule you like you're a flex worker. The hub manager is a good person but not when it comes to hours. She likes to make you feel like you need to come in when you were off on the schedule.
good,"You come in, search parts for customer vehicles, make sales; sometimes you install parts such as batteries onto customer vehicles. You clean the store; organize and stock merchandise; take customer phone calls."
good,"Great job security, fun work environment especially if your interested in cars. Customers expect free mechanics and the compensation doesn't match your demand."
good,A friendly environment depending on location. Not all upper management wants to see people advance. Hard workers are view as just that hard workers which makes managements job easier so they like them to stay as just that.
good,"Good work life balance, management is very understanding of part time employees and always work with you"
good,"This job isn't for everyone, as cars are a very specific field. The big issue is usually with management. This job is more numbers driven than most people realize, and because of this, they put pressure on you to often try to sell things that people just don't want. When people are working on their vehicles, they only want what they absolutely need. Management seems to forget this most times."
good,"Being a HUB Coordinator there is so much that is expected of you that is very difficult to obtain but it is possible.  The problem is that the locations we delivery to are not communicating proper expectations to their customers and then blamed us for all their errors which in turn gives us such a bad name.  I have such a hard working staff and it just seems no matter how hard we work we can't get ahead.  On top, the upper management that is suppose to be our support don't keep in touch with us so they are constantly clueless and more of a burden then a help."
good,A typical day at Autozone revolved around making the customer happy.  With that I was able to help customers find the parts and services needed for there experience.
good,i have no worked there in a long period of work but from what i remember it was alot of work and not enough pay like micro management on every little thing of moving all fuses forward just petty stuff
good,"A typical work day includes greeting customers, installing batteries, changing light bulbs, doing check engines on customers vehicles. Management has change, I'm still learning to understand my new manager views. My co-workers are awesome, even when stressful situations arise we are each others support.The hardest part of the job is the 8-10 or 12 hour wear and tear on your feet from the non-stop standing. My most enjoyable part of the job is the customers who highlight it plus the ones who come with difficult questions or problems for me to gain a knowledgeable experience."
good,it's a good job to have when you're busy. the only thing that i don't like about the job is when my job title got changed with out my knowledge and my hours got cut in half.
good,I would help getting the shipment out of the back of the truck and process the freight building racks to hang the clothes on and getting everything ready for the store to open
good,"fast pace, automotive knowledge needed, customer service experience, bending and picking up heavy parts, great lunch hours. very flexible hours"
good,"Learned about cars. Typical day meet new people, preparing displays, and inventory.  Long hours on your feet short breaks.  Average benefits and pay,  Meet and helping new people was the most enjoyable part of the day."
good,The work it self was not bad at all but the managment was really bad. There were days where i was asked to work overtime and sometimes i wouldnt get paid for it. I think maybe it was just the location i worked at maybe others are ok.
good,"I have worked for several companies that claim to put the customer first, but this was the first time where we actually were expected to take care of the customer before doing the little stuff."
good,"Working at Autozone you have the most ambiguous title... sales associate. You pretty much do everything except manage the place. Depending on the location you work at it can be hard to multitask when you have duties and customers to attend to. the hardest part of the job would be upselling and changing batteries for customers, but honestly you get more hours if you upsell the product of the week. Instead of getting commission you get to do more work, hurray. it can also be labor intensive. like when the stock truck comes in with all the large pallets, guess who has to count and put out the product... you guess its you. it is a great place to start and gain experience, but the pay wont keep you there long enough for you to become manager"
good,"Did a lot of standing walking and talking "
good,"The job  is what you make it. So, if consumers are not in the store, one has to . keep themselves busy. Some things one can do is: front-faced; replenish items; as well as clean parking lot and bathrooms."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening the store in the morning answering customer questions and phone calls, scanning inventory, filling daily paperwork, training employees, scanning inventory, pulling items from overstock to fill store, putting up window signs, making special orders, printing new labels, changing item displays, installing batteries, headlights bulbs and ect,"
good,"I was told I would be able to get a full time position within a short period of time. It has been almost 6 months, and I am still only getting 20 hours a week. The company as a whole seems decent, except they don't really value their employees."
good,"It was an average place to work, got a long with everyone but wasn't my passion. I did learn so many things about vehicles that I never knew before. Helped customers figure out what was wrong with their vehicles and installed small items like wipers, batteries, etc."
good,If you know your stuff you can move up quick depending if you have a good manager.They demand alot of their employees and pay is not all that good causing a high turn over rate.
good,My typical day at this job was a lot of driving. I would deliver parts to the buyers locations. While helping customers at the store when there were no deliveries. What made working there even easier was the fact that all the employees and managers were close.
good,This was a fast paced environment in which I was hands on with the customers. They have flexible hours and you wok close with the management team.
good,I have worked in the automotive industry the better part of 20 years. It is a great feeling to be able to assist customers with issues and get them back on the road.
good,great experience with customers i had a lot of feed back because i did a good job helping customers fix their cars on the spot as well as getting to know what parts i was selling and what they did
good,this was a great learning experience for me. I learned about cars and the parts they need to run correctly. I was able to help alot of people fix there cars.
good,work there part time to make extra cash a couple of times. Learned some basic computer skills.
good,"Make sure store is ready for opening"
good,"Help customers find parts, perform preventive maintenance on A/C unit. Clean all units on each store visit, replace ballast , light bulbs, fire extinguishers."
good,Helping people to solve their car problems is the most enjoyable part of the job
good,"A typical day of work would begin with me opening the store and doing the opening/closing paperwork.  Following this I would determine which employees would be doing each job duty for the day. Following this, as a team, we would tackle the days duties and challenges.  If there were any challenges, we would address them in an appropriate manner."
good,"After clocking in for the day, I went to assigned products, scanned them, packaged in totes, sealed totes, and sent to designated store locations. I often lifted 75+ lbs. in this position. I learned how to use a scanner, time management, and teamwork skills. As with any job, there were wonderful managers and ones that needed practice. The best managers had leadership, constructive criticism, and availability.  The most pleasurable co-workers knew their tasks to complete and had a plan on how to do so. The most difficult part of the job was when I had to work 11+ hours without notice. The most enjoyable part of my job was concluding a work day and visually being able appreciate the workload my team and I had accurately completed under specified times."
good,"Mechanical parts sales and advising, daily duties included looking up automotive schematics and part picking"
good,"Autozone isnt a bad company but they take extreme advantage of their employees, I was a parts sales manager for 10 years and received very little in raises, they work you double shifts, they dont hire the right people, they expect way to much out of you, they write you up for ridiculous situations, I new that company like the back of my hand and did way more than I was asked and never was thanked or aknowledged for anything. They have alot to learn about true employee relations and true customer service."
good,The job is great in some ways its easy the people there are cool and fun to talk to but the money is horrid and no hours are given to anyone but managers and they say no positions are available for management. This job just barely pays for the gas it takes to get there and no matter how hard you work no thanks is given no raises no advancement no good things period
good,"Counting tills/registers, verifying returned damage/undamaged merchandise, leading team meeting, planograms, and presenting outstanding customer service skills."
good,"My day at work consist of helping the store to hit daily sale goals for the store, help cutomers, answer phones, keep store clean and merchandise and daily reports. co-workers are great to work with but the hardest part of the job is been short staffed. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is making sale by giving great customer service."
good,It was somewhat of experience some people/workers worked together to make the work complete.
good,I would take customer orders and deliver them to their destination and also bring back returns.
good,"Helping customers, great Management, great co-workers. great place  to work"
good,"good company to work for as far as benefits, retirement, and stock. But its too much politics and too much favortism going on."
good,"loved a lot about it, just wish they had better advancements"
good,This company offers lots of opportunity for growth and Training.
good,"I had gotten my start there, but it was too focused on selling small petty items over the counter. Your schedule was effected if you did not sell enough."
good,"Enjoyed working with customers, collaborating and teamwork.  However, company has high turnover rate, hard to keep good trained employees on board."
good,i usually come into work in the morning following daily procedures and throughout the day helping customers while also at the cashier. i have  learned the basics of car knowledge and improved on social behavior and know what is required to do in my position. management have been kind to help me understand products and taught me the right way of doing things. co workers are always happy to help each other. hardest of my job was always truck day where we are supposed to finish unpacking boxes full of product in a short amount of time with so little help with the staff at hand. best part of the job was able to learn how to fix cars.
good,"I learned a lot, not a lot of hours but it was my first serious job. Customers are always rude."
good,Working for Autozone was a challenge like any Commercial sales. You always have the challenge of sales dollars. you have to keep sales up to keep enough drivers in the store at all times. when sales dropped they would cut drivers and than wonder why delivery times where no within desired time. But all employees worked together to achieve the goal. but when you run 2 man auto on the retail side and 1 man auto in commercial sales it was tough to maintain sales goals.
good,"Working with different customers each day, helping them find whatever they needed for their car. Great experience, I got to learn more about cars."
good,"selling auto parts with some knowledge of vehicles, setting planograms, performing managers next day review of returns, doing recalls, inventory matrix and managing staff. Hardest part is not having a set schedule and having to work most weekends and holidays. Most enjoyable part is co workers and meeting new people."
good,not a bad company to work for hours could have been more ok company to work for
good,Help customers to find the right part depending on their needs.
good,good co-workers and customers. good benefits when you get them.
good,Good place to work just expect stressful days pay could be better alot better.
good,"currently looking for a second job, because working with just autozone there isnt enough income."
good,It is a good place to work as a part-time. The pay is not great.
good,"fast pace, customer base heavy and low expectations."
good,"Positive environment, friendly staff, good training department and fun environment."
good,"be a good second job for someone, be ready to work weekends. Most enjoyable part of the job here is helping customers."
good,constantly pushing for sales. customers are their priority
good,need paid holiday and more days off during the holiday to spend wit family.
good,"The work environment is stressful and fast paced, good for me bad for others. Management never saw eye to eye on aspects of how the job should get done or when it needed to be done by. The pay compensation for the work is not great but what retail store is?"
good,"work was always fast paced, always busy and dealing with customers, always learning about the customers and their needs. management was somewhat fair but never out of line.i loved working with my co-workers, we where a family. we did inventory for the whole store in 5 hrs just 4 of us. my favorite was dealing with the customers , they can sense your mood, it was always a great experience."
good,Good starting job positions for those starting to work. Nice and easy play to enjoy work.
good,this was an interim job while trying to obtain a local job. I left driving over the road and found this job to look for another job
good,sales and free advice to people about their autos ooooooooooooooooo
good,"I loved working here, but had several issues that really started to make me dislike my job."
good,"steady work, some training available, fair management, team oriented,"
good,"an easy day was a typical day"
good,Its not enough money or hours the pay is not enough and there is no forward movement with the company in other words there is no room for advancement
good,"driver, parts counter, customer service, commercial specialist"
good,"al llegar siempre empezabamos con una pequeña junta,  al principio una serie de ejercicios como la porra oficial de autozone como el lema de la empresa..."
good,It was a great work experience. I enjoyed working for them. The co workers were great.
good,I like the job for the independence it had. Load your product then your on the road most of the day. Only thing I wish was that it was paying more. Its a lot of driving.
good,"Began part time as counter sales with include duties of setting merchandise displays, inventory control, restocking, and cleaning. Upon retirement from TDCJ moved to full time and promoted to CSM adding to my responsibilities to which included store and warehouse inventories, supervising sales staff, and promoting customer service.   With in a year was promoted to my 1st store manager position. Initially assigned to stores with issue and was tasked to resolve those issues until I was offered the store at which I started. I was able to improve this stores productivity by hiring and training a sales staff that was customer driven, dependable, and productive. Over the next 3 years we increase sales, customer count and satisfaction, reduced shrink, turnover rate, and the competition."
good,Can be fast paced during the summer months. there are also a lot of duties to perform at one time
good,Enjoy the job related experiences look forward to the new experiences.
good,"AutoZone is a job that has a fast pace environment, and you are constantly on the move helping customers. Product knowledge is also something that was needed because many customers do not know about cars parts so it was my job to inform them of getting a certain brand and telling them what they needed in order to fix their problem. The skill that I enhanced the most working at this job would have to be my interpersonal skills, and my ability to multitask and still being able to it complete the task both quickly and efficiently."
good,not very well compensated. Great employees to work with in most cases but i am lower level management and wish i was better compensated or had a better incentive system.
good,i just worked with the customers and helped them how ever i could
good,put parts on pallet .learned how to run pallet jack .worked good with coworkers
good,"In a typical work day you can't tell who is a manager and who is suppose to be the team. Stores are generally understaffed and employees begin to get frustrated all the way to the store manager. Everyone in the store no matter what you actual title is stocks truck, does planograms, uses the cash register, answers the phone, helps with commercial orders, does on deliveries, does chargin system checks, installs wipers, pulls codes from check engine lights. Everyone does everything and there is never enough time to get everything done that your district manager expects to have done in your store."
good,It was a different experience for me.  I never new anything about cars.  It was a good experience for me.  I just didnt enjoy it that much.  I love working with and helping people.
good,was a great place to meet new people.  helped customers fix cars.
good,work days are about the same. learned nothing . management was good different at every location. co workers are good. hardest part of the job was the pay.
good,"I worked there through college and it is definitely a good place to work. Don't expect much pay, but they will work around your schedule. The people that work there are helpful and usually in a good mood."
good,"fun, gratifying career with plenty of chances to move up in the company."
good,good place to work for has alot of pros and cons but overall loved my job
good,AutoZone is a great place to work. I had to give up my position due to increased school load. AutoZone helped me get my feet on the ground here in Keene and also opened a few doors in the networking department.
good,when ideas are changed so very often it is hard to maintain any morale boosts.
good,I worked for Iron Mountain to pay off some school loans. The conditions were typical of a warehouse. It was cold in the winter and hot in the summer.
good,Great coworkers and management. Enjoyable work atmosphere. Productive establishment.
good,"Company seems pretty good to work for, my personal experience may have been tainted by a portion of the management team."
good,good job if your in high school or in college and need to pay bills
good,"Great store manager, employees are good to work with.   Corporate driven programs for achievements.    Long hours, weekends, and ever changing schedules."
good,I became parts sales manager there it was a fun atmosphere. got to know a lot of people and made the customers very happy by suiting there needs.
good,"Going to work and focaing on being safe."
good,when i work there i was young and i wasnt making any money i was the lowest pay empoly in the store so i look for t=something better
good,Easy work.. Fun and friendly management back you up if theres a problem. Public is hard to work with.
good,get to deliver parts to auto repair shops and meet the people that work on cars. build good friendship with local shops and employees at autozone.
good,"It's a wonderful mechanically oriented workplace, but i don't advise working here unless you already enjoy auto parts."
good,This is a fast-paced position that requires a multitude of tasks.  I love the customer interaction!
good,"When I first started at AutoZone, it was my first venture into the auto parts world.  I learned a lot in the time I was employed there.  The managers were knowledgeable and helpful.  I had built good rapport with several customers.  My schedule was usually flexible if given enough notice for days off.  When I started in part time status, I was given the option for insurance.  At times it was a very fast paced and stressful working environment.  Being non-management, it was at times frustrating trying to assist customers and having to call for management approval for returns and other processes.  It was also frustrating being a woman in a man's world. I was often overlooked or discredited by customers who were accustom to being waited on by a man."
good,"Order puller, packer,scanner , taker orders for commerical accounts  make deliveries and stock."
good,"if you like cars I do suggest a job at autozone, you will find a lot of other people into cars too"
good,"As a Store Manager a typical day started early and ended late mostly.  It started with ensuring all IT equipment was working properly, account for monies, assign work areas for staff.  Assist Delivery Manager if needed.  Greet employees and get a feel for where they are mentally and physically.  I may work on schedule that had to be completed weekly.  Participate in conference call with District Manager daily.  Train personnel if necessary, and most important,  ensure excellent customer service was a reality within my four walls.  I gained valuable experience in dealing with people directly weather it be staff or customer.  I had some great co-workers and managers and some who were not.  I enjoyed the most getting the feedback from the people who I had helped along the way in my 15 years with AutoZone."
good,"AutoZone is a wonderful company to work for. You have job stability, but there isnt much opportunity for advancement."
good,You really worked hard for the pay you made. It was a good job production was great.My co-workers were ok.
good,One of the worst companies to work for!!!!!   The upper management cares nothing for the people making the sales to create the bonus upper management gets.
good,"Helping customers get the best possible service. Learned quite a bit automotive upkeep. Managing there was a great learning experience. The people i worked for, and with were great. Corporate policies and the constant change in said policies. The other employees were great to work with."
good,"Regardless of how rude or wrong the customer was, management always took care of the customer. The hardest part was to deal with the poor management. Their decisions were not understandable."
good,I made Schedules and provided daily supervision to my employees. I worked well with everyone.
good,"A typical day is phone answering lookin up parts ordering parts installing parts giving the best advice to your ability and Providing Excellent Customer Service"
good,It brought me great joy when a customer would come in with a part and no one in the store could identify it accept I.  Pretty good experience
good,I enjoyed company great benefits. Long hours bonuses was great
good,"Worked with the company for several years. I had reached a point in life where I wanted stability and opportunity over retail hours. A good place to work, especially if you are in to vehicles."
good,Nothing spectacular about this company just an ok place to work.
good,Just like working for any other parts company. Learned a lot about the business.
good,"•	Educated Customers about various products. Advised upgrades for better performance and provided product installation."
good,Liked working here for some customers that were nice but some they expect warranty on everything. Management was koo very helpful.
good,it's a good work place pays not that good it's hard to get hired in but other then that it's a good work place
good,Working at Autozone isn't really a career choice but more like just another job. It's easy to get a job there and easy to get fired. Good place to learn about cars if you pay attention.
good,"It wasn't so bad at first. A nice full time work schedule and plenty of runs a day to commercial customers. But my location on Mccart avenue had no job security. No cameras, no tags, no item theft deterrents. Had three robberies but the place was great to work. However the customers will complain if the line get's long but hey they want something they gotta wait lol"
good,management was good to work for and enjoyable work enviroment
good,A lot of work. They are not stingy with hours if you need some extra money. It sucks on Sundays because of truck day other than that not to bad.
good,A typical day at work for me is full of stocking and helping customers. I also diagnose problems with customers cars. Ive learned alot of new things about cars that I didnt know before. I work alot with overstock in the back warehouse. Its a great job.
good,"This job is an learning atmosphere for a lady, it was an okay place to work, just very different."
good,Company takes care of you with health and dental. Pay is not great but the job is easy. Hours are basic retail. Great place for a students out of high school
good,Its a good place you to greet the costumers. Learn about the different car parts.
good,"Another good place to work. Not very challenging if you have high ambitions, unless advancement opportunities exist, which they did not. With available advancement, or more responsibility, it would be a great place to work"
good,"Store Manager, Inventory,"
good,"This is not a place you wanna be at the rest of your life. Managment is really cool, but the company doesnt really care about you as an individual. You never know what days your gonna have off, so you cant ever plan anything. Also dealing with upset customers is never fun and the worst part about it is you cant do nothing about it. You just have to stand there and listen to everything they have to say."
good,"good job, very friendly staff, helpful people and a really nice place to work"
good,Autozone was a good company to work for. They offered benefits and bonuses and had a really friendly environment. I was a driver and that part of the job got old quick.
good,I learned a lot about helping meet customer needs. I gained a lot management experience
good,"Supervise all sales, manage coworkers, manage work schedules, promote sales and promotions."
good,My supervisor is always willing to help me learn new things and encouraging me to familiarize myself with the company programs
good,"Job is fairly easy, hard to move up or gain hours if part-time."
good,I learned more at az than alot of other places. Had lots of training but lots of hours. Learned how to read and apply pnl. How to handle shrink issues and human resource issues. Did my own hiring and training.
good,"I very much enjoyed moving store to store, but the regional managers were horrible!"
good,"There is a strong dissconnect at Area management. They do not activly participate in their stores, therefore do not have a valid feel for the company or culture."
good,A typical day of work consisted of delivering goods to stores in the tri state area. There's not really much to learn since you're just taking direction 100% of the time
good,Retail environment. Helping customers with sales. Money handling. Learned an extensive knowledge of cars. Management was pleasant. Co-workers worked efficiently to complete task. Hardest part of the job was working long hours when other employees called off. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people.
good,It is our job to make sure that all orders from every store are loaded and ready to be shipped in a timely manner. A typical day at work is fast paced and requires everyone to be on their toes. The job requires a lot of heavy lifting but also helps teach you to be organized.
good,"It's an okay place to work, if you like working with people. I learned a lot of different things over the course of my years working there. Many machanics can also teach us employers a thing or too because they have hands on experience with car parts and troubles that may come along with working on vehicle. The employees at my location are fun to work with, and we all get along well. The hardest part about working there, is being a female because a lot of men customers don't take us serious."
good,"not a bad company to work for, the biggest drawback is that the commercial program takes a backseat to the do-it-yourself program"
good,Fun place to work however the compensation is not quite enough for the duties expected to perform. $9.00 per hour is not enough to be out in the freezing cold replacing car batteries/wipers.
good,"I was able to learn many things here but would have appreciated more recognition for my hard work. The learning experiences were store managing, opening and closing a store, inventory, month end, finances, and strategic management."
good,"customer service, parts inventory, deliver parts. co-workers had great vehicle diagnostics information. hardest part of the job was making sure all customer were satisfied. the most enjoyable part of the job was speaking to the commercial accounts and their happiness in receiving parts in a timely manner."
good,I enjoyed working there about the only thing i didnt like was when someone would give a customer a wrong part. Knowing atleast something about cars or trucks would help.
good,Good place to work very fast paced and customer oriented I always liked to solve a problem.
good,"i have a good team and an awesome store manager. from working at autozone ive learned how to greet customer, make them feel welcome and happy. how to help them with their problem. and made sure when they leave the store they leave with a smile."
good,It was fast but fun
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people and being able to assist customers with their needs and concerns about auto parts.
good,"Auto Zone has a long track record, but sometime doesnt hire the needed employes."
good,Customer Service/Retail
good,helping customers
good,"The days at Autozone are long and dry it is very hot/cold depending on time of year. Do the exact same thang day in and day out. Managers for the most part are nice but are very persistent about getting the work complete. Didnt really have a chance to meet co-workers but the one I worked with was cool. The hardest part is not exactly doing the work but having to stand there in boredom and do it for 4 hours before lunch and after. On Wednesdays, they held give aways and raffles."
good,they over work u managements makes u do there jobs very stressfull job
good,"it is a very fun place to work, co-workers are very nice, management is another story. The hardest part of job is there are always constant people in the store everyday and the most enjoyable thing about it is learning about cars."
good,"In this company just about everyone is a ""Manager"". If you see a grey shirt, thats a manager. Red shirts are regular associates and you don't see too many of them. This makes some instances easier and others harder.Easier because the same manager is not always closing or getting pulled from a project. Harder because you are all on the same level and when I would try to ""push"" someone to get something accomplished i was met with ""your not the boss"" attitude. The Znet system they use for parts look up is in my opinion the best in the industry. I have worked for AZ competitors and the system is easy to use and very informational. I learned a LOT by messing around on Znet. It is so easy to use we had regular customers that knew how to use it. For myself, the hardest part of the job was being a woman in the auto parts industry. I know my stuff and boy did I have to PROVE it!"
good,Learned about automobiles. Ive learned what parts do and where they are located on a vehicle.
good,i really didnt like it except for the fact all the customer was regular and i like converting with the customer.
good,I would have liked to continue working for Autozone if I felt there was room to move up in the company.
good,great place to work for friendly people all around. its easy to catch on and their computer systems pretty much do all the work. only thing that bothered me was people that would come in to shop would only speak spanish and it was hard to translate auto parts in to english.
good,looking up parts using Alldata. Lenerning management skill. Inventory and stock placement.
good,"Fortune 200 Company, great benefits, pay is fair. Not career minded company."
good,AutoZone is a very good place to work for those who have a decent automotive background but need a place to start their career. Their benefits package is comperable and they will even pay for things like ASE certifications!
good,Great co-workers
good,"Auto zone was a fair establishment. They never wronged me or treated me unfairly. If I ever had an issue or complaint management listened and did their best to fix the situation. However the job was very demanding and on any given day you could end up doing any random job. For example, two or three days out of the week I would drive. Two days I would stock. One or two day I would be working on the counter. I prefer a set schedule not a constantly random environment."
good,"Even after working with cars for a long time, we couldn't find that Autozone was the place to be wroking."
good,"Company pays mediocre for it's type. The culture is there, being a car parts store. Everything else is just a normal retail job."
good,Open the store and assist customers with any questions they had. I learned how things worked and where they are located. Co workers were all nice and happy to help
good,"Cleaning, stocking and serving customers to find the correct parts. Co-workers were young and had seniority over me. They lacked experience in employee relationships which caused some conflict. Management was under a lot of pressure to make sales to meet corporate goals. The hardest part of the job was dealing with immaturity. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,"A typical day involved taking orders, selling parts, delivering parts, and directing other drivers. I learned how to organize my own layout of parts in the warehouse and how to manage other workers. Store managements was at times lacking because of turn over rate. The hardest part was being unorganized and understaffed because it effecting our job flow. The fast pace and my coworkers. Since we were understaffed having everybody work as a team was a must."
good,"Great place to work, flexible working rotations and interaction with customers is always exciting."
good,"flexible hours, good comfortable work environment. Co workers were nice, helpful and management were capable."
good,It's a real cool place to work at if you're a car enthusiast. Management is not properly trained and often lack the great qualities of a good leader.
good,cheap parts and cheap labor is what they are about. Hiring people who have no knowledge about cars is very common.
good,Terrible parts look up system. poor quality parts. Sub par customer service
good,"working at autozone was something i needed to finish and get through college. a day their would be very fun and exciting helping various customers with parts to help equip their vehicle. my manager their was a well understanding focused man and he showed me alot about how to run a store, i believe if i would have stayed a little longer i would have been able to experience the manager role. hardest part of the job was working outside in the different climates of the season. most enjoyable part was being able to put a smile on someone face because they couldnt fix their vehicle.."
good,great place to work
good,Pulling parts for customers. Ordering parts for customers. Delivering parts to auto shops.
good,"open the store in morning do cash counts open registers give tasks to employees for the day , customer service ,learning all the service codes and updates from car parts and dealers for the new years teaching up and coming employees to the company rules and tasks monthly inventory ."
good,"For those that like retail, the job was fine. If you're a people person, that helps as well. Drawbacks are the company constantly changes direction and requires all employees to buy into their culture with chants about the company and constant multiple daily calls from the manager to the District Manager."
good,Good company to work if they would just give their employees a decnt for the work they do.
good,Had alot of fun learned alot of skills and loved the people i worked with.
good,"Its a job, doesnt pay enough to get you by, wont get full time just get part time employees."
good,Great atmosphere to work in.....fun co-workers....good advancement opportunity.....good support from superiors.....
good,"Basic duties at work included keeping a clean and organized workspace for customers to view and purchase products. Other duties included assisting customers in problem solving vehicular problems and getting them the parts they need. The co-workers made the job feel less like work and more like a team oriented event. Everyone worked together to keep the store in top condition and help customers with their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that even though store maintenance would always be the same, helping customers find the parts they need would always be a different experience on a day to day basis."
good,The job was easy but when i worked there they were constantly cutting my hours and my boss was a total control freak.. Didn't take me long to get tired of that. The work is pretty easy and you will learn a nice bit about cars if you don't know much already.
good,Excellent work environment for learning about the Automotive Industry.
good,What is typical about a day at work is that no two days are ever alike. Customers drive the daily routine and helping them solve their problem or complete their project makes managing an Autozone challenging and fun. I look forward to new challenges and opportunities everyday. The management process at Autozone is well-defined and flows within the week and from day to day. The hardest part of of the job is the rotating schedule and late opening hours (11pm). I enjoy developing my people and helping them reach their goals.
good,"Being a cashier , Utilize data-bank system to search for merchandise orders for the customers,sometime we don't have what the customer need so we have to special order it for them, management often helps, co-workers are fun to be around they will help you out when needed,the hardest part of my job was Inventory maintenance a, its noting too enjoyable our management didn't create anything fun for there employees"
good,I enjoyed my job at auto zone. I loved looking at the outdoors while delivering parts.
good,When I worked here the commercial department was a mess but very profitable. They have made many improvement since.
good,this was a great job. great way to learn about car and parts. this was a great job. I'v learn so much from this job. it thought me how to interact with customers and how to be a perple person.
good,"i think it was a good job, although it was a full time position with the benefits it could have been way better. The main thing that i didnt like was that everyone was more about speed then the quality of the sale. They didnt really have great customer service skills just enought to do the job."
good,"AutoZone is an extremely fast paced environment where hard work is acknowledged and innovation is rewarded. While at most companies, the lenght of service looks like a bell curve, at AutoZone, it is more like an inverse bell curve, which means that 40% of Corporate employees (AutoZoners) are long term. Has a great Stock Purchase plan in addition to a Safe Harbor 401(k) plan. Develops and fosters a strong culture of support around Customer Service, and has great earnings in good as well as bad economic times, so job security is better than many other industries. Must be very organized, able to multi-multi-task and work in an extremely fast paced environment to be successful, though the company offers many venues and types of training and self-improvement."
good,After losing key personnel in upper management I found that the job was more about sales and related sales. I feel like customer service is one of the most important things in any business
good,"I worked over 10 years, there's a lot of turn over. There are competitive pay and benefits, but advancement is based on who likes you, not how good you are at your job. Not as much coaching to do better better as they say they will offer."
good,I get to work immediately picking orders. Pack parts for delivery. I enjoy working with the customers. I drive for 12-13hrs and love it. Great management too
good,Good place to work but compensation could be better wth longevity.  Benefits are pretty good they offer wide range of benefits but with the low pay you would spend a fairly large amount of your paycheck if you were to partake of everything offered.
good,I have worked at AutoZone for about 4 months and while I like the job because it is slow and boring it also doesn't pay much and its boring. So I get paid to sit around for half of my shift doing nothing most days which is a plus and a minus.
good,AutoZone is a good company to work for as long as you can handle long days and lift heavy merchandise.  The work schedule is not posted until Thursday for Sunday shifts so you cannot make plans more than week in advance.
good,Not the best job ever. Had some fun working with this company though. Co workers are what make it the time worth while. Management was not best in my opinion
good,The store manager was awesome and most of the managers. Of course every job has its ups and downs but there was a particular manger there that was very lazy and only did the bare minimum and continues to get away with it. Disappointed but overall pretty good store.
good,"Often understaffed considering level of service expected"
good,"To be fair, Autozone has great management as far as encouragement and training you to move up in the company. I can honestly say, I have never worked anywhere, where they encourage you to look ahead and try to advance your career in the company more than here.  The real downside to working here is that as a store manager, your work/life balance is terrible. You are required to work a minimum of 50 hrs a week. The stores run at bare minimum, so any call outs and you are scrambling find someone to cover that shift, otherwise you will end up covering it. The only real knock to management is that they are truly delusional as to why part-timers quit or they appear delusional because they have to tow the line. Turnover is really high because they pay so little that most people leave at the chance to make $.50 more an hour.  Either way its a great opportunity to move up quickly and gain real world experience to use when looking to advance your career elsewhere.  There are store managers that have been with the company 20+ years (mainly because it takes a lot of resolve to be a store manager, so job security is sky high), but there is no way I can remain here under these conditions for more than 10."
good,"Autozone, in my opinion, is at this time (2019) is not a great place to work. Although it does offer great benefits, I experienced problems with support management. I asked for a transfer to a more stable store more than one year ago and was only offered one possibility where I would have had to take a 15% pay cut and had my hours reduced from 45-50 per week to 35-40. Although I did expand my work experience, I now feel like I gave the company too much of my time (9 years) and effort for what I got from them...little support to be able to do my job to the best of my capabilities."
good,Recently moved back to this area and applied at Autozone wasn't expecting to be called for an interview as I had applied to the company before. Was pleasantly surprised when I was called for an interview and even more surprised when I was offered the job. I actually look forward to going to work each day but that fades after a few hours of dealing with demanding and impatient customers. All in all still better than a kick in the pants.
good,I deal with customers and auto parts the other employees are easy to get along with and will help if you're having troubles and questions that you may have
good,"Other workers are great. Busy most of the time. A lot of heavy lifting and climbing ladders. Management within the store is great! Outside the store the upper-management is all about sales, money, and bonuses."
good,Great company to work for. Opportunities for growth are plenty and solely based on individual performance and merits. Strong culture in customer service but also cares for its employees.
good,"To be honest, the company itself is great to work for but your experience at Auto Zone will all depend on your management set. Your store manager and District manager is really where your experience will be determined, as well as your growth"
good,"Not bad, but not great either.  One of the better jobs I've had but mostly due to the people I worked with.  In store computer systems were awful due to poor software plagued with bugs."
good,As long as the team you work with is oriented towards working together as a team the store atmosphere can make working here good.  The issues more lies with the upper management and how they tend to treat anyone under Corporate rankings for instance anyone beneath the District Manager position can tend to expect being treated unfairly at times and being asked to constantly meet unrealistic goals without the proper team. Pay rate isn't equal to workloads My Salary is strictly with some of the overtime I made as a basis for reaching my yearly income not a legit only 40 hr work week.
good,I loved Helping people and work with a few good people and it helps with my management skills and to help people from all walks of life it keeps u on your toes
good,"Sales, Customer Service, Sales Goals"
good,Autozone offered a very educational environment and allowed for fair and attainable advancement within the company. I found the work environment to be very uplifting and management to be knowledgeable and helpful.
good,"Not a bad place to work, but they will stick you out on team runs for a week when they need somebody. Even after telling them you can't sleep in a truck going down the road."
good,"Supervises operation of the store and team members, opening/closing/changing shifts, and task delegation to team members."
good,Everyone should be equally train we no short cuts n be a listener when an employee as crying out for help all Dm need to get to know store managers and actually listen
good,"If you are competent in the automotive field, you will excell at the sales level at autozone. However pay is comparable to standard retail, leaving little incentive to remain."
good,Not something you would work for long-term wise but its a good opportunity to gain work experience for future reference. Helped me learn how to pace myself instead of tiring myself out. the management are very helpful during work or outside of work.
good,giving great customer service is  very important to  company success and what we are required to uphold from the day you are hired. the culture could be much better.
good,"I clocked in, found out from my manager what I was supposed to start working on. I greeted customers when they came into the store, and asked them if they needed help with anything. I also answered phones, and worked at the cash register. I liked it in certain ways, but it was hard because no matter what the situation with the customer, they were always right."
good,Was a very good place of employment. All the people got along with everyone. Would recommend this job to anyone with automotive knowledge. Would be better for little better pay and benefits.
good,My experiences with Autozone were vast yet unfortunately short. Shareholders in the company stock have had a tendency of focusing on conserving operational costs as opposed to focusing on adequate training. As a result the employment turnover rate at the time I worked there was roughly 98% a year. I survived in that company for over two years and progressed within 9 months of being there attaining a management position.
good,"When I opened the store I fill out morning logs. Count the money drawers. Check in returns. then ooen the store to customers."
good,Working with autozone distribution center helped me learn a lot about time management and fast pace work. They should do better checks on people they hire
good,"DM's management style varies tremendously. We've had a region, and depending on which DM you had greatly changed how you felt about your career / company"
good,"From changing batteries to changing headlights, you are expected to do wittgtjr (what it take to get the job right). As a manager i am constantly stressed because people come in expecting mechanics when in reality autozone hires anyone competent enough to get thrown to the wolves. If you survive and can deal with difficult customer and pay that doesn't justify the effort you put into the job then this place is for you."
good,"I enjoyed my time working here. I had a good manager at the store I worked at. The only reason I left was because the pay wasn't that great. I was at the highest pay scale for my position, and there were no higher positions open at the time."
good,So much work for the pay. How do they expect people to stay? Store will be bare for a long time then get super busy in 5 minutes. Customers are usually not understanding ever.
good,Good place to work nice benefits they offer full-time positions and part-time positions also have excellent health care benefits and easy hours schedules are fixed with one hour lunches
good,The company as a whole has a decent management set up but the logic behind a lot of what they do is redundant. Its a good job if you want part time hours or just need a job to pass through.
good,Had three DM’s only one seemed as if he cared about the employees. Also feel they don’t give you the necessary tools and essentials to do the job effectively and efficiently.
good,Had great coworkers and some  of management was great as well. If your into cars and want a discount on parts this is the place. I did learn a few tricks with some repairs and parts knowledge  that has helped out alot.
good,"Sometimes you get some really difficult customers, lack of security, not enough pay but you good day were it just feels like time flew, greeting customers, cleaning & stocking shelves, planograms and assisting customers with needs be it looking for a battery or light bulb."
good,"It is a fun  place to work when the customers are friendly, but when they are not, or in the winter time changing batteries you quickly realize you do not get paid anywhere near what you should be."
good,"It's a great place to work but with lack of advancement and relaxed hours, great place to work but pay will not be what is expected sometimes even tries to give you something else than promised."
good,"A day at work is to check and manage to get done as much as  I can. I had learn a lot, I made this job my career for years and never gave up on keep on learning. My coworker are the always the best part of my job and my costumers that became my friends."
good,Working at autozone had its ups and downs like any other company. The biggest issue was staffing. Trying to run a thriving business being short of staff over extended period of times wears you down .
good,"The particular store I work at is great, people wise that is. The fact that I've been there for over 2 years and I've been told that I would be considered for a higher position whilst being passed up continuously for another candidate is basically infuriating. Only reason I haven't left was promise to gain higher positions. I'm still waiting for that."
good,"I started here with no knowledge of cars, but was hired because of my customer service background. I learned a lot about cars, but still would never work on one on my own."
good,this company has a  lot  of things that it needs to fix they need to train the people in the upper  leadership rolls  better than what they have been doing in the past its hard to deal with people who think that they are better than other people  because of there position in the company its like they think that they are untouchable
good,Not really a job for females that dont like to get dirty there's a lot of refunds and exchange going on as a woman the men always assumed i didn't do anything but cash you out when in fact i had been trained on everything.
good,"It was a good, job but they do not pay you very much. The people are easy to get along with, and the supervisors are great at listening and helping you"
good,"They have new management now and she great to work for and if I still lived in the area I would return and I rated it off her, because she was shift manager when I was working and she was great then and should been head manager at that time I probably would stayed"
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. It was not easy resigning. However the schedule is very un manageable. No set schedules are allowed or set days off. I could not manage my family life and the job any longer. I chose my family.
good,"I have nothing to say. I worked long hard hours and worked a lot of overtime for them. "
good,"When working there will be short staffing if the manager was not present since he had most of the workers around  the time he worked. For the most part were nice, but there are handful of people who would come in and be rude and inpatient  especially if were had some trouble finding their parts."
good,"It can be a great place to work if you know what your doing. Ive seen people get hired with no automotive experience and struggle. Also seen newcomers strive as well, its all based on your ability to push yourself. "
good,al ambiente es agradable con gerentes aceptables en laboral
good,"Great, Relaxed Environment. Working for AutoZone you have the potential to learn a lot about Vehicles. If you love working on your own vehicles the discount comes in handy. Hardest part of the job was just dealing with any unhappy customers."
good,The usual day was fast paced with not alot of Associates to handle things at times.  Made the day go by fast and slept well at night.  Long hours for Management because of the demands.
good,Work atmosphere can be improved. Commerical department is competitive in nature and encourages innovation. There is a lack of advancement and not much transparency with upper management.
good,"Working there was a fun experience ive learned alot about cars and learned on my social skills, its very beneficial, i dont have to spend tons of money on my car when i could buy parts for cheaper and do it myself"
good,Retail work. Hours and employees always changing. Work on holidays and weekends. If you want more consistent hours and lifestyle than this is not the type of job you want.
good,"Very culture driven"
good,The work environment is good.  I enjoyed working with the customers that came in on a regular basis.  The turnover of associates is the hardest part of the job which is typical in most retail businesses.
good,"Focus on customer service, daily tasts and sales. Learned more of the parts that Autozone. Management are skilled and willing to help new employees. Hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule. Enjoyable part of work is the employees."
good,Nothing to say about this company or of the time that I worked there. There’s lots to do to keep yourself and others busy.  You always need to stay on top of your work load Monday thru Sunday.
good,"A typical day at work was at times were challenging, stressful, and at times good. I learned how to stay focus, keep pushing through all the negativity. Management needs help and more training on people skills, how to treat your employees, and on how to keep environment less stressful. The workplace culture was good. Hardest part of the job is when there is no team work. The most enjoyable was satisfying my customers!"
good,"Great place to work, as long as you have a good team to stand with. Day to day tasks are minimal, customers are great for the most part.  The job is definitely one to keep you busy."
good,It is great to help and interact with the customers. The team is great to work with and make the time at work go by fast. I enjoy working there but have decided to seek full time which meets more of my skill level.
good,Auto Zone Commercial is a fast-paced environment. You need at least the basic knowledge of automotive parts. You learn as you go but you have to be really good at memorizing any information.
good,I liked autozone i feel like i was under paid for my knowlege base and i literally know every component of a vehicle  and i was started off at 8.00 an hour and others even the females were startex of a ten and knew nothing and i was doing all outside work sounds sexist but thats just how it is and i loved the job but my work oeers never really helped me it was like i was working all alone while everyone else was playing on their phone and managment really wouldnt say anything so my management position was like a regular job because i was the only stern one but nobody would help me enforce it
good,i really enjoyed working for auto zone until t was a management switch and i started to get less hours and less work days and then was relocated and then relocated again then lost my job
good,"Auto Zone is a typical retail establishment so don't expect wonderful pay. You are paid on an hourly base but are expected to sell extra add on items. Depending on who your management team is selling these items could make or break you. Ive seen managers give less hours to people who don't sell. "
good,Most days are fast past with the amount of customers received in one day but in down time between customers employees joke around and talk about cars and what problems other cars may have. It is a demanding job when always trying to be number one for the customers which is understandable but sometimes the customer just doesn't care but not always.
good,"Good structure and procedures."
good,I like it besides the pay is terrible and it takes for ever to get a raise. There is a bunch of not needed things you have to do. But it's better than nothing
good,Not many managers acknowledge employee's hard work and there's not much room for improvement. It is a good experience to learn automotive but not many people stay long term.
good,"Working for Auto zone had its ups and downs,  working with the public can be a delicate situation depending on who you meet so you have to be a people person to keep your customers happy. I would stock shelves when truck delivery's would arrive and answer the phones to provide availability and prices on parts."
good,"Quick paced job long hours must be flexible, "
good,"Decent Hours at first, but can be inconsistent at times."
good,Stressful work environment. Hardly no breaks or lunch. Scheduling was irregular. The work hours were very long. Constant callouts and difficulty to navigate store.
good,"great company to work for, hours are always flexible. customers for the most part are great the main problem is the lack there of in leadership and dicipline"
good,"I was the one who would put up all the hard parts.                             I had to stock everything in shelves, and when parts were missing I had to stock more out."
good,"I advanced quickly with AutoZone. Easy to use system, very strong culture.  Management was flexible with scheduling, working around school and family needs."
good,Learn a great deal about the automotive industry. Management is very friendly and caring. Hardest part of the job is being understaffed. Most enjoyable part is accurately helping customers correct vehicle iussues.
good,Autozone was a fun place to work. Once promoted to Manager you are used and abused. You do not get compensated enough for everything you do. Job has many hours available to work and options for advancement.
good,"Typical day at work is helping customers find their parts, making sales, restocking shelves, and other tasks around the store. Good place to learn basics on cars."
good,good job very good if your trying to learn more about cars. its great if your a patient person then working with customers will be easy and i rate this job a five out of ten.
good,the new manager we finally got is awesome that was after I was already found a new job.  That was really hard on the entire team.  After he came it was so much better in no time wish I never left.
good,Dont do this if you have bills that need to be payed. They pay next to nothing and do not offer good raises. Less than 50 cent raises a year. No good for people who work hard.
good,"As a manager you had a flexible schedule, that helps with the work, life balance. The culture of the company is fun and out going. One down fall is working every weekend."
good,"Overall its a great company to work for. The work environment can be a bit frustrating dealing with rude customers, but that is part of the learning experience to becoming a better manager. The upper management is a part of your daily routine so no slacking off. The hardest part of working there I would say is having to work with coworkers that are not experienced in automotive parts. The company prefers someone without any experience so they can be trained to the companies standard. In my opinion thats not the greatest way to giving the customer the friendliest advice. They expect you to know what you are looking for and want you to give them the correct parts they need to repair their vehicle."
good,"Working for Autozone is good. Like any other retail job, it can get a bit hectic work wise/ customer satisfaction. If you're looking to work for Autozone, be prepared for the different characters that walk through those doors."
good,Worked fast pace driving 8-10 hours daily as many as 3 trips to Galveston in one day. Scheduled to drive in rain or shine. Job has good benefits - but driving in poor weather conditions should be a consideration from management.
good,Not much automotive knowledge needed. Their system is easy to use and navigate. You do learn a lot about the different types of components and their functions through the system and by the more experienced staff.
good,"Pretty relaxed but doesn't pay well. Different schedule every week. It's nice to be able to request a week off if you want but it's difficult not knowing when you will work next week. Upper management is full of themselves and loves ""catching people"" messing up. They make you wear a uniform but make you buy it. Not a company that values it's employees."
good,With this job I loved being around the customers . I also loved that I was challenged with the knowledge of cars. I was also challenged by the men that work there and the customers.
good,"My manager gave me as many hours I wanted to work to make up for starting out at only 10. Was a parts delivery driver. Knowing more than one language definitely would help, I don't know Spanish, so that did set me back a little in communicating effectively with customers in the area. Management will give you the hours, but can't promise more pay until after a certain amount of time."
good,Not that bad of a place if you're fresh out of highschool and know a little about cars. I enjoyed the regular customers and befriended a few. I had fun but pay is low and it is frustrating dealing with the public to me.
good,"I enjoyed Autozone for the most part. They were really easy to work for while going to school and always worked around my classes. I do have minor complaints on their compensation for sales and extra work completed, but it's not a major issue. Overall it is a great place to work part time from my experiences."
good,"Getting the negatives out of the way first. The management sucked. My store had 3 store managers in the nearly 3 years I worked there, and a few several month periods with no assigned store manager. This was mainly due to my store being in a bad part of town, it got robbed several times a year. I was robbed at gunpoint and expected to return to work the next day. This was a traumatizing event, company didn't care. Assistant Manager almost got me killed. My last store manager stole from the store which resulted in my termination because I didn't catch it, which is unfair and wasn't my job. On the bright side I enjoyed my job. Hired in part time at the parts counter. Only responsibilities were stocking. cleaning, selling parts, and minor installation. About 1 year in I was promoted to mid level Management at the store. Increased responsibility to some store banking and inventory management, employee training, and some other things. However during the times we had no Store Manager most of those responsibilities fell to me, without much training and no increased pay. Pay was decent for a college student living at home, but looking back wouldn't be enough for me now. Benefits and discounts were pretty good though."
good,"My job is fast paced and strenuous at most times but it has its slower moments from time to time. I cannot speak highly of current or past management, but most of the average employees aren't hard to work with. There is room for advancement but not much ability to create change. From my standpoint, there is no worthy incentive to advance into management. The hours you'll work become less desirable, and there is no real support amongst colleagues. However, the atmosphere that is created between peers, is what makes it worth going everyday. It's usually that lighthearted and spirited interaction that gets me through the day."
good,"Working here is great and all, but there are a lot of downsides. Hardwork is hardly noticed. Customer satisfaction is a challenge. Managers care for themselves and not for fellow employees."
good,"It is a job were you have to work very hard to get promoted.At first i found it very exciting and intriguing, but i was later disappointing because I know that i have more knowledge and have worked very hard, but still came short in becoming a manager. I have been there longer then some managers their, but for some reason my store manager always found an excuse for not making me manager."
good,It is same as previous I mentioned. From this I learn new continuously. Enjoyable parts when nothing obstructing our work. Like parts & worker if it is available easily we can do more fast work.
good,"A few things great, some things not so great. Working here as a ""youngin'"" at 18 years old prevented me from getting a position with more responsibility, even though I out performed my peers with factual numbers. Instead they hired people from out of the company to be my manager, come in late while I waited at the front door, on time, and seldom showed up for work at all."
good,"I worked for the company while I was in college. The flexibility in scheduling was a great benefit during that time. Since I worked with my friends, the environment was usually pretty fun and energetic"
good,A typical day at AutoZone is doing the same thing everyday can get stressful at times. The Management plays favorites for sure. The best part of this job is the job security.
good,"Start each day getting goals, numbers needed, making sure employees were taking proper breaks. Automotive is a great opportunity to learn about and I enjoy every bit of it. Customers are always a plus as well knowing so many mechanics always comes in my favor of course. The hardest part is not being able to assist everyone at once. Overall the total involvement with customers, car parts, getting under the hood is priceless."
good,Stressful work environment at times but overall easy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to work in mechanics. Customer service is best if you like working with people
good,"Wait on customers, troubleshoot car issues, fight with the computer system, cash handling, clean, stock etc. Like any other store. The store itself is not that bad. Raises are notoriously low even if you bust your rear end to do a great job."
good,",  upper management don't have a clue as to how to run a store or what it takes ,Dm hands are tied when are losing good help because the don't have enogh help to run the stores  always busy ,not enough help  pay is good"
good,"Global Chance LLC,which has diversified their business to reach all types of customers in the society across Oman.The group is involved in the business like hyper markets & restaurants other than their automobile division : New Autozone"
good,"This job is for people who can carry heavy things and does not mind having to stand for a super long time. The customers are always rude, they don't have consideration with the work you do, so be ready for that. The employees only care for themselves and hate to help new employees."
good,"A mix bag due to the retail environment"
good,"At Autozone I learned a lot from managerial things, running payroll, delegating tasks, interviewing potential candidates and I became more fluent in my spanish. Great place to gain work experience."
good,I would still be with autozone today of they would come off of more money. 10/hr is not enough to run a store run employees make schedules and be responsible for thousands of dollars.
good,Fun place to work until you get an irate customer that can't get to the liqour store because the warranty on the part you sold him has run out and now he's broke down and doesn't want  to spend beer money on auto parts.
good,"Work is very taxing and very repetitive. The management can tell you if you HAVE to work the next day or two, or make you come in 3 days in a row a hour early. I HATED my job there but had to do it. It really wasn't for me. But a lot of people I knew there were OK with it. So you might try it. But know what you are getting into. I could only handle it for a year."
good,"Learned to work with customers over the phone, how to handle people, getting them to calm down and fix there problems. Worked with a lot of different software including billing, crediting software and device minulation software"
good,"Review pretty much says it all. Hard manual labor and little break facilities; as to keep cost down."
good,"Working for autozone was fun, but the managers would never take your side in any type of situation, As more employess got hired, everybodys hours got cut and so I went from 40hrs a week to 20. From there it just got worse."
good,Operations run well. Managers are great. Learn new things everyday. Coworkers treat you with respect. Environment is clean and healthy. Never a dull moment
good,"I had to order parts for automotive repair centers, order product for store, cash out registers at the end of night. My co -workers were very nice and miss working with them and the job was fairly easy."
good,Contratan personal sin experiencia solo por el puesto que tienen en el trabajo anterior
good,Never really moved up with autozone being a driving didn't have many latters as far as making it a carrier wish commercial had better option for drivers.
good,"AutoZone provides a good place to work in the downtown area. Each department has pros and cons, but overall this is a good company. You just need to get in the right department."
good,I was hired right before my 21st birthday & prior to this I was going from job to job thru staffing agencies. So it was hard keeping a job after certain job met their deadline. Once I was hired at Autozone I was given the chance to grow & in a little over 4 years with the company I went from a part time sales associate to Commercial Sales Manager running my own department. I'm very grateful for having been given this opportunity & to finally grow with a company & as an adult. But after 4 years I feel like it's time to move on & look towards my future & future career.
good,"On a typical day I help customers find parts and tools to start or complete their projects, mainly automotive parts. I've learned how to speak and help customers in person, and sometimes over the phone. We recently had a change in management change. The hardest part about my job is not knowing enough about vehicle parts."
good,"enjoyed helping people but never  knew what you would be walking into on any given day pay was an issue no holiday pay . "
good,Very fast pace work. Lot of time spent on the road. I have learned a lot about parts for vehicles and where they are located on the vehicles. The management is great. Management is always willing to answer all questions and help when needed. Everyone works as a team and does the same job. The hardest thing of the job can be helping customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers get the parts they need.
good,This is solely a fill-in job in-between full-time college and paying bills. I am currently searching for a career in public relations while I keep my steady job. That is all.
good,This was a very good workplace aside from the crime around the parking lot and surrounding are from time to time. They have a very good cast of workers there and they really work together to make it a nice work enviroment.
good,se tienen que llevar demasiados reportes en el dia se exige demasiado y 8 horas al dia no bastan para terminar lo que se pide
good,"The company is easy to move up in if you have the right management above you. Yearly raises are good but the down fall is the starting pay, especially for non-management is extremely low and because of that if you are a manager you are constantly short handed"
good,The hardest part of the job is managing the new generation of Millinials. The most enjoyable part is to be able to help customers solve their problems.
good,when i work I'm always greeted with great positive energy and customer are nice it a great place the manager are nice people to work with the regular employees are cooliest people to work we work as a team it work out perfect the District manager is nice and seem like a person unless u don't behave or disrespect the job then he turn in to a person u never want to meet
good,"Autozone is great company to get into for retail and customer service. It is also an easy company to advance in as long as policies are followed and sales are consistently met. I started as a commercial driver and I am currently an assistant store manager. Four of those years, I was half time, going to school. The company does not do much for college grads, which is why I am pursuing other avenues, career wise. Benefits as a manager are pretty standard. Healthcare is good, for today. The hardest part of this job, after five years, is keeping my heart in it. I know everything I need to know. I just dont have the drive anymore. I need something to push me. Everything is the same, everyday."
good,"Some days where busy while others where slow and grinding. Started as parts / customer service, then got promoted to parts manager. Overall duties where the same, except now had to work with management more closely and ordered products and dealt with inventory."
good,answer customer calls help with trouble shooting paving machines help with finding parts for paving machines updating service and parts manuals
good,Great job if you don't have regular commitments or like to schedule activities in advance.  Spend the day helping customers and maintaining the store.
good,its ok. its just they demand a lot from you especially when they go and hire lots of people who have no knowledge about cars.
good,"Fast pace work environment, good management, there was always work to be done and parts to be pulled. If you like a fast pace environment, this is the job for you."
good,"rush hour, expected to meet sales and are made , hardest part of the job is to get everyone tho hit wittdtjr above 40% and we are below that and we get held accountable and it looks bad on us.. co-workers are stable.. and management well i believe some need more experience"
good,This job was fun at times and it was always busy. I was able to expand on what they initially hired me for. I became a drive and delivered products to clients. I met new people instead of being stabilized in one area. It was an overall ok experience.
good,"Must have strong leadership ,communication,problem solving,great customer serves,the ability to work well with other,listening ,take the control of customer problem,teamwork,controling inventory,merchadising"
good,The managers push you so that you can be better at your job. They are all so understanding as well. I was pregnant while working with this company and i knew something wasn't right. they told me to go to the hospital and get checked out and to let them know what was going on. I was then placed on bed rest for a week. and my job was there for me when I came back.
good,"I work with Auto Zone in two different areas, Oxnard and Bakersfield. Even though it was the same company, It seemed completely different because of the difference in areas. The company had high expectations in both areas yet, there was a big difference in how it was passed down from upper management down to local management."
good,"Everyday, was very fast pace, helping customers with finding car or motorcycle parts. helped out the commercial part of Auto zone with taking orders and delivering the parts to their shops.I worked the cash register and parts programs. "
good,"My time at Autozone has allowed me to gain experience working with customers face to face, often when they are at their worst. Few people are happy that their vehicle is in need of repair. Therefore I have learned much about how to make a customer happy as well as how to ensure their continued business and brand loyalty."
good,steady and busy workplace....supervisors are helpful and cooperative. Expect the unexpected and be ready to adapt.will have time to enjoy learning
good,Overall the Lincoln Park AutoZone is a good place to work. The HUB area is pretty busy. I have learned to work with some physical limitations to be able to do more than I thought I would be able to do at this point. This was also the hardest part of the job. This was my first retail experience so I have learned a lot in my time with this company.
good,This was a cool place too work only if you didn't have any kids are a family coworkers were cool an helpful I enjoyed the help part about the job an the environment
good,Over all this can be a good place to work. You will find yourself learning something new each and every day. And if you like the automotive field this may be a good match.
good,"mostly customer service, cash register, setting planograms, helping store manager with daily store operations as opening and closing tasks, managerial paperwork, store schedule, preparing and putting up truck each week"
good,"Very busy.  Both phones and customers might flood at any moment.  Makes for an exciting day, never boring.  There is always something to do.  Tasks are plentiful, so not always able to finish right away, at the expense of assisting customers.  But talking cars with customers and staff delivers many wonderful stories."
good,"The average day had your typical work that had to be completed, however there were always circumstances that would have to be attended to as a manager."
good,"AutoZone was as you would expect, kind of slow retail sales position. Management was awesome, if pay was better I would definitely go back."
good,"Good work environment, but you will be belittled by many customers."
good,"The most enjoyable part was helping people who thought a ""girl"" didn't know anything about cars. I learned that there are a lot of DIY people out here."
good,My time at AutoZone was enjoyable  a typical day at work was to help customer with their needs and concerns. I learned something new every day that was the best and enjoyable part of my job. My co-workers were great i liked working with all of them.
good,Management isn't great and doesn't know to communicate with staff. People don't know get along with one another and people all is always starting problems to try to get them fired.
good,"If your starting in the work force, not a bad place to start. They take care of their workers fairly well and will give you skills to move forward. "
good,I had about 20 jobs shoved into one position and was pulled in many different directions.  I  learned a great deal in this position. The regional manager in the Washington D.C. was pretty easy going as long as things were going accordnding to plan.  Benefits and salary could have been better for sure.
good,Company is lacking in a overall care of its employees. They offer opportunity to promote at a quick pace but do not provide sufficient incentive for overall productivity. Typically employees are undervalued and deemed replaceable which creates a non-committed workforce.
good,"If you are a car buff,with general knowledge of vehicles then Autozone is the place for you. "
good,"At Autozone we had to take care of customers, greet them at the door and get them the rights parts for their vehicles. The most enjoyable part was helping customers. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with inventory."
good,"Helping customers with was they needed.Putting stock away and get "
good,I learned a lot while working at Autozone.  I managed a group of individuals that were talented in thier own right.  I learned a lot about vehicles and myself as a manager and person. Autozone had really good benefits to go along with the self motivated environment.
good,Autozone is a typical retail sales environment. They were ale to work with my school schedule and give me enough hours to cover my personal expenses.
good,I enjoyed working here. It was fun to be a female and see the look on the customers faces when I knew exactly what they wanted. It was challenging to convince some to the male customers that I truly knew what I was talking about.
good,"My typical work day includes part look-up, checking customer fluid levels in vehicles, installing batteries, windshield wipers and light bulbs, etc. I learned about car parts and the functions of those various parts. The work environment is well except the lack of communication of management. The hardest thing about the job is learning all the various car parts. The most enjoyable thing about the job is a satisfied customer."
good,"The scheduling was the worse out of the entire experience. The manager by the end of every week (Satuday) creates a schedule so you dont know when you will work the next week until the schedule is posted. If a customer asks to change the battery of their car, you would have to go to the customer car yourself and do the entire process including the cashier transaction RAIN OR SNOW. Opening hours were mostly 7am till close which was 11pm. Lunch is not free. Managers were confusing and did not take anyone seriously unless a higher manager was present in the store. The Commercial team was the best experience i had since the team was enjoyable to work with, converse problems and easy on the duties/"
good,arrive at work around my desire hours and get the job done make sure all is up to pall also lead
good,"I was a cashier, stocker, and customer service. This job was a great experience."
good,"Immediate managers and co-workers were fun people. Loved working with them."
good,"I always loved the atmosphere at Wal-Mart. It was very hectic at times, but they always knew how to brighten your day."
good,"A typical day is giving selling parts, giving, advice, vehicle diagnostics. "
good,"varies from district to district. according to company policy if your full time, you have to be available from open to close, which i do not mind however when you receive your schedule on a friday night can be very annoying. you cant plan your week until you receive your life. If your a member of management is pretty much like your married to the store, which they dont pay enough. you never know what type of customer will walk through the door."
good,"came in on time, management sucked. but worked hard till there were better oppurtunities"
good,"I learned a lot while I was here, I just hit a professional wall where I could not progress any further."
good,"I receive a lot of orders from customers, then have to pull the item requested from inventory.  I then print out an invoice for the customer to sign. Then, I get in the company vehicle to take the requested part or parts needed. I also take inventory, sweep, take out trash, keep the front of the store clean, assist customers with minor tasks, look up parts needed, inspect company vehicles, pick up or drop off transferred parts, process checks, and do a count out on the cash drawer."
good,"Take order from customers using parts software, finding and pulling orders, verifying orders,"
good,"I worked here for two and a half years during college, pretty decent job"
good,"The employee didn't like the Manager, because he did very little work and braged about how he can just stand around and have every one else, work. So , in turn the crew would call off on his shift most of the time and myself and another asst. manager would have to come in. When you have poor leadership, you make a poor team."
good,Assisting customers in their automotive parts needs. Train other team members in policies and procedures. Had little help from upper management. The hardest part of the job was knowing the ideal long wait for becoming a store manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning more about the various automotive industry.
good,"Performed tasks to complete new, or re-sets  of Box ttpe Retail outlets."
good,"A typical day at work would include helping customers with any questions or concerns about vehicles, cleaning and front facing store front, and receiving/sending auto parts to mechanic shops. The hardest part of the job is managing bulk waves of customers; however, in the same it is the most enjoyable by being able to properly help the customers and give them the tips they need to do the job right. The management is great and friendly and is extremely flexible around my own personal schedule. I believe I have learned more working at AutoZone than I have at any other job so far."
good,its an ok place to work but the turn over in the store makes its hard sometime because than you have to work weeks at a time and maybe get one day off
good,A typical day consists of helping customers and giving them advice on their troubles that they're vehicle might come across. I learned about how cars work and I am able to diagnose any general car issues.
good,Benefits are lackluster unless fulltime employee.  Management does not take charge of situations in the store.  The district cuts hours at stores due to sales the day before and leaves store shorthanded.
good,"Each day is different.  No two customers are the same.  I enjoy helping people and making a difference in my customers life.  I try to be semi personal with some of the repeat customers just because they are not just a face, they ask me about my family too which makes it feel like I'm making a positive influence in their life.  Most of my co workers work together as a team, we support each other and act as a family.  I've learned more about cars and car parts and how cars operate."
good,As a Commercial manager I enjoyed my time at Auto Zone. Culture is changing and moving away from specialization toward a cross trained staff. Some difficulties there can be frustrating. Like any Commercial auto sales position you will be dealing with shops all day and trying to get product to them as efficiently as possible. This was more or less a priority at the store I worked. Not all stores are created equal. If you do not have the support of your store's General manager you'll have difficulty. Pay is standard for the industry and is not great. 
good,"I open the store, audit safe and registers. Help customers a lot of problem solving. I learned that customers are always right. Always want a customer to have the best experience. I manage a few employees make sure they are following dress code and taking lunches at schedule time. The hardest part of my job is re setting the store, but I am getting better at it. I pick up things quick and always have a plan. The most enjoable part of my job is the customers leaving with a smile and we provided them with the best service."
good,"Worked the registers, assist customers in the store or over the phone.  Co-workers somewhat got along.  Store manager was great, other managers were ok.   What I enjoyed the most was helping out the customers and doing my job."
good,"I had a great manager, that let us used the experience that we were hired for."
good,"Pros: Fast Paced Environment, Great Employees, Good Management, and Friendly and Helpful Staff."
good,":Stocking up shelfs, helping customers."
good,A decent place to work for little pay. Corporate culture is great but upper level management will treat you as replaceable.  You will meet some good people.  Poor pay.    
good,"mon-fri job nice to have weekends off good hours 8-5 hour lunches drove about 150 miles a day,friendly customers"
good,"Typical day at work: Store opens with two managers (referred to as grey shirts between coworkers) and one red shirt (non-management). Overstock items are pulled and put up by red shirt, Front counter is handled by one manager and the other manager sets up for commercial sales (AutoZone delivers parts to nearby shops). The store is operated in this fashion for two hours or so until other employees arrive. business is pretty steady most of the day with one or two ""rushes."" AutoZoners as we collectively called constantly step in and out of the store for many different reasons, commercial delivery, check engine light assistance, battery changes, bulb replacements, mechanical advice, lunch start / end. Employees are pressured to up sale and offer last minute sale items (AutoZone calls point of sale items, Check Out Challenge or COC). Stores usually close pretty late, 9 - 11 depending on location. Closing is pretty simple does not take a lot of time, 30 min tops."
good,All of my co workers was easy to work with. Management was easy to get along with. I liked going to work there
good,I learned a lot about how to fix and diagnose car troubles. I worked in a happy environment with my co-workers.
good,I have learned a lot working for this company. Personally and professionally.
good,Cold calling and canvassing for new business. Work the Norht Mississippi are calling on various business's requiring auto parts.
good,"I enjoyed working there because I was on the go all the time running here and there constantly, but they didn't appreciate a loyal employee like me .."
good,"Produce and approve competitive pricing on prospect applications submitted for pricing, while maintaining profit margins"
good,"Hard working dedicated employees who are loyal and take pride in their jobs. They succeed in spite of the lack of direction, support and maturity from management. Turnover at the Advisor position is indicative of this evaluation. The Advisors who stay live in the Danville area and have limited opportunities without relocation."
good,"Co-workers are fun to be around, I do my job and go home when it's time, I help out when need be. I've learned a lot about auto parts while working here."
good,Autozne was a work expierence that thought me about selling and organizing my time.Managment was always on task and the job was an easy task to accomplish.Co-workers were great workers and when i needed help good information sources.The hardest part of the job would be disposing toxic chemicals.Working the new freight was the most enjoyable part of the day i got a chance to see new merchandise and learn about it.
good,Opening Duties serve customers inventory deliveries every day was different
good,I took away from this job the ability to comuicate with customers to better serve and provide for the customers
good,I enjoyed working with the public and helping them with problems everyday. It feels good to see that you helped someone get back on the road.
good,It was a great place to work. It was fun helping people and hearing there stories.
good,"Autozone is a nice job to have if your looking for 15-20 hr a week. The job is simple, make sure your customers are happy. And if you don’t know, now you know."
good,I liked working in the automotive industry. Although it wasn't a very exciting or great paying job. It was a good entry level job though. Of course there are more benefits if you move up.
good,I had a great time at Autozone. I learned more about cars then I ever knew. The best part about being there was when a customer come in mad. I give them the best service and they leave happy and satisfied.
good,"Being a car enthusiast and DIY mechanic bi absolutely enjoyed working at AutoZone. The co-workers were great to be around although some customers were extremely rude , like any job I assume. My reason for leaving was because as I was promised advancement but instead a new hire with no experience took that position. The pay and benefits were not good for an individual that is trying to reach higher goals. I'd recommend this job more to a new high school grad or a part time worker."
good,With autozone you can 20 plus points and still have your job and you are only allowed 12 points before you are gone. Managers can poke lesser paid employees in the face and still have their jobs. If you are a manager you can always be late and still have your job.
good,Do as DM and RM say. Get used to parts not being in stock. Numbers are most important. Advancement is always there. Fun job. Hard to balance. Always an interesting day and will keep you on your toes.
good,"Sometimes, I feel like I don't get paid enough for what I do. And the annual evaluations are based off numbers instead of how we react and treat our  customers."
good,"Under management not well trained , although alot of good people work there."
good,"High stress on upselling. I had a great team and I miss working with them. Great store manager. The pay was very competitive at the time, and the company still pays better than some of its competitors. 20% employee discount except on oil, antifreeze, transmission fluid, etc."
good,I like being able to help people and have them leave my store satisied. I also enjoy work in a team environment but also being able to complete tasks on my own.
good,"I started out knowing very little about vehicles, but you learn quickly as you go, especially with the translations, which is good because you have to apply that knowledge and experience to help customers that sometimes know even less."
good,"Buenas prestaciones, y estabilidad laboral."
good,For the most part it's a good place to work. The money is not good at all though if you are living on your own with a family to support. This type of job would be better suited for someone still living at home. You cannot support a family on nine dollars an hour.
good,AutoZone has a calm environment but sometimes you'll interact with rude customers or employees other than that it is a nice place to work especially if you need a part-time job while going to college.
good,Not sure but it was a learning experience. It was fun to meet different type of people was happy I could help a customer out with changing their batteries or lights.
good,"Nice place to work. Being the inventory specialist, I was given the freedom to make my own schedule and to preform tasks at my own pace without any supervision."
good,Very good starter job for the young people and a very good for retirees too. The pay isn't great but the working conditions are more than fair. Nice people to work with and for. Good training programs with the time to learn your job.
good,Was given a management position right out of the gate. Made my photo in the yelp page shortly after and have been recognized for my hard work and attitude buy district and store managers. Thankful for everything but I feel my talents will be well compensated elsewhere.
good,"Auto zone was an ok job.  It started out great but things changed when we moved into the new building.  It became more stressful , management became secretive and they became stressed out. We got carts that allowed you to pull 9 stores at a time which added physical stress to your body.  We had a lot more injuries because of the added weight .. the work itself isn’t hard .."
good,Work is great but the bosses can be a bit rough. Mind you most of my bosses are great dont get me wrong but there's those chosen few like at every job
good,"I started this job with very basic automotive knowledge as a red shirt and over six years later, I am still here."
good,"After 6+ yrs as a parts sales manager, I was making less than than what a cashier makes at the local grocery store. The company likes to put a carrot on a stick for people they need to keep, but, have no intention on promoting. They push sales and KPI's and enjoy shaming and berating store managers weekly for not making goals. In fact, I had a store manager once, who was attending a funeral for his father. He was required to call the store once a day to remind the store on focus points. Almost every other retail store I've seen has multiple departments specializing in different areas of the business. I.E. receiving, customer service, phone calls, accounting, sales, planograms/stocking. As an employee, you are responsible for it all. They only allow the bare minimum staffing the maximize profits. So, you are constantly in motion from one task to another. You've probably seen the long lines of customers waiting for assistance.. The only priority is to take cash from the customer and put it in the register. They track every metric and will threaten write ups for not selling little packets of WITTDTJR. There is no commission or incentive for doing this (other than not getting called out for it). Only the store managers can win anything of significance during quarterly contests. And, by significance I mean company apparel."
good,the job was a fast pace and productive. really liked working there. Only problem was not enough hours and with management there was not that much communication when it came to their employees
good,"I did fine as a driver for Autozone. I did not like working the counter inside the store. Over time, you will be able to find parts. Dealing with customers over the phone or counter can be very difficult if you do not have a strong background as a mechanic."
good,"Very strong company with a track record of taking care of its employees and delivering to shareholders.  In many ways, they seem to be a victim of their own success.  Due to their successful history, there's reluctance to change or innovate quickly without several layers of management approving.  It seems more political than it needs to be."
good,"Corporate mentality. Do more with less help. It's all about the bottom line. I can't name one employee who is not stressed including the CEO."
good,"The warehouse,as expected, liked to focus more on safety and fast past working. This is a no fun/ strictly work location, where the managers treat you with little to no respect. As an Associate I never felt the respect i deserved from my advisers, their job is to guide and help towards the right direction. However, the advisers at this location treat you as if your robots and not once did i learn anything from my advisers I learned it all by myself and from other associates. This job is here for those who love warehouse work and don't mind to work alone because you hardly work as a team at Auto zone. In fact team work might as well be condemned. They like to focus on safety, but put you in a position where you have to do unsafe things to complete your task. The positive things that kept me at this job was the fast paced work and the positive environment made by the associates. I did learn a lot from this job, how to drive certain machinery, lifting products correctly, how to use an RF scanner, and most importantly I learned how to work at a fast paced job."
good,"My managers, co-workers, and work atmosphere were fun but I worked in a heavy african american neighborhood where everyone had a bad attitude or were just plain annoying. People didn't respect anyone or anything in the store or parking lot. One time someone bent my side view mirror and another time some old lady hit my driver door with her door and said sorry in the most uncaring voice. AutoZone's a great company but where I worked, I didn't even feel safe."
good,This is an ok place to work.  They push you to make sales goals. You have to stand all the time during work.  You have a point system to go by.  Calling out hurts everyone.
good,Flexible job. Not hard. Low pay. No advanced. No mental challenge. People don’t care about their work. Can’t get terminated for poor performance.  Weak mgmt
good,Good starting job but no good pay hands down great customers great employees but like I said they just don’t pay you good enough to stay there and you have to be full time to get great benefits
good,"It is work, sometimes it goes fast other times very slow, some days you get nice customers and other days not so much. The employees that I work with are great, management included. Overall its not a bad place to work if you know about cars and even if you don't believe me you will learn something either from the customers or the employees."
good,The work was easy mostly everyday you knew what to look forward to as far as work. You get to learn things about car if you dont already have and understanding about them.
good,I love working at auto zone it great experience and help me built on my customer service and people skill I am a quick l am good with my hand  customer love me
good,Definitely a good starter job because the pay is not good at all no helth benefits no 401k but it was a good and fun place to work for would have never left if they had  competitive wages and helth benefits
good,Great place to work depending on who’s managing the store!! I was doing everything in th building from parts delivery to cashier and stock. The store manger I started with got transferred and he took me with him.
good,"-Conservative"
good,"It's nothing special. Not very stressful and plenty of freedom to get work done in a comfortable way. It's your standard retail store, just with a specific focus on automotive products. Also, they provide opportunity to learn a lot of automotive knowledge on your own by hands on experience or by training modules."
good,I am appreciative for the opportunity i was given to gain some management experience to the local AutoZone in my college town. Everyone is willing to help you out when you are just learning the ropes and work is evenly distributed.
good,"Working in a hub store is probably much different than working in the regular locations but a typical day in the hub is pretty interesting. As a Hub Specialist, my day begins with picking parts ordered by the 50+ stores we serviced so my drivers can deliver them in a timely fashion. After the first of three runs depart, the distribution center's daily truck delivery arrives and I begin assisting with stocking the parts our hub has just receive while directing my employees to continue picking ordered parts for the next runs. As my drivers return from the first run of deliveries, they bring in returns from the other stores. I direct these drivers to stock the parts they have just brought in while preparing to load the next run after all of the parts have been picked. Before ending my day, I must work on fulfilling customer orders from stores we do not service (from other regions and states) with FedEx through AutoZone's vendor direct program."
good,Everyday I came in I had to pull the parts that were ordered from all the neighboring autozone stores and get them ready to be delivered to each store. This was done three times throughout the day everyday. Very routine.
good,Very flexible with hours. Fun environment to work in. However understaffed and not given enough people to get tasks/goals completed in a realistic time frame.
good,It is a great place to work for. The employees have  many opportunities to grow in the company and make a career. Autozone  offers great benefits as well.
good,"Open store clean and office work, catch up with all workload while receiving customers and doing fast and reliable service. Work is full of different scenarios where the mentallity you resolve them is what really matters."
good,"A lot of hype but little substance. "
good,"Expectations are extremely vigorous, management very demanding on issues that may seem inconsistent. Management very unsupportive, micromanaged to extremes."
good,Good people to work with and culture. Bad policy as far as their point system goes. Over worked under paid. Mangers bring home the same as entry level. Not worth the stress
good,This job does not meet any of the wants or needs for a long time job or career for me. Using this job simply to help pay for expenses while attending school.
good,While I have worked at multiple AutoZone locations the standard is always; attention to customers needs and to detail of the store to maintain a healthy appearance. Training team members allows for max potential and reach to convince customers of purchasing at locations. Some locations need a shake up in terms of management  but with appropriate staffing and training the store can become a place that people can enjoy to work at and connect with one another.
good,"Easy Work, Hour break, Just gets boring doing the same routes/ things everyday.Pay could be better get a 30 cents raise every year,All vans have air conditioning and Heating."
good,It is a good company to work for. I think they can do better in offering their employees better  benefits. It is a very stressful job. It not for everyone.
good,"It's a good job and you can have fun if you like to help out customers and get your hands dirty from time to time, but if you aren't really into cars it may seem like a boring place to be. Some days are more laid back than others."
good,"ok place to work, discount isn't much, only 20 prevent off in stock parts, pay is minimal, easy job to perform, management can be good or bad depending on location. culture is big here, hardest part is dealing with irate customers/commercial accounts"
good,"When I first hired in to Autozone the company was great, Over the years employees have fallen in respects as to what the company really thinks. Itis like they dont care as much anymore."
good,Great place to work all employees and management were great you can work at other stores to make up hrs or go to others stores for there yearly inventories and make extra hrs.
good,"I dont remember that much other than work was hard the manager was helpful the warehouse was clean but hot in the summer. they used there own trucks, there equipment was top notch."
good,The job is great but the pay scale is very low in comparison to knowledge needed to be successful and expected hours of availability. Can be very rewarding.
good,Experience all depends on location. Worked in a few different locations and every store had a different culture. Customers & honest management really makes the job worth while.
good,Management Sucks No Steady Schedule Somedays You Work Long Hours Others You Dont  Favoritism  Its Easy Work Its Just So Much Of It Pretty Strict About A Few Things
good,For someone who wants to get their feet wet in the automotive industry and learn the product this is a perfect place. They do not pay enough to support yourself though.
good,Great manager always worked great together. He knew I was reliable. The Store was a bit out of order but not due to management. There was no opportunity for advancement but I enjoyed my time there. It's a great 1st job for people fresh out of high school or just looking for extra income.
good,Not much room to grow on once you get To management that is the stopping point no room for dvsncement Also pay is slow to escalate and  are highly expected.
good,Is a great place to work for people who love to work in a customer service environment. A great start for people who aren't educated in mechanics. It will teach you the basics.
good,"AutoZone Distribution Center was a good place to work for. Although it seem to lack Maturity in some of their staff, it was not a bad company to work for. Their holiday schedule was Not at all Good, but i understand that it's a Distribution center and they tend to not have many days off."
good,"In order to work at a place like AutoZone, you must be very flexible. Some days it would be busy, others wouldn't. Or more, some hours might be busier than others and you must be quick on your feet in order to meet the demands."
good,"Lots of customer interaction, discounts for employee and family, going out of the way for customer satisfaction, Great employer, easy work schedule, could use better hours only down to the company, a lot of roles to be played by any employee"
good,Most people that worked at the store were very young and fun to work for the most part. they love to help people who didn't know anything about cars. its a good customers service job to do if you love helping people.
good,"My experience with AZ was a good one overall, there are several things within the company that were just not good, I will however credit to the company the amount of knowledge that I received while working there, however the management of some of the DM's and Managers was just unheard of. I came across of some amazing people that work with that company and built lasting friendships however when it came to some of the upper management like the District managers they were very nasty, rude and didn't want to the hear the complaints of the employees working under them. however let me stress that some of the DM's there are absolutely awesome I would name them but I am sure that I cannot, but let me just say this they were ALL men"
good,a very good starter Job for high school kids and just graduating college. if you do like cars I would recommend working here to learn more. growth is a little hard if you do not plan on making it a career
good,I loved my co-workers but no hours were available. There is not much room for advancement. Upper management is not quite as friendly as direct management.
good,"it was beneficial because it would teach you about communication skills in a fast pace environment. Other employees would help each other out when one didn't know, and the hours were always flexible."
good,You clock in and thats when you find out what will happen. There is always something that has to be done. most the the day you work with customers. Helping them with parts and simple installations
good,they where a freat company to work for. i wish i still worked for them. the work was great and i enjoyed it alot. i hope to one day to get rehired on there
good,AutoZone is a huge corporation out there in the world. They do not pay very well!! myself being employed as a manager for almost a year(been with the store for almost 4) making a dollar more than minimum wage is a deal breaker to leave.
good,"fast paced work, fun environment. ok pay for retail. good benefits. encourage advancement to motivated associates.  can get clickish at the district level"
good,inventor receiving part stocking shelve selling parts customer services  looking up parts making suggestions to improve customer satisfaction installing Batteries that customer purchased at the store
good,"Not much to say - the pay was great for the time, well over minimum wage. The work wasn't difficult, but management always seemed rushed and frazzled. Overall not a bad place to work for."
good,While working with Auto Zone I've definitely learned a lot in regards to inventory management and controlling payroll. Since I've been with the company I've been able to grow and expand my knowledge of the commercial sales industry and polish my supervisory skills. Although there hasn't been much opportunity for advancement from my current position I feel that if the opportunity was to present itself I would be more than prepared.
good,It's a good job other than people that think they run things. Your day goes by pretty quick if you stay steady working. Most people there are amazing people. The bosses are awesome. The benefits isn't that great at all.
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the customer interactions. Management is flexible and understanding of my flexibility with my other job hours. I only asked for 30 hours a month.
good,"Looking up sales reports, and orders. I learned a lot about cars, and car parts. Management is good now that I left. The old Store manager has been relocated. Great workplace culture. Hardest part was doing shipment on the heavy parts. Helping customers find the right parts."
good,"I did have an overall positive experience at Autozone.  They preach culture and it is reflected on the stores as a whole.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer that seemingly had nowhere else to turn, and making a difference in their day."
good,Great place to work for those who are or who are learning to become car enthusiasts. As you learn and confidence in working on your own vehicles. While receiving discounted parts.
good,a nice opportunity to gain experience. Spend most of the day interacting with customers and helping them troubleshoot their problems with their cars. Learn a lot about cars
good,we developed relationships with accounts to order to better serve them and had fun developing raffles and games to try better our sales to reach our goals
good,Autozone is a busy company. You will learn a lot from working there. Management is very strict and appearance is number one. The hardest part of the job of the assist store manager is doing the store managers job for them. I should be assisting not doing the job myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees I worked with they make the day go by faster.
good,"While the manager I worked for at my location of hire was personable yet professional, and made each shift drama free, the company directive of bending over backwards to assist customers is over and above what should be a retail standard. This is not a good thing. Sales associates are not certified mechanics and should not be expected to diagnose or install minor items. That's what shops or certified mechanics are for."
good,"Decent place to work. Customer based, parts knowledge needed. Typical day is fast paced, exciting, and constant changing. "
good,Very fast paced and hard to grasp at first but throughout the course of the months it will get easier. Remember to have fun and be friendly with others.
good,Good place to work. I had a good group of other Territory Managers to work with also.The hardest part of the job was trying to keep everybody happy and taken care of.
good,Everyday you will be dealing with customers that is majority of the time clueless and do not know what they really need. The customers are what keeps the job worth working for though. The place has its highs and it has its lows.
good,"Some days hectic and others smooth..very efficient in fixing any vehicles..management sound, but otherwise misfits..the workplace is bunches of funny oats...no real hard parts, but every now and then irate customers faceoff over their vehicle falling on repair...the enjoyable parts is deciphering the code reads on vehicles and giving the simpliest info. on how to repair..."
good,"There are no real way up, you may become a manager, but you may get paid $12 an hour, which is pitiful if you have a family. There's not a lot of incentive, nor anything as far as a track record for advancement. Job/Life balance is good, I never felt it really intefered, if you need days off, you can often receive them. Job security is very strong, you can't get cut, unless you just a teenager who doesn't work hard. It' a basic job routine, always stay busy, try your best. Management is not so bad, people here are often reasonable, friendly, and helpful. Some manager were on the shady side, but nothing big to complain. There was no job culture, except for the fact that you learned parts constantly, even if you feel you kinda know it all, you'll find out pretty quickly there's another part on some foreign make that you did not anticipate. But most of the problems you face, are pretty repetitive and easy after getting use to the ropes."
good,"its a cool place to work and feels good to educate people on their calls but the management sucks. They need to do better and hire managers who has adequate people skills. And for a company that makes a lot of money , they pay their workers and a low wage. I know they can afford to do better."
good,Pay was good but they need to train more majority of the people that worked there have no motivation nor the knowledge! The management/employee tend to bring lots of drama
good,"Excelente empresa en cultura y valores ,siempre aprendizaje constante, desarrollo solo en puestos de inicio ya para puestos gerenciales solo gente externa en un 70% y 30% interno se para el desarrollo, distritales manejan crecimientos por amiguismo alejan a los autozoners de tienda como castigo, dependiendo el distrital."
good,"As long as you are working in the right region or right district its not a terrible place to work. In my instance I was a CSM but had several problems from the SM and complained for months to upper management before finally leaving. Overall its a good company with good advancement opportunities, just make sure you're in the right area."
good,Requires parts knowledge and some mechanical skills as well. Lots of work to do and requires great customer service. As well as assisting your customer with their vehicle problems and proving the best advice you can offer. Also lots of work to do around the store like cleaning and adjusting merchandise.
good,Enjoy working here. Company has a great culture and fundamentally cares about its customers. High paced environment that is demanding and can be rewarding.
good,Helping shops benefit from lower prices to keep their business going. Working with outside vendors to make a greater benefit package. Co-workers worked as a team to better make the job work
good,Autozone was a great part time job but management at the time was horrible. I tried to advance in the job but was constantly denied because of the management that was in place at the time. If given the correct opportunity there is could have advanced to management
good,if you are good at pushing extra product onto a customer then you will do good here. i loved my bosses but the DM and other big wigs are not so great to put it nicely. i can remember an out of town commercial manager trying to act like he was god and i was a ant and when i stood up for my self in a professional manner he got so mad he stormed out the building because my store manager defended me and not him because i was in the right. it seemed like the company's only concern was money. they often looked down on you if you could not push ad-ons to the customers and get ride of management if they do not meet sales quotas. it makes you feel kind of like a car salesman.
good,"I'm sorry, but I do not wish to make a review. Thank you. I did not enjoy working here at autozone, the management was not the best."
good,Position paid barely above minimum wage & I drove 300-600 miles a day (mileage depended on which route you had & how many runs) without any breaks or meals allowed.
good,"I was Warehouse manager for Autozone, I learned how to be a leader, work fast, be a multi tasking person. Our hardest part of the day was getting delivery, while helping out costumers, and other autozoners that would come from other stores."
good,It really like working for this company . This company gave me management skills that I didn't have. It was a safe environment also. They gave everyone a chance to move up
good,If your looking to work out of loose weight . This is the job for you. Long as you stay constant and make rate you will be ok.inteally don't have a lot more to say about this company.
good,Every day you learn something new. You learn better customer service skills. You learn about the store and parts.You become more familiar with the parts
good,"Productive and friendly, laid back workplace with an ample amount of support. Management is very supportive and flexible with hours."
good,I didn't know too much about car parts and joining Autozone helped me learn a lot in such short time. I have wonderful co-workers and my only real complaint is that I'm part time and need full time. Even employees that have been there for a few short years don't get 40 hours a week.
good,AutoZone is a dependable workplace. It is a fair place to work. The biggest concern with this company is management. Nothing in consistent across the board.
good,"If you love diagnosing/troubleshooting vehicles then this is the place for you, it allows you to exercise your skills although you cant perform any of the work you can ensure that you sell the right part to a customer to help them fix the problem with there car."
good,"not enough hours, location was easy to access for public transportation not for a commute from another city driving your own car"
good,"Go to work help customers, not a lot of education to be had most of what you learn is repetitive, ok management, co workers good, hardest part of the job is figuring out what the customers need, most enjoyable part is helping people"
good,"Managing in a Auto part, helped me develop a better understanding of how customer service should be like. As a manager i have make sure that the store policies are being enforced."
good,It was a great learning experience. The job gave me team leadership skills while gaining knowledge in sales. This also enhanced my knowledge in the automotive aftermarket industry.
good,Loved the company. But the store manager needed to get retrained or let go. No people skills at all. Belittled fellow employees on the sales floor with customers around.
good,"I would open store, collect sale numbers for meeting, have a morning huddle with team to focus on sales targets. Scan outs for inventory replishment. set up time to do weekly schedule.handle problem solving skills."
good,"My typical day at work woas very busy. Once I got there, it was ful force until I got out. Learned how to be very patient with customers and fix any problems that they needed. I was management and had a good team that got everything done when needed. My co-workers loved my energy at work. Always kept everyone together as a team to get the job done for the day."
good,"Open/Close store for business, reconcile and audit the cash registers.  Daily cash transactions, Order and receive change with Dunbar, order parts for customers.  Assist customers with battery checks, battery installations, windshield wiper replacements, light bulb replacements. Perform diagnostic test on cars with check engine lights on and offer solutions to fix the issue.  Perform Manager`s Next Day task and ensure that the Zoner is performing and completing daily task."
good,communicating with costumers providing parts advice. I learned communication skills and working in sales. management was great. co-workers are good upbeat and kind. there was no hard part of the job. most enjoyable was helping the costumer get what they really needed.
good,"Always tons of stuff to do. They pride themselves on education. I have learned so much about inventory management, business culture, business development. Sometime the hours are long and the pay is low for entry level jobs. The pay for management in more in line. Our store was upbeat and fun. "
good,"Typical work day for a driver. Hurry up on those deliveries, but don't get a speeding ticket. Hardest part of the job was cooling a commercial customer off from getting there 2 hours after they expected the part. Not the drivers' fault. Just part of the business. Most enjoyable part for me was seeing customers happy that the correct part was brought to them the first time..."
good,"It is a fun place to work, having worked in retail in the past it is a great place to be."
good,"increased my knowledge about cars"
good,"HR are amazing at their jobs but not all Store Managers have it together and this can affect your workload, your schedule and the amount of stress you receive from work.It has been a great experience and opportunity to learn how to manager employees and my workload better."
good,a typical day at work is always busy a very fast pase job a lot of customers to attend to and help. helping customers with many problems and answer thier questions and a lot of cashier work i learned how to adapt to many diffrent personalitys imy coworkers are easy to get along with and enjoy working with my coworkers the hardest part bout my job is to keep up and try to help every customer as much and as good as i can the most enjoyable part of my job  is its uh very fast enviroment to work in and always meeting new people.
good,After clocking in and receiving assigned route you pull all items listed and load truck. Driving from each location and delivering correct auto parts and products. I learned about different car parts. When working the hub you barley see co workers because your always in and out. The hardest part of this job was driving and delivering in the bad weather. I enjoyed driving to all the different Auto Zone around Louisiana.
good,always had a great time working here the employees and customers where always frendly
good,"Every morning my manager had coffee and a cigarette before starting the day, then he hit the ground shoes a blaze. I have never seen a person that could manage internal problems with out his stress level ever to high and the ability to manage tasks, coworkers and costumers with ease. He is where I learned my selling ability's from and my patience with costumers. The major thing wrong is that the schedule is rotating everyday instead of once a week and you could not have more than two day off in a row unless you requested time off. Also it was hard to get two days together off because of their rotating schedule. Pay was lousy but I had fun working for this company"
good,Will try to find any reason to let u go  ones they are mad a  you. but other then  that its ok
good,"I bring energy and experience lead by example."
good,"It's a calm place to work but don't expect advancement based on your hard work alone. You need to have someone higher up on your side, if you lack that you'll be a CSR forever. I learned a lot about cars in general, I know I'll take this knowledge every where with me. The hardest part of the job if you work in a mainly bilingual area is translating the made up names in Spanish you customers give car parts to English. My store is pretty lax, but when things need to get done inventory wise it was usually thrown on me while everyone else ate and talked in the office."
good,As a Work leader and Assistant Manager I was kept busy maintaining the floor and sales to an above average standard. Insuring the safety awareness is met and new policies are implemented. Employee qualifications are up to date in a reasonable time frame.Time keeping and scheduling are maintained. All loss prevention measures are in place and store security is ensured.
good,thought I was going to be a delivery driver but have been working the counter since I started
good,"This is a pretty cool job. I really like cars and am currently a full time student so this is a good way for me to get a little money while still doing something I like, working with cars. I also like people and working here I meet lots of new people who I learn from. I am also learning lots of things about cars that I did not know. I am happy to say I work at a location where my co-workers are quite knowledgeable in the automotive field and we work well as a team. I am not happy at all with upper management. My store manager is awesome and all co-workers are awesome as well. My district manager and HR are what are horrible. I am a business student graduating December 2013 and everything I have learned about bad managers and HR decisions is exactly what they do. If they were not like that I wouldn't be looking for other jobs, I would stay there and try to progress in the hierarchy, but with those kinds of people working there I do not want to."
good,"Start off helping the customers with a part or parts I can help the customer on the computer, then retrieve the part or parts and give an estimate on the parts and send the customer to the cashier all through the day. If there's no customers that need help I would stock up supplies or parts in the store. Take a 30 minute break and back to work until it's time to clock out. Working with different minorities you will get treated differently from the same race that you try to work with. Was ok for a while until they were only looking out for themselves. Wasn't giving promotions only for themselves. I was good with curtain co-workers and others were trouble makers. Working harder then anyone else everyday and the customers would let the store manager know how good of a customer service representative that I am but never got promoted. I enjoy helping the customers."
good,it all depends where you worked some managers went by the book and some didn't some store mangers made it fun to work and actually trained you and some where just there to collect a check you didn't get any classes on mechanical work you had to learn by yourself or ask questions to other employees
good,"Aside from the rude customers and the lack of information; Autozone can definitely improve on their flawed attendance point system and the approach tactics to selling what we call ""checkout challenge."" If you cant sell, I advise you not to apply for this job. Though it really doesn't matter if you can, but when store managers get pressured they will make you sell no matter how great of a re-pore you get from your customers. "
good,"AutoZone is a great company to work for.. The pay is ok.  On a typical work day you are on the salesfloor and outside assisting customer. You migt be changing a headlight or battery, or installing wiper blades.  AZ is a very disciplined company.  It is almost like the military.  I learned so much from working at AutoZone.  Before I came aboard, I knew nothing about cars, now I can tell you whata wrong with your car and install and do different variations of things.  I work as the Parts Manager in which I am 2nd in command.  My co-workers are a great team.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with mechanical issues.  The most enjoyable part is the look on a customers face after recieving WOW Customer Service.."
good,Dealing with customers with technical issues pertaing to mechanical parts VIA phone and also in person. Learned new thing everyday. Very strong management team.
good,Had district phone meetings every morning. Very numbers oriented. Staff was nice to work with. Only major problem is that at times the district manager wanted me to run a skeleton crew. Had to complete tasks in the store while helping customers.
good,its great serving customers an assist them with their needs and also provide them with advices.
good,"A fun place to work. I've been working here while doing my studies. Now that I'm done studying for my major, I'm looking for something more in my field. Moving up in the ladder is not difficult, a little dedication and hard work, and positive attitude. Some members of management are questionable. Over a positive experience."
good,The work is good. Most days go by fast cause of the influx of customers on a given day. The health benefits are ok. Only if you are there for a good amount of time can you mover up. Most coworkers are fun to be around.
good,"Check out counter. learned about the parts of car/trucks ,and where they were located on the vehicle. Had to interact with evryone who walks in the store. Hardest part of the job slimier parts brought a confussion some times."
good,They kept you up to date with their many tests to advance in their system.
good,Sales Representative
good,"It is possibly one of the easiest jobs I ever had. Unfortunately also one of the most stressful. Care about your job and what you do, only worry about what you can control. Like any other job most people that come through those doors are paycheck people. For being one of the easiest jobs I have never seen employees complain so much. I have worked at a distribution center in summer heat , no a/c. Minimum wage, making on average 40 pallets a day in an 12 hour shift. Working at Autozone in a/c for helping people out is way easier and i was getting paid way more."
good,It was an overall OK first job . Coworkers were mostly great and worked as a team. I'm not much of a car person myself so was not really for me. managers treat you fairly well.
good,"Pay could be a little higher. Job is stressful something when busy. Workplace usually ok, sometime to much drama. But overall, not a bad place to work"
good,"This company is great for someone interested for secure hours and overtime."
good,nice place but no communication with the employees and staff. poor mangement all around. They need better training skills instead of just sticking people in positions.
good,"It was fun for a while just didn't get paid enugh, work was starting to pile up amd i didn't see my paycheck get any better, people there are amazing management was solid, just didn't like the work given amd the pay."
good,"Job advancement is very quick if you are a hard worker and willing to learn. Pay starts out very poor but quickly becomes better as you move up within the company (though still not fair considering all the stress). Many days are spent working open to close and even longer depending on floor cleanings and other things. Personally was once there over 19 hours, and thats after a one hour lunch. This was a consistent occurence due to complacent employees and a manager who would work only about 30 or 40 hours while I would work 50-60. Then, after putting my personal life on hold for over a year due to always being at work, I was fired because of a company policy I was never taught and knew nothing about. Instead of a demotion or just teaching the correct way, termination was their immediate solution. They do not care about how much you put into the company, only their bottom line. No second chances or learning opportunities means absolutely no mistakes no matter how small, including mine."
good,very fast paced and demanding in all areas of work and sales can be very overwhelming at times and a very strict managment in all areas as well as being micro managed at all times
good,It's a great job and great people.  The higher in company you go the more stress . I recommend this job for a young manger to get experience and get out.
good,Like the company uper management was unable to communicate with management in the store level can do schedule on computer did lots of plannos put truck up worked with employee to be able to take care of customers with there needs for there cars love to teach new employee how to do there job and what it takes to get the job done wright
good,Hourly pay could be better. Learn to troubleshoot problems and help customers. The more knowledge you have about cars parts the better and easier the job is.
good,.AutoZone was an overall great experience. Had I been able to advance and get more hours  if I'd been able to get more hours and growth opportunities I'd still be here
good,Autozone was a fun place to work because of my coworkers. Pay was far not enough to maintain. Little advances were available. Scheduling was pretty good due to my manager.
good,I learned a lot about the different makes and models of cars and all the parts and methods of repair for each. The people I worked with were hardworking and pleasant to work with.
good,This was a starter job for me and I enjoyed what little time I spent there and made friendships that I still enjoy when I go back there from time to time.
good,"most days were fine, being customer service the biggest headaches came from customers. coworkers are usually fine to deal with and management can be helpful."
good,"learn to be organized and fast on my feet. "
good,"I knew nothing of car parts or retail, but I became one of the most noted Parts Sales Managers in SC. I learned a lot in a short time and really enjoyed helping the customer."
good,trabajo en equipo y mucho crecimiento solo los jefes directos en alto mandos son cero parciales
good,The people i worked with were great and created a good environment to work in. The company doesn’t want to pay Mangers for the work they do. They pay Mangers almost the same as a entry level worker.
good,The most rewarding part of my job was when I was able to change a customer challenge into an easy task because I was able to provide them with all the product and information they needed to complete there diy job.
good,"Auto Zone was an okay work environment to work in. Hours were flexible, experience or prior knowledge wasn't required. Learning on the job was an option. "
good,First off it’s going to be busy but that makes time fly which is good I liked that a lot the crew members are cool and helpful all the time the hard part is learning on the go the best thing about it is once you learn everything you feel like you can take care of everything
good,Great place to learn automotive knowledge. Hours were very flexible. Unfair work conditions as not everyone put in the group effort. Underpaying job..
good,I worked there for two years total. Good group of coworker's. Worked there the whole time attending college . They were very good about working around work times and family.
good,"Fair place to work, just doesn't pay most hourly employees real well. Relatively small annual pay increases. Upper management receives performance bonuses"
good,"Good place to start out learning customer service, and new skills. Finding parts for customer vehicles, changing batteries and lights. Management was very good. Hardest part was promoting up through the ranks."
good,This company never truly did me wrong. My direct managers were always willing to guide and coach me. As I worked through the ranks upper management became more difficult to deal with.
good,Good place to learn about customer service and general car knowledge. Boss was understanding to school life coming first and provided sufficient training.
good,I worked here over a year and although it was a great work envirment seems like District Managers care less About Employees they have a tendency to just replace you if you ask for more money was told lies after lies about advancements and manager was always looking for a problem with no solution in mind but to reprehend
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone is there to get their job done the work day is easy and smooth. There isn't one job that is hard as long as you are taught properly and have a willingness to be self sufficient once you are on your own.
good,Its your standard ginormous corporate conglomerate; they care about money and not much about their employees. They are flexible and understanding when it comes to scheduling.
good,"Working at AutoZone was a great experience in the development of customer service and appreciation. AutoZone focuses on team collaboration, which can create a great work environment. I would recommend working at Autozone to anyone who wants to get in a job that values team effort, customer service, automotive solutions, and constant training/ development."
good,terrible pay for what is asked of you to do as a management employee never been called a manager for less than 12 an hour for all the responsibility you have as a parts manager there the pay was hardly above regular employees it was very hard to get them to work with the hours of availability it was fun working there i did have a great crew who always got along
good,"no issues, good pay and good people. learn a lot about cars working there, schedule was not the best but i managed. it was a good overall experience although i did not like working Sunday or driving to work on a level 3 snow storm"
good,A typical day at work always working with different people. I learned how to work fast and how to leasing to each customer. The management was professional and good environment. Working in this store in was always something to learned from each of my coworkers. The hardest part of this job was to keep up with some much different people that sometimes wouldn't understand how hard is to keep up with each of different attitudes. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be train for all new different products that they were coming to the store.
good,"Rush/peak hours of non stop movement....dealing with upset customers’ and wrong returns. Restroom checks, front and face store all day. Check-In store to store transfers. Overall environment is good and a great way to learn how a car works if interested, possible networking connections. Preventing shoplifters on a daily basis."
good,"AutoZone was very strict on their WITTJR. If you didnt get an addon for a spark plug, battery, brakes or oil you were written up. after 3 write ups you were gone. That isnt how you sell or motivate anyone to get the sale."
good,A typical day at Autozone would include front and facing the store handling chemical products with care placing them in the correct location. Helping out customers on what they need as far as car products.
good,The work is fast paced. Alot of moving around. Management needs a lot of work. Supervisors are childish. Team needs to retrained. Does not follow morning cheer.
good,"Autozone has a very strong culture, stronger than many employers in the retail business. Autozone has built themselves up into the leading auto-parts retailer in the business. As a team member, if you work hard, you will go far."
good,a typical time at Autozone was not only selling of parts but learning how to do inventories as well and helping customers with their vehicle solutions.  As time wore on It was very difficult to go up into management at the time that I was with the company it was a very good job for me to start off with and get to know of I would recommend for someone that wants to learn of automotive parts and sales with a company
good,"Its a fast-paced job, very well managed but as a temp worker its a lot of work for very little pay."
good,This is a good job but hard work. You only get 2 breaks a day but over all a good job. Need more breaks and rate incentives. Some people bust their butts to hit rate and don't receive and praise for it
good,Gives you an opportunity to advance. They have a great managers and everybody is willing to help others. They offer competitive benefits for full time employees after 1 year.
good,"Working at Autozone was a great experience to assist in my personal life. It taught me organization, troubleshooting, automotive technologies, and leadership. The company failed to commit to me even though I was a leader at my store and played a key role in achieving all of their goals. I was never awarded for any of my hard work other than winning sales competitions. They have a high turn over because of their inability competitively compensate their employees. They only give raises based on tenure and the reviews were not tailored to fit the employee. Management is quick to overlook success and quick to judge failure."
good,Working for AutoZone was great until the lack of security for the store and employees became an issue. I was held up at two different locations and nothing was done about it until I went as far as loss prevention to get security cameras in the stores.
good,"Overall the company is sound however, management has no practical idea how to work with employees.  Very little management training.  Pay is extremely low for experience and advancement is slow."
good,"I was with the company for over 8 years and they were always moving people around and disturbing the workplace vibe, as well as lower pay for the industry than most similar employers."
good,"Active workplace always busy. Easy to learn things on the job and be apart of a team. The customers were ok at times, except when it came to the warranties."
good,"If you like working in retail and like working on cars, this might be a good place to work at. This is not a 9 to 5 job your schedule must be flexible."
good,good place to work if work hard and do things right. Most managers know what they are doing. Working hard and doing things right does not matter when it comes to other opportunities
good,"A typical day at work involves putting parts on the shelves, helping out customers and delivering parts to local shops and dealers if you're part of the commercial department. I learned a lot about cars and different components that get put on vehicles of all types. Management is quite strict, especially the District Manager, whose name I will not mention. Workplace culture consists of mostly high school and college aged kids, so it's mostly fun. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy weights repeatedly with very little breaks, due to heavy work loads. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving long distances, sometimes for hours at a time."
good,I loved working their honestly.  It was a great atmosphere and the staff was easy to get along with. Occasionally you'd get an unruly customer but you can usually tone them down after a bit.
good,"Employees were great, but the customers were awful. Demographics may have played a role in the customers attitudes. Managers were very helpful and the job is very informative."
good,Autozone is all about safety. Being aware of your surroundings. Doing your stretches. Drinking water. Wearing the right gear. It is very important to all AutoZone members
good,"Was only a delivery driver and worked sales up front as well, staff was very polite most of the time and worked well together. management slacked a lot and didn't seem like to much room to advance pay was incredibly low."
good,it sucks don't work there why do i have to fill out reviews of jobs i worked at previously honestly a waste of time if you are trying to help people find jobs
good,Autozone is poorly managed for the top down a lot of times people are promoted and they are not a qualified candidates and the friends games is played..I personally don't not like to conduct business in the matter the most qualified with the best work history should be promoted...the work atmosphere is great
good,Muy buena empresa. Lo malo es los jefes que metem pura gente de fuera y familiares a puestos altos y por lo mismo no ay crecimiento esto en guadalajara
good,"Autozone is a great place to start, they teach u as you go, its a great place to me different people and help them with their mechanical problems. good place to move up in the company."
good,"Despite the fact that our Autozone is the slowest in the district, we still get a slew of regulars popping in to say hi almost every day. There's always something to do around the store, and our team is great with getting things done ASAP, so that we don't have to worry about tasks sitting unfinished. "
good,A educational experience for myself and co-workers learning to promote and advance the culture of the company we are employed by through knowledge and diversity.
good,"This was a fine job for what it was. The chance for advancement is good, as they hire from within a lot and have plenty of locations. Some of the systems in place for employees didn't seem to be the most logical, but that can happen with any big corporation intent on having things done the same way at thousands of locations. If you go in willing to work hard you will do well at Autozone."
good,"Working at Autozone was a great experience. A typical day at work used to be really busy and fast paced. I would get to work, clock-in and start cleaning the store. The store was always busy so I myself, was always busy as well. I would also deliver car part to shops using the company's car. Greeting the customers was the number one thing to do, customer satisfaction is really important in Autozone. My co workers were amazing, they were always so helpful and taught me a lot. I don't really think working at Autozone was hard at all, I always looked forward to go to work and customers knew me really well for always having a smile on my face and being so helpful."
good,es un buen hambiente laboral  aprendes muchas cosas de piezas de automoviles
good,"Arrive for work, meet and greet customers.Give advice to parts needed and or required for repairs. Stock parts, inventory and receive management training."
good,Was a cool staff at one point but kept getting assigned new management. Overall happy about experience. Good job to start off but not a career place.
good,The people were good to work with and get along easily. work environment was ok. managers were not very good at their jobs.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of stocking in the back room as well as organizing product on the shelve on the store floor, answering customer phone calls and helping them in any way that they need and helping customers out in the store one on one. "
good,"The job was great, but it was not enough to keep going. Money is not much, and business will boom on the weekends. Co-workers were great and enjoyable."
good,"answer phones and deliver parts for the commercial accounts when not on the road i was helping in store customers find the correct parts for there diy repairs, did cashiering and installation of batteries and wiper blades."
good,The enviroment at autozone is very top notch. The management is  very involved with learning the autozone way with period tests to improve my selling skills and customer service skills.
good,"I like the company and the work enviroment, but in Puerto Rico with 16 to 24 hours a week and limited professional growth options, it's mandatory to have a second job on the side."
good,the people are great to work with but the production changed way too much. it kept getting harder and harder to make production on the same orders.
good,I enjoyed working their .Great Customers their was always something to do. My hardest part of the job was making management happy. I enjoyed my customers I love cars.
good,"i enjoyed working at Auto Zone, it was a fun learning how to trouble shoot electrical problems with automobiles along with an understanding of all components in cars."
good,"goals that push u to your limit creates a constant feeling of failure,though the customers were great managements inability to create a viable action plan left the store under staffed and scurring to complete daily tasks"
good,"would clock in and would give customer service. I would always learn new parts and words in spanish. My manager at the time was not that helpful or kind was not fond of him. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. I think my hardest part being there was not knowing a part for a customer and the best part of it was giving customer service, knowing that the customer left satisfied"
good,"Hay desarrollo constante y mucha capacitacion,manejan una buena cultura aunque no todos aplican los valores,se enfocan mucho en el servicio al cliente y en lograr la satisfaccion al mismo"
good,"A typical day of work at Autozone includes helping customers find the right parts for the customer's automobile. Day to day you may replace wiper blades on a customer's car, change their battery, or replace their headlight bulbs. There is a heavy reliance on stocking the shelves and organizing the product. I learned a lot about cars at Autozone. I never considered myself knowledgeable on the workings of automobiles until after working for Autozone. Now, I feel like I will be more self sufficient when it comes to my own automotive needs."
good,a typical day would be come to work fix up the tore and manage the closing tasks
good,"Ordering parts, waiting on customers. Keeping a productive and collaborative commerical partnership with venders and suppliers. The hardest part was that I was a mechanic."
good,...It was a ok company to work for.
good,"My typical day at work would be, I log into the commerical accounts start taken inbound calls from customers by placing orders, checking accounts and collects payments and delivering parts in a timely manner but also safely. I learned to establish accounts, take payments using the system, do outside buys with dealers, and most of all strive to the stop. I have seen poor and the best of management. I enjoyed working as a team players with my co-workers that were also team players. The hardest part of my day was not being able to help the customer get the part only because we could not get the part no kind of way. I enjoy working with my customers they make it possible for me to come in and help above and beyond at no cost to them besides the parts of course. I give them the best customer service they can ever receive because that is what keep the customers coming back when they feel like someone is willing to help."
good,"management is young and immature. no leadership. very lazy environment. corporation as a whole is very good as far as benefits. on site training is not very good. I have been there almost 10 years and have asked several time to be shown all the facets of my assistant manager duties and still have not been, but other younger associates have been."
good,Always a learning enviroment... fun helping people solve problems with their vehicles.
good,"Typical day requires daily inventory checks, also maintaining proper stock organized and cleaned daily. Help customers troubleshoot cars and investigate problems and help locate car parts. Maintain cash register clean and in order throughout shift. Leadership and team working skills are a primary asset you gain from working in autozone as well as customer service skills. Co workers all share qualities that help strive the company to maintain customer service as a main priority. Management is one of the best in helping all workers be organized and help run a very successful shift every work day. The hardest part of the job would be determining what part a customer needs when they have no knowledge of certain vehicles they own. The most enjoyable part is gaining knowledge about cars and how there parts work alongside them and also working as a team to achieve company goals."
good,Great place the customers were always happy and the workers were always cheerful
good,Working at AutoZone is fun and a great place to learn about automotive systems. If you want an increase in automotive knowledge this is a great job.
good,"This Job is not Military Friendly or Personnel friendly they care more about the Customer. however, you have room to grow within the store. but I recommend. look at all your option"
good,"Do returns"
good,"Working here was depressing. All of the in-store task were just busy work, or messing with someones car while not being a mechanic. It's a place to pace the time I guess, but the pay was terrible. When I asked about a raise I had just gotten my one year pin, my store manager  acted as if she didn't know how it worked."
good,"The people you work with are awesome, the only down side is to save money they only hire certain amount of employees, so a job that take 4 people only 2 people are working on it we where in a bad neighborhood and at night only one manger, and one sales employee would close them was a really big problem."
good,Working for autozone was a good experience. I learned a lot about car parts and cars that I didn’t know. But it is extremely stressful and fast paced.
good,"Pros:  - Great people to work with."
good,Can be a past paced depending on the the amount of customers that come in at a time. But management does a good job making sure you are not  over worked.
good,"Its a good place to work if you like fast paced, mildly intense working environments but the staff is so friendly and high spirited that you'll have no choice but to like them."
good,Autozone is heading in the wrong direction. Applying to much task and pressure on the store managers while cutting hours in the store and cutting back on needs.
good,"It’s a good company as a first job , but I wouldn’t recommend applying if you want a regular position. Only positions worth it are management . They have a great work work environment."
good,If you are willing to put in the work you will be compensated for what you do. It may be years down the road but it will happen. It is labor intensive.
good,"Es un lugar muy ocupado, hay que estar de pie por varias horas del dia. Lo mejor del trabajo es que todos los empleados somos como familia y trabajamos en equipo para lograr tal meta. Salario depende de tu experiencia."
good,"A typical day would normally consist of  managing the sales and taking care of the store, keeping the store clean and stocked while helping all the customers to get them the right parts for their vehicle."
good,A productive day at Autozone is getting the parts out to the customers on time. The workplace culture was great management was amazing. The hardest part was making sureyou had all your parts and returns.
good,they are constantly cutting hours but do not approve of overtime. Workdays are nice but the lack of help being in management puts you at a large disadvantage.
good,I personally worked tons of hours and did not get paid well compared to other local businesses. I was the highest paid part time employee but is not nearly enough to live on. The only reason to stay is the employee discounts and enjoying being around the automotive industry.
good,"Lots of hours if you show dedication. Always meet incredibly friendly people but you will always get that one person that you wish that their car will brake down during rush hour (mostly taxi drivers). Managers and co-workers became really good friends. Discount is a plus."
good,Enjoyed  working with the people's. I have always enjoyed  working in a customer service representative. I have several years of sales experience and customer service
good,I liked the culture but it does take several years in the company to make enough money to provide for a family.Depending on the management position you can get quite busy with endless phone calls.
good,Very educational and interesting company to be a part of. Will definitely keep you busy and hands on throughout any workday. Many opportunities to grow.
good,I enjoyed working but there was no room for improvement the staff was very pleasant good company this company sell motor spares and accessories this company didn't consider my experience
good,Over all not a bad place to work if you can handle dumb questions from customers all day long. The problem is some of the upper management. Once you get outside the store level some of the management gets unpleasant to work with. They can be focused on the numbers and forget that they have people working for them not machines. Other than the upper Management this company has been a dream to work for.
good,this job would be for new people working.you can excel after time. when i started working at autozone i had a lot of experience in the automotive industry. they almost didnt hire me because i had to much experience.
good,"Gran equipo de trabajo, excelente compañerismo y gran accesibilidad de los gerentes."
good,Rather easy going work environment with an above average work life balance.  The compensation was not the best.  I feel it should have included commission.  Interacting with the commercial customers face to face each day was very enjoyable and informative about the industry.
good,Auto zone priority is customer satisfaction. No hassle return policy and great parts and products. Paid holidays. Closed 5 days a year. ..............
good,I really enjoyed the customers who came into AutoZone. It was really nice to get to learn everyone's stories. The only negative is the management. It took forever for problems to be settled.
good,I admire this position as a parts mgr lots of respect and had great employees . Fantastic stores to work and got to meet different employees staff and learn as I go from every point of direction i was heading to. My District Mgr was an awesome person to work for .
good,"I enjoyed driving for autozone greatly."
good,if you like people and have a desire to help them with ? or sale or even info and know just a little about cars then try it this might be just the job for you
good,I loved working their. very friendly environment. At first I figured it was going to be very challenging learning where everything in the store was but after a while it got very very easy.
good,"Has more hours available than applies for, and you can advance easily to higher positions. The work environment is workable, sometimes you can get more hours put in that asked for."
good,Ive been employed by this company for 2 years now and still no full time or management positions have become available to me but it is a good place to work wish i could stay but im a father now and it seems as if only at my store people arent getting promotions
good,"Auto  Zone does have access to more parts and descent prices however, internally they don't care too much about the employees"
good,"Providing customer service, such as ordering part, checking batteries, alternators, starters, using OBII to scan codes."
good,They hours aren't great. I've been told of promotions that may come but never come. That being said I'm willing to leave.
good,I really like the crew I work with they have helped me out extremely.I am still learning about cars which I find exciting. I really think it's neat when women come in and their working on their own vehicles I admire that.Hardest part is when a customer doesnt know what he wants and we have to try and figure it out for them.
good,"I didn't have the best time at Autozone but it isn't a terrible company."
good,nice place to work love the people there very nice enviorment clean and spaciouse good benefits love the customers I would love to go back there
good,Got the job done when things needed taking care of. Delegated workers to do specific tasks that would benefit everyone in the workplace.
good,"Help the customer locate parts for the customer complete sale."
good,"I work as a parts sales manager... I work on cars , order parts, take care of the employees, make sure task are finished, bank runs, and delivery"
good,"I am a gear head, love anything with a engine and love helping other people with their automotive issues. Hardest part of the job was the fact that there was only one cash register because sometimes there would be a huge line and i was not able to help the customers. Over all it was a great job and i made a lot of friends."
good,What I look for in a work environment is a smooth pace and open communication. Money is motivation. I'd like to work for a company that offers growth and stability.
good,When I first started there I was only part time but due to my availabilty when I was not in school I feel that my time was taken advantage of. I worked for the company for several years and was able to advance rather quickly because of my willingness to learn and strong worth ethic.
good,"Commercial stays well busy on most days. I take orders and deliver them. I've learned how to manage the commercial area. My boss taught me everything I know to be able to take her place. Co-workers are nice. Hardest part of the job would be making sure we have collected all the cores and payments before the end of the month. My most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get out of the store and drive, meet new people, and have a good conversation with the commercial customers in person."
good,"Keeping productive is never a problem form making shop contacts to setting inventory planograms. the learning environment is amazing always learning something new on a daily basis. being a part of the management team defiantly has ups and downs but a lot more pros than cons. The work environment and staff is always good time, spend enough time with them everyone is like family. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping new people every day."
good,"Customer service, handling cash, stocking shelves, inventory, and anwering phones. Management was okay. I worked with alot of great co-workers."
good,I help the Customers trouble shoot the problems with their automobile then sell them the part they need to get their car running safely.
good,"A sense of favoritism between management and employees, no voice because of fear of retaliation but do notice your hard work."
good,"not enough hours, work was very inconsistent. Easy to adjust to atmosphere being automotive related. "
good,"The management was good, the only issue was that they treated the employees like numbers and expected great customer service."
good,multi tasking
good,"I was asked to sell different products in stock at the store on a weekly bases during the sales process. I would also look up parts when calls or customers walked in on a computer system we had in the store.aia stocked shelves when I had no customers,and cleaned the womens restroom,And I also woul check customers engine light with a tool we had in the store.In all there was alot of interactions with customers and a chance to work on a personal sales pitch.The management was very helpful whenever I had questions I couldn't answer for a customer.Me and my co-workers got along fine.The hardest part of the job was the fact people would think since I was a young female that I wouldnt know how to do my job,but the most enjoyable part was being able to show customers I was able to do exactly what the same services that they would recieve from any of my male employees."
good,Wages are very low! promotions are only awarded with 30 cent raises max!
good,"If you know about cars, try working here. Many people do need help with making their vehicles work better."
good,Days off were such a hard thing to come by. If you requested anything you would be forced to work over a full week straight for asking for anything. Management needs more training
good,"Fun environment to work in. Great customers and wonderful employees. Sales were driven with great customer service, Training employees and building business is my goal."
good,"I would still work there had I not gotten extremely sick, missing too many days of scheduled work days.  I was able to become ASE certified through the company."
good,Great customers and great management..Nice flexible hours but the pay was low..Almost felt like I was working for free..Overall great company to work for..
good,The computer software for auto-zone is horrible it’s outdated or something don’t understand why they don’t do it fast & simple & you need to be a smoker to have breaks which is really dumb thinking about going back to smoking to just take a break man hate it
good,"Autozone is a great company to work for. You gain a lot of experience with them in the automotive world. Management and everything is great while higher ups want you to do everything and anything under the sun to sell people things they don't want. The only thing is pay really sucks. A management position in the area is only bringing down $12/hr when you do as much as the actual store manager making 50k+ per year. "
good,"I enjoyed my time working for auto zone though there were some things that I wish they would be more lenient on. For one, they do not give any understanding to employees with families. District Manager for my area was a drunk who quickly changed moods. Store manager and most of the other managers were fantastic people who were always willing to help. Good place for a teen job or a management position."
good,"it paid the bill, the store manager need better training when it comes to running a store. for what i understand you'll get promoted just being being there all the time, not if you actually qualify, they'll give a store to anyone who's been there long enough."
good,"Good work environment for the most part but salary you work all the time, daily phone email, text, long hours . high standard but not enough hours or qualified people to do the work as only salaried managers make good money. anything less then store managers make not well paid for money"
good,"Autozone is a good company to learn in if you’re interested in cars. Environmentally it’s not the best because the higher bosses are worried about there bonus, so if they’re not meeting there goal they come down hard on everyone which is unfair and selfish. District managers and store managers only worry about themselves and refuse to help others out in order to help each other expand, but as long as you have a strong mind you’ll get through it."
good,This was my first job out of high school and a wonderful way to build customer service skills to the point i was awarded a management job. This had me working with people from front sales to upper management to continue my training for commerical sales. So i would reconmend this as a very good place to start or to futher you knowlege for sales and mangement.
good,A great place to develop people skills and team building. Found myself at a wall with no more space to grow. Overall the company is company centered and makes you seem dispensable. However there are some managers who make this place livable.
good,I enjoy helping customers find what they need using my own knowledge of parts. I learned more about automobiles and delivered WOW! customer service day by day.
good,Most of the days of work the movement of customers is very slow. So we took the time to make a complete recovery from the workplace.There is good harmony and communication between management and employees.
good,"The management was very good. Production and attitude had to be at a very high quality. Very laid back, easy going employees. They gave you a 20% discount on anything you bought from Auto Zone."
good,"I worked for AutoZone for over a year, and saw no pay raises. I liked working for them because of the work environment, however the hours were terrible, especially during the holidays, and winter."
good,My time at autozone has been productive. I've learned a bunch from working there dealing with cars and car related situations.
good,"The day consisted of taking inventory, helping customers get the right part they're looking for, and cleaning the store. I learned a lot about daily driving issues and what cars to not buy because of their problems. There is a ton of management to assist you if there is ever a problem. With such a large company, the variation of co workers you may have seems limitless. The hardest part of the job is putting car parts on the shelves, and the most enjoyable part of my job is learning new things about cars."
good,"Lead a team of employees to solve business challenges, drive results, build people capabilities and"
good,"My work day usually goes smoothly, I clock in and if I have anything to deliver I take it to the shop that ordered it. My co-workers are pretty awesome and make my day go smoother. Our manger is alright he just needs to learn to go by people's availability."
good,"Pull all item for corresponding invoices while answering incoming calls from my commercial accounts. Communicate with team on most effective routes and delegate which employee takes which said route. Deliver orders when needed and always check with my accounts on what is going good and bad for them personally and with my team. I also held outside buys, account payable, and general cash handling. The hardest part of my job is running down parts that are supposed to be in inventory. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with my accounts face to face and via phone."
good,The job was pulling parts and putting them in a cart for shipping.Pulling oil glue paint etc. Hot job pushing and pulling.
good,The expericence at AutoZone has abled me to understand how to handle general liability claims and investigations processes.
good,"new problems to diagnose"
good,Would recommend to another person. Learned how to interact with co-workers in a busy environment in which there is a lot of dangerous situations that present themselves and they do a good job of informing you on how to avoid those situations.
good,check inventory and get computers started up. Bosses are very laid back and understanding. Hard part is working 14 hour shifts.
good,"Usually my days of work consist of slight jokes, communicating with co workers before starting workload then begin to start working on whatever it is that has to be handled. On this job I learned about a lot about preparation, organization, car parts, and using my own common sense to apply to whatever situation that needs to be figured out when no one is around to help. The management on this job is well organized and very well orchestrated. My co-workers are laid back and nice people to get along with but work as well. The hardest part of the job would be just getting everything done on time no matter how much of a workload we may have. The most enjoyable part of the job would be being able to work by yourself."
good,Autozone offers training on the job and guarantees to give you 25 hours as a part-timer and 40 working full time. It is a friendly work environment with flexible hours.
good,overall with you partners helping each other makes it smooth .day sometimes goes pretty slow customers are really polities and worth part is work weekends
good,This job is a job that teaches you a lot of things and you interact with all kinds of people daily. A need to pay attention to detail is necessary. Working in this environment is rewarding because it’s one big team so you’re never alone!
good,I been at auto zone for 12 years and i moved up in the compnay as a assistant manger now im looking for something else that going to better me and my family
good,"A typical day for me included either picking up after the day shift or finishing up someone elses workload. Although I had no problem doing such, the constant ""we are behind"" and the drive to keep helping customers instead of fixing the store is what kept us in the back of the pack. I typically tried to be a jack of all trades but there is no merit for this if the manager does not have your back."
good,I was just a part time employee that worked in the hub.  I loaded shipments for other local stores and also drove routes for the shipments.  Auto Zone was a fun and hardworking culture to be a part of.  With the overtime you could make decent money.  When I left they offered me a promotion with a raise to stay but unfortunately I was moving to a town that did not have an Auto Zone.
good,When I relocated to my new home I got hired in at Auto Zone in no time. The customer made my job so much easy because they had already knew what they were looking for at the parts store and I was learning while working with each customer.
good,Auto Zone was a great job to get through college. Favoritism was played 24/7 and it's why i started off as a manager.  Never will go back and would rather work at mcdonalds
good,"High Volume Sales, intense costumer service, A lot of pressure to increase sales, confortable physical work environment, opportunity to growth with the company"
good,"If you enjoy working in an environment selling car parts then AutoZone is the place for you. Customer service is placed at the highest priority, the pay however is a major issue causing the employees to be dissatisfied and leave. I have learned the art of multitasking, this means doing the planograms, cleaning the store, straightening the products while also proving excellent customer service. Although the environment is great, one of the hardest part of the job was to get enough recognition by the district manager for higher paid position."
good,"My typical day is manage my store making sure that everything good before the customers  get there. Making sure  my Team knows there Goals for that day like our Goals for sales what  it need to be for that day. Also get My Team Pump up on how we can get the Goals and maintain them for that day. The hardest part about the job ,really it's not hard if everyone focus on the  Goals you sat for you and your Team. The most enjoyable part of the job is The Customers they really get you going . And it makes you feel good to know that My Team And I can help someone that day and to know that feels really Good."
good,"Was quite a fun place to work never was boring, I learned alot of different parts and i learned customer service in the time i was there"
good,"Besides the cheesy cheer required to start each meeting and the promotion board. This is a great company, unfortunately hard work is not really recognized. AZ has great benefits and the pay isn't to shabby but, a lot of the Management lacks leadership skills and training."
good,"Probably one of the best jobs I ever had. I love my coworkers, I love the environment, I just love the people."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Autozone and found it to be rewarding."
good,Autozone is a good place to work if u have alot of patience. The thing that u have to worry about is customers when they come into the store and dont know what a part is called or they dont know the year make and model of their vehicle
good,Good place. Good benefits. Like working here. Good people to work for. They will work with your schedule. I learned to work with others. The hardest part of job is satisfied customers
good,"Great to work with, friendly and a team player, Always willing to help my co-worker.  Always willing to help."
good,Working at Autozone is pretty easy once you get the hang of it just like any job. Working with the best team that works hard and gets tasks done was a good way for me to pick up from still of how to run a store. It was challenging to sale but fun at the same time. It is a very repetitive job.
good,"Management "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to do what i enjoy the most was to interact with the customers everyday and to work around car parts.
good,I have worked for the company for almost 2 years . I have the experience to move up into the company and all I hear is false promises . I have asked repeatedly for a promotion or more money
good,"Taught me how to be on time with my deliveries , multitasking with customers on the phone and face to face as well. Learning the automotive industry was a great experience."
good,not pleased. can be better. some people choose not to work and lazy around. hard for those who do work. managers are fairly good but depends on which location and who you work with
good,"is good for people like work to par time, they no have good schedule for work the supervisor is no good trainer. the manager is not good the no have schedule for lunch on time."
good,"Retail store that also dealt with commercial accounts. Pull parts, answering phones, driving, test parts, charging batteries, inspections, and cashiering."
good,"i work for az for 19 months, i had several people hired in over me for a position i was promised by store management. it all depeneds on your store managers, some are lazy and barely get by, some are rushing you and stuff never gets done, or they are smart and every thing is lazed and stuff get done on time. if you are staring a family then find a new place to work, when my kid was born the DID NOT give paternity leave, and they complained about me missing work when he was born due to c section."
good,"You can move up quick in the company. You just have to really kiss major butt for a LONG time before they even consider a promotion. Work ethic can be better in AutoZone. "
good,I love cars so it was a fun place to work and gain more knowledge but it wasn't a fair place to work for the hourly wage and not many benefits or time off.
good,"a hood job if yu nt paying bills, voming out of high school or home for college, love the hours but i dont like the attendance point system because yu never know what happens in life."
good,it was okay to work there lots of laughter just wasn't fit for me. Also I was able to gain some experience I wasn't able to use in my jobs before. Although the lack of communication and teamwork was off I never lost focus of the goal that auto zone had to set and complete.
good,Auto Zone was a great job. Just had no chance in moving up the ladder. I stared off knowing not one things about cars to knowing how to manage a car. Great experience glad to have worked there
good,My day is varied and the workplace is fast paced.  The hardest part of my job is getting customers to understand the importance to maintain their vehicle.
good,Its a good place to work for like your first job and maybe someplace to actually grow but there hours and pay is not all that great
good,All problems in this store start at the top.  The store GM is not an effective leader and only trains people to the minimum level necessary for their job.  There is little follow-through with any issues at the store level.  Corporate policies for store operations are not enforced and the violation of policies are not punished unless upper management gets involved.
good,Help customers with automotive questions and concerns install batteries and some light bulbs. I've learned that some people are more dangerous when it comes to automotive knowledge than I realized. The manager is ok when they want to be however if you are take time off you punished by having hours taken away. My co-workers are fun and enjoyable to work with. The hrdest part of the job is trying to help customers when they think they know whats right and they are completely wrong.
good,"As a female working in a predominately male work place, it was very difficult trying to get hours and getting customers to listen to me (as they were all male). Respect as an employee was hard to gain and the management there wasn't too easy going with anyone having a second job. The company, as a whole, does not care about their low level employees."
good,"Used to be a good place. Now it has a bad work / personal life balance. The schedule is used to punish. The company, or at least middle management doesn't want you to be involved in community events, nor will allow LOA to help with community based disasters as it is an inconvenience to them. While you are not paid commissions you are expected to pressure sell add on items."
good,"For the most part from the time I started until the day I walked out I had to continuously fight for my position. They never honored my Dr.'s orders after my surgery and continued health situation,  they didnt accommodate any of my needs"
good,"Not bad to work at, the hours can be long and take over a big portion of your life. unfortunately being full time you must have open availability, no care for if you're in school or not"
good,"Work environment was great just management didn't do their job whatsoever, most unprofessional place to work with manager and regional manager in place."
good,"the hardest part was trying to stay open and wait on customers and change everything over to the  autozone style store. I enjoyed working there and we done very well after a couple of months when the public seen the new autozone sign out front,It was still tough for a year or so until we sold all chiefs inventory after that it was great. All the employees got along good and had good attitudes."
good,I've enjoyed my experience at this job it has given me many opportunities to learn and grow both as a person and as a car enthusiast.Hardest parts are slow days.
good,Overall a great work environment but management and corporate need to get better at following through with promises such as promotions or even shift hours.
good,"Some of the management was great.  There was back lash/stabbing and jealousy problems.  They would schedule, change schedule and not give enough hours."
good,"While I was working for Autozone I had an almost absent store  manager, his apathetic behavior towards running the store really showed on the employees. He went on to quit and leave the store with no manager and there wasn't an appointed assistant manager all while there was no district manager."
good,"All locations are different, I worked with some great people. You have to take the good with the bad, generally under staffed at the height of the business day. Plenty of opportunities to help out people that truly value any help. "
good,I loved that we could have sales competitions in a friendly manner. Within the first couple months I was competing for the top spot in the store. Learning how to upsell items forced me to learn what items typically went with which jobs.
good,"I was hired as a commercial delivery driver. As managers changed, the schedule did not pay enough to drive from Antlers, OK, which several customers depended on."
good,"if they would rehire me i'd go back. you will learn a lot about cars, planograms, stocking . the do computer tests once a month.. most of the people are ok to work with, get along..."
good,I have really enjoyed working here and will continue as long as I physically can. I like most of the people that I work with.   There are those that want to learn to be able to truly understand and help customers and some that feel the need to make things up or exaggerate what may really be going on with customers vehicles to makes them look like they know everything. This a good place to start.
good,i wanted full time and never got it plus i was sent to a further autozone than the one closest to me.and to many managers working there and sometimes have red shirts do all the work .also they need to put more security cameras.
good,Work hard and you still probably won't get a promotion. You'll have sore feet and hours so crazy you have to be in your 20s to have the stamina. You're just padding the CEOs pockets. Don't kid yourself.
good,I learned a lot about cars and can always take that knowledge with me. I enjoyed my time there and would recommend more females to try and work there for personal knowledge.
good,You do so much stocking and pulling parts you have no other choice but to learn also you come to learn about other people issues about the same car  Like I said is a great place to learn
good,"Its a good fun job for someone who doesnt have alot of education and doesnt mind working for minimum wage.  Throughout the day you help customers find parts they need, or stock shelves in the store."
good,I loved my job as a del driver. I got to meet a lot of people especially men. I am a social butterfly the more the merrier. lol I didn't like management.. When i reported it the asst manager and I was both let go.  But ya great place to work
good,"Some advance, some don't. If you have no life and offer to do everybody else's job, they offer you a management position. Then once you accept it, you don't have to work at all. Just tell others what to do."
good,"I enjoyed the job at AutoZone, the management just refuse to provide an employee with enough hours to live out of even though I was a full-time employee."
good,"A good place to get your feet wet in the auto field. You'll pick up a lot of information about cars if you don't have a idea that is. Standard discount on parts nothing crazy. As a driver basically on your own just doing your job. As for the bad autozone have what is known as a point system and it's the worst. After a certain amount of points your fired no matter what. Points relate to mostly attendance and that to me is by far the worst thing about autozone. Because if your not the most favorable on the job you will notice while others points drop off even when they're not at work, your's on the other hand will forever continue to raise."
good,A typical day would involve preparing all the food items that were going to be sold at the concession stand. We also had to make sure everything was clean and orderly so accidents and bacteria spread would be minimal.
good,"Muy exigente para lo que pagan, muy poco crecimiento"
good,"overall experience great, until change in management and no one willing to attempt to solve the issue internally threw HR. also if your play your employees with peanuts, your gonna get monkeys."
good,I didnt know much about cars when i began the job in 2014 now im the commercial manager. lots of potential for advancement and fun fast paced working environment.
good,"Retail, hotrods and great customers.  Team work always includes the customers and their needs. Computer work was tedious at times, some things hard to find, but overall had a great time."
good,"it is a very nice place to work and a very good learning experience as far as the work place, scheduling and etc. I feel upper management needs to have a weekly meeting  on scheduling and know there employees pros and cons to make the company run at a higher level."
good,It was a good experience job was fun employes where cool hardest part of the job was locating where all the parts went at first
good,Company did not offer many hours but on a typical day I enjoyed interacting with the customers and helping them select the best automotive parts.  I had little interaction with management because there was never an issue that came up.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to help out a customer because the part they needed was not in stock.
good,"Heavy use of customer service skills and time management.  Hard work on weekends, holidays, nights.  "
good,Only down fall for autozone is i only received 6 hours a week. i couldnt live on 6 hours a week. it cost me more to go to work than to work there.
good,"Good for a high schooler. If you are an adult with real life bills you will not get them paid working here. If you are of adult age and still live at home with your parents,  with no over head you won't mind the pay."
good,Manger was not the greatest person to work with. Alot of down time.
good,you get to meet new people that love cars and want the best for them
good,Is as expected from a retailer.  They would rather keep the woman that break company guidelines than the men that just happen to be in wrong place at the wrong time.
good,Good friends a there was not for me and went back to school .I learned to make a schedule for co worker and and to controle inventory of stock on over two million items in store items
good,I like this job just not my style i would rather be working on something rather then selling parts
good,Coworkers were good . Work environment t was acceptable  had issues with management and their style of managing  they encouraged working together for benefit of work culture.
good,"More focused on customer service. Great benefits,  employee discounts, and good people overall. Staffing can be a real issue, but a good manager and supportive staff can combat that."
good,Not a bad place to work. Could do better with managing its employees so that people weren't stuck working 40+ hours per week. Very easy to move forwards in the company
good,"I started at AutoZone when I was 19. A year later I am 20 and now a manager ,but they do not pay well as man people think. We got paid what a good salary would be almost 6 years ago or more. When I did move up and try to get a little bit more it was like pulling teeth. The people you work with are most the time fun easy going people. Even when i moved up to manager they would not give me full-time with benefits despite being there for over a year and working hard to get there. That is why I say it is Okay because it certainly not the worse place to work it pays the same as fast food. The store manager at my store acted like the companies money was his, going out of his way not to promote the people that deserved it but instead promoting willing on how little they cost to promote. In my year and almost half this company for me has been all Cons and Only like one Pro."
good,"Part time is not 26 hours it’s 18. You have to call other stores to get hours. I hate this part because people who are full time get all the hours and of course, they are lazy and don’t want to do the actual work that keeps the store going. Just mooches. If the mooches weren’t there, the hard workers could get their hours. But auto zone doesn’t care about your work ethic only that you are a body on the clock."
good,"Buen sueldo y tiempo justo de trabajo pero tienes que vender aún que no lo quieran y pésimo liderazgo de gerentes ya que te presionan demasiado y si no vendes te corren , distrital muy despota"
good,"i didnt know much about auto parts and i really enjoyed the experience and most of all the customers. i enjoyed all the co workers. i learned how to check and install batteries, changed windshield wipers, checked alternators and starters."
good,"The daily work and deliveries are fine and keep you busy."
good,I wasn’t able to do much because I was still in high school and I was always on top of my studies making sure I was passing all my classes but autozone didn’t want to work around my flexibility on working n school I barley got any hours with them.
good,"Good place to work, good benefits n very aimed at making sure there workers are safe n motivated, during the year they hold different activities for your families to attend, also offer a great 401k n benefits w stock options"
good,"Overall a fine place to work, depending on the employees you will learn quite a bit of basic automotive knowledge. Has your typical retail setbacks as far as customers and poor management."
good,The only reason I left was cause of bad management  but over all the job was easy to do and I was always on task getting thing done make the day past by quick
good,"As always, when you have just one job title and you can handle all your duties with no problem, you get more on your plate and you have to do other people’s job. But the company refuses to give anyone a raise."
good,I was hired in there as a commercial delivery driver and knew nothing about the auto industry. i didn't learn a lot but i did learn some stuff about what parts are included on a vehicle.sometimes it can be busy sometimes its low key all depending on the time of day.
good,"you worked 10 hours fill shelves learn from older mechanics, had to install batteries in cars some very interesting people that walk into the stores. management differed daily"
good,"I have good customer service, actually has had job offers because i can sell really well. Quick on my feet and good and finding out problems with cars."
good,"Because it is a 3rd shift, people are trying to be happy, but by the end of the week, lack of rest hits everyone pretty hard. Also, you wouldn't know you had to work overtime until the day before, which throws you off completely, being 3rd shift."
good,The job is not hard. The hardest part of the job is the stress of having to do everything yourself and not getting the support from the regional team. The pay is ridiculous for the amount of work that  employees are expected to do. They are paid less than McDonald's workers and most managers have mechanic and automotive knowledge that sets us apart from other parts places.
good,"I enjoy the work place, but it could use some help. Fun people to work around. It is definitely a fast pace work environment. And you also have to pay attention to detail"
good,Fun environment of you have good managers pay is low until you move up. I worked commercial thats the only way I would recommend AutoZone the DIY counter is stressful and can be frustrating
good,"Hiring process takes a long time .great discounts , flexible schedule paid time off ,manager's are great workers very knowledgeable about parts good customer service"
good,overall its a good place for a first job. Coworkers are great and are very helpful. can get to be hectic when busy. salary is not up to par with work load demand..
good,I really think you guys need to improve on picking your store managers. Your store managers are horrible except a few. Some are  perverted and just don't know what they are doing .
good,"Typically start at 7:00 stocking , cleaning , preparing returns for next truck , delivery' s start around 8:00. On most days we are delivering at a steady pace , but other days it an overwhelm you as not enough drivers are present. Between runs I stock , clean store areas, clean parking lot and assist with planograms."
good,take care of the customers need. auto parts to accessories inside the vehicle. interesting job and you get to learn about the customers as they come in on a regular basis.
good,"Clock In , do Management Paper work KPI reports etc.. Count safe , Count and prep Cash registers assign tasks on Captains log for employees. Customer satisfaction Is #1 at Auto Zone stores we do everything we can to keep that customer coming back! we live by the Auto Zone pledge which is "" Auto Zone always puts customers first! we know our parts and products, our stores look great! we got the right  merchandise at the right price!"" which is all true.. The problem is that they hire too many kids that call off at the most inconvenient times . I've been with the store for many years and built relationships with commercial accounts and regular customers , they were always happy to see me as I was to see them."
good,Great customer service.some free services for customers. Free wiper installation and free battery installation on most cars .most workers are polite and helpful.
good,This a simple place to work but there is not any room more advancement as far as positions go. Benefits are only offered to full time employees it could be years before you are offered a full time positions.
good,"My typical workday consist of counting merchandise and doing planograms.  I've learned a lot, I worked as Assistant Manager for 2 years.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers."
good,"It is a great company to work for but you have to stay on them about advancements and raises and hours. the people are great, management is the biggest problem in the company"
good,"good place to work but upper management has control issues. Don't like the location they have me at, not the safest place for me."
good,"I learned a lot about auto parts, and cars.  I was surprised how many people know nothing about their cars, (make, model)."
good,"Typical place of employment, not much room to move up or expand knowledge of company. Management was hardest part of the job, co-workers and job itself were great."
good,"This is a great job if your a young person in my opinion. They did not like to listen to m ideas on how to save them money and also how to make more money. I felt like i was not able to be creative to help better the company I was working for. The schedules were not written out in advance I had to work crazy hours for very minimum pay. I actually felt like I was working for free at times. My most enjoyable part was when it was time to go home or time to eat lunch. Management at the store level helped out but at the corporate level, they did not care in my opinion. In all it is a ok little job to do while one is looking for something more serious and something along a career as I'm doing."
good,Co-workers are nice and management is nice. But ultimately management is powerless to run their own store. Corporate makes all decisions and chances for advancement are non-existent.
good,"The particular location has a very successful commercial and retail sales quotient.  A good working atmosphere however the store was typically understaffed.  Advancement opportunities were non-existant.  Store was located in an area open to theft in daylight hours      and always near closing at night. As a manager always a great concern.  Store manager was very experienced with many years in the business, but was ineffective in scheduling personell."
good,"A typical day:"
good,"Management of Day-to-day sales operations, loss prevention, scheduling, and inventory management, Monitored business successes and opportunities through the effective use of PnL statements and developed business plan to improve profits."
good,"A Typical day would consist of me coming in to work at 1pm or so, checking tils as well as the store safe. Going over the sales goals for the day as well as the week. I learned a great deal about cars in the process. upper management has no idea what goes on in their stores. The hardest part of autozone would probably be the fact that their upper management doesn't concern themselves with the everyday autozoner."
good,Answer the phones and help with selling car parts. I have good management. The hardest part about my job is trying to help someone and you can't.
good,"A typical day is working with other people, most are not happy because they need parts for there broken vehicle. The customers can be great or they can be very angry. We learn parts as we go along as well as professional mechanics that offer advice and help to us, the management team really cares about there employees and would do everything for us. Over all its a good place to work for a starting job. The hardest part of the job is when customers come in cussing and screaming because someone gave them the wrong part but if we can just calm them down and ensure them we can get them the correct part it goes smooth."
good,"most of the time its busy which is great."
good,"Working at Autozone i learned a lot of things your average person might not. On an average day i was usually in the store helping people locate the right part for the job they were working on. Wether they were doing a simple oil change or replacing an axle on their suspension. Sometimes customers were in need of a new car battery or light bulb on their headlight or taillight, and i would go and assist them in replacing either/or. So communicating with my customers was very important in order for me to find the right part. hardest part was knowing the exact issue with their car problems due to the fact that we weren't taking the car apart to look at the exact problem so we would have to go by what the customer was experiencing. Overall it was very rewarding because i would learn things about something we use everyday. My coworkers would sometimes be more experienced than i would so they would assist me when i wouldn't have all the answers We worked well as a team."
good,"Trained in use of tools related to needs of automotive mechanics, including computer programs required for automotive service. "
good,I was productive working for them but I wanted to advance my career and there was no way I could do it with that company.
good,"Count your drawer and keep an eye on it at all times, count the money that comes in and out twice. Make sure the store is clean organized, front face all items fill shelfs if needed, work on sections cleaning and following new planogram setings. Be friendly with customers but dont be best friends with them keep it profesional. Be friendly with coworkers but evoid flirting. Report any misconduct from Supervisors Managers even District Managers dont keep things quiet. Be in a defensive mode but dont let anyone know you are. The enjoyable part is do you part of the job help others ask for help and never give your phone number to strangers."
good,"put up with cust's that wanted parts almost free.a lot about cars and parts.one was great,the other two w/very lazy.same as management.working with the diff.hours 6am-3pm then the next day 6pm-close and then back again.getting a pay check."
good,"We were able to work with what we had and still make mission. Often times shipments were late but that never stopped us from making the best of a bad situation. Management kept us involved in the affairs of the store to avoid unanswerable questions. As a team we provided the best customer service possible with the tools provided, easier said than done. It was satisfying to have such an amazing team."
good,Good customer service. Enjoyed learning about automotive industry.
good,"Its a simple job, one I wouldn't reccomend moving up in the company simply because its compensation is not worth it. But other then that it's a fun part time job."
good,Overall the company gives clear and simple directions of its requirements and goals for the employees. The problem is a constant level of understaffing and or under budgeting of hours form higher levels of management.
good,"I loved working as a parts sales manager, a lead on set up teams, and even as an assistant manager. The hours we're flexible and the coworkers and customers were never too much of a problem until I became a store manager. My superior was very disengaged and basically told me when I took the job that it would be difficult to do other activities outside of work. I took that as a challenge instead of a warning. Then came the 11-13 hour days. We were told by upper management that if we didn't have enough staff, we were required to work so that there was coverage. My boss rarely came to check in or coach me in any way. I thought that was a good thing, and even received an award for most improved store in our region in my second year, only to be told that I'm ""NOY a team player during my yearly evaluation. I continued for another 6 months fighting personal stress and issues that leaked into my work. I went on temporary leave for 3 months and asked to go back to my original store. Unfortunately, my boss decided to put me in a store that was completely broken to ""help this store manager out"". I loved my job, but really felt like a worthless puppet by the end of my venue with the company. I'll never go back, but I will continue to shop there and say hello to those I met throughout my time with the company."
good,"Enjoyed applying auto zone's core values of putting all customers first, then co-workers, then other responsibilities.  Store manager is way too much ""by the book"" and not concerned enough about performance/initiative of all employees. Not enough assistant managers at that store. Needs to hire enough employees to handle all shifts, making the work load more appropriate."
good,The manager did not comply with company policy and loosely followed rules. Employees were fine but not motivated. I thought this company wanted to develop future managers.
good,"Well how can i start this i feel autozone is good, they do have to work on alot of down falls that they do have. They need to have a better advancment in their careers. In my experience managers were pretty bad when it came to caring about what their employees wanted. Scheduling was awful most of the time without really caring if you could work those day can't have side job or nothing."
good,The job was pretty good everyone was good. Managers where great as well the would help if u didnt know what to do in that part of your job. The job was pretty simple
good,The pay scale is low for the industry. They don't care about how low they pay their employees. They promise things they don't follow through on. Burnt out managers cause employees to leave.
good,"Working there was pretty cool till the hired a no at all Manager. Treated his employees terribly. Before this new manger , everything was pretty chill work would be great. As well as promotions. Being the only female there was alright. The new manager they hired sub pressed me and tried dragging me down."
good,"While working as a parts sales manager, I was told that I’d be getting paid $13.00 but was later changed to only $11.00. Then they decided to make me part time"
good,didn't really get paid very well the job was cooler than the pay the management wasn't the best but they were there if they had better managers and higher pay it would be a cool place to work
good,"The upward motion just isn't there. Unless someone above you dies or retires, you'll stay right where you are for years to come. The office is slightly dated but not bad; parking is the main point of annoyance for many. Management varies wildly by department, with some individuals being friendly and helpful and others on a complete power trip. The work itself is what you might expect, and - again - varies by department."
good,It was fun! I enjoyed my time working for Autozone. The scheduling wasn't that good because I was always getting called in but other than that it is fun learning about your everyday customers. Also there is a lot of room for advancement.
good,AutoZone was a decent parts store but i think they lean more towards tools for the job rather than the off the wall and odd parts for specific and specialty applications.
good,"There is no typical day at work when working in Automotive."
good,"Extremely easy job, Good for someone who wants a slower pace work environment. It is retail so customers will always be customers but not a bad job at all."
good,It's great to learn new things about your auto vehicle. Also great place knowing how to deal with difficult situations with customers and how to help through the situation with still buying merchandise.I learned how to deal with commercial products and company that requires you to drive and deliver auto parts.
good,"I was not able to move up in the company, they would promise for me to get a management position and hire pay and I was never given it. Management was not the best during my time there I had the chance to see at least 3 come in in 2 months."
good,I really do like working here. The manager is really nice and fun to work for. There are definitely some things that are personally related to my situation that could change for me at work but those don't reflect on the job itself.
good,10 year at the company and overall everything was ok.  I only had problem with advancement as my position was hard to fill and they did not want to loose me and have to find someone else to do the job
good,"This place is good if you're young and starting to be independent. They have very flexible hours and will work with your schedule. You don't have to know about cars, but it definitely helps."
good,"Enjoyed the job, the people, the stores.  However, AutoZone is not MMJ friendly and after I was struck while on duty in a company vehicle, I had to test for drugs/alcohol.  As an MMJ patient, I tested positive for THC."
good,I love my job and what I do but lately the managers I work for are pushing me out well it feels that way. I want to do something in commercial auto parts if possible
good,"Good Job, not enough hours or advancement opportunities. Hours were given to new people instead of the ones with the most seniority.  No benefits, and hard to advance."
good,decent place to work if you are single ive been working at autozone for a year and if you dont mind working weekends this is a great place to work and if you are in school
good,"Typical day was assisting customers with their vehicles whether its finding out whats wrong with their car to getting the correct part for them, even changing a battery or 2 a day. Learned general info and the basics of motor vehicles and how they run. Management was pretty fair to an extent. Workforce culture had a wide range. The hardest part of the job is locating all of the parts in the back. Just knowing where everything is located throughout the store. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you helped another customer get back on the road safely."
good,"A good experience to learn all areas of retail and small business operation sales and inventory, management and merchandising, and operations."
good,Was a great job but needed to move from Missouri back to Iowa. Hours varied never knew week to week. Was going through alot of management changes before I left.
good,"There was a point in time when the store itself went without an actual store manager for almost two weeks to a month, as well as being short a psn. While the store is slowly improving, anyone higher than a store manager does not care about the needs of their employees. In recent months 3+ strong employees left due to stress and lack of support from the company."
good,"A typical work day consisted of assisting customers with trouble shooting their vehicles, looking up parts, and testing vehicles with diagnostic equipment."
good,Nice employees and managers.  Teamwork oriented environment.  Flexible work schedules.  customer is always right theme throughout the workplace.  Relaxed
good,It was a face pace work environment. It was a challenging environment with diversity of different levels of educated people. Working day to day with people was something I enjoyed.
good,"Autozone is a good place to work for. Sure at times, you have to deal with customer BS but you can grow in this company. You can go to part sales manager to assistant manager and even more."
good,I left due to extreme personal issues.  Life became difficult after losing my 19 year old son to random violence. Autozone was a nice place to work at.
good,"This company is great and ideal for various ages who love to learn and love cars and people. The location I worked for however (Happy Valley). Was stressful,chaotic, and unorganized.  If the management and the under management lead are more organized and worked together with non management,get tasks done and have organized store. It’s be successful"
good,"This job is exciting if you like working with the public, but it could be a nightmare if you don't know how to control you self and emotions around people.  It can be a competitive environment when trying to manage customer attitudes and the work flow."
good,"I used to love the job, then I was relocated to a new store with promises of a promotion and job description change and never got it. My new manager never worked with my schedule and as a part timer I was supposed to be able to make my own. I was willing to work what was needed when needed but never got a schedule that actually worked. My first position in Homedale was much better and manager took the time in making everyones schedule work well."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of cleaning, answering phone calls, helping customers, front facing and stocking the store, and giving helpful advice to customers. At auto zone i learned how to interact with people of different kinds, such as rude customers or someone who insisted they was right. I also learned how to keep a store looking clean, how to stock merchandise, and i acquired a lot of computer skills. I didn't agree with the management due to the fact that there was more managers than regular employees. This led to projects not getting finished on time because of different strategies and ideas on what should be done first. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers who didn't want to understand something and having to explain the problem. To me the most enjoyable part of the job was truck days when we got to restock the store."
good,AutoZone was a good place to work as long as the management team at that particular store was good. There where many great people working there but there were a few that made things difficult or even impossible on the workers at the store.
good,"A typical day for a full time employee consists of 10 hours, dealing with multiple customers, inventory and anything that the manager may need completed."
good,"Fun work place,part-time looking for full time. Air conditioned truck with benefits and, room for advancement.Commercial delivery's, Counter sales.Customer contacts."
good,I enjoyed working a autozone. It was a great place if you like to help people with their cars. lots of creepy old men in auto parts though. great place to work.
good,"A typical day at work is nonexistent, it is ever-changing. There may be some days where you barely have any customers and other days where they are beating down the door for no reason. Expect to be met with hostility when you don't have a part in stock or try to correct someone."
good,All in all it was an okay job for a part time job. The hours were good for people who like to work early and still have a full day. I left because I needed more financially.
good,Most days at autozone were fairly decent until you had days were it was non stop from open to close. Your trying to provide excellent customer service for all but can't when management was sitting in the back no willing to help.
good,Is a very fast past workplace. The fellow employees are great to work with. Customers can be somewhat difficult at times but overall a good place to work.
good,"AutoZone was a very new experince and I met a lot of new people and always learned something new daily. "
good,"Long day of work for 10 hrs. I learned from using there computerized system to put orders on the conveyer belt, to stacking totes onto pallets so they can ship those orders out."
good,El crecimiente en la empresa es muy tardado. Dar mas capacitacion al personal
good,Most of the people are OK upper management leaves something to be desired. Upper management takes for ever to get things done then you have to ask them many times for the same thing.
good,"Es una gran empresa americana desgraciadamente esta muy apegada a los estandares mexicanos, sueldos bajos y mucho tiempo sentado en el mismo lugar por tiempos prolongados."
good,"I enjoyed working for autozone very fast pace, good people, over all a good work environment, some customers could be very rude, at times right down nasty. management staff some excellent some not."
good,"selling parts meeting and caring for all peoples needs."
good,"Creo que lo mas satisfactorio en este trabajo es que antes de entrar no tenia idea sobre las auto partes, gracias al puesto creo que domino bastante bien el tema."
good,AutoZone is a good workplace as a part time job and reasonable for a fulltime job if you don't want a hard workplace but the pay isn't all there.
good,"if your into car and auto parts this job is for you. team work is key! "
good,"Come into work, load truck, deliver parts, drive back to the main branch, repeat."
good,"the job itself was great, what really brought the store i worked at down was the head management. working part time at this store was solid what became the issue is the constant terrible scheduling. working a 2nd job the manager in charge of schedules would constantly place me into a position where its pick one or the other.the maintenance of vehicles was always fun or funny in some way, once had a bmw that was entirely battery powered doors, locks, and trunk. battery exploded on the premise, rendering the vehicle useless do to the fact that everything was locked at the time.we ended up getting a new battery installed back into the trunk by releasing the hood lock from underneath the vehicle with a hanger and putting jumper cables onto the bolts provided under the hood."
good,"Responsible for daily open and closing operations. Quality customer service, and inventory, also knowledge of auto parts and parts delivery."
good,The typical day in autozone was as soon as i clocked in the store would be bombarded with customers and alot of parts that were left on the counter from returns o basically the day would go by fast because there was so much work to do in so little time
good,"Commercial Driver"
good,"Overall the company is a great place to work for. The only issue was the management at this particular store. I can not speak for other locations. I was never given my 30, 60 or 90 review. I was told I would be considered for full time after 90 days and was never even given a review much less the opportunity to transition into full time employment."
good,"Everyday customers come in the store they tell us what they need, we get the parts for their vehicle, sometime they ask to install batteries, headlight bulbs, wiper blade and more. "
good,"Almost all positions are part time. Which makes you imelligible for all the benefits they list, like holiday pay, health insurance, vacation, etc. They tell you they hire within the company, but in my 6 months with them they hired two outside managers."
good,i liked working there it was a good part time job not much room for advancement though...
good,"Team work"
good,"I enjoyed working at autozone. The people were great and the management was great. I drove one of the company cars, bringing car parts to local mechanic shops."
good,great customers serivce but   bad management and  lack of respect for   any employee  who gose thur domestic violance
good,"i am currently the manager of the commercial program I answer the phone and build clients for the business daily. I love talking to people, so my day goes by well"
good,"A typical day at work i would clock in and get right to work. Greet my customers and welcoming them out loud to ""Auto Zone"". I have learned many things about automobiles, such as charging car batterys, checking engine lights, changing head lights etc.. My co-workers were definetly my best co-workers i've had all team players. The hardest part of the job i would say is nothing because everything is a learning and understanding process to a job. I enjoyed satisfying my customers and making my boss and management proud."
good,"cashiering, customer service, working with my coworkers to help customers out. Management lacks a bit, but still get the day moving. hardest part would be when were understaffed and customers walk out cause we cant help them. I enjoy helping customers look for their parts and help them get the job done."
good,"The company is okay, however, their training process is not the best. What I have learned at Autozone is you have to be a go getter. They do not give you anything you have to work hard to get promoted. I always learn something new about a car every day and I try to share the  information with my customers who are not that knowledgeable about cars. When I first started at Autozone, I did not know how to put windshield wipers on a car. I now know how to put them on all by myself. I know about batteries, alternators and how to take better care of you car. As far as my co workers we work as a team. On a typical day at Autozone is very busy and a quick pace store. "
good,If you love auto parts this is the job for you. Customer service is number one.
good,"My job is a fast paced company, I deliver parts to other stores in the company (L.I. , Brooklyn, queens, Staten island ) it requires lifting & Knowledge Of Commercial Driving Routes"
good,"Overall, not to bad. Great pay, just more to be desired. I've learned a lot about cars, and issues they face in my 3 1/2 yrs employment."
good,"Its a great place to learn about cars, parts, and sales. emploees must keep the customers as their priority. Some customers get very unhappy if they cant find their part or if the store is too busy. Great part i you build a relationship with the customer so they always come back."
good,worked in inventory and banking departments
good,"I would have to say, the most enjoyable part of the day is getting to work with real people that aren’t always the happiest because if you are at a parts store 9/10 it isn’t willingly. Straight to the point you get to change that, you being there with your knowledge and experience goes a long way for someone in seek of assistance with their vehicle."
good,I was in charge or commercial sales. Brought that company from $200 a week to $5000 a week in sales in less than a month. Management was very poor and tried to take credit for things they didn’t do.
good,learn about cars. how to deal with customers and also learn to work on some parts of the car some days can be easy some hard because of the custumers . all co workers seem to get along. hard part is to try and remember parts
good,Is ah good company to work just the paid is not there. In order tho have a good salary store managment will be the best option .........................
good,"At the time worked with a great bunch of people. Autozone is a great place to work, learning all the time and meet fantastic people everyday kept the job interesting"
good,"Autozone has a very competitive, but friendly environment. I started working there with literally no knowledge about vehicles or anything and they took me in and taught me everything I needed to know and more."
good,"Enjoy job, but want less hours. Not enough drivers, so I have to do more driving.when not on road, I help out in the store.stocking shelves, assisting customers."
good,"The culture is pounded into you from day one, you will quickly learn the moto, cheer, chant. District Managers are promoted by metrics that sometimes do not make sense and are heavily based on how well a store performed, which is oftentimes not a reflection of a good manager, but a manager in the right place at the right time. For instance, a manager was promoted to District manager after they were placed in a store that the previous year took a loss from employee theft from the manager and several staff. To make things worse they were not taking care of their customers. any manager, even a new manager would have made an improvement there, if they had increase sales several years in a row then maybe it was them and not the situation."
good,"I was hired off the street & worked in three as a store manager for over three years. My experience was overall a good one. I was paid fairly and always made my quarterly bonuses as well for exceeding sales goals. I was lucky enough to have been assigned, in my opinion a very good District Manager, who understood the business very well. I enjoyed managing both sides of the business in both retail & commercial. Unfortunately after three years of always making bonuses, and  never having been in any trouble or have had any corrective actions, I was suddenly let go, by a new DM that I had only had maybe two months. This is why I gave management such a low score. The reasoning for me leaving, along with some other great employees was simply put ""not warranted"". I know this from the over twenty five years experience, I've had in business management. However, one bad upper management mistake doesn't mean that the company as a whole isn't a good place to work for, and after all of this, I would still recommend them."
good,Autozone was really a learning experience in the retail business since it really pushes your limits with communicating and really taught me alot about automobiles.
good,"I enjoy working for AutoZone. Giving customers that WOW experience, and then have them return just to say they have enjoyed the professionalism and knowledge that was given along with the right parts that fit their vehicles. "
good,AutoZone is a good company to work for. However they need to concentrate a little more on training their employees so that they are able to perform at the maximum level possible for success often there are a lot of gray areas in their training and preparation which could lead to the failure of their Associates
good,I enjoy working at AutoZone. I enjoy helping customers find the parts they need for their cars to get them back on the road. I enjoy being commercial sales specialist as I helped the commercial accounts with their parts that they need to fix their customers cars deliver the parts in a timely fashion. I also enjoy going out weekly and doing sales calls and informing the commercial accounts of the new upcoming sales and promotions AutoZone is having
good,Its a job. I have seen intimidation tactics used by management to try and achieve their personal goals and not those necessarily good for the store or team. I have also witnessed basic necessities not being ordered because it will affect the store managers bonus.
good,You have to keep up with your your competitor. All while keeping your store up. Manage your team. Also provide extraordinary customer service. They privide good benefits. But the advancement starts to diminish once you hit store manager.
good,"Deliver parts"
good,"It was a great company to work for. The people are great but dealing with the public can be hard. "
good,"The average work day consists of, making sure the store looks clean, parts are put in the proper place, ensuring customers get the par they need, as well as push for the current sale's available. Once a week stores will receive a shipment of needed parts for restocking, this entails lifting heavy objects."
good,Employers are to meet a production rate and the environment is fast paced. They promote a culture of support and collaboration but it does not project in employee's moral. Breaks are short and facility too big. Supervisors are constantly on your back as it relates to production rate.
good,Great place to go fot parts for anything u need. Even tools. People are nice usual . Employees are usual nice. Great environment to work in if Ur looking for a simple part time job
good,La empresa es buena solo que el personal que lo administra no es el deceado es muy arrogante
good,"You get a lot of experience working with all kinds of customers. There will be a lot of unsatisfied customers due to the fact that you don’t have a car part that they need. Some may even want you to go out of your way to do something the job doesn’t allow. Such as going outside to help with their car during the night time. However, you learn a lot how to deal with customers and build patience."
good,"Opening the store in a orderly fashion, deactivating the alarm, handling petty cash, counting the safe, filing paper work from the day before, completing Managers Next Day Review, wrapping touts, cores, and batteries in preparation for new inventory. Assigning registers, lanes and tasks to Autozoners; including lunch schedules. Handling customers needs, responding to tickets, installing batteries, light bulbs, and wiper blades."
good,"I've worked for Autozone twice. Once for a few years and, more recently, for 8 months. I remember why I left the first time. Work must come first and life must come second. Everything is based off the numbers the reports make and your ""hours"" are always held over your head. As a CSM, you can't do enough ever. Their health insurance is a joke. I have a mental health issue and that didn't matter. I sadly, as most Zoners do, lived pay check to pay check."
good,"was relocated with asking me about it before. "
good,"steady work environment, lots of calls coming in at once. not a slow paced job. management was understandable. discounts were provided to employees. flexible schedule."
good,"Enjoyed my time at AutoZone. There's a team mentality there- everyone pretty much bans together to complete a task."
good,Not a long term career. Company does not understand they work against themselves. If they would listen to those that are actually working in the stores they could beat out competitors.
good,"For a typical day working at AutoZone was keeping busy. I was always doing something like organizing merchandise and making the store look clean and presentable.  Working at AutoZone can be very face paced and other times it would be slow especially on days that there was bad weather. As I continued to work for AutoZone,  I got alot more experience with auto parts and how they work. The managers at AutoZone were nice.  They knew how to handle situations well.  I would say the hardest part of the job was when it got very busy in the store and the store was under staffed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with people and help others when needed especially when customers would come in and need assistance with their vehicles when it was snowing out."
good,Autozone was the starting point for many to advance to better opportunities. Autozone has a flexible work schedule. It's a friendly work environment. Many job opportunities.
good,you would need to be able to understand car maitence and several auto mechanics questions and answers. i agree with most shade tree mechanics and also saying the right words to sell the right part.
good,does give you some management and retail sales experience. good place to meet people in related fields. the people associated with this company can be very helpful
good,"they have good team leaders who you can easily learn from, most store have a good routine so your schedule is what you want it to be , they pay is ok not really great but ok. overall good place to work"
good,"A typical day consists of pulling all reports and analyzing numbers. Prepping work for employees to begin upon arrival. Helping customers and providing what services are applicable. Also working inventory management ( verifying returns, overstock, and QOH issues). Overseeing all financial transactions."
good,Great first job. Great experience. Great learning experience. Learn alot about automotives. Good opportunity to grow. If you work hard and put enough time there's opportunity for advancement.
good,Help customers to there vehicle needs. always remember the customers always right.  fast pace job and physical the best part of the job i love working with cars and learning new things on all types of vehicles.
good,"When you first start they kind of throw you to sharks hoping you don't drown or get ate up. Not a lot of structured training. No commission, no incentive to offer."
good,"Always kept me busy without being stressful. Was team related. A work day would consist of dealing with customers, making sure the store was stocked, making sure everything was neat."
good,It was a good job if you're going to school because they have flexible schedule . The human resource was horrible they never get back to you if yoh have a issue that needed to be addressed
good,"buena cultural laboral, buenas prestaciones de ley"
good,assisted managed with schedule making. Covered extra shifts. Worked weekends and holidays. Relocated in multiple occasions. stocked shelves with new merchandise.
good,"Auto zone the company and policies are with the best of them. I just don't care for the promotion systems, you literally have to know someone in the company to make it past part sales manager. That's my only real negative about the company, I felt smothered, 4 years with no change barely a pay increase."
good,"Fast pace,long hours, heavy lifting and getting dirty! Must be willing to stand for very long periods of time, working outside installing wiper blades and changing headlights and installing batteries."
good,Good workplace culture. Opportunity to learn about cars and car parts. Hardest part of job is moving the heavy parts around. Fun place to work every day is different.
good,"company goal line and directive very clear and set in accordance. many locations, employment transfers to other states should not be reversible if the location accepting is agreed and waiting."
good,"Good company to work for but upper management has no idea of what work/life balance is. You can bring change to your own location if you are a manager, but the company as a whole does not care sufficiently about its people."
good,"At AutoZone i received a lot of managerial skills and basic conceots of what it is to work in retail. The management that I had as a coah and mentor when I became store manager was very poor. Now, this is not to say that the entire management was poor because the supervisors that got me to the position of store manager were the best Ive ever had. The most enjoyable part was that I was very good at my job and kept my customers smiling. That brought me joy."
good,"Not bad, pay isn't great, benefits are alright, hours were not set and could change week to week day to day, the job it's self was enjoyable except for being pushed to sell unnecessary items to customers."
good,fun company to work for though the pay is very low  and long hours of standing and moving parts around  great managers just the advancements in autozone are very low and not  acceptable for a man with a family
good,"A job at Autozone does not require that you are a wiz with vehicles. But it does require the ability to listen, learn, and share all gained knowledge at a moments notice."
good,"It is fun working at AutoZone, it forced me to learn things I didn't think I never thought I would need to know. It also unveiled my passion for building Tuners!"
good,"Overall good company to work for if you are upper management (store manager/Commercial manager) Part sales managers are the back bone to this company, we deal with the most problems from customers but get hardly any recognition. We know how to sell but never get anything but a good job for hitting numbers. Once my store hit constant sales goals and product sales goals and were given a pizza and a case of sprite for a thank you. You get to know your regulars and there a blast to deal with, best part of the day is when you actually help someone fix there problem. The satisfaction customers get when you fix/help fix there cars is what drives you to go into work everyday. Great place to gain management experience just have a good connection with your PSM's and store manager and you'll be fine."
good,"I love working at AutoZone in the first store I ever worked at. The management was great as well as the team. The knowledge I gained is amazing, but i do believe the pay and raises could be better. There is a lot of bad management in a lot of the stores, but the ones that have great management you can see the vision AutoZone has."
good,"Most team members were active in wanting to improve team morale and make a happy environment, The manager at a district level failed to address pressing issues that later lead to problems in multiple stores"
good,the job is fun but im not getting paid enough to be able to live on my own. i always end up working past my breaks so i end up getting a penalty for it. the most enjoyable part is getting to learn more about different things about different stuff the hardest part is trying to get to the mechanic shops on time when there's so much other to take.
good,typical day would involve giving knowledge and advice to customers.installing and helping in quick repairs.ive learned so much in the automotive area . management has been up and down from reasonable decision to a not so friendly one .the hardest part is dealing with angry customers .the most enjoyable is seeing happy customers
good,"My duties included stock and cleaning. Although, all employees that were not management were  supposed to share the workload. Most days, I would be the only one doing stock, even when the front employees were doing nothing."
good,"help customers with issues"
good,"My store has great management but other stores, I've heard, have poor management.  Of course, there are issues like most places but its overall a good place to work at."
good,"Just do your job and you will be ok. Pretty simple and laid back. Fun environment. Flexible with hours, idea for school. You learn a lot about cars and customer service."
good,"Constantly changing goals, long unpaid hours. Lack of communication among upper management. Culture is inconsistent along all shifts.  Time off not readily approved."
good,"A typical work day is fast paced and time consuming but fun at the same time."
good,I would still be working for Autozone had there been attention to my hard work and dedication.  I worked in Pendleton Indiana and transferred to Belleview Florida which is where my career with AutoZone stopped.
good,"good place to work just not enough work hours..all managers are nice to work with.the payb scale needs t be adjusted for the work u do,besides that nice place to work..."
good,Company cares about employees and customers. Unlike their competitors who care more about money then people or the parts they sale. They focus on customer service and making sure the customer gets what they need.
good,Meet and greet and assist customers and cashier. help stocking shelves and ensure that the item the customer need is available.  The environment can be is somewhat relax and staff ae friendly.
good,"Typical day at Auto Zone  in customer service with assisting with automotive parts and installing light components. Management worked hard to assist customers"
good,"A typical day at work is very slow at the beginning, but at mid-day it gets up to speed. Working at Auto Zone has its ups and downs on a typical day whether dealing with frantic customers or nice ones, at the end of the day its all about customer satisfaction."
good,Good temporary job to earn extra cash on the side. They dont have many incentives but pretty easy work.  If you are a student and looking for a job until you graduate then this is it.
good,This job was a definitely different from the rest. I enjoyed communicating with customer and helping them with everyday needs. My employees were tolerable. The job doesn't pay enough for me.
good,"When I started here I loved it, but the upper management (District manager and higher) is a joke. they could care less about personal issues requiring time off, and in my experience rarely respected your days off by making you feel bad for wanting to take days off."
good,It's an ok place to work. Plenty of room to move up if you're willing to bust your tail for it. I feel that the company doesnt value ones personal life/time. To focused on sales and as long as someones running the business nothing else matters.
good,Autozone was an enjoyable experience and I got to learn from multiple mechanics. The only real problem was being understaffed during the nights we had the truck.
good,"Great employees, fun atmosphere, very slow advancment, not the greatest pay! Been there for 3 years, and have yet to be approach with better postion or what i could do to began becoming a better autozoner! Higher managment not the best at creatong better employees!"
good,This is a company that makes promises that it never keeps. I was promised advancement opportunities that never came to light. I was also appalled at the amount that they pay their employees
good,The hours are flexible and was conflicting hours for my babysitters. I asked for a set schedule but never was done. The management was great and they taught me a lot.
good,"If you work hard and stay focused, anyone can move up quickly in this company.  The downside is that you work a lot of weekends and second shift schedules.  This company micromanages on a daily basis and will cut your hours if sales are sagging.  Working with the general public can be tough at times, especially if customers prove to be difficult.  It was always refreshing to help teach people about their car whenever possible."
good,Gives you a great opportunity to learn the automotive parts business. Can gain the experience needed to advance in this career. WE really do thrive for customer satisfaction.
good,The job itself was fun. I enjoyed working with most customers in a field that interested me. The problem was no person would go the extra mile. It was a very lazy culture. Management was very strict and made it very difficult to have a relaxed environment.
good,"i like it so far, i just wish i had more hours , theres alot of info to learn but i got a proficient amount of knowledge , alot of angry customers alot of products."
good,"Good place to learn about vehicles as you help others with theirs."
good,"Fun workplace with meeting many new people. driving to Shops delivering parts, get payments, bring back to store and process paper work or payments. some days there are 1-3 people working also besides manager. hardest part is dealing with managers attitude and one sidedness to one associate"
good,"Good company to work for, but as far as career... The glass ceiling is pretty low. Not a company to retire from. The wages given need to improve."
good,"There are times where its very busy and start to feel bad the customers are waiting on a part, well at less I do. Fast pace at times"
good,The employment here was typical but also enjoyable. The management was always there if you needed help with things. My co-workers where great to work with.
good,I am self-motivated.  Management appreciates my work ethic.  Drive company vehicle and inter-act with commercial customers.
good,"Management train you very well, they just don""t throw you out there, they make sure you keep up with your training,and make you aware of new things."
good,"great company, no incentives for workers, not much advancement, hardest part of the job is learning the automotive parts"
good,"Learned alot while working here. Employees are friendly and easy to learn from. Not a hard job, but there is alot to know."
good,"The people are really great, super fun atmosphere. Not alot of hours to give, no room for advancement, no benefits, hourly pay not that great either."
good,"BUSY and Pay could be better, but all jobs are employees fulfilling other people's dreams. I enjoy some the customers, and I enjoy the people who work with me."
good,"the hardest part of this job would be when there's just so many customers coming in too and fro, you have to tend to everyone's needs like there little kids, it can get very intense at times because of peoples attitudes and situations."
good,"Typical day at work I assist customers with problems they experience with their vehicles."
good,"AutoZone as a company is very customer oriented, providing a helping experience. The coworkers are helpful, management is overall pretty good but can be hit or miss. Considering I have a great understanding of auto mechanics since before my employment there, I didn't learn much in that aspect. The only knowledge that I gained from my employment was just operating their computer systems and keeping ordinance with loss prevention. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer relations that I formed. Eventually, customers would call and ask for me specifically to help them, and if I was not there that day, they would wait if they could to receive my help. What I did not enjoy about the job was being the most parts knowledgable out of the whole store including the management."
good,"Autozone was a very average parts warehouse. There was little to no employment advancement. A typical day consisted of standing in front of the counter for hours without nowhere to sit down for a moment. Occasionally you would go out and front-face all of the products and tidy up the store. There would be the usual very rowdy crowd that would come in and cause a whole bunch of drama close to closing hours. Management was nowhere close to the greatest in the world. It was very poorly maintained in my opinion. My co-workers made the job very pleasurable, they always had a positive attitude and we all worked excellently together. The hardest part of the job would be truck day. Since I'm not extravagantly tall or strong, it made putting up inventory a little difficult sometimes. The most enjoyable part of that job was the customers. There was always customers that were so happy and did everything they could to make your job easier."
good,This is a great company to work for. I highly recommend it for any one that does and doesn't know about cars. The system is so easy that is fast to learn. easy job
good,Dealing with the retail public was fun. Retail hours demanding.
good,If you can match numbers then the job is easy. That all it is to it.
good,"I worked as the Inventory Specialist management position. Full-time. 40 Hours a week. I came in with absolutely no vehicle related experience whatsoever. With this job I learned a ton of useful information on cars. Which is great for working on my own vehicle. As the inventory manager I learned how to manage manage incoming products, outgoing products, new products, how to set up displays, shrink, overstock and loads more. It was very rewarding being able to manage the entire inventory of the store and put my growing organizational skills to use. The pay for being a manager however isn't a whole lot unless you are a GM. There is a small amount in advancement opportunity there, although it didn't come with much of a pay raise. The co-workers were great. There is some awesome teamwork if you manage to get put on a shift with the right people. In my specific store it wasn't uncommon to get surprise scheduled as a driver to transfer products from the store to another within 100 miles since the drivers tended to quit frequently. Perks included a small discount on most car parts and access to any information available for specific vehicle models."
good,Standard automotive retail. Limited support from Management District level and higher
good,"Great job, must be ready to lift up to 50 lbs, great management,"
good,"I learned a lot about cars. The company helped me become a better sales representatives. I learned what I needed to do to get the job done. My coworkers are fun to work with. We are literally a team. However, management could be better. The hardest part about this job was having a clear schedule. However, the location was pretty close."
good,As a beginner you start from the bottom and that means maybe 10 hours a WEEK.
good,provide security for the college cecking visitorsin and outh
good,If you are young and ready to give all you time to the co. it for you.
good,"As soon as I enter, always within thirty minutes before scheduled to clock in, I greet my fellow employees and management staff. Then proceed to clock in and head to the back of the HUB to start my assigned task of unloading and stocking every pallet of sent product. I continue to stock all the hard parts until none are left then move toward the front of the store to finish all front product. Before clocking out, every night, all 'redshirts' are required to clean-prep for the next morning. Along with 'front-facing' the entire store floor, taking out trash, cleaning bathrooms, mopping floors and cleaning outside parking lot/window areas for customers in the morning"
good,"i was hired as a red shirt ( DIY ) but was rapidly trained as a grey shirt ( psm parts sales manager )"
good,"AutoZone is an interesting place to work. The organization has strong roots and a strong concept of what a good corporate culture could be, however due to turnover and attrition; the culture does not stick. "
good,"The job was a great job, really enjoyed working there.But the corporate end of the job was in great need of values and organization."
good,"A typical day at  AutoZone was you open up the auto parts retail store or you closed it you did multi task form stocking to pulling orders unloading the shipment coming in use also cash register equipment.You were taught how to find auto parts for the private sector or commercial sector with training to help in small diagnostic to the public. By giving them great customer service over succeed their need to fix their vehicle.  AutoZone was a neat learning place to work at and meet new people. Management was supportive in training but not so in moving you up in promotion advancement."
good,"I learned all new things, from how to change windshield wipers to doing oil changes. Management was great, they kept us on our toes. Co-workers were friendly and loved the job, very helpful. I would say the hardest yet most enjoyable part of my job was identifying the problem in a vehicle by a sound."
good,"Management is laid back. Co-workers are either really good, or horrible. Customers are OK to deal with.. but very pushy. Absolutely no acceptable industrial safety guidelines. Store is a mess, hazards everywhere."
good,"pull parts, restock part and shelf, look up parts for customers in and on phone and check or pull parts"
good,Fast paced so your day went by quick. met very knowledgable people on the auto industry.
good,I was able to learn alot being on the commercial side of auto parts. I was in touch with the garages and I was able to learn how to handle accounts and how to talk to customers.
good,I enjoyed working with the people but unfortunatly the management was much to be desired.
good,"Management at the stores I worked in wasn't the best, but there were good employees to work with and overall was an enjoyable job."
good,"A typical day at work would be punch in, set garbage cans outside, set cash registers up, and sign in...Then I would pull overstock (stuff sold the day before). Co-workers are great, they are a great bunch of people. There isn't much of a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers, seeing new people and regulars coming in."
good,At work I learn alot about the automotive industry management is very helpful my coworkers enjoy their jobs and excel at them the hardest part of my job is also the most enjoyable part troubleshooting problems for customers.
good,lots of work when busy hard trying to get work when slow. The management didnt understand that you cannot force people to buy when they dont want to.
good,Not a very good company. On many occasions my paycheck was late. mangement was good. Co workers unhappy. But i did learn to speak spanish fluently at this workplace
good,Fun place to work if you know automotives. Friendly people. If your closing you have to make sure store looks good for opening next day
good,I believe the hardest part working with Auto Zone was trying to get thr right part for the car that had been put in an scrap piece that was not an manufactured.
good,Hardest part of the job is battery installations and truck day
good,I learned alot working there... I moved up in management very quickly. I was very proud of my work and my accomplishments. Unfortunately some coworkers didn't like that I moved up before they did.
good,"I love working there good place to work.. A great place to take your job to the next level... My dislike there ,,poor work sometimes with the boss.. Other than that  thing will be good there.."
good,This company was great to work for at the beginning when I first got hired in 1999 then it became about the almighty buck the more you made for the company be better off you were to be left alone
good,Autozone is very calm place to work at. there were days were it would get busy but overall we just had to make sure the customers had what they needed .
good,Car parts comes easy to me. I’d recommend someone who likes cars or wants to learn more of then. Also call the store after applying to speed the process.
good,You’ll get a chance to learn about cars and diagnose problems with little information. Help to know a little before working here to better help customs and make it easier on your self.
good,Overall decent experience. Management was very confusing while I was there and some troubled employees made shifts difficult at times. But I liked the job overall.
good,Great company to work for if you are well versed in automotive parts and repair. Friendly staff good management and flexible hours. Room for advancement and many locations to provide opportunities for those who seek to advance in the company.
good,Autozone was a good company to work for but the pay is not enough these days. To keep a household together Im looking for better pay to support my family.
good,The company is a very nice company to be employed for. I wish they paid more however they make sure you get hours... I met some great people while working there...
good,Good place to work.  Decent work/life balance. Staffing model is very small which can put a strain on the team.  Several locations so commute is typically less than 20 minutes.
good,"Great training programs- Regular store meetings"
good,I loved working here. The pay is good the people are nice. The only downside was the continuous heavy lifting. It puts a strain on your body if your not in the right kind of shape.
good,I find Auto zone to be well managed.   The employer cares if you get hurt.  I learn every day some thing new.  It is multi cultural company.  The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what  the customer wants.
good,Me parecio que si cumplí con los requisitos y los requerimientos del puesto
good,"They work well with your schedule. The benefits are good. They also help you during natural disasters. If your time permits, you can easily advance in the job."
good,Cool laid back everyone got along for the most part. It gets really busy around the holidays and sometimes management doesn’t get the schedule right but overall I loved the job
good,"Great company,  drive trucks long distance and commercial.  Places like Durham, Hillsboro, South Boston,  VA, South hill,  VA, Kinston,  Rocky Mount, Clayton,  Wake Forest, etc"
good,I had a good manager that was willing to help me to understand the programs and the etiquette required to keep the customers happy. They were willing to work with me when I had to pick up my kids. And if you ask for more hours and actually show you want to work... They don't mind helping you out.
good,I've worked for the company almost 5 years now and just want a change. The overall work flow is very relaxed and you are able to work by yourself on some projects.
good,The job was fairly simple and easy to handle and work with. Closing conditions were good and easy. Had very helpful coworkers and managment. Easy working schedule.
good,"I enjoy working at AutoZone, it is a productive and organized company, it also teaches a lot and has a lot of opportunities for learning and growth in the company."
good,The job along with the people is great! They are very safe and organized with what they do. The only thing that was bad was the uniform. Other than that it was a great experience!
good,I like working there I just need more hours. It's a good friendly environment to work at. Can be fast and slow paced at times but overall good. It will teach you things to learn and do
good,Go around the warehouse all day and pick orders/parts for other stores and break down pallets of new parts that come in off the truck and put them away .
good,Can be relaxing at time but can get stressful when it get busy. Is manageable still and easy to do work as long as you can handle it. Good place to work to get a knowledge of parts.
good,"My only problems ever had were with managers who'd forgotten what it was like being ""the little guy."" Late nights and often a careless attitude about the general worker from the higher ups was a negative for me."
good,"I recently worked at autozone and was a well renowned red shirt, mainly due to the fact I worked long hours and I was willing to work in any location at any time. I worked at about 15 of their ct locations and made plenty connections. Depending on the store or manager, it could go a number of ways."
good,Co workers were great they help each other like a family the work wasn’t hard and They give you a lot of hours if you need it they pay also isn’t bad it a good job overall
good,Typical day is handling calls from major dealerships. Answering and educating customers on car parts.  Storing or car parts into database. Driving orders
good,come to work stock inventory attend to customer and delivering part to customers sometimes good job but no good full time hour so they don't give you benefits.
good,"This is a great place to work. The co workers are kind and willing to help you learn what you need to be successful. Overall, hours and pay are similar to companies that are similar in services provided."
good,I had a bad experience and felt taken advantage of. Was not at all like my first experience with this company which was why I came back must have been my timing I guess
good,Work with you on your schedule. Has alot of training. Offer advancement in the job. It can be very passed. But also have slow down time. Managers are good at working with a new hire
good,the staff was ok but the work hours were not to be desired i learned much about automotive and the work place culture was ok  managment was fair but my most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the people
good,Great place to work. I love customer services and works with people. And i love to sell. Slow down time let's you clean the store and check inventory.
good,So far it has been a good company to work for. The salary needs to be adjusted to meet the standards of today. Training has been minimal. Scheduling should be based on the work load and hours of the day that are the busiest.
good,I liked the people and most of the work but the pay is just enough to cover 50% of my costs for living. Management varies from location to location but everyone is cordial and very polite.
good,Management and employees over at the hub stores are considerably overworked with a three man crew doing what only 8 should be doing. Also communication needs to improve. Other than that; the company is great in costumer satisfaction and training.
good,My experience will differ from the majority I’m sure. I worked with a boss that was on the verge of retirement and felt like he was just riding that wave this the mission was not seriously being achieved. Aside from that I had fun working there. Long hours at times but the feeling of helping and educating the customer was the reward there.
good,Wonderful staffing. Great opportunity for growth. Awesome workplace culture. Flexibility in problem solving solutions. Flexible in hours. Several classes are provided to grow within the industry
good,High turn over. District management over looks sketchy processes by top managers trying to hit goals. Diversity card played very hard making some conversations uncomfortable.
good,"Great place to work. Learned a lot about cars and solved many challenges regarding cars. Managed employees and schedules. The hardest part of the job was filling in when employees called out and being able to take care of the customers on busy days with a small staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you build a relationship with the customer's and in return, it makes them happy and it makes the job easier and more exciting."
good,I worked here for a little over 2yrs. I met a lot of great people. I also gained a lot of knowledge in the automotive industry. The only complaint I have was I did not get enough hours but that could have just been my location.
good,This position gives you the opportunity to meet new people. The work environment is face paced. You get to see all the beautiful scenery on the routes between stores.
good,Great place to learn customer service and patience. That place environment always people there asking questions or need any help face-to-face and on the phone
good,"I work at AutoZone, its a pretty cool place to work, good pay and benefits, i like the flexible hours also, its easy to move up to another position if if you work for it."
good,Benefits  Ones I used and Enjoyed was Schedule it worked with Me going to College and my other Part time. Coworkers was Great . And Discounts on Parts
good,"worked daily with customers and met their needs with products, assisted customers trouble shoot the needs for their cars.  learned the computer service. good atmosphere"
good,Es una excelente empresa que se preocupa por sus empleados los capacitan constantemente y les brinda la oportunidad de ocupar puestos de mayor responsabilidad lo cual genera compromiso y dedicación para formar carrera dentro de AutoZone
good,"Increased my knowledge on automotive and associated products. Learn customer care and ongoing bonds with customers. Very rewarding in helping out customers complete their challenge on their car, truck, motorcycle, ATV, RV, and/or boat."
good,they said that they care but is a productivity drive but the scale is unreachable. the management don't listen and they have no clue on how to care for the employees
good,"I learned a great deal about sales, customer service, and the automotive industry as a whole. I learn how to think from a customer stand point. And how to maximize business based on that."
good,The commercial sales manager position is great but if you aren’t a store that brings in over six thousand a week in sales they don’t really see you as a hard worker. Being in a more rural setting hurts the sales of this position because of limited accounts and limited resources for parts that customers do not want to wait for. I love the position because you build great friendships with great businesses and learn a lot when it comes to the automotive industry.
good,"Laid back work environment with room to learn if you're willing to multitask. If i had to choose the most difficult part of the job I would say is the physical portion of carrying multiple brake rotors and such, The company on the other hand is extremely diligent with the safety of both employees and customers so back braces and much more is provided at every store. I just recommend getting a tad bit in shape while and/or before working at Autozone."
good,This job was helpful for my times and it promoted me fast and gave me the keys and tips on how to be a great leader and How to properly manage my team members.
good,Autozone is great place to work at if you want to get a foot in the door when it comes to the automotive industry. You will learn a lot about parts and the vehicles. Typically you will assist customers in finding parts and products. Other responsibilities include stocking and some basic automotive repair as well as testing.
good,If you like vehicles this is a good place to work at. It is a decent job if you're a student as well. Hours can vary depending on how busy it is. Very fast paced enviroment.
good,"I was a part time sales manager there and at the time was making less than $9 a hour, while working part time at another company i made more money there starting from the bottom."
good,I learned a lot from working at AutoZone and seen a lot of cool cars and engines I learned a lot about how they work as well there were a lot of difference in opinions with chosen management
good,Not a bad place to work but pay should be better. The good thing is there is an opportinity to advance and the scheduling is flexible. There is also plenty of stores to transfer to.
good,Great job if you apply yourself. Opportunity for advancement if you have the drive to want help  people if you like Automobiles and Dealing with parts of automobiles this is the place for you
good,AutoZone has a major priority in safety for their drivers and warehouse personnel. They have great equipment and maintenance staff that gets the job done. Great pay and benefits too.
good,Varying schedule. Not much advance of what hours would be working. Annual raises were good. Coworkers were generally good to be around. Good training.
good,Auto zone was very lean with there employers just not enough help and not enough hours for someone trying to survive for the job title I had if only the staff was more bountiful
good,"Is a great company, but has some poor management and poor management decisions, not as much focus on commercial. wants to compete with oreilly's and advance auto parts in commercial sales but company wants to put commercial on front counter and not give space to focus on commercial customers in back like oreilly's and advance. wants commercial managers to manage DIY personnel also."
good,If you can handle dealing with the public it's not a bad job very relaxed environment. You learn more about cars and how they operate and is team oriented when it comes to having an issue with customers and there desired parts.
good,"The environment is fast-paced and the atmosphere is charged with the typical in and outs of retail. However, there is the excitement of those who come in with without the knowledge of what they need and leave with the assurance that they are getting exatcly what they will need to fix their problem."
good,My time at autozone was great. I learned a lot. This was my first job where I was giving a promotion to a manager. Being part of management gave me the chance to see how a store is ram first hand.
good,If you want to be trained on how to offer excellent customer service then autozone is a great choice. They promote within regularly and have a good sense of teamwork.
good,"Great company with a strong culture -Collaborative."
good,"Hours were good and the job was interesting. My store manager was cool. I enjoyed my shift. Stayed in shape lifting merchandise. Most days I helped with customers, and stocked shelf's. Occasional I helped brake down stock when we would get a load from the shipping dock. Rearrange shelving and merchandise, following a planogram."
good,"I loved being the parts driver for Autozone and interacting with the customers. When I wasn't doing that, I worked in the store helping customers installing batteries and such."
good,My direct manager was awesome. Very knowledgeable how ever the store manager and upper corporate management made day to day operations a little difficult.
good,The job was high and fast paced. There were constant moving to get the job done. There was limited staffing and so there were more expectations to get things done quickly.
good,Starting out is great getting to store manger and so on is another project that requires who you know not what which I find sad many managers quit when they figure this out or they stop training n cost for the rest of their career
good,Good job work with your schedule very easy to pickup on offer classes to help you get a better understanding of the parts and type of vehicles you will be dealing with.
good,I was mainly responsible for delivery of parts to customers in our local delivery area.  I loved this part of my job. I was able to create many lasting relationships with customers as well as meeting many new people.
good,"Performed managerial duties in the front of the house as well as the back of house. Cash management accountability, hiring, training, and customer service."
good,"Good place to enter the automotive business, lots of good people, high turnover in staff. Foot in the door on the commercial side, easy to move into management"
good,"Iliked working at autozone because the work is what I mostly know and enjoyed as far as experience and helping people and trying to solve their problems. I mean I don't know anybody that don't get a satisfaction helping another human being to its very rewarding as well as challenging. The only thing is that one has to be patient as far as raises but the opportunity is there for management positions. Also is very demanding lots of paperwork, managing employees, shedules and etc."
good,"As a parts sales manager, we ran the shifts. Counted the safe and the tills, assigned ""zoners"" the tasks to complete during their shifts. and verified once completed."
good,"Very fast paced job with phones and customers"
good,"I enjoy working there because of the flexible hours. Good people to work with, I like the job because it is easy going. It’s not labor intensive and im warm in the winter"
good,this was an ok company but in my opinion they put more time into making sure thre sales rep did certain things rather then the customer was happy but over all ok job
good,The location I work at did a good job of hiring the right people. there is a real genuine sense of community. Most customers are regulars so it's easy to build a rapport with the community.
good,"I did enjoy my time with Autozone. I was on track to become management, but life issues forced me to leave.The biggest issue I had, was some of the parts listed, were wrong. I am glad I had knowledge to find the proper parts."
good,I learned so much about automotive industry. I made great friends within the company and with regular customers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who thought I was ignorant because I am a woman. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping those who needed and appreciated it.
good,I wish I would have stayed there because it was a good job. I drove every day for a few months and never wrecked a vehicle. I learned basic car maintenance.
good,"For full time you have to knowthe right people for advancement, they would rather hire from outside than promote from within. Part time is great, flexible hours and still opt for health benefits."
good,"Compensation for work doesn't match what they demand of you. Decent work environment. Tedious work, not physically demanding. You will learn lots about cars."
good,"The schedule rotated. You were at the mercy of the store management when it came to scheduling. You may close one day and open the next, and that could happen several times in a schedule. Scheduling needs to be done by someone that is not at the store to prevent clicks from giving their friends whatever schedule they want while dragging everyone else through the coals."
good,"Working at AutoZone is great for a student because they will easily work with you around your schedule and the number of work hours that you want. Also, the manager is usually great to work with."
good,Auto Zone is a fun place to work. It does however take a strong willed person to be able to identify and correctly explain the malfunction to a customer.
good,Autoz Zone is a good place to gain new skill and learn teamwork. However it is not a place to build your career if you have A College degree. That is an important factor while being in Autozone
good,If you need a job and you know sales. This is the place for you. They are always hiring and eager to train. Knowing cars and speaking a secondary language (especially spanish) is not required but definitely adds to your quick selection for hire.
good,Some hours of week could be considered rush hours with high customer volume. Meeting sales or promotional sales was difficult. When to do so called front facing as to on floor stocking was had to know when to atend.
good,"The first four years were amazing and I really loved working here. Around the 4-year mark, I was passed up for promotion in favor of someone with less time and experience in the company and specific job. I still ended up doing management level work without the pay or the promotion."
good,Great place to work for they always put customers first. Great company to build a future. People are always willing  to help and provide great customer service.
good,Customer service was the most important thing to have there. Days could be over whelming with customers. Was a good work place also had great team members.
good,"My typical day involves driving parts to different location through out my shift"
good,"Autozone a big company"
good,Great organization. Industry leader. Thrives on innovation. Approachable leadership.  Motivating. Rewards talents. Promotes from within. Culture is relaxed.
good,"The job is cool but they only start people off at 24 hour weeks, which is nothing. Hours to improve over months of working and other people leaving.  .."
good,AutoZone is a good place to work for they work around your schedule for the most part and most of the people are great to get along with on a daily basis
good,"I enjoy working with the people there. It is hard to shedule Doctors appint ments, etc. working there. Just don't have a set schedule from week to week."
good,working for autozone was a great experience. it was very depending and high paced. it taught me how to multitask and believe in yourself. if you can work here you can work anywhere
good,Place which asks for some experience with mechanical but is not required. Work space will teach you majority knowledge which will be needed. Great place to learn.
good,Everthing was cool until the moment I was promoted. From there on all joy for work disappeared. Fellow employee began to resent me and no longer felt welcome.
good,You can really learn a lot from here. There is a lot of training that is required. The customers provide you with a great environment to learn. Everyday I go to work I learn something new.
good,"A typical truck night at autozone consists of me and two other autozone employee's.We typically receive between nine and fourteen skids.  Separating the items on the skid into specific totes, so that time can be properly managed. Also, crossing the employee I am in charge of, so that they are capable of not only doing their jobs but also mine. On the days that truck doesn't come, I typically work the front register ""DIY"". Learning more customer service skills, and gaining more product knowledge."
good,"fun people and always something new, wither its a new problem to solve or a part to find for a customer. but at the end of the day you always learn something new about a car you didnt know before."
good,"The managers are very kind and work with my schedule, the regional managers had no idea who i was, and only spoke with read shirts when something was wrong."
good,Not a bad company to work for. Product and car knowledge are important since you will be expected to work on cars in the parking lot and run check engine diagnostics.
good,"A typical day would be cleaning store, stocking shelves and checking out customers. Most managers were very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was finding the parts customers wanted. The most enjoyable part was helping customers with their purchases and needs."
good,There is a lot to do to maintain a store to Standards.  You need to be physically able to do the job as well as be able to delegate responsibility to other in your store.  Training is essential to help your employees move to the next step in their careers.
good,"Your selling and delivering automotive parts. Put away a delivery on truck day, handle a cash register and customer service. You clean the store and face shelves."
good,The only downside was not being able to separate my work and home life. I would get phone calls all hours of the night and Autozone would not pay for a company cell phone. I feel that I was underpaid for my experience and the dedication I provided.
good,Pretty easy getting used to the computer system. The employees always help you if you need help identifying a part or help guide you around the store. I did get tired of having to close one night at 10 and open the store at 7 the next day but other than that I don’t really have any complaints. Only reason I’m leaving is because I’m looking for a career and autozone seems more like a stepping stone for college kids on their way to bigger better things.
good,Easy repetitive jobs of various ranges. Management is easy to talk to about any issues. This job does require flexibility and being able to adapt to different jobs on any given day.
good,I learned a lot of things about cars year make and model different types of oil different type of transmission you are not in this job everything about mechanical working Electric
good,All in all not a bad place to work. Fast paced and short handed.Getting days off is tough sometimes and often getting calls to come in when you do. The pay is not too bad but could be better.
good,"Great place to work. If ur a student and live at home. AutoZone doesn't pay well. Short hours. No overtime."
good,Everyday is a new oppertunity to discover new things a new people and get them the help they need no matter what it may be as long as you have the right vehicle we have the right part
good,I liked the job overall. Management could've been better. They encourage speedy deliveries even with heavy traffic areas which could lead to speeding tickets.
good,I left autozone because ultimately it was a part time job and I couldn’t get enough hours to survive on. I would recommend working there to someone who is looking for a job to get them through some tough times.
good,Really did not enjoy this job but I am grateful for the opportunity I had to expand my knowledge of supervision skills. They have no flexible hours and did not want to pay me for my maternity leave or did not tell me anything about sick leave if you did not come to work they would still point you instead of using that day as a sick day.
good,"This was my first job, was in college when hired. Being in a college town, the store I was at had a high turnover rate. "
good,"The customers are ""in my opinion"" are the best part of my time working at Autozone. they are very loyal.  I loved to be able to help them and make their day just a little bit better with great customer service,"
good,In and out of the store as i was a driver. fast paced and some times very stressful. loved my store manger is was the bees knees. learned a few cool tricks while i was there. i liked shooting the breeze with are accounts.
good,my store manager is amazing to work for and it makes the job very pleasurable. i would highly recommend it for some one who doesn't need a high income job as they do not pay well though.
good,Minimum opportunities for advancement in a few departments when I worked there. The compensation wasn't high or competitive. The job culture was pretty decent.
good,"todas las tiendas cuentan con muy poco personal si aprendes mucho pero el trabajo es repetitivo, la direccion es buena tienen muy buena cultura y la  parte mas facil tratar a clientes"
good,"Overall good experience.  Couldn't live off the pay full time, but was decent for part time work.  Not physically demanding work but attention to detail helps."
good,Fast paced environment. You see all sorts or cars and learn about all different kinds of parts. Easy to move up. Helpful for learning what different parts do.
good,"Very fast paced, everything is pretty easy to catch onto as you do it over time. Must practice your job outisde of work too fully be able to help customers to the best of your ability."
good,"Corporation wants employees to be available 24/7 as they many need them.  Early morning or late night store meeting for essentially nothing."
good,Lots of knowledgeable people that will help you learn in the automotive field. Lots of people that will train you for your next position. Some opportunities for transferring also
good,Only worked there for two months and it was decent. I enjoyed working in retail sales quite a bit. I liked the fast paced environment and helping customers
good,AutoZone in general has a good work place the only bad thing is you never receive any benefits until after full time that is if you get full time. The store I am at is fine but could be way better.
good,"a typical day consist of assisting customer on finding the right part at the right price, becoming almost an expert at car if you're not already an expert"
good,slow paced environment for the most part. easy going and relaxed management. coworkers are easy to get along with. good place to work if starting in the automotive field
good,The only things I would probably change at this place of employment is the pay rate . Also the rate of benefits you get and could take advantage of . They give 20 percent discount to employees and 10 percent to military vets . I also like the full hour lunch .
good,They are willing to work with you but are expected to take charge of your own development. Make sure you are a hard worker. An interesting culture. Dont move to memphis.
good,talking with customers about their parts of their vehicle depending on what year/make/model.. Making the customer feel like we've done our job to meet their needs..usage of the cash register..checking customer batteries and testing check engine light matters.. just all in all making sure every customer is happy and satisfied
good,"AZ was a good place to work.  The benefits were limited, but the company offered stock incentives to keep key people.   I left this job because I was growing a family and wanted to spend time with them.  Working hours can be long and sometimes includes weekends."
good,Work is not overall difficult. But being very automotive savvy would be a great help. The store changes part locations quite often. Also there are numerous times when there are more workers than needed.
good,"Pretty good job for a college student. The job really depends on management. If you managers suck, your time there is going to suck. If they are cool then you will enjoy your time there"
good,"The company has decent benefits, poor management, and secure work if you're full-time. It's great if you don't mind the low wages, its very easy work despite putting up with ignorant and irate customers every single day."
good,Very Fun to work there. The customers are very nice. The town is perfect size keeps the store very busy during the weekends. Another thing that I really liked was that the managers would buy the rest of the employee's lunch when sales were good. So this would motivate us to keep selling everything.
good,If you are willing to ask questions and listen you can learn a lot from people that work there that know what they are talking about when it comes to car repair and parts.
good,Have to multi task. Very fast pace especially when it gets busy. On top of helping customers you had to stock shelves when the truck was there. Dealing with mad customers was hard also.
good,Le métier de mécanicien automobile est exigent tans physiquement que mentalement. Il faut démontrer une bonne gestion du temps et pouvoir résoudre rapidement les problèmes. On dois toujours s'assurer que le client reparte satisfais du travail pour lequel il a payer.
good,its a good job for a beginner wouldn't recommend as a forever job unless you are a store manager friendly people not enough hours for someone looking for a part-time/full-time
good,"Working there wasnt the worst thing in the world.  Typically you would come in, clock in and start front-facing all the items in the shop and service customers after."
good,"At AutoZone when the store is slow and customers are not waiting to be helped, everyone should still be doing some work, which ranges anywhere from putting up merchandise, cleaning off the parts counters, front facing merchandise in the store, etc."
good,I enjoyed helping the customers. It was a learning experience for me too. I learned to change a car battery and all the different functions of a car.  I was able to move up the ladder quite quickly.
good,Working here you should exercise caution. One mistake will cut your throat here. They will fire you for it but let the laziest employee get away with doing nothing. Doing nothing is better than messing up. The management team are all close minded and don't really care about their employees. They will work you to death if they can and it gets you nowhere.
good,I worked there while in scool. it was an easy job with flexible hours. Managers were great and treated you well. i learned a lot about auto parts just working here
good,"I was fun, I worked on cars with my father as I was growing up and I got to add more to what I had already knew. It was great watching the customers smile when they seen a female working there and knew about vehicles."
good,Decent benefits. Pay rate is what you would expect from a retail job but if you're not a store manager don't expect to make a living. Sometimes a fast paced environment.
good,Auto Zone was a customer driven company with sales and goals as the key goal of the company. Auto Zone is a growing company but the hours and pay were
good,My job was a little stressful because I had like eight managers telling me what to do. And they all were telling me different things about the same location that I was going to. The store manager was great the assistant manager was great.
good,"Really felt comfortable and enjoyed working with all the employees. My day consisted of customer service, cashiering, inventory and stocking. Learned a lot about auto parts/care."
good,"could really learn a lot of info about and parts and sales, the people are good, the work environment is great and the pay is good as long as you work hard and learn the system well."
good,my review about this place is they are very good about teaching you the basic stuff you need to know about cars when working at an auto parts store. they do give you recognition for the good job that you do .
good,"job is cool, pay could be better, i feel that they need to focus on training there incoming employees more because they seem to lack in knowledge. Overall the company is ok to work for i enjoyed my experience"
good,"Enjoyed getting experience here as a manager and loved the appreciation my Store manager gave me, but would prefer more hands-on experience and more hours."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company as long as the right people was above me in the chain of command. I also learned that some of the managers didn't care about you and only focused on themselves, and when you learn about the culture of Autozone that is not what the company is based on. It is supposed to be a team effort always. There is no such thing as a small role."
good,Very great organization to work for. Provides great customer service to customers. Management is very thorough to employees.  It is a great organization and a pleasure to drive for them.
good,Open the store and get everything ready for the employee who will be delivering part to other Autozone.  The workplace culture was great good people and great place.
good,Open and close procedures.  Training new hires.  Inventory stocking and cycle count.  Customer service and evaluating customer needs.  Loss prevention and custodial upkeep of store.  Planogram implementation.
good,Autozone overall is a great job but sometimes the customer never knows the name of the part or Make of year / make / model / correctly here in Ky only it's parked outside go look (I don't know).
good,this job was great getting to know your regular customers and their needs to help them find the right products that they are looking for to get the job done right the first time.
good,"I loved working for AutoZone. Management was easy to work with and willing to accommodate days needed off within reason. Only downside was the pay, but store manager did everything he could to pay employees highly."
good,"If you rub the right elbows, you move upward and onward.  If you don't you stay in your position.  Policy is everything and will be the deciding factor on you getting fired or promoted."
good,"It is based on what your committing is. The community makes it or breaks it for each store. They are ALL different. They do not pay you more however for being ASE certified, But insist on that idea."
good,Autozone is a great place to start a career in sales. There are opportunities for advancement and they are a company that definitely prefers to promote within.
good,"nice company to work for they pay well and treats their employees well. down side limited shift times for non key holders, also limited promotion options."
good,Auto zone is a great place to work. It is typically filled with knowledgeable staff with your automotive needs. It is a good place to find whatever you need and if you can't find it then the staff could help you locate it or order it.
good,This is a great job for starting in the job field. You have to clean the store and make sure all the merchandise is faced and organized. The management is okay.
good,very competitive but fun when it came to coc's. i learned about cars working here. Management team was good. One of the hardest part of the job was trying to calm down anger customers but co workers made more enjoyable.
good,Management isn't bad. You have some good managers and some bad managers like any place. I got along well with my store manager personally but there are times when you look at some of the store managers and can see why the company is going down under. It's interesting to see so many store managers that have zero knowledge on what it takes to manage people and keep employees vested in salesmanship.
good,I unfortunately did not spend a long period of time working here as my own business started to develop and grow so I need to devote my time to my business.
good,Was a good starter Job. Worked there why I was in college and learned about retail and commercial sales. Got my first taste of management and it provided a great place to learn how to deal with people.
good,"get there and clock in "
good,Attend to the customer need to find the correct part Cashier Install Automotive Battery and Automotive Head lights. this establishment will help people in the field of automotive
good,Good company to work for to get your foot in the door. Understand car parts and perform battery installations frequently. Also most managers are understanding of family and schooling situations.
good,I learn more about cars which it help me a lot to get to know my own car. I got to learn the difference in a lot of things regarding cars that is very helpful now.
good,Typical days are busy on occasion but also get slow days. Sometimes there are times where things make no sense. But overall management is respected and respectful as long as you are.
good,i clock in i check with management on days to do list. start organizing the jobs that need to be accomplished that day all the while stopping to provide excellent costumer service.
good,"Pretty Good Job Excluding The Pay But Is Manageable According To Work Shedule, Lunch, And Work Environment. Makes You Become More Social With People You Do Not Know."
good,great atmosphere to work in friendly clients and coworkers. diligent work and professional. it is a balanced pace of work. negative to my role is being a seasonal employee
good,"The company is very flexible with work schedules, but the overall work is tedious. Also the general customer is less than desirable to work with. My current manager is fantastic."
good,es una buena empresa ya que tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo
good,I loved working for AutoZone.  I am a car fanatic and love the smell of anything auto.  The work was tedious at times and all day on my feet.  The rate of pay was fair but the lack of benefits was not.
good,"Me agrado llevar el control de productos en piso y almacén, ordenar, y atender a los clientes por medio del sistema de la empresa."
good,"I learned a lot about cars while working at Auto Zone. Enjoyed working and helping our customers find and get their parts needed. Co-Workers were pretty easy to get along with, and helpful."
good,Auto Zone was a great place to work and if they would have had a full time position open i would have stay with them! I enjoyed the people i worked and the Job i was doing
good,Was somewhere I would have worked longer but management hired too many individuals and affected the hours of the set employees already within the store.
good,"Helped customers with installing batteries,lights. Wipers,etc.,"
good,"Not bad, had its enjoyable moments. Sold parts, answered phones, helped customers, most of which were not very polite. Probably because they needed parts to fix their car. A bigger employee discount on parts would've been nice. Enjoyed being a driver."
good,I worked there for a short period of time due to me wanting to finish school and work was getting in the way of that for me. No I did not hate the job nor did I like the job.
good,"like any job it had its good and bad days. most days were the same you helped customers look up the parts they need and pulled them. every now and then you were have to install a battery, or light bulb, or wiper. over all this was a busy but laid back job."
good,"parts are not the best, cheap china tools can hardly last changing a battery. i would recommend working here to a friend. but i would never work here again."
good,"Overall what ruined this job for me wasn't the company or the job itself but the management. I actually really liked the job itself, but the people they choose for management are typically not management quality."
good,"I love AutoZone, truly. This company has given me countless opportunities to progress to my current position, but now as I' get to my 2 year anniversary in my current role, I've been stuck here. I need to make more money as rent increases and as my wife finally moves in."
good,"A typical day at work would be me helping customers, and more. I learned the in's and out's of auto-mechanics. Management was the best at auto-zone from my experience. To be honest there were no hard parts to this job. The most enjoyable part of this job was the nice people i worked with."
good,Auto zone is a nice place to work. friendly people and very understanding when it comes to learning new things. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping people.
good,"The job was overall great. I didn't dread going in everyday and the hours were good, especially as a high school student working part time at the time. I didn't know anything about auto parts, but skills and information was easily picked up along the way."
good,"very friendly people, great service, great with scheduling, the hardest part of the job was answering the commercial line for phone calls. the most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere."
good,"The hardest part of the job is being a female in a male dominate field. Generally the type of customers we receive is male and on some occasions I interact with individuals who do not wish to have a woman help them. I do not try to understand the logic behind it, but simply insist on letting me try to assist them with their needs. The customer and myself usually move past the initial turmoil that they had and they leave happy with their parts and all is great. In the very rare occasions that they insist on a male to help them, some form of management usually comes next to me and has me proceed as I would with any customer. Management usually informs the customer that they will stand there in case of questions but reassures the customer that I know what I am doing when it comes to getting them their items."

good,The job was pretty easy most of the times but when weather was bad we still were out on open highway. The management paid attention to the point system for certain employees and were sometimes unfair with scheduling. I feel we could have been paid more.

good,"AutoZone has a unique culture and succeeds in the inner city to proved great service and advice and unique learning experiences in the workplace to allow workers to take great experiences and use them in everyday life like using advice to show people how to problem solve and how to communicate problems and solutions to clients.

I loved giving advice, it allowed me to feel great about what I had done as a service to others."
good,I worked at many different stores and areas of each store over the course of my time. It can be made into a carrier but typically kind of rare to happen. Pay isn't the best but the job isn't too hard.

good,Learned quite a bit working here. Was a commercial driver delivering parts to mechanic shops. Hardest part of a work day was Thursdays because it was restock day which meant there was a lot to do inside the store.
good,If you work hard there is room to grow in this job.  You have to push certain high profit items to make upper management obtain their bonuses.
good,"A typical day at AutoZone consisted mainly of helping customers that walked in or called diagnose their automotive issues. After I was promoted to manager, I got more responsibilities, such as arming and disarming the alarm system, doing daily paperwork, and managing 1-5 employees."
good,"Skills learned from this position:"
good,"management was a little scattered, it was hard to get everything done when you were always moved to other locations because other people couldn't keep up with the work. Some people talked all the time instead of doing the job that they were supposed to be doing. you couldn't reach production if you followed the safety protocols."

good,"At work i was a commercial driver, parts picker, and a commercial sales man which consists of me either driving taking parts to shops getting signatures and money as well as picking up returns if the customer has any."
good,"Compensation and benefits are great, however due to the uniqueness of my position there is no room for growth professionally beyond my current position. Solid overall management with lots of mentors and team spirit."

Management was good, they were very knowledgeable about their store and were willing to help you out if you had any questions, the only con to management was every now and then they showed favoritism to certain employees.  the hardest part of the job was lifting and stocking certain heavy parts, and sometimes working an 11 hour day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people to better understand their vehicles and what they might as far as parts, and my team members."

The most rewarding part of this job is to provide excellent customer service for those in need and to provide knowledge and experiences that would greatly impact a customers budget in a positive outcome.

good,"A typical day at Autozone will keep you on your feet. You learn quickly how to multi-task between answering phones, while satisfying walk in customers. My main position is a commercial driver which means I deliver car parts to the shops. I enjoy meeting new people and experiencing all the shops. I find it an experience to go behind the scenes of some of these shops that only employees get to access."
good,"A normal day at AutoZone is pretty calm. A study paste of customers, something to do when the work place would be slow. On busy days we would have our store packed with customers and our commercial phones would be constaly ringing. The crew that i had worked with was awesome we all got along and work together as a team and if we had any conflicts we got together to talk about it. But the district manager and the regoinal manager seemed unfair and to favor certain stores in out district and to favor certain mangers. some of us would get introuble for the smallest of things while others could show up late or call in and just get a slap on the wrist."
good,The employees are great to work with. They are willing to teach any and everything they know. It a place to start if you want to learn about cars.
good,A typical day was enjoyable and went by fairly fast the store manager was very understanding and gave every accomidation but the assistant manager was hard to get along with.
good,AutoZone is a great company to work for and has really good benefits. The only problem as with any retail company is that you never have a set schedule.
good,the customers that I had to deal with were awesome and the majority of the employees were cool however near the end of my employment it was getting really tough to work there
good,"Starting working when it was Chief Auto Parts, when Autozone Auto Parts bought them out, we (local store employees) helped to set the store up, from placing all the shelving,  to all computer and telephone lines.  , up and to the day of our first deliveries for stocking our store.  It was great .  I enjoyed working with my fellow associates."
good,"My co- workers were the best part of working at autozone. We were always on the same page when it came to helping customers and getting our jobs done proficiently. The job was fast paced and there was always something to do, so it made the time go by really quickly."
good,Great company to work for if you have great management. I loved my job prior to us getting a new district manager. Everyone had fun while getting the job done. Great benefits for full timers but not so much for part timers. Not a difficult job.
good,"The environment was great, the co-workers were great, but it just wasn't right for me. The pulling of parts requires constant strength. The hours were overnight and that was hard but doable."
good,"I was able to learn and grow with a growing company. My manager and I built the commercial program into a booming entity of our store. I took phone orders, retrieved parts, billed them, and delivered. I also was often in charge of rearranging merchandise on the sales floor."

good,Keeping everything in the store clean and organized. I learned how to deal with everyday challenges at work. My coworkers taught me a lot of working with everyone different attitudes. My hardest part of my job was trying not to take sides. Learning different things at my job.
good,"I liked working here, liked the people I worked with and most of all I like helping customer with there automotive problems."
good,"I love every day that I work, the management training program is excellent and has taught me a lot. The work environment is friendly and healthy"
good,I like how there is always challenges between employees to help customers get what they need. A wonderful company to work for. Offers al required training needed.
good,"Working with customers was great, and what I learned was above great because it involved more than automobiles. The people I worked with was superb and very nice mostly. Having more employees to work with would have been nice since at times it was pressed by having more than 10 customers and the phone ringing on 2 or more lines and only 2 employees working at a time. I had the time of a life meeting people and listening and learning from them about many different things and for the most part I enjoyed helping them."
good,The work day was active and eventful. I learned alot about parts customers and computer systems. Management was some what fixed.Co-workers were great. Hardest part of job was keeping sales up with limited crew and trucks.The most enjoyable part was helping people.
good,"With this company I worked with the customers to find out what part they needed for their vehicle. I also answered the phone, helped customers install wipers and test batteries."
good,I liked driving and it was nice to go at your own pace. The company is good to it's employees. I wish it paid more and I would have stayed with them.
good,I spent a great amount of time working for auto zone in the store I was assigned to and many other locations when they needed me. I was bilingual and a quick learner but they never fulfilled their promises on moving up within the company even if I knew how to do most of the work the for the position. the reason I give it a four is because I learned so much about cars and helping folks with their problems was rewarding. The employees were helpful and some always willing to teach and help someone.
good,"Time management is essential hen working for Auto Zone. I learned to spend my time productively by getting as much done in the time allotted. Management could have been better if those in position understood the labor /maintenance aspect of the job, rather than just the management aspect . Meeting new people was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Delivered auto parts along a specific route all thru northwest ohio, southeast michigan, and indiana. Also, worked at the parts counter as customer service rep."
good,"I enjoy working for Auto Zone, my co workers are very cool. Everyone is helpful and willing to assist. The job overall is particular at times but nothing that can not be done. My managers are understanding, always available, and willing to help."
good,Customer service is key to this type of business.  The hours can be erratic and hamper productivity. The turn over of employees on the part time level hampers the effectiveness of the store.
good,I was pleased when I decided to go back to school that the company worked with me to schedule around the classes I was taking. It really worked out for me.
good,pay not that well but you can move up in this business and learn about parts on cars and how to fix about any problem with a car.. well meet great peolpe and get paid every two weeks
good,"I learned more about vehicles and broadened my knowledge on how to help people with problems that occurred. Many managers willing to teach new things, few that got impatient."
good,Worked with the public every day. I had to concentrate on each payment the clients made to make sure they give me the correct money and that I give them the correct money back. I worked with difficult and very friendly customers.
good,"Worked very well with staff, lots of change which is ok but not for the customers supporting your business. Outbound calls to build customer relations, going the extra mile to find unavailable parts."
good,Very acomodating place to work. Plenty of room for growth. There is always something to do. Great place if you enjoy working with people.
good,A great place to work if you are into cars and want to help other people with their cars. You get to know regular customers and those are the best to talk to.
good,"Learned a whole lot about cars, but the co-workers were a bit difficult to deal with. Customers were decent, never had issues."
good,"Fast Paced, ""Counter Person"" duties involving counting cash, assisting clients choose parts for their ""daily drivers"" or ""project automobiles; not limited but including, paying attention to details to cleanliness of store, keeping staff motivated and enthused about completing their tasks assigned, and Operating a near, two and a half million dollar operation in just my location.  I learned that if I help enough people get what they want, I'll eventually get what I want.  I managed 5 to 7 managers reporting to me daily, involving cleanliness, customer service, coaching, cash handling, Loss prevention, OSHA, Directives from Corporate and Regional, computer training, on-boarding new staff members, and product knowledge.  People are what make this a great Company to work for because they all want attention as much as their automobiles.  The hardest part of my job was traveling 2 hours to get to work and another 2 hours to return home.  The most enjoyable part of my job was witnessing the satisfaction from clients that were served by me or my staff."
good,a good place to work the work days were kinda of bad only work 4 days out of the week and sometimes its was for only 4 hours. but i like driving and seeing different citys. the people at the job were very friendly a family type of enviroment. the boss was very helpful always work with are schedule if we needed a day off

But I do and have done my best to always make sure all customers are happy and leave with everything they need."
good,"Team players, everybody does everything.The company itself is not to blame for the management that was in charge when I worked there, I'm sure they thought they were hiring the right people to do the job."

I guess the hardest part of the job is figuring out the customers part(s) when they don't even know what it is or does. the co workers are great to work with that is the best part of the job. if you ever want to make it past a red shirt you have to push for sales daily.   "
good,"I didnt like working in a dry warehouse, it was too hot in the summer."
good,"working in the automotive retail part was very entertaining you rely on a small group to get the job done day to day. stocking, cashier, using computers. but the best part is interacting with customers face to face."
good,Part time job and it was alright. Just wish I had more hours. Management was really nice.
good,It was a great job. I got to work outside and actually have the sense of completing a different project everyday.
good,"Being at Auto Zone for 4 years I have been able to grow and become skillful. I am now part of management, I have become responsible and mature. I've developed great customer service, learned to maintain Inventory assets effectively and now with all the knowledge and skills I want to expand. "
good,"a typical day would is going through reports and previous day sales and setting goals, telemarketing to accounts to drive sales on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the relationships. as far as the company it has good benefits. "
good,"I usually just drive to auto body shops or other Auto zone's all day but in between deliveries I work with customer service. i learned how to work with customers and co-workers in a productive manor, how to better manage my time, and  how to handle products and and employee property with care. the hardest part of the job is customer service as I am still on the learning curve with some of the products and have no prior knowledge  of the products, secondly it is sometimes difficult to navigate around traffic on my more lengthy deliveries during rush hour. the most enjoyable parts of my job include being able to help customers with there purchasing needs."
good,Get alot of interesting people with alot of interesting issues on their cars. Makes you feel good when you can help them correctly. Makes you feel bad when you sell them extra stuff not necessarily required because your boss tells you that its a requirement to keep your job. 
good,"an average day at autozone included sales of products and warranties on auto parts, retrieving data trouble codes on customer's vehicles and replacing windshield wipers, batteries and light bulbs."
good,"I enjoyed working at Autozone.It taught me alot about your basic parts,and how to diagnose problems related to your vehicle."
good,"Some DM's are good, but if you get a bad one- not a great place to be.  System is set up for you to push items on customers they dont always need."
good,"inperson and phone customer service, hands on work with automotive parts n vehicles,cash handeling and register use, managed retail..commercal..stocking/inventory..hub transporting..shipping...   "
good,You never know your work hours till the end of the work week for the next work week.  Have to work Holidays and weekends all the time.
good,I became very knowledgeable about auto parts and keeping inventory of the sales floor. Autozone had a great management team and I highly enjoyed my experience there.  
good,"a typical day for me is pulling parts ordered to supply local sister stores, when not busy say like on truck days, I assist in helping stock shelves and assist customers with finding parts and answering questions."
good,"I would clock in to work and go to my commercial area, get my company vehicle keys and get my first task order and get in the vehicle and take my order. That's basically what I did all day. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. There was so many personalities in the workplace and it was fun and great. Sometimes the hardest part of the job would be obnoxious customers coming in just being very mean for no reason but you just learned how to smile through it anyway. The fun part of the job would be pleasant customers."
good,"Everyone has a great since of humor and we all get along really well.  My job is busy most of the time, our commerical customers are great to work for.  The hardest part of my job is not understanding some of the parts that go with certain vehicles.  Thats where one on one mechanics would come in handy.  My day starts out making sure there are no deliveries, I am the first driver so show up.  When the next driver comes in I stay at the store more helping with customer calls. I only take runs the rest of the day if there are to many orders to deliver that the other drivers can't keep up with. My job is commerical sales and customer service. I enjoy it all."
good,Autozone DC of Lavonia is a nicely run distribution center. The managers are very involved in what they do and support us to the best of their ability. There's always something to do so you almost always stay busy. Hours can stretch on but are definitely worth it. They have a friendly work environment and the staff stress that we all be as safe as possible.
good,"Great place to work, clean and friendly environment, great employees"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of answering phones and helping people everyday. Also, making manager decisions in regards to returns and consumer complaints. Management is always a step ahead and always promotes quarterly tests and safety. The co-workers are very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of this job is remembering all the functions. Being a part-time sales manager is very difficult because it's only part time and not full time. The most enjoyable part of the job is closing."
good,"Well managed warehouse job. Manual labor mixed with driving warehouse equipment. A team environment, friendly and helpful co workers. The hardest part of the job is the temperature, very cold in winter and very hot in summer."
good,Help walk in customers as well as work the cash register.Answer incoming calls test car batteries.My main job was being there commercial driver picking up and delivering parts to either other store or our customers shops.
good,provide quality customer service while assisting with common automotive failure diagnositics.
good,Flexible hours and only a basic understanding of automotive repairs needed. Need ability to deal with fairly low brow customers depending on area.

good,"This is one of the exciting jobs i have had so far,i enjoyed interacting with the customers on a daily basis.When i first started i was a bit worried becasue this was a new gield foe me especially since i am a woman.I didnt know anything about cars at all, but i was trained for two days and i felt as if i had been working their for years.My overall experience their was awsome."
good,"Great advancement opportunities. Truly enjoyed all the things I learned about cars, and about managing a company"
good,Grabing parts or customers and helping with automotive issues. Management was good. Co-works were good for the most part. Hardest part was dealing with difficult customers. Working with cars was the most enjoyable part.
good,"In a typical work day I deliver parts to commercial customers and interact with commercial customers on the phone to take their orders. I have learned the managerial part of commerial parts sales. I work with a great staff, who are knowedlegeable, professional and pleasant. Sometimes I have to deal with the general public, which can be challenging at times. The most enjoyable part is seeing the joy of a satisfied customer."
good,"As a key holder I open and close the store, help customers via phone, access warranties, process returns and exchanges, help with planograms, recalls, and price changes, also lead and impliment overall store cleaniness and presentation"
good,My day might start at 9 in morning and end at midnight. The upper management was not supportive of the lower management.
good,Answered customer’s inquiries and resolved complaints.
good,"My day at AutoZone consists of many customers asking for car parts and asking questions about parts and motor oil. I've learned cash register transactions, returns, stocking, overstocking, charging batteries, and looking up store parts for the customers"
good,"early mornigs, price changes, ads changes, flexogram store set ups,"
good,"I learned how to close out registers count down a safe, close out a store and receive orders for shipping. I love working on a team there's nothing like being a part of something that's always progressing and growing. Nothing was hard about this job. I enjoyed every moment of it."

good,It's a fun place to work at and everyone gets along with each other.
good,A great way to start a job career. It gives flexibility to work and continue an education.
good,good place to work interesting people
good,"Handling both the knowledgeable advice and customer service to ensure sales is primary goal. Other duties include inventory maintenance, cash and account reconciliations. Both A/P and A/R for commercial accounts."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction and the relationships that were made with the regulars and co-workers.
good,again working through a temporary agency. I worked 8 months before being layed off due to lack of work from the company.
good,"Everyday is a learning experience. The diversity in the work place is amazing, that you get different people from all over the world. Being part of management, I have learned a lot from this job. The hardest objective is to keep people accountable, with a high volume store, the roster tends to be bigger than most stores. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the satisfaction of helping others with their automotive needs."
good,"friendly , hardworking staff, not alot of stress, very repetitous"
good,I would cpmplete my daily tasks as a retail store assistant manager.
good,Enjoyed the employees and working environment. Learned a great deal about automotive diagnostics along the way.
good,"This is a face pace company. I learned how to manage others, time management for tasks needing to be completed. The hardest part of the job is heavy lifting. What I most enjoyed about this job is the people I worked with including the public."
good,•a typical day at work - long
good,fun place to stretch your automotive knowledge
good,"I loved the people, but upper management would nver let you be less than Excellent, in their expectations. There were no praises for a good job."
good,I wanted to work at Autozone to learn more about cars and I did for the most part; learned more about people as well.
good,"Work training is very good. The managment does not have any tolerance for missed work, even when it is with a medical reason. the coworkers are helpful,and like to see others do well."
good,It was a fun place to work and the people was fun to work with. we all did are jobs but had fun doing it. Every day was difference from the next. I learned more about auto part than I knew.
good,Great part time or full time job management can be worked on though and the pay is ok but my overall experience there was positive would recommend others to apply
good,Pretty easy going especially if you got some basic car knowledge. Coworkers for the most part are nice people. Great place if in need of a part time. Clean environment.
good,"I enjoyed my time there but there were a couple of co-workers that I really couldn't stand and made it a chore to go to work some days. Other than that, I really had no issues with the place, the work or the people"
good,I was promised a raise & recognition. Neither were given when it was time. my promotion was months before raise and they considered that my raise. There was more on my plate then other part sales managers. I gave my time more then any employee.
good,"A friendly staff and customers "
good,"Any job is what you make it, Autozone encourages employees to help customers. I’ve been blessed with great management and have also experienced selfish and lazy.  Workloads can be difficult and upward movement even harder but overall they work with schedules, have a family like atmosphere, train on job, and give people the chance to care for others."
good,great employee's who love to work and assist customers we diagnose the vehicles to give you the right parts you need and we endure customer satisfaction
good,"Good job for fit individuals. Must stay on task and have a constant energy level for ten hours straight. Work a four day week off three days, no second shift only first, third, and weekend shifts."
good,Customer Service is. Key along with a positive character. You can make time go by faster just by making your customers feel great!!! Other then that the job is pretty easy to do.
good,Some companies create a great atmosphere to work in; while others in so many ways force you to deal with the negativity that comes with the job. At Autozone teamwork is the best option in this time of job because promotes a good atmosphere despite strong differences or overbearing management.
good,"Working for autozone was a good experience,  I got to deal with customers and help as much as i could possible.  I also got to stock the floor, run commercial and drive for commercial."
good,I worked with a lot of wonderful hard-working people. It helped me want to become an automotive technician. I learned the functions of parts which helped me learn how to sell them to help customers get the right parts. The hardest part of the job was watching how the company selected people for advancement that took credit for other people's hard work.
good,great place to work at with good people. great management and friendly customer base. work includes small tasks on customer cars and cashier duties as well.
good,"Very fun place to work, especially seeing the satisfaction of the customers after helping them satisfy their needs wether its replacing a battery or helping them find the parts they need."
good,Did not like doing a cheer and culture too touchy feelings but a fair place to work with clean facilities as well as great equipment and drivers treated well.
good,Great job but the pay is too low and not enough hours. At AutoZone you learn alot about vehicles. The store manager and employees are friendly and helpful.
good,It's a good first job but they do not pay well for the amount of work required. The company could definitely afford to treat/pay its employees better.
good,"My days are often too short with highly inconsistent days on/ off ratios. I like the work but would appreciate better compensation and or hours. Other than that, I genuinely appreciate my role."
good,Great starting point for eager person seeking sales.  Good benefits and salary potential for full time employees.  Good clean working environment.  Great managers who push for excellence within you.
good,This job gave me an opportunity to interact with the costumers and i loved it. It gave me the confidence to talk and be a part of peoples everyday struggles just like myself.
good,Very busy and a lot to learn.  Car knowledge helps a lot.  Problem solving and multitasking ability helps too.  Challenging but also rewarding at the same time.
good,Its get stressful trying to make your numbers. You can work hard and do your job but the numbers will still be bad. You are required to make a -7 or better per week. If not they will write you up. After 4 write ups and you get one more you are fired for production. I personally think they have lost alot of good hard workers due to the DLX system that figured up numbers
good,Great job but pay wasn't so great. I enjoyed the challenges of helping customers figure out s solution to their issues. You are expected to mentor and train new employees even if you're slammed with customers or truck.
good,Very good place to start for a new manager with not much experience. Job can be very hard if you have small kids because minimum  hours are 50 hours a week for store managers. The compensation it pretty fair but everyone underneath the manager is minimum wage. If you have any Automotive background very helpful.
good,"If you like working with auto parts or even want to get to know more, you should try applying at autozone even if you don’t know much most of the customers teach you a lot."
good,One will have an opportunity to learn much associated with a Distribution Centre of Motor vehicle parts and accessories. The Centre serves over 100 stores with Texas and Mexico.
good,"This was a good learning curve job. Training was good, sales was important and the experience was overall good. Not enough pay but good culture. Good discount."
good,"Ok company, depending upon what region you are working in. Some DM are very knowledgeable and qualified, and some should not be in the position they're in. Need more training."
good,"Once clocked in I would immediately jump onto my register and begin assisting customers. Greeting them as they walked in the door and pulling their parts for them. I loved to do the installs when the company allowed me too, minuscule installations such as car batteries or windshield wipers. I was also asked to up sale on items such as break pads always pushing for the customer to also purchase grease or hardware with their selection. Little did my managers know that's what I loved to do was up sale. My numbers were noticeably higher then my coworkers sometimes even my managers because I would always up sale to help build the customers basket. I learned that I loved to work on car, trucks, even ATVs. If not for Autozone I might not have discovered my passion for auto mechanics."
good,"NA this job is a non sit down employer, fast paced. Other things include our customers are the reason we receive our income, unfortunately not everyone recognizes this."
good,I loved working at autozone only if the money matched as many hours that was put in weekly. A lot of opportunity to grow as a leader . Overall great company
good,Worked 30+ hours as a part time employee. Was passed up for a full time position by someone outside of the company. The hourly wage is a joke for everything you have to put up with. Discount is helpful tho.
good,I started working here in order to advance my education with automotive services. I worked here for a year and enjoyed it. I was able to take the information I gained and become a great mechanic.
good,AutoZone was an excellent place to work very flexible and it was a learning experience. Able to manage your schedule and able to receive employee discounts.
good,"worked the cash register, helped customers find the parts need for their cars, answered the phones, checked delivery's and hub transfers, counted out draws at end of shift and placed in safe, made bank drops."
good,"It's easy to be taught how to work the computer database for parts but if you are not familiar with parts you eventually will. As months pass you learn the function and installation. Wipers are the easiest That I learned to change. Educational in itself, with the right co-workers and wanting to learn yourself."
good,"Ok job and advancement possible. Believe what you see, not what you are told. You can learn a lot quickly. If you are a favored employee then rules do not apply."
good,"Great organization that I’ve enjoyed working with the past 18 years with career opportunities, benefits, positive culture and safe working conditions. Thanks"
good,I loved working for Auto Zone and for my management but when it came time for raises and job advancements it take extremely long at the corporate level.
good,"I liked my time at Auto zone, the management team was great and always tried to help you get better. They were not afraid to help you get any help you needed not only at work but at home too."
good,"A typical workday began at 2pm until 9pm.  I assisted customer throughout the day with needs for the car.  I offered add on sales at the register and completed sales.  I changed windshield wipers and after completing quick engine checks, suggested possible car maintenance.  The work culture was that of greeting each customer with eye contact and a smile within 30 seconds of them entering the store.  Management was strict with office and store polices in which we were to adhere too.  The most enjoyable part was learning the merchandise and being able to assist customer.  The hard part was items not being in stock therefore leaving the customer not completely satisfied.  In those instances I would reach out to other stores to see if the merchandise was available."
good,Management changed and things got really difficult. before management changed though the auto zone I worked for in my home town I had 2 major problems with them changed my pay with out telling me and I lost money for a month thank god I caught it but then they changed it back and reimbursed me. But why should I even have to worry about that type of situation.In my 5th year I was talking about leaving and I was only making 11.30 an hour in 5 years. That is crazy not even getting a full 40 hours because they moved me back up front. and out of commercial. In commercial I was getting a full 40 hours a week. So I was highly up set. Then I was promised by the district manager that I was gonna get a 2 to 3 dollar raise. 3 months come up I bring it up I check my pay check and I got a 23 cent raise. I PROMISE TO GOD! So from that point on I have tried to do nothing but GROW!
good,"If you like cars- this is the place to work"
good,Flexible schedules. Good company. Nice people. Good for part-time work. Gave me hours I wanted for part-time work. They have many close locations & can move between stores.
good,"Working at Autozone was pretty OK. As a place for me to work for my First job, it was a decent place. I got paid about as much as you would expect and I was never really treated unfairly."
good,Good place to work very hectic sales invirerment. Fast paced and long hours but very rewarding. Customer satisfaction is the key to great sales. WITTDJR!
good,Overall a great company wish it had more fulltime positions. It has its strong points and some weak points but almost a well rounded job.i would work there again. It was an easy job to have.
good,"A typical day at work starts with signing on and checking t see if there is any mail. I learned a lot about parts locations. The management were great. The workplace culture was not that great, they are too laid back. The hardest part of the job is putting the core parts up and making sure they are properly labeled. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to go home."
good,Be sure to help coworkers. Work environment changes with the seasons. Finding a balanced work schedule with team proves challenging. Many other factors only applicable to stores in certain areas.
good,Love helping customers find what they need to fix their vehicles. Very informative job. They offer great discounts on products when you are employed there.
good,A typical day at work involved team work and good communication.  I learned a lot from co-workers and customers who did a lot of there own car work.  Management was good for the most part.  We have a cool relaxed environment because of the people in charge.  They take the edge off of the stressful situations that peoples' cars cause.  Our workplace culture is about being positive and getting the job done right.  That includes making sure to ask the customer questions about what they are working on so we can get everything they need the first time they come in.  The hardest part about the job is lifting lots of batteries and dealing with people who are stressed out about there car situations.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customer fix there issue and watching them smile at the accomplishment we made.
good,"Working at Auto-zone part time was pretty okay, I also learned a lot. the only down fall was the pay, the pay is just horrible. They are pretty flexible with hours as well."
good,"Need to up pay rate for employees to help better staff stores."
good,"Your work environment depends on how you run the show, my employees and myself got along just fine. We understood a job needed to be done and we ensured it would be finished. Lots of collaboration and understanding is needed to finish the day strong.  A great team environment, there was room for growth for those who wanted to step up to the plate. Although at times I feel like we were understaffed."
good,.come to work do what you have to do safely and also cleanness and help customers with what ever they need help the right way so they could feel that you know what you doing
good,"Not a overall bad company to work for besides the company does not follow their own policies ( returns, warranties etc ).  Upper management does not take in consideration of employees opinions or ideas making a employee feel that their thoughts and ideas are not wanted.  Company sides with customers either be it DIY or COMMERCIAL and only listens to their side no questions asked.  There is a high turn over rate for a reason ( regional and corporate management )"
good,My day at Auto Zone includes helping customers with finding the correct parts for their car and project.  Installing batteries and windshield wipers when customers are unable to install them .  Also teaching the customers how to install the wipers and battery.  The hardest part of my job is understanding the customers that don't speak English.   The best part of my job is helping customers and looking at the smile on their face once you fix their car problems.
good,"I have become quite knowledgeable with car parts and accessories. most days are rough because we deal with customers who typically aren't prepared to spend money on their vehicles,so i have to calm customers daily.the hardest part of the job for me was remembering where every part is  located in the store."
good,Great stepping stone but they don't value there worker they don't give good raises. They will always put there customers before there employees even if the customer is wrong . Good environment but defiantly could use a little work on the management side of things.
good,"Salary was barely above minimum wage, but as a no experience required job, it's not a bad start. During the day it can be pretty busy and fast paced, and customers can tend to be rude and impatient half the time, but the crew I worked with was mostly laid back, respectful, and helpful. Having a general knowledge of automotive mechanics helps a lot, but isn't absolutely necessary. There is online training course they offer to help be more knowledgeable of the products and systems."
good,I was at AutoZone for many years. It is a fast paced environment with a ton of great people. It located in a great place and the building is pretty nice.
good,"If you are able to take a job seriously, this place is perfect even for beginners. It’s a great place to learn and grow in the car industry. Management is different at each store but overall they got the job done. Good place to move up."
good,On a typical day at Autozone. When on temp service go in and separate all the recalled items to different stacks. I worked on the assembly line as well. Placing parts into boxes for them to be shipped.
good,I do not currently work at AutoZone. The workplace culture was rich but stressful. The hardest part of the job was staffing. Finding qualified applicants was always a challenge.
good,"Good hours , good people , good overall work place . Employee discounts are nice . Easy job if you do it correctly. Good If you have a family because of the hours are flexible"
good,it can be a rewarding job if you like customer service and problem solving very minimal mechanical skills are need but computer skills are very helpful
good,"Worked for Autozone for 5 years, as a whole the company is good, however, there will be variances depending on local management that will make or break your decision of the company. Little room for promotion as they prefer to hire from outside."
good,I enjoyed working at Autozone and they where very helpful in training and teaching me the requirements to managing to store when it comes to inventory and commercial accounts.
good,I enjoyed my time with Autozone met a lot of good people and learned how to work and communicate with the general public. Well originized management very lenient with scheduling.
good,"Great place to work unfortunately the pay is not enough to live on.  A great learning opportunity, comfortable atmosphere, wonderful crew in the store i work at."
good,I was a counter person or CSR with stocking and cashier responsibilities. It was a very fast paced environment. It was a good learning experience. I knew some about the workings of an engine going in and learned a lot while there.
good,Autozone has a nice mix of corporate and family business mindset. A lot of people have been there for 20+ years which makes business or culture changes more difficult.
good,Working at AutoZone has been a really good experience. It is a company with a strong sense of culture. The company has plenty of room for advancement for those willing to go the extra mile.
good,managers could be trained with better knowledge but i mostly loved the customers always having a smile once theyve gotten everything they need thanks to the helpful mind of Autozoners
good,Nothing at this time. Don't wanna speak bad about the company cause it's not the companies fault. Small country town regulator customers on a daily basis
good,This place will help you hone your sales skills with automotive knowledge you already have. good if your looking for something better but you haven't finished your education.
good,Great place to work.. they have been great at promotions and coaching to get me to the next level... I enjoy talking with the shops and helping them get their customers back on the road.
good,"I rose quickly through the ranks at AutoZone and started a store from the ground up as a store manager in less than a year of being employed there. I truly enjoyed my employees and tried to instill the motto that if you have a positive attitude at work and learn something new every day, that work will no longer be ""work""."
good,"The company as a whole was a pleasure to work for. However after transferring to a different store in a different state, it came clear to me that some of the superiors lacked proper leadership. In addition there was also issues with proper pay. Other than those issues there was no complaint with the job. I enjoyed assisting customers to the best of my ability, from maintenance tips to proper tools and parts for a specific job."
good,started as a counterperson and within a month was promoted to an assistant manager. .Six months later I was moved to the busiest store in our region. After about a year there was transferred to a brand new store with a brand new manager. Soon after I got my own store.
good,"In the mornings I would get my RF scanner and store labels to start my day with. I would log in scanner and scan labels and start pulling auto part for stores. Placing them in a tote and sending them down conveyor to the QC station to be checked for accuracy and loaded on trucks for delivery. On occasion I would have to solve issues with labels not scanning or the system skipping parts and such. When I would get to a NO ORDER status which means I am out of stores to pull until everyone gets caught up to the same store. AT that point I would have to co help fellow co workers catch up. All of this being on production, which means you have to stay busy or you wont make production and will get a write up."
good,if you own old cars and need a discount on parts it is a good place to work part time. i would not look at making a career there. they do not pay enough and it is not worth the stress of store management for what they pay
good,"I am the current general manager for my store and it is very stressful right now to keep stores staffed, I have to say this is my biggest challenge right now."
good,It was a good job when I was young and it thought me a lot.  But not a good career. To low of pay. Not good benifits. And the hours are not the best. Other than that i do not regret working there.
good,It was a fast paced job that demanded sales goals be met while sacrificing customer service. Product still needed to be sorted and put away quickly with min hours allotted to complete it. Our associates were quick to help one another but dealing with corporate was a head ache.
good,"buen trabajo un sueldo normal, buen compranerismo,"
good,lots of room to move up if wanted. multiple locations make it possible to move up quickly.
good,Average retail job with not many benefits for the part time employees. Hours are fair depending on the department and culture of employment varies from store to store. My recommendations would be to make friends with management (if possible) prior to employment in order to have a true insight of the job.
good,While I do wish the pay could have been better the environment and culture was very intriguing. Everyone was friendly and helpful to new employees and there was always something to be learned from the management. Down sides as with every where there is favoritism at times unfair treatment. Overall I would recommend this as a great firs job or for someone in auto tech who wants to get more into the parts side of the auto field. I would probably still be there if the company would pay a little more to retain quality workers.
good,"There's always something to do. Constant requirements from cooperate to up-sale are annoying."
good,I liked working there its not an easy job but they have fun. It can be hard some nights to make rate. But my supervisor was awesome and very helpful. If it wasn't for a bad car accident I'd still be there.
good,It’s a retail job and you have to help the angry customer out to help fix the car sometimes can be slow pace and can become very fast paced! If you like retail this the job for you
good,AutoZone is a good place to work if you like helping people and really like cars. you can become a manager fairly easy but you will have to take the initiative to get the training material yourself.
good,"Fast paced place to work plenty of advancement opportunities, worked with my school schedule. very tight night group of supporting individuals who mostly got along."
good,"This is a place to learn so very much about automotive without having to go to college. Management is extremely demanding and you can look forward to long, busy hours of work in a fast paced environment. Lots of hands-on encounters.  If you are in management, you will be held to  high standards and if you cannot meet the goals, you will be scolded. Morale is as good as the management makes it to be. If they are stressed, then the rest of the team will be just as stressed with them."
good,"Overall Auto Zone is a pleasant place to work, where everyone gets along. It's hand s on learning and you learn as much as you are willing to learn. I learned how to test starters and alternators and other things.It's a place where management is right out there with you. For me the most enjoyable part of the job are the customers and the rapport you build with them. For the most part as long as you stay positive keep a good attitude and apply yourself there are no hard parts to this job. Would I recommend Auto Zone? Yes."
good,"Fun place to work, store manager is great. Parts service managers are cliquey and territorial. Store manager is very understanding of personal life issues and tries to work with you on hours. Pay isn't great. Would recommend overall."
good,good company to work for. Autozone is  financially strong company with 5800 stores worldwide. there is a room for advancement and friendly place to grow.
good,With the right management Auto Zone is a great place to work at.  I have no problem with the culture itself I just believe that in busier stores we do way more than what we are properly compensated for overall cool place to work
good,"Helping people is the best part I felt about this job, having customers come in freaking out about problems with their vehicles to find out that it is a minor issue just take a little know how to fix. is by far the most satisfying part of this job I felt. But know the upper management are constantly pushing you to complete goals in sale and product pushing to amp up these goal as soon as you complete them and then shame you for not living up to these expectation."
good,"First let me say that the overall environment at Auto Zone is good, the co=workers are a fine group, the store manager was not a good person to work for, he is an individual that will lie to employees , he talks behind your back ."
good,"Standing for long hours and talk to many people during the day, help a lot of customers with trouble with their vehicles, helping people is the best part of the day."
good,I worked as a driver for them delivering parts to different auto companies in the area.  I also had to work with customers on the inside and helped change different parts on cars.
good,"Good place to work,  DIY/commercial accounts well as vendors are what makes auto-zone a fun place to work.  Making customer service,  one of the most important part of this job"
good,I work for the one in Castleton Indiana it was a good spirited store with a good group of guys. Some days were slow some days were fast-paced I would go back if I can give me my job back
good,They tell you how easy it is to move up and the company and it’s like jumping through loops. They always making promises that are never kept.We are always under staff
good,"Hub drivers are put thru the mill with micro mgt. To the point of total frustration. Pay should be a minimum of $11 for a well seasoned driver who loves their job. I will say I would have stayed but for Mgt and money. If you're interested in hub driving at 0983 I would say don't. The $ is to low for the stress you'll be put thru. I will say as a CSR working front of the store is more fun. I love it. I love my new store, my new boss and everyone who works there. They provide excellent training, great hrs, everyone gets along and helps one another. I look forward to my work."
good,My time at auto zone was actually really nice. My team was relaxed and very helpful. We all worked well together. My only complaint is that I was promised a promotion and never received it.
good,Best place to start a career there is plenty of chance for advancement and many ways to get extra hours.  The company loves to promote from within. A great place.
good,They were always DIY friendly and lately trying to get into commercial  business without having the right people in place. They needed more help for people to work on getting new accounts.
good,I driving and the people were easy to work for. The company is vary flexible working around a person schedule. The employees don't get layoff at the most hours would be cut.
good,Working on the road is nice for the right type of person. i enjoyed it very much would still be doing it today if it were not for a family tragedy that required me to get off the road.
good,"my coworkers where and are still like an extended family to me. the reason i honestly stayed so long was the team, but after all to quote clerks ""this job would be great if it wasn't for all of the customers"" its retail man prepare to be defecated on"
good,"I would unload load, products to the store, show customer service while helping customers find products they need, look up parts people need in our system when we could not find it and order them and finally check them out as a cashier handle cash and cash out in the end of the day."
good,"A typical day is clocking in helping open the store, helping the customers find the correct parts & pricing then pulling said parts, Doing my vehicle inspections then delivering parts to different commercial customers. Help answer phones & find parts for those customers, take payments over the phone or in person. Stock & forward face products in the store & keeping it clean & neat. Love my co workers & manager we all get along well."
good,"Very engaged with the customer got to be quick with your hands. Customers don't like repeating themselves.  Also,  you will have to test or replace batteries. Test alternators and starters. Replace bulbs cabin airs filters. All sorts."
good,"Days are long, hours are crunched, and too few days a week. The job itself isn't too bad assuming your body is in really good condition. I personally have some problems with my left shoulder so carrying batteries is a bit difficult."
good,"You can move up in this company fast depending on the positions you start in. However unless you are in the corporate office, the higher you get the more stressfull it gets and the less time you have for personal life."
good,Usually slow start but challenging throughout the day. Employees would help each other in all facets while working together. I enjoyed the personnel the most.
good,"Es una empresa en la que el personal es muy amable y apoya a la facilidad de adaptación rápida en el puesto en el que se tiene que desempeñar, y todos los miembros de la organización ofrecen un trato sin discriminación y igualdad, siempre a la disposición del cliente y de los empleados de nuevo ingreso."
good,"Good place to work. Long hours are commonplace and the company's culture is like no other. Most measurable data is micromanaged on a daily, weekly and monthly basis."
good,As would be expected in a corporate environment. Upper management is not in touch with the daily aspects of the store personnel. Job advancement is encouraged.
good,The best part of Autozone is its' people. Most everyone there is willing to help their fellow employee with whatever needs they have. People try to make it fun at work by joking around.
good,"fast paced, competitive, rewarding, good benefits, paid time off, standing on concrete floors all day, steel toed boots, no room for error, collecting past due balances from clients"
good,"fun ,stable shifts low pay ,normal day at work loud heavy equipment putting up freight changing batteries. Manager was very great but other employees made it worth the stay for a while at least"
good,This one my first real job other than getting paid while attending a college bound program but I enjoyed working at AutoZone. I learned a lot and I made great friends.
good,"As Store manager you are required to fill any vacancies created from employee call ins, missed shifts or short staff issues.  Hiring a competent staff is the key to any successful business"
good,Overall a good company can b fun but it has its stressful days just dont like da fact that theres no se schedule. Your whole day is spent in there and the managers should b paid more
good,There are many people who join the Autozone team that I have seen move up the chain fairly quickly. The job is simple and you get to meet tons of good people.
good,Good place to work but would rather work in the DC or as an outside sales Representative rather than in store to use my degree to it fullest for any company i work for.
good,"If i were to be asked to come back, i would in heartbeat! I loved working there especially meeting new people and helping with customers. My knowledge for automotive grew rapidly although i have experience in repairing vehicles as well as products needed or recommended."
good,It was a good place to work managment was very well trained and orginazed I left due to educational reason and had to move for college. It was a very good job if you knew about cars and a great way for someone to learn more.
good,"Mi puesto desempeñado es vendedor profesional de autopartes, sin embargo se desarrollan actividades mas allá de el, los días están organizados por la gerencia, solo que al final lo que determina todo es el flujo de clientes."
good,"KPI driven sales operation which focuses on customer satisfaction while maintaining/exceeding profit benchmarks."
good,"Everyday you meet new people, some nice, some not so much, but  for the most part you build relationships with some to the point they will rely on you to help repair their vehicle"
good,Worked at 15 different stores. Upper Management Changes. Requires a lot of time and energy. Also there will not be much balance to your work- life mixture. Once a member of management your life will be consumed with Autozone.
good,A typical day at work is exciting because of the team I work. We all work as family. We all help one another with problems we have during the work shift.
good,"Very open about their promotion efforts and requirements. If communicated to managers and demonstrated through work efforts, promotion is attainable. Also a good place to build customer service interaction experience."
good,Overall not a bad job. learning to deal with the many different types of people that come into the store all with their own problems and concerns was the hardest part.
good,"It was a good place to work, fast paced, hours went by super fast, a little physical demanding but overall very good, the real problem is the lack of control a store manager can have with their own associates, It was all controlled by a person on top of another, not really a bad thing but in this case someone who isn't constantly paying attention to an specific store or doesn't have personal interaction with the workers of the store had to make decisions over the actual store manager. "
good,"Learned alot more about cars and the parts involved with them.The manager of the store was a micro manager, but the assistant managers were very good."
good,Okay place to work. Decent pay and benifets. Stressful at times. Need to fix management problems and I think they will get better. Has lots of potential to be a great place to work
good,"I am willing to grow old with a company. I am cool, calm and humble. Ideas are what I have and willing to learn as much as I could to give good result"
good,"Working for this company means you have to achieve such high demands or they'll easily replace you. The benefits are excellent but when you switch from state to state, they like to rip you a new one. If they can take advantage of you, they will. Also they don't have to hire you back. So this is better to be a high school job and not a career job. Its not worth it."
good,Open to learning new things and getting to know different people and being helpful and ateninve  to people and there feeling while keeping a good attitude
good,has its good and bad days. the weather could be a problem when driving on the freeway. love the fact that I could see other co workers from other stores every time I work
good,"Good work place an friendly faces "
good,They rarely hire ppl on FT. Therefore you r forced to take on other jobs to provide for your expenses. And pay is every 2 weeks. At only minimum wage.
good,I loved working for autozone I didnt mind workering hard  or mind getting up in the morning for work. I would be at work an hour early. I would love to help customers and help them find the problems with their cars. Just interacting with people and joking with them. My first manager was one of the best managers I loved working for her. Picking up some of the parts like battiers and rotters.
good,Fast paced job with a laid back atmosphere. The average size floor space allows attention to detail with each sales person and customers. This is a great proving ground for individuals that are obsessed with customer service and driven by success.
good,"Company turnover rate in high so there in always room for advancement. Automotive knowledge is recommended, but not necessary. In house training is available via computerized testing and study guides. But if a fast paced working environment does not flow easy for you and you do not have a thick skin for customer service, this not the job for you."
good,"Open or close store. Complete all daily logs and checklist. Manage time clock and schedules. Set up cash registers, balance safe and make deposits. As management my duties included making sure all departments had the proper manpower it needed, correcting any problem that could not be solved by other AutoZoners. Aid in the logistic operation for the AutoZone commercial and hub department. Because we deal with customers frustrated with ever increasing car problems, i have learned a great deal of patience and understanding. When you work through the customer inexperience and frustration and get them what they need, the feeling is like nothing else."
good,in the work place culture it can be very difficult cause honestly because the managers had favored the other people i was working my butt off at the job.
good,"I am a vendor pretty much on my own. I cover a large area and sometimes the hardest is finding parts you need in a very small town."
good,If you are looking for a place to advance quickly and you have a Self driven positive attitude. This is a good place to start. There have been many successful stories that have taken place with this employer.
good,even tough there is not a lot of oportunity of progress is really great as a workplace great people to work with when the managers are not triying to take you down.
good,You learn a lot about automobiles and meet a lot of good people. The pay isn't what i expected at all. i'm not satisified with the pay which is why i'm looking for another job with better benefits and pay.
good,it was ok i was just promised a lot of things that were never real. but overall it was a nice place to work for. the managment really needs to all be on the same page tho.
good,"First job, Autozone taught me a lot about customer service. Typically we would take care of the store as in stock items as well has handle customers and money. Helping them with parts and giving the best advice we can offer. The store would get very busy and that taught me how to be fast and think on my toes. All my managers are very understandable and chill. The hardest part of the job would probably be the language barrier since most customers wouldn't speak English as much be I get by with coworkers translating and helping each other out. Working there I knew very little about motor vehicles but every time I clocked in I learn everyday."
good,Learned More About Interacting With Customers. Good Management But Can Use Some Changes. Co Worker Are Hard Workers But Can Learn To Not Threw Other Workers Down In Spirit.. Loved Learning About All The Parts A Car Has And Was Able To Sell Them
good,"Starting out was a great experience. I learned how to direct and coordinate my co-workers, use RAF guns, SAP (Inventory management program), returns, receiving and shipping procedures."
good,"Exelente servicio al cliente. Ambiente agradable, te capacitan constantemente y reconocen tus logros. Lastima que la paga sea miserable por el grado de esfuerzo que exigue autozone"
good,i learned to communicate with customers and get them on the right path when it came to getting their car/trucks fixed. Worked with some great ppl and worked some great hours.
good,"The managers are very great people, always ready to assist you whenever you have questions or concerns. They do a great job at training you so that you will be successful on your own. It is a great job for college students because they will work with schedules as well. There is not much heavy lifting however, there is a lot of customer interaction which is easy as long as you are not a shy person, this job requires you to be as kind and caring as well as understanding as possible."
good,This company was good to work for though hours are inconsistent unless your position is full-time. The store manager is willing to listen and help with scheduling and any issues you may be having. I feel that the hardest part of the job is having unhappy customers.
good,"It was s great job. I liked the job and the customers that came in. There's employees who would get away with lax of attendance. For example: Company policy on attendance was, 12 points and then you was terminated. With that being said let's just say some employees has double that and still have employment."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers answer any questions they may have related to different makes and models of vehicles. A huge part of the job is to make sure that the customers leave happy and knowledgeable about the things they may need."
good,"A typical day would be waking up early and working almost until job was complete. I learned a lot, being motivated and encouraged to be successful at the job at hand."
good,"AutoZone values customer satisfaction and quality service. We go the extra mile to ensure that you get the help you need. “Autozoners” as they are called are knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. They are eager and more than willing to help you with your vehicle. All the while, maintaining a clean and safe environment with a dynamic product placement throughout the store."
good,"It was a great place to work at ,working with people is the enjoyable part of the job .we will also get training for other position"
good,"busy and fast paced environment with lots of customer service and many task to be done in short periods of time. returns, sales, delegating, assigning task, daily paper work, attendance, planograms, inventory management. Making sure everything runs smoothly. Best part is when all employees work as a team."
good,Always promising advancement but nothing happens. Been working for this company for 3 years. Enjoyed working with customers and problem solving.
good,"In this position it is a great way to learn new and exciting ways to be able to fix any type of vehicle. Many experts come in for parts, and I am able to help them find the desired part as well as pick their brain about the knowledge of what they have to fix on their vehicle."
good,i did not know anything about cars until i work at the autozone. and now im able to tell what kind of parts im buying or look for.
good,"Answer phone orders, and proceed to fill orders. Address any payment options changes and make sure everything payment wise is in order."
good,customers are sometimes hard to deal with. managers are cool but store managers don't help out. i learned some spanish while here due to hispanic customer base.
good,"Well, this was a great place for me to start working. It had a lot of advantages. Such as learning a lot about cars, helping people with car troubles they are concerned about, and even meeting new people through your shared hobby. However, this job came with many cons as well. They changed scheduled days and times weekly, so it was very difficult to schedule things like Physician and Dental appointments. Customers expect you to know the answer to all the questions because you're the man behind the counter. And you're only a minimum wage associate... There are MANY small tasks they expect you to keep up with while still taking care of customers. ""Fronting and Facing"" is what they call it when you make sure everything on the floor and in the back room look neat and tidy on the shelves and are in the right place. You have to understand their organization system which is moderately complex. Customers expect you to know how to install a car battery or a headlight. And a few more things. I had left this place due to work environment and my co workers. It was honestly A LOT of work for a minimum wage job, I had automotive knowledge compared to my other co workers and they still felt it wasn't worth a raise of any amount. All but 2 of my coworkers were always morose or irritable, no matter what was happening that day. There were 2 managers that would always turn off the radio even when it was still appropriate for work. It was just a very unhappy environment."
good,"A typical day for me was come in clock in pull trash cans out to the front for the customers I was on register so I will pull items for customer ring them up push additional sales diagnose vehicles also download the truck for new stock. I've learned a lot about cars on the daily, management was always very helpful and we had a friendship that was something I loved about the job co-worker was nice and the hardest part of the job was doing the truck by my self and closing with just one other person to help you and every part of the job was enjoyable."
good,"i have learned there policies and procedures, everything else i brought with me. they will give you the support you need at first then take it away."
good,"Get to work five minutes early for stretches, choose pallet jack. Get my headset, and pick and pull in my designated area for the day. "
good,Enjoyed working here for over a year.  I was in an accident resulting in a broken shoulder that kept me from working for 5 months.  I came back to work for a month and was then let go.  Very disappointed with the outcome of my position.
good,"The jobs is really simple. You go in, and assist customers in their needs. Customer service skills are important in this job as we always put our customers first. The management is, along with my co-workers are all great people. We all work together great as a team in getting things done efficiently. The hardest part of the job is answering phone calls while dealing with a customer when the store is packed.For the most part I enjoy working on cars, and the little time I get to spend outside with the customers when changing the battery or locating specific car parts."
good,"Typical day is to great customers, help them find exactly what they need, answer phones, handle money, inventory etc. what I learned was how to be patient and make sure the customer is always satisfied no matter what. Obey what the managers ask you to do and always go that extra mile to get things done for them. Being friendly with co-workers is n o problem because I'm a very friendly person and I get along with any diverse groups of individuals. The hardest part of the job has to be the rude customers that you just have to keep your composure for because its not personal. most-enjoyable part of the job is getting things done because its my job and also i LOVE keeping my customers satisfied."
good,"acceptable management, various opportunities, helpful coworkers. Large learning enviorment. good hours, good pay"
good,"Enter store looking at the first appearance, making sure presentations of products, and features are at their best. Check associates who are present and give assignments of tasks. Go through manager checklist. Give aggressive customer service when needed, which makes my job enjoyable."
good,"This would be a great part time job for a student. Very few benefits, no full time positions outside of management and no room for advancement."
good,I loved the job. I was very much into cars and this job taught me so much on vehicles. I loved to interact and help customers.
good,Building different relationships with the customers and building that trust and bond with them is the  most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Buena la empresa es exelente pero nesecita dar mas oportunidades de trabajo
good,"I learned at this job that the Customer needs are first which gave me much experience in Customer service. My co-worker were always very friendly.."
good,"Being a part of commercial at AutoZone, you need to be able to deliver your customers parts in a timely matter.  Maintaining a strong business relationship with the commercial accounts helps increase the sales and the overall improvement of the store."
good,"People are awesome, long work days though. Definitely have a lot of fun at work with people that are laid back, hard workers. Learn a lot about cars while working there."
good,We have fun while we work joke around but we do the things we need to do.  We stock and take care of our customers.  We also take care of their cars and get them the right parts.
good,"Autozone was one of my favorite employers due to my love of automobiles. I worked with a wonderful group of co-workers and the management team was great also. Unfortunately, the compensation wasn't very competitive."
good,"I pulled orders from an invoice sheet, packed, labeled, and shipped orders out, or sometimes I received items being sent back."
good,"When I started there was a new district manager and he did everything possible to squeeze money out the company. labor was cut few workers and it was busy."
good,"Everyday is a new challenge, allows to grow in abilities of automotive knowledge and ability to give customer service. Allows for growth within the company if you put in the time."
good,"stocking shelves, looking up car parts on a computer, diagnosing problems and being positive. the hardest part about this job is ordering the wrong part. the customer depends on you to order the right parts."
good,autozone is a okay place to work they have stores evey where so advancement and relocation is always a possibility and they give you the tools you need
good,If you are considering a career in auto parts this is a good company to start with. It is great in customer service and training the staff.
good,"Typical day at work consist of preparing the store for opening, "
good,New everything a manager would know and never got promoted. Also was never given many hours. I do feel that Autozone has good quality products.
good,"Working here you will expand on your knowledge of vehicles and they will train you on how to use their machines and basic diagnosis on vehicles.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who don't have prior experience with vehicle maintenance and repair, however it is very rewarding when you are able to help fix their problems with the skill set you possess or have learned working there."
good,"Push sales and its always a learning experiance and our interacting with customers to learn and fix their car problems."
good,Great place to work. Good hardworking people. I have learned a lot about car parts and inventory tasks. My boss is a great individual to work for and co-workers help make the job enjoyable.
good,"Atutozone es una gran empresa, sin embargo los líderes carecen de liderazgo efectivo, no se basan en programas de recompensas sino de castigos, eso mantiene un ambiente hostil entre los empleados."
good,Manager was awesome and meant the best for all her crew. Fun to work with others and always see different faces. Thanks for the opportunity
good,"AutoZone is a great company to start a career with. Management positions in the store can pay decent. Store management positions can make work/life balance difficult depending on upper management expectations. Strong culture, for better or worse. Salary positions pay well, depending on your qualifications, but often require more than the 50hr minimum scheduling requirement. Few paid holidays, no sick pay, and ""use it or lose it"" policy on earned vacation time. Benefits are way too expensive for what is covered. No retirement plan, pension, or decent 401k matching plan. You could work for this company for 30+ years and have nothing to show your time invested. Best advice, invest in yourself. Stock options are very good, and AZO stock continues to climb. This is a very good option. "
good,Great company with a strong corporate culture.  Cares about its employees and understanding their goals and aspirations.
good,A typical day would include loading various merchandise and transporting it to store all over the valley. It would be an average of 200-300 miles per day. The vehicles were nice.
good,"The job was pretty rewarding.  It felt great helping people make repairs to the vehicles, especially during the latest economic recession.  Management was friendly and welcoming to suggestions and requests."
good,"its a good place to learn about cars if you like cars and what something in the  automotive field,The people are great to work with and managment is good too."
good,"ENJOY EVERYDAY OPERATIONS AND WORKING AND HELPING CUSTOMERS .HAVE DEAL AND SOLVE CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEE ISSUES."
good,This is an okay place to work as long as all the management is communicating together.  There is only room for advancement if the store is making a certain amount of money.
good,"Friendly place to work. Very busy and chaotic, but overall it is a fun and challenging environment."
good,"I was a Parts Driver, a typical day for me would be driving the company car and delivering parts to shop's when ordered. Breaking down loads of boxes when they arrive, putting parts away and keeping count inventory. i was also helping customers find what they needed or gave them advice of what might of been wrong with their vehicle and replaced light bulbs and windshields. I learned about different model cars, minor repairs, learning of different problems that customers experienced with their vehicle. I also taught customers & helped people figure certain things out of their vehicle by using the diagnostic equipment provided. I enjoyed the management they where supportive & had an up-beat attitude toward training the new employee's. Co-Workers where great, we worked well as a team, we would always help each other out, & always Shared knowledge of different experiences we may of had with customers. At times the hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntle customers/employee's that may of been in a bad move, & sometimes when driving i would get caught in traffic & get the part delivered a little after the time was set for delivery. The most enjoyable part of the job was having support & some what knowledgeable Co-Workers about vehicles."
good,"•	Delivered 100+ car parts to different Auto Zone locations a day"
good,Autozone is a great company to work for but when it comes to getting promoted they're very slow about promotions. Overall the employees are great and the environment is ok.
good,"I learned how to  be a good manager there"
good,Autozone is a good starter but not for long term employment. If your a motor-head this is the job for you.
good,"Will lets assume your begin as a part time red shirt, for that person a typical day at Autozone would be working 4 hours a day whose duties would be tend to costumers, pick up the phone within three rings and basically do whatever you are told to do by management. This may include pulling overstock, cleaning the store stocking merchandise or just plain cleaning the parking lot. However I must say that though this job requires you to multitask you do learn a lot of handy things such as, how to handle and manage money, pull overstock, cycle count, reconcile the registers, audit the registers, cycle count, and how to manage a store. Further more the hardest part of the job is learning all the different parts for cars, and dealing with rude costumers in a professional way. For me the most enjoyable part was making costumers happy."
good,I just don't get enough hours to take care of my Family. They have a lot of turn over in the company with employees and in management and some are hired that don't have any idea what a starter is. The job is that you don't have a set schedule every week. I love being with the customers and serving them.
good,Cool laid back environment allowed me to understand the fundamentals of how to be a great salesman and customer service representative.
good,"Enjoyed working with public; co-workers worked as a team.  Demanding job, always.  Hardesr part of job - loading and unloading truck. Most enjoyable part - love working with customers, peoples person."
good,Fellow employees were nice and helpful when questions were asked.
good,"Good company, needs to pay better. Upper management was great and helpful."
good,"was in charge of cashing out and talking and informing customers of our parts."
good,Its a great job to have when you are in school. Management is great and you can move up if you wish to stay with the company.
good,"the best thing i enjoyed about my employment here was helpin others complete a job, asking co workers for help if and when needed. Staying on your feet all day is the most difficult part of the job. I've learned to be patient with others."
good,"I only got to work late hours which was difficult on family time. "
good,Great job and good team effort. Autozone treats there team well overall.
good,"Very active day, inventory daily, sales, bank deposit etc.... Not to trust anyone, the management was not good. The hardest art of the job was to don't be able to make decisions that related the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay check."
good,"giving advanced directives on auto parts sales, organizing and keeping logs of services for audits. Assist customers with concerns/issues in store on a daily basis. The sales representative also provides assistance with cashier services and payment for all inventories. Must have knowledge of product inventory"
good,It come's down to if you know car's like you think you do and the parts are also important because if you replace something that you didn't have to then there will be another problem with your car
good,"I started off knowing nothing about automobiles, and left knowing more than alot. Love Learning and making money at the same time."
good,AutoZone has a wonderful working atmosphere at the location I work at.
good,under paid working every day verbal abuse from district manager but helping people is fun and fulfilling.
good,I learned a lot in a very short amount of time and much trust was handed to me. I was given the proper tools to effectively complete my daily responsibilities.
good,Its a good place to work i you are going to school or just need a part-time job.
good,This place was an overall great place to work at for the most part as long as your strong and willing to learn as much as possible. It is fast paced along with an amazing family like personnel. But the pay is still only min wage.
good,"Daily tasks consisted of reviewing operations for inventory management, reviewing daily sales goals as well as store goals. Motivating employees about sales techniques and pushing promotional items. balancing safe and properly handling daily paperwork to ensure all audits are passed by DM and Loss Prevention Manager.  I learned most of what I now know due to my time at AutoZone constantly learning new things each day from other members of management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with certain aspects of customer service,  We are there for customer satisfaction and practice it everyday to perfect that trait unfortunately we can't always help the customer as much as we'd like. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship that we build with our customers as well as with other co workers. We spend so much time at work that we end up being like a family and the regular customers are a part of that bond."
good,"Pending the store and the Area Manager you work for this place can be heaven or hell. Proper training is available if you know where to look and who to ask. Staff levels are always kept to a minimum in order to maximize profitability at the cost of your sanity. Store support and all management above assistants store managers are off all major holidays while everyone else works. Most times customers expect store employees to fix their cars in the parking lots and for free. There are little to know chances for advancement, and the yearly 2 to 4% raises and hardly noticeable. If you find the time to learn automobile parts and and how to properly use the computer systems then you will do well. All others will sink."
good,helping customers with vehicular issues and up-selling on purchases. Excellent HR department.
good,very diverse met lots of wonderful ppl there perhaps need to consider there ppl a bit more
good,"Great place to work. Benefits are not the best for a family."
good,"I worked there for almost 20 years, I thought I would retire from there. However, when you have an upper Management change and they feel threatened, this is the result."
good,"A typical day at Auto Zone included working with customers to find the parts that they need for their cars, or lawnmowers, and sometimes even boats. We kept the store front faced and all products stocked for the customers' viewing. I learned more about car parts and how they functioned. The co-workers I had were very easy to work with and made the job go very smoothly during long shifts. The management was very frustrating at times because of the scheduling. They made time to joke around with co-workers but overstock and scheduling got put off a lot. The hardest part of the job was not knowing when I was going to work in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things about cars and their parts, and being able to assist the customers with my knowledge."
good,There is not much room for growth. Higher management being the manager in charge of the district make fake promises to make you work harder but never stand by there word.

good,"meeting and working with people,customer service,learning new things,working on cars,troubleshooting, didbt like i was only part time and pay was not that good."
good,"I enjoyed dealing with people and helping them solve their automotive problems. The people, at the store I worked with, were great. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what your schedule would be for the following week until the Wed of the preceding week."
good,"I enjoyed working for my manager. he is a great guy. but i hate the company. they make you sell stuff nobody wants, if youre not a good salesman to push product, you will get bad marks. no matter how hard you try to meet quotas. the only good thing about working there was the 20% discount on most products in the store. no health care for PT employees. but I expected that though."
good,"I extremely enjoyed working for the company, due to my love of cars. I liked dealing with different customers on a daily basis, and also the regulars."
good,"Enjoyed the people that I worked with, but on a company level, I felt more like a number then an employee."
good,Fun and exciting work environment that can greatly expand your automotive knowledge.
good,"they hire people with very little knowledge of automotive, not alot of training other then online, no class time or interacting"
good,the work and job was great. The manager in my store was the problem.
good,"I loved working at Auto Zone because i could feel as if i was helping the customers complete their job. I like working with the customer and figuring out what the best repair could be for them. My managers at the time were very supportive and helpful. The hardest part about my job was trying to please the customer and follow the rules within the same transaction, but i always managed to get them all they wanted at a reasonable price and that was very enjoyable to me."
good,I enjoy the down to earth but structure atmosphere. You will learn a lot about cars. Team work is big and it can be fun.
good,Good place to get a mechanical education for improving your life.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of selling parts, ordering parts, receiving shipments and logging them. There were several things that I learned while working here. How to work on a car, different types of car parts and their functions. How to test different equipment. The co-workers were very knowledgeable as well as helpful. The hardest part of the job was getting feedback from customers who did not want to talk to a woman about their problems with their vehicles. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning all the different functions about vehicles."
good,Fast Paced Customer oriented
good,store stays continuously slow pay is alright for a part time sales job though you wont get any hours and some customers can make it so the job isnt worth keeping
good,helped customers acquire car care and maintenance products as well as diagnosed vehicle problems and sold replacement parts.
good,"this was a good company as far as benefits, but needing to transfer or move up in the company required to be liked by the store manager. There where employees that had been with that company for several years and yet new hires with no experience got hired. of course after this it went down."
good,Too much of a multi task enviroment due to younger employess not taking job functions seriously.
good,I enjoyed working for the company and learned a great deal both about the industry and my own skills.
good,"Overall, I've enjoyed my days working at AutoZone. The people that I work with are super amazing and supportive, and even some of the regular customers are amazing. But, of course, with any retail job, there are times that the job can become very stressful, and unfortunately, if you're under 21, it's really hard to move up to any kind of leadership/management position. Otherwise, it's a great job and I've learned about customer service, sales, as well as about automotive work."
good,I loved working at Auto Zone.  Several years there ASE Certified.  Recognized for the work I did. Respected by Management and customers alike.  Trustworthy
good,"customer driven company. benefits are very good. as a manager, there was no time for a family. hours were way to long, worked 50 plus as a manager."
good,"It was fun to work here a little stressful at times you are on a time limit and restricted but otherwise you get to drive-in movie around throughout the day only thing is they could improve on their management, not the best"
good,Fast workers only no sloppy work only the best to serve customers. All repairs done on time computer skills.  Have to travel out to service New Mexico and Texas
good,"The work is easy and your experience depends on how well you handle public interactions.  Definitely a job for a people-person.  You have no room to advance if you are under 21, but it's a good part-time job."
good,"You can learn a lot of technical knowledge about cars if you're willing to. The pay isn't great at the start, but if you demonstrate your personal drive and can be flexible with your work schedule, there is potential to move up into management positions because there are several managers in each store."
good,"Company cares about customers they come first, getting promoted and pay are questionable.depending on the store manager and district manager they will hire new managers that know nothing about cars and overlook those that do and have been there for many years"
good,"I loved my job at Autozone but could not get full-time due to military training, as told by my general manager, this didn’t end well as I am a proud member of the military and it was an insult to me so I quit. I won’t work with someone who doesn’t respect me or my beliefs."
good,"Great atmosphere low paying job. "
good,Ybey where good people worked there. Hard work. I never had a problem with noboby. I jist did my job and helped others do there's sometimes. I never missed a day of or ever late..they will tell ypu that. And i didnt complain
good,"You got to meet new people every day."
good,It isn’t to bad I enjoy it worked there while getting certified in automotive I enjoy the customer interaction and making sure I did my job and make the customer want to come back
good,"Timed routes covering most of the ABQ and surrounding areas"
good,I diagnose different vehicles throughout the day and help customers help customers with there needs. hardest part is when they expect us to be mechanics and they get upset at the fact that we might be able to fix there car or cannot fix what they might consider a easy job.
good,Not really good pay so I left it for a better job but over all it's a great job for someone who's only feeding there self much respect to my fellow auto zoners
good,You can get to know the regular customers and really get to be friends with them. They become extremely loyal. Kind of wish that AutoZone gave a bonus for this...
good,Company willing to give 40 hours a week for full time employees. Have to be able to lift heavy objects on a daily basis. Versatile place to work. You are able to do different job tasks from driving to customer service on a sales floor.
good,"nice place to work at .managers had problems with employees .stealing product, not following prodacol  this place needed better trainers. and the computers were not up to date with the recalls."
good,"Some Store Managers are better than others. Each store has it's own atmosphere. I have learned a lot about cars and how to take better care of my own car from working at AutoZone."
good,"Liked helping customers with questions about their cars, delivery driving made the day go alot quicker than a normal day.became part of my family. Decent pay, work on having a different uniform or casual day."
good,I was a regular sales specialist and in about 6 months of working for autozone I became manager an I enjoy every bit of it except the pay and the play time with the work schedule
good,"I picked up a job as a commercial driver at Autozone as a second job to my full time job as a warehouse laborer. The management was very flexible with my schedule at my full time job and made balancing the two positions very easy. Comparatively low wage compared to other chain auto parts retailers, however that could be due to the rural location."
good,Teaches you information in the auto part industry. Learning customer service skills. Great working environment and opportunity  to move up in the company. The only downside is the low wages.
good,The work life was very professional and easy to learn. management was always very helpful and informative .Lots of on the job training and a lot of off site training for furthering opportunities.
good,"Will usually have to play car doctor with customers, but keeps you busy. Will be beneficial if you are knowledgeable about cars. Fairly mundane/boring depending on the day of the week."
good,Good place to start a career but you must remember you can only be as productive as they want you to be. If they don't let you move up because you're too good at what you do it mostly translates to them being scared of you going over them.
good,"Great job if you love working on cars, bikes and know few things as far as parts. I would suggest this to any students in highschool or going out of higschool. Wether its tech school or grad school you want to go to latter on and its something related to the automotive field, this is by far the best sales place you can work at."
good,"I really don’t have any complaints, what so ever. I enjoyed working there and still frequent the store often, as a regular customer. The atmosphere is great and the staff are friendly."
good,"Loved the benefits, most of the members of management. Loved my co workers. Loved the job I performed. Learned alot more in technology and"
good,Great place to work and learn about cars and trucks and what's keeps them going go online an apply for a job at auto zone hard works pays off hew the best autozone
good,"Can be very stressful if you're not confident in your up selling game.  Work on holiday, but do get holiday pay.  No excuses for your performance. They do offer training and teaching on product and give you the tools to be able to perform."
good,I learned about treating customers right. Knowing how to speak to customers and being able to take care of the needs of the customer.  Very good place to work
good,"During the morning shifts, the customer flow is fairly slow, during that time is usually when we get most of the stuff that need to get done. Usually around mid-day is when customers usually start coming in lots more."
good,Plenty of things to learn and plenty of overtime. The training was erratic and something's cant really be taught but you get used to it. A good way to learn about cars.
good,"Su lema ""El cliente es primero"" pero para que su cliente tenga buen trato y se vaya satisfecho deben adentrarse más a sus empleados"
good,"great place to work . learned alot about cars. would stay if they had more full time positions available . great customers and employees . really learned alot and liked the environment ,"
good,No pagan tiempo extra.No tienes vida privada por horarios.Mucha rotación de personal.
good,"Tiene buen ambiente de trabajo pero te ponen metas y si no logras el objetivo te tienes que quedar más tiempo para alcanzar la meta"
good,The company has helped me to grow my knowledge of parts and has helped with my overall experiences. The company is a great way to get started if you're looking for a career in automotive.
good,"Auto zone is a great company overall, especially if you’re into cars. Working for the company has definitely benefited me in terms of my knowledge towards cars and car parts. Another great factor about the company is they also work around your schedule. I was a full time student and the company was willing to put my education first and still be able to take care of me. Highly recommend working at AutoZone as a starting job."
good,"Loved working for autozone, they pay good and the job is easy for the most part. Depending on what you do and where you’re located it can be stressful but they usually pay you good in those situations"
good,Not worth it if you're manager. Not as flexible . nonmanagement gets flexibility. Will transfer you without pay raise even if the store is further than your home.
good,"The pay isn't great, but advancement and support is there if you assert yourself and actually learn the job. Management will help, but don't hold your breath for everyone to participate in helping you train for a P.S.M.(Parts Sales Manager) position. Overall I enjoy working for this company and hope to see great things in the near future."
good,"Fun place low pay, don’t offer much for advancement after becoming sales manager. Everything has been predetermined hope you don’t get a awful store manager"
good,"Work was at 5am and went until 3pm with an hour for lunch. Labour intensive, dirty, expect to sweat, but friendly coworkers. Management was going through some changes, but overall was fantastic. Great for part time work."
good,Worked full time.  I would go to the store and I would have my list of deliveries to make and go out on the road most of the day to deliver parts to automotive customers.
good,"Autozone is a great job to learn customer service and also gaining hands on experience. only issue there's a lack of hours and lack of promotions. Overall, it good."
good,the work was hard but the pay and benefits was worth it. I wished I still work there . I never should of quit. there is room to move up in  company . Human resources are awesome
good,Autozone is a good company to work for. You can advance at your own pace and get certifications through the company. You work rain sleet hail or snow.
good,"at moments it can be very stressful and other times, slow-pace. there are good and bad day like everywhere, but we have more bad than better days. the people there either make it good or bad. its all teamwork and who you get along with."
good,I met some very interesting people with my employment with this company. Some customers I assisted with purchases and auto problems I still keep in touch with and by that happening it shows that I was appreciated by them
good,Great work if you have a great team.. dont expect weekend off really cause those are the busiest days unless you request ahead of time. Make the most of it. You will learn a ton about cars as you go. You dont have to know anything about cars to work there.
good,"They have TVs but a few games wouldn't hurt, something to get our minds off work for a few minutes. Although it does prevent us from getting side tracked and keeps us focused on what's to come during the second half of work."
good,I personally enjoyed working at AutoZone it was a very good experience for me I picked for just under a year before I went into maintenance and I enjoyed my time at maintenance it was very relaxed and easy money and I love working with the people in that department
good,"I came and went when I wanted. No call/No shows. Whatever. I still had a job. If you want to say you have a job, but really don't want to work one....come on down. This is your job."
good,"Autozone great place to work and learn everything about cars,trucks, ect. Meeting new ppl getting to learn them on what they need and to keep them satisfied"
good,This is a great place to work. The management team is awesome and are willing to do anything to help you succeed. The one thing that really gets me about working here is that the pay just doesn't seem to make living really possible in todays economy.
good,"This job is very easy and fluid, most issues rest in staffing and organization. Management is a mix between great managers and not so great. I would place this job high above most entry / beginner jobs. A career does rest in management if one seeks it out."
good,As a part time job they were flexible with my full time job.My manager tried to get me promoted to Assistant Parts Manager as i was once before with the company.
good,"Fun place to work, lots of cooperation among the employees and different departments.  Had fun events and annual conventions for the employees. Stock options were great.  Hated to leave but turnover in upper management changed the overall work culture for the worst."
good,This job is one that will always be needed due to the change of cars and parts. They upgrade cars and technology everyday so they stay update will all the new parts or at least try to and try to mske there parts affordable.
good,A lot of the values and culture were very strict and black and white. There was no room for flexibility. Very up on IT and programs just not very customer friendly.
good,"It was a god job take their time in giving you a raise, i did learn a lot more about cars and got my opportunity to work on some customers vehicles. they hire managers from outside rather than employees already working there."
good,I started working at autozone not knowing anything about cars. Coworkers are very knowledgeable and when I need help they was always able to help me..
good,"Management was great, people communicated (they had to, we worked at the hub store) Workers were nice, work was not over the top, hours and pay were great."
good,"Fast paced, good morale. Not a bad place to work. There is room for advancement in the company. Knowledge of automotive parts is quite the necessity. The team I worked with helped me expand my knowledge immensley"
good,I learn a lot  in industry automobile. Every now a then i have some computer tests online. Every month they do checkout challenge for employee selling a specific product.
good,"Having the opportunity to work for a company as it evolved to one of the top performing retail auto parts chain in the country, has equipped me with multidisciplinary skills required to perform in today's current business climate. Thanks for the opportunity."
good,In my experience with autozone i have learned alot about automotive technology and team work communication needs help through management and coworkers
good,"Stacking rotaries to be ship to different locations pull -orders for brand new orders for customer ,Work begins by clocking in then wait for the paperwork to see what type f orders we was going be pulling"
good,"A typical day, is getting to meet so many customers, and assisting them with auto purchases.  Learning something new each day helping customers resolve their car issues.  Gaining knowledge to help grow within the company, as well as, in my daily life."
good,Overall it is a good place to work you have security and they pay it fair wage. If you enjoy getting hands-on experience with Auto Parts in changing parts out you would really like this job.
good,"Great job if you know about cars.  Very busy & fast paced workplace,  large assortment of tools and varieties of parts as well as other items you never know you might need."
good,good company has flaws but otherwise decent have some things to work on but if they tried just a little bit harder it would have been a complet blast to work for them
good,Autozone is a good job to get your foot in the door of the automotive world. But i had a bad manager and it was super unorganized and nobody cared but me and i couldn't fix everything by myself.
good,"It's a nice first job for a young person, Not stressful but fast paced. Co-workers can be enjoyable at times. but sometimes requires heavy lifting. As a delivery driver I was able to mingle with different ethnicity groups of people, and that was an enjoyable experience."
good,There were days and nights where the pace was slow. Hardly any weekends off. The most enjoyable part about the job was experiencing and learning about vehicles and parts. Greeting and meeting other was fun as well. Inventory was hard every now and then.
good,Customers are great (as far customers can be) and management can be to. My store manager happened to suck but my district and higher management were awesome.
good,"I improved my customer service skills, have a strong team work culture but still it doesn't offer career advancement or a fair pay for the expensive living in Puerto Rico. Would recommend it for someone in college or not willing to have a satisfactory career."
good,"AutoZone did work with me and my schedule for school, however after 3 years of loyal service, I was never promoted the way I felt was necessary nor was the pay after 3 years that extravagant."
good,Ok place to work not bad work environment pay could be better hours are weird and not great  scheduling could be better but not a horrible place to go to work for.
good,I was in store customer service and also parts delivery to commercial garges. I liked it but I was asked to work more hours than what I wanted. They are very strict on drivers and the times it takes them to make a delivery.
good,Offers advancement but very understaffed and would have to follow shifts strictly and a lot of the part-timers would call of which affected the full timers and would have to come in on their day off to cover shifts. We could not give out extra hours only if someone would call off which would open up a shift but part timers could not work over 25 hours or they would get write ups from the district managers if they did not mention to management they would go over 25 hours. Besides that it was fast paced at my store and everyone would learn a lot about customer service and parts knowledge.
good,I was a Parts Sales Manager for AutoZone Inc. and i would definitely recommend this job to anyone who is interested in growing/expanding their career opportunities. I would definitely go back.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at the zone but my only issue was the manager, she was very unfair when it came to scheduling the associates. We were not allowed to switch shifts with other associates, we would get penalized for calling off for whatever reason. Sick hours were not applied even with a doctor note presented, and she was hardly on the sales floor. She was not a team player she had high expectations for everyone else but herself."
good,"Great culture, good opportunities to move up in lower positions."
good,auto zone overall is good place to work at. they have flexible schedules if needed. they have competitive wages with other companies in the industry and offer health benefits for full time employees.
good,"La verdad para ser la empresa que es no me gusta tanto que ellos mismos cambien sus políticas a su conveniencia,buen salario,buenas prestaciones y muy buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,Fast paced work environment with little to no experience. They will train and coach as needed. It takes a long time to move up positions. Only downfall is in order to grow is who you know and not so much as to how hard working you are.
good,"Typical day of work would be open sweep the front of store take out the trash and make sure all the products are in their place. Clean aisles, cash registers and back of store. Check on company vehicles to make sure they do not need any maintenance. I learned how to improvise when to comes to solving customer service problems."
good,Autozone is a great company to work for. They are flexible with hours and time. They have great benefits for full and part time positions. Management is great and the hardest part is putting away product on truck day.
good,"As an AutoZone Store Manager, you take on the role of what many have said is arguably the most difficult position within the company, however; that is not to say that it doesn't also double as a very important learning experience. Often the SM position is referred to as difficult and stressful because of the sheer amount of daily and weekly tasks at hand that you are made in charge of making sure get completed accurately and on time. Managing two departments (Front Store ""DIY"" and Commercial), setting up daily tasks, updating KPI's, scheduling, preforming interviews and hiring, all while keeping up on store profits and loss and overall moral is only an insight on the life of a store manager."
good,I have worked at Autozone for the last six years.  I have been a full time employee for four years.  I would say that the environment is quick paced.  There is opportunity to move up initially but there is no major movement in salary between positions. My employees are respectful and everyone contributes everyday.  The hardest part of my job is being there at 4:30 am.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with the company, I received true satisfaction helping people and excelled quickly until I hit a short ceiling and there are little to no opportunities unless you get your own store but that does not happen often and the annual raises were a joke. I had a really nice, and knowledge manager and Autozone provided alot of online training and great benefits. However,The worst part of the job is being on your feet all day and nowhere to rest your feet, 10 hour days no chairs 4+ years. .15 - .30 cent raise was a insult, and thus the reason for high turnover as is the true managerial challenge; training high school kids who have never changed their own oil how to give car mechanical advise."
good,"Everything was good about this job except the advancement/promotion system. It was never too much work to do , and the managers are nice.  servicing customers was easy with the computers that we used to search information on."
good,What can I say I always wanted to work for autozone now I can say I have. It was fun at times and was only a part time job after my main job but I did enjoy it
good,The culture at Autozone was amazing. They really care about people and always make sure to put the customer first. The company does a really good job in trying to make sure everyone feels welcome and at home.
good,Job has taught me a decent amount about basic car maintenance and repair. Also gave me good retail experience. Most management is good. It's mostly a retail job but with car parts.
good,"Autozone didn't have much to offer in terms of benefits and pay at the entry level, but it was a fun place to work with friendly employees willing to work with just about anyone"
good,Enjoyed what I have done with this Company.  But it I feel that I might not get where I would like to with them. So I thinks it's time to find a Company that I learn from and with as well as growth.
good,It’s a parts store where you are dealing with customers who are dealing with a broken vehicle. Advancement is mostly limited to in store opportunities unless you spend multiple years with the company.
good,"I loved Autozone when i first started however, in the past few months my view changed. My current manager overlooked me as a manager and lied and told me i have to be able to drive to become a manger and that is when i turn 21. I am fully qualified to become a manager and I work beyond what is required of me. He also uses me and only me to distribute truck. and won't let me learn anything else."
good,"meeting new people,learning new skill sets, mutli tasking skills, helping people in need , being praised for a job well done, learning the business and how to run a smooth work place"
good,Could use better pay rate for automotive knowledge and experience. Also willing to work with families who have children and daycare/schooling situations.
good,When I was there I really enjoyed it. I worked with a great team. Great place to learn good customer service skills. They promote you fast if you work hard and do a good job. The only reason I left was I was part time and I needed more hours.
good,"I have learned alot about cars and its only been 5 months.  Fast paced which makes for never boring, team effort as far as recovering store and tasks concern.  Various managers which alternate on the shifts"
good,Not bad  The store manager and other managers could use some training helping them all day because they do not have basic skills or understanding of parts is a little strenuous when you're trying to focus on your job I think both of the old managers have moved on now
good,"Autozone is a great place to work, we try our best to make sure you have everything you need/information to get the job done. Employees are friendly and ready to answer any questions customers have."
good,i worked for AutoZone for 9years and its a good company to work for but you will reach a pay level that will t top out around 15 dollers an hour and thats not bad i just needed more.not to mention there is a lot of stress involved in this job
good,"Awesome place to work once you get everything down pact. A great place to further your knowledge on automotives and to advance your career. Friendly work environment, it can be stressful at times but that comes with working in customer service. The hardest part of the job is probably  dealing with rude or unruly customers and staying professional throughout the process."
good,"Fast pace, fun environment, challenging when it comes to sales and if you don't know much about cars. Sometimes requires more work than what your're being compensated for ."
good,You can have a simple or hard day. Your day can insist of helping customers in the store to changing 10-15 batteries. Culture is good management for most part respectable.
good,"There are plenty of jobs- as there many manager but there are not enough of staff workers. Since this occurs there isn't a lot of time off, but it's great when you need the hours."
good,Autozone is a great place to work with plenty of opportunity for advancement if you work hard and are reliable.  I would recommend Autzone to anyone looking for a good career.
good,Fun place depending on store management. Opportunities for advancement are all over. Great recognition programs boost morale. Poor management is dealt with promptly.
good,"I loved the manager I had during my internship, she taught me a lot and I had a very educational summer. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the 'extra' activities they had for interns"
good,Great company with a challenging client base. My overall experience as a Store Manager has been great! The location I was based at made the day go fast but was very challenging.
good,Autozone was a fun place to work at.  Sometimes challenging. Needs to update computer system. Crashed often. Could offer more training for lower managers so they can move up easier.
good,I loved working for the company. The reason I left was because I broke my foot. I took my medical leave and when I wanted to come back I could never get the regional HR manager to call me back to get it squared away. He was unprofessional and it’s kind of sad.
good,Autozone for me was a job to support myself throughout my learning in college. Typically a work day was not hard work. I've learned many skills whether it be to management and real world business and some great technical skills. The culture is diverse. Someone who knows nothing about vehicles can work there.
good,"The work environment was pretty good. The work load was just enough. Management was pretty good. Hardest part was learning all components of the job. The best aspect of the job was, I learned new skills that I may be able to apply to my next position."
good,"most days are very busy. But a good place to work. Staff is friendly and management is great. The store is in a rough neighborhood though, and sometimes the customers can be very rude."
good,Auto Zone was a fast paced competitive environment which you had to stay with the speed. I believe the job is for people who love cars and my passion is not very strong.
good,"AutoZone is a great company. They offer good benefits and great pay, but you have to be willing to work long hours and multiple successive days to earn higher pay and job responsibility. It's an easy job, you just make the customers happy so that they will be more likely to return and shop at your store. There are tracking metrics which ensures that you are selling as much product as you can and offering the customer what it takes to do the total job. Sometimes it gets a bit stressful, as do all retail jobs, and sometimes the hours are extremely long."
good,"I am truly grateful for the opportunity Autozone gave me when i applied to them.  They are deffinetly top of the line when it comes to the culture at Autozone, starting at the top with there CEO they really do make all aspects of working at Autozone easy and stress free.  The employees are friendly and when in need of help/assisitance with anything all managers were available.  Autozone gave me an opportunity to become a manager an from that I was able to really develop a motivation to make myself better and pursue greater opportunities."
good,This job requires strength and great communication skills. Youll need to carry heavy items and transport goods from one location to another. Requires a lot of learning
good,"My immediate supervisor was excellent.  As you moved further up the management chain, it seemed to degrade.  Overall I liked working there and would probably still be there if I had not moved from the area."
good,I really loved working at Auto zone distribution the hours were great the people were amazing the company does a lot for its employees that are full time
good,"AutoZone was a great place to work, fast paced/ fun job. Was a wonderful job to get me through college. A reason I was not a fan of the job, was the difficultly of advancement."
good,"Job is fast paced, employees are friendly, culture is family like.  hardest part of the job is there is no hard part.  management is excellent and understanding."
good,Customer satisfaction is key. Each day was an different experience dealing with all kinds of customers. Here I learned how to do Planograms. The AutoZone team was a respectable team. I enjoyed working with my fellow coworkers. A team that cared.
good,a typical work day consists of taking care of daily tasks as well as assisting everyone in a timely manor from the second they walk in to when the leave
good,"The  workplace  is  okay,  but  it  is  very  slow.  "
good,This is a great place to work if you know cars and parts. Customers are friendly and staff is like family after a while. Managers are here when you need them.
good,"Good company to work  for - vacation the first year, paid holidays and a point  system for schedule interruptions, fast promotions, clean environment work place."
good,AutoZone was a great work environment. It had a lot of driving going out of town seeing places that you haven't seen and other inciting characteristics. If you never leave your hometown Drive for Autozone.
good,"I genuinely enjoy working at AutoZone. It’s a pretty relaxed environment, though the location I work at can get insanely busy at times which can be stressful. The management is wonderful, coworkers get along pretty well, and everyone seems to know their place. I have heard some pretty crazy stories from former AutoZoners that worked at different locations, so I’m aware not all employees have pleasant experiences. But, as for the store I work at (I won’t say which one, not sure if I could get in trouble for that?), I can promise it’s a great place to work. Only real complaint is that there’s very little room for promotion if you’re under 21, because you cannot drive for Commercial, so you’ll likely only be a part-timer. You’ll also likely come in contact with lots of very unpleasant customers, so if you have trouble keeping your cool, AutoZone might not be the place for you."
good,"Depending on what store you work at, and how fast your co workers are, you could be seeing lines of up to 10 or more people. A high volume store is always busy and requires a ton of clean up. There will always be something to do."
good,Everyday was always a task but not in a bad way. I enjoyed the fact that it was fast pace and always something to do. Even if I wasn't on the road delivering parts I had the option to help walk in customers in the store. My favorite part of the job was knowing I completed the job correctly and in a timely manor. Our commercial accounts cant complete their job unless we do ours correctly and I loved hearing them special request me to deliver their parts because that's a sign that I move fast and completed order accurately.
good,Customer comes first no matter what we were doing. We had to stop and help out customers regardless. Great learning experience for customer interactions.
good,Working with Auto Zone has been fun. I learned so much with some of the ladies that were their. They helped me grow so much and to advance from a zoner to  management in such a few months. I learned everything I could. I learned about different cars and learned how to work on a car. working with auto zone has educated me on what system go with what and what tools are used for whatever job you are doing. I really learned what it takes to do the job right the 1st time. Learning all of those thing have help me also keep my car in  tuned and not let somebody tell me anything because I am a women. If I could go back I would only because I love to work and keeping my people where they need to be in sales and getting our customers in and out
good,Working for Autozone as a manager was great Lotta responsibilities but nothing you can’t handle great work environment a lot of fun working with cars and helping customers at your fullest extent
good,"I learned a lot about car maintenance and what products or parts are best required to do so. There could either be slow days or busy days, very unpredictable. The people I worked with were th best part as I managed to learn much from coworkers and was even able to teach to new ones as well."
good,"Auto zone was a great work atmosphere that taught a young individual like me to get more into cars like I wanted to. I knew basic fundamentals of an oil change and how to keep your car running precisely with certain chemicals. Auto zone not only taught me a lot but taught me patience with impatient customers, gave me a good balance of my outside life and work, it was very professional, but I had left due to personal family reasons."
good,"You can learn a lot about cars if you put in the effort, although most of the time you will be dealing with customers. Eventually you will be able to know car parts and some basic car needs, therefore, it isn't as bad as other retail companies, since you can get a somewhat applicable learning experience to your every day life."
good,"Autozone work required the ability to either communicate with people who may not know what their looking for, may not know what to call it, or have an extreme knowledge and may get frustrated if your on the same level. Finding the right balance, not to mention the right shift balance is key."
good,"You could usually tell what days are going to be busy so its not that much of a surprise. Even though you might get a rush of costumers coming in at one time. This schedule is based on how much your store sold for the week, so needless to say if your going to be lazy I would't recommend it."
good,"Over all this company is a great place to work. I have learned that it is important to monitor inventory  daily , weekly, monthly, and yearly. It is very important that management understand both team and individual goals and duties"
good,i worked at a store in Romulus MI. The staff was great to work with.  They made me fell like family.  I only reason I left was to relocate across the state.  I unfortunately left without notice.
good,Autozone seria un lugar de empleo excelente para alguien que está buscando un trabajo iniciante pero en realidad yo ando buscando un lugar un poco mas familiar que tiene mas oportunidad para avanzar
good,"Good job for a career and a nice place to build your skills. Stays clean and are very safe. The pay and benifits are great, if your with the company. Overall, nice people, good business"
good,Work between 8-11 per day depending on routes. Knowledge of city and surrounding towns. Must be able to deliver parts on time and correct parts to each store on route. Some routes are short to drive some are long. Some routes you need to leave early in the morning.
good,"It wasn't what you knew, but who you knew. started of with high hopes with thoughts of moving up. soon learned that sales an KPI's meant more then employee satisfaction."
good,it was nice working with car parts but just couldn't stand having to cover all the time for employees that never are punished for calling out. I left for a better opportunity.
good,"A very high paced, sales motivated company. Constant work to do, fun environment. District Management style is harsh and even good sales are never good enough, striving to always do better was the goal."
good,"Autozone is a great place to begin your employment career. You are exposed to all kinds of temperaments and people, which helps mold a person in any customer service position."
good,"visitar cartera de clientes"
good,"un dia tipico en el trabajo es hacer apertura, e inmediatamente abrir tienda y atencion al cliente. Aprendi muchisimas cosas en autozone, cosas que ni sabia. La gerencia deja poco que decear, mala administracion, mis compañeros de trabajo no tengo nada que decir excelentes. La parte mas dificil es ignorar los clientes prepotentes y nefastos. Lo que mas me gusto fue que en esa empresa aprendi demasiadas cosas."
good,"A typical day at work at AutoZone would involve installing certain car parts into customer vehicles, ringing up customers, stocking inventory, you must be able to adapt quickly to the pace of business."
good,this is not a bad job if you don't mind working every day of the week day or night I am a manager so I get 40 hours a week or more but it is hard to get two days in a row off unless you are a part time worker
good,Working at Autozone can be VERY fast paced.  Most of the time there are not enough employees in the store to handle the needs of the many customers.  It can become pretty stressful.  The best thing about the company is that they are so willing to work around your every day life schedule.  They have done everything I have ever asked in order to accomodate my schedule.  I am a single dad and my son is still in school.  Autozone has been very graceful in allowing me to work when it is possible and has always made sure that I am off in time to pick my son up.  I highly recommend them as an employer for anyone that has a tight schedule.
good,really enjoyed working there. Everyone seems to get along. Only down side would be the lack of pay.  Can be very educational and they very far when needing time off
good,"the job offered advancement and i found it to be very educational. there are many resources available to the customer, so that they may more efficiently and cost effectively fix their vehicles."
good,"Working for this company as a counter sales person was mediocre at best. I enjoyed my interaction with the customers and my interaction with my store manager and some of my co-workers. However, the pay standard was certainly sub-par"
good,"i get in my car after an inspection. log what needs to be logged. drive to hub destination (roughly 3 hours). drop delivery, get signatures, and drive back."
good,"A typical day is pretty easy, stress free, one can learn about vehicles, management is understanding, hardest part is when a customer has a part one doesn't easily recognize, and I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers."
good,"The typical work day started out with a shift meeting to give each employee their sales goal for the day. Next, company training programs were reviewed and checked to make sure each person was up to date for their company training."
good,"I enjoyed my time at AutoZone, but it is not, in my opinion, a job you can support yourself on for the long term. I worked a lot of hours, but did not make enough to really earn a living."
good,Autozone is grey when it comes to balancing your work life and your home life but the pay is terrible. Advancements are easy but once you've reached the management spectrum there's not much room to grow.
good,I work with commercial accounts selling parts and everyday is a learning experience. I answer phones and also take orders online from some customers. It gets very hectic and I multi task well. Autozone has a very diverse work culture. The hardest part of my job is advancement is hard to come by. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I have taken care of my customers to the best of my ability. I love and appreciate that my customers are very loyal to me.
good,"this company is great to work for and I recommend it for anyone looking to get into automotive retail. Easy to follow policies, flexible scheduling, and a small store environment"
good,I really enjoyed working there. I would have stayed on if I was offered a full time position and more than minimum wage. My co-workers and manager were easy to get along with.
good,Its a good part time job for people seeking to gain experience in the automotive industry. At a store level you are treated like family but at a company you are just a number.
good,Willing to learn more about the company but ot is very difficult to move up in this company.. Must remain humble and have great customer service even when customers get rude and belligerent
good,Autozone is a typical retailer. Not a very hard job but very little chance for advancement. Pay is ok and work schedule is a little unpredictiable. Still would rate three star
good,"My job was to make the schedule,  open and close the store.and do daily inventory. I usually would have 2/3 associates that worked under me. Also do deposits and signage change."
good,with this job I learned how to be part of a company where I could grow. Not just myself but also with others. I learned about being a leader and how I can lead others.
good,Day to day interactions make the job enjoyable. Job could use incentives for productivity such as commissions or bonuses for goal meeting performance.
good,"If you are willing to put your best foot forward and do what it takes to help the customer, you will go far. Just don't expect them to have your back vs a customer. If a customer complains, even if it is unreasonable, management will side with the person complaining. Even to the extent that they fire you without just cause."
good,"fast paced and stress full"
good,"good place to work with an hour lunch every day, all work employees get along very well, and work together as a team. every day is different to customer flow, which makes it interesting ."
good,Enjoyable workplace. Great way to increase automotive knowledge and people skills. Not too much room for advancement. Somewhat flexible schedule with decent shifts.
good,"depends on if you're in a busy store or a slow one. Too many policies for a large company. Management doesn't appreciate people in lower positions, expects too much out of small stores."
good,"Poor store management in some cases, good atmosphere, decent money, good discount + extra discount weekends. Overall great company to work for with decent advancement opportunities"
good,"Work varied day to day due to customers. Never had the same day.  As a Part Sales Manager, experiencing customer service and satisfying customers was the biggest reward."
good,"I've worked at Auto Zone in two states and by far the one in Ohio was much better. Better management, better team. When i came down to San Antonio, I had a manager that didn't know how to do his job efficiently and tasked me with most all of the other tasks that the other Parts Sales Managers could have been divvied with. This is what broke my ties with this company."
good,Always a good place to work.never had an issue with things there just changed location and needed a closer job. Would recommend to car savvy people that like working with hands
good,"Autozone allowed me to grow in many ways and learn to do things that I was not able to before working there. I advanced my way from just a part time sales associate to Parts Sales Manager within six months of working there due to altering and resetting another store located in Harrisonburg, VA. Our corporate office set a limit of eight weeks for my team to complete this and we completed it in six weeks. Even though I loved working for Autozone I decided it was no longer for me as I am a single parent and the hours are demanding."
good,I had a very flexible schedule. My teammates were always very helpful. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of this position. This is a very fast paced environment.
good,"The hardest part about this job was the customers. And I had a horrible moment happen while there that changed my perspective on the job and location. Besides that, I enjoyed learning about cars and the best products to keep vehicles clean and running good."
good,Managing a store is a fun job to do because you basically are running your own business in a way. You are always competing against your last year sales numbers and keeping your store stocked with all the parts so you don't have customers living empty handed because ran out of something.
good,Aprendi mucho sobre la atención al cliente y venta
good,"full time employees have reasonably good job security, part timers are promised a number of hours a week just to see those hours cut drastically in time."
good,"this place was one of my favorites to work at I learned a lot abount managing and multi tasking , inventory and scheduling. the hours were flexible and the shifts not super long."
good,The hours and says wasn't good wasn't enugh work but over all it was a great experience. I learned a lot about cars that I didn't before and I enjoyed my crew
good,"Auto zone is a fast paced work environment where customers are put first. It was a fun place to work, great people. Management gets it."
good,"Great place to work from beginners to experienced parts retailers."
good,Although I didn't really like the storefront atmosphere of sales it really wasn't for me but with my mechanic background as well it made it easy to work at AutoZone
good,"The work is physically demanding, but it's fun work. You have to push yourself to keep up your production level. Your production is monitored closely and is quantified. As long as your production is high and you have a good attitude, this is a great job."
good,"A typical day at work usually includes handling customers and answering phones. I generally deal with customer questions about our inventory and minor repairs to their vehicles. "
good,"The job is very easy but it doesn't pay as much as other retailers. They do a good job with training, sales, and with ability to promote with in."
good,"I cleaned everyday and worked with a lot of customers. I answered phones and helped them with their cars, changed wipers and light bulbs, organized the store and worked with the registers ,ect.."
good,"I loved being around all the different parts, learning them and researching them. The area I worked in was a small town so almost everyone were regulars which made it more difficult to up sale but made for more pleasant encounters. The computer systems were easy to learn, and there were so many educational opportunities."
good,"I was the driver for this company. I delivered auto parts"
good,"you are required to have completely open availability in order to receive full time hours, I have to have full time in order to afford bills but am closing the store 5 nights a week until 10pm and takes time away from my family."
good,It is a place that you can go to work and not wishing You we re home instead and you learn something new  everyday. The people that work there aré all nice people who aré willing to help at anytime .
good,AutoZone was a great place to work. I cant say anything bad about it; they've helped me learn a great deal from cars to business. the team is positive and very knowledgeable. if you want a good work place go to AutoZone.
good,I have a passion for cars so I enjoyed working at AutoZone and learned a lot about cars. Co- workers was helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customer faces when we supplied them the parts to get their car working.
good,"I love working for AutoZone. The pay isn't to great but it's a great company to work for. Paid Vacation after 6 months, benefits, and paid holidays."
good,"very organized, well complete environment . satisfying work place setting. good commendable scheduling. Just have it days."
good,While working for Autozone I learned a little bit about cars. My managers where all pretty nice and understanding. Anytime I had a question they were always there to help.
good,"It was a great experience working there while it lasted, the coworkers were great. The job was easy but at the same time challenging.  I learned the names of many auto parts and how to diy on many jobs."
good,I work almost 6 day of the week more then 10 hours. I learn to be helpful in other department and driving different equipment as well. The member of management they thing only on them not for the employ. Something i don`t receive any help from my co-workers and is hard cause am working with car part
good,"Para la empresa es muy importante la atencion al cliente, se esmera por tener al empleado bien preparado, puedes lograr subir de puesto si tu lo deseas a base de esfuerzo"
good,Great place to work. Lots of hard work! Good Management. Good on recognition for hard workers. I love to help others keep their cars up and running.
good,"great atompsoeher little no management, many people that work at this job don't last long every day is a challenge to assure complete satisfaction"
good,"Hours would vary from, 5am to 10pm. Clock in, address online orders, store setup, unload freight, stock merchandise, in between each duty also assisting customers, located parts, diagnose vehicles issues. Custodial duties during closing shift, counting register and cash drops."
good,"AutoZone was a pretty decent place to work, but the management could have been a little bit better. Gave big bonuses to managers, for associates work, but no compensations to associate workers."
good,"An interesting place to work. Customers from day to day range from exciting, to predictable. You must be on your toes, and ready with a smile, and an understanding that most people don't want to be spending money to repair their car."
good,"Fast paced and friendly, with many opportunities to learn basic mechanics and electrical systems, while providing excellent customer service. Hands on work under the hood installing batteries, headlights etc. Management is friendly and easily works around your schedule."
good,"A normal work day is 10 to 14 hours long with a hour break somewhere in there. I have learned how to handle upset and sometimes hostile customers by finding middle ground, also the problem solving skills I have learned here has become better with mechanical and social problems that you normally wouldn't see. Management is good in the way that they will make the drive to push you harder to make better results with less people. But sometimes they go a little to far. The hardest part of the job that is frustrating is the hour drive one way added to the long day of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you help someone and it changes their whole day for the better."
good,"I learned sales, different form of customer relations. I enjoyed being a commercial driver, wish I could have been made a full time commercial driver."
good,Each day there are new challenges to overcome which keeps the mind keen on having backup solutions for obstacles as they occur.
good,"Working with Auto Zone taught me alot, from communicating skills to dealing with customers the right way and also everything about cars. I was the youngest employee and all my coworkers loved me."
good,"It was always a new adventure every day at AZ. Great staff, awesome customers and very flexible scheduling.I'd recommend it to anyone that whats to get into the automobile industry. Its a great learning tool for beginning techs."
good,autozone was a decent work place. it was faced paced and was consistantly busy. i learned quite a bit about vehicles without ever being a mechanic. i liked the environment and built relationships with lots of customers
good,"Always have a friendly staff. The upper management cares and listens, have full control and tools you need take care of the customers"
good,Busy place.  good discounts on parts.  you can learn enough about cars to be helpful. putting up truck is hard on your knees. overall not a bad job.
good,"Extremely aggressive in controlling payroll."
good,I have no bad review for this job I left in regrads of no reciving enough hours. But other then that I would`ve enjoyed staying there.
good,Productive and enjoyable work environment with friendly co-workers. Many tasks given throughout each shift must be completed before shift end.
good,this was a fun job especially since im into cars. the hours were ok but they varied week to week. Management was very knowledgeable about the products. My coworkers were the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Can be a busy and hectic place to work, but on slow days mostly task work. Seems to mostly be about numbers and sales in upper management. At store level: as long as informing customers of what they need and offer extras no issues. Co-workers are awesome, can joke around and work well together."
good,A good foundation for beginning employees in a fast paced retail business. Inventory control was considered very important as well as keeping showroom organized and presentable. Management was responsible and polite. I encouraged management to provide advanced training to employees as most were first time employment.     Hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying customer needs.
good,"Assisting customers with finding parts and, trouble shooting problems with their vehicles and checking them out at a register."
good,"The job was not hard, but it was indeed tedious and needed to be taken seriously. There were many things to be discovered about different vehicles and the customers were usually very respectful."
good,So far the only thing that I don't care for about this job is the wage. Everything else is great. I get to learn new things and help people troubleshoot their problems.
good,"good place to work, management could use lots of improvement, learned that working with real young people is very challenging getting them to show up to work on time and everyday to be responsible is a tough job."
good,"Autozone was one of my favorite employers due to my love of automobiles.  I worked with a wonderful group of co-workers and the management team was great also.  Unfortunately, the compensation wasn't very competitive."
good,The company is great place to learn about auto parts.Working here I have learned a great deal of customers service and automobile parts.
good,"Auto Zone is a great place to work. Only working part time, they understand my need to little hours. There are many things there to keep you busy from stocking and facing shelves. Help customers over the phone or in store. You get to text batteries, starters, and alternators. Also getting to install the batteries or wiper blades, or even light bulbs, you get great satisfaction from a thankful customer. My co workers are very helpful and my management is always looking for further ways to insure we get the knowledge we need to completely help the customer. My most enjoyable aspect of the job is helping someone who came in nervous and left feeling confident. The worse part is the mean customers that cant give proper information about their vehicle to help me finish finding what they need. Many people mistake Auto Zone employees for master mechanics."
good,I enjoyed the environment and the people I worked with on a daily basis. Even though I had a small background in Automotive I knew the basics and continued to learn on site. They were very accommodating and friendly with answering any job related questions I had. I learned so much from other workers who gave me some great tips.
good,"Good company, ability to advance from within, and plenty of job security. However, long hours with above average stress levels. Hard to balance family life with this career. work with customers to determine what was needed to complete repairs on the vehicle. Recommending parts and or tools that will make the job at hand easier."
good,i worked here during high school and it was a fun environment. I did learn alot about different car parts. over all i enjoyed it very much
good,"Assisting customers with purchases."
good,Abilities test is required for employment; this is a great gauging tool in a service business.  Management works with the staff for scheduling to help alleviate timing conflicts.  Great part time job.  I have utilized customer service/resolution conflict skills to help customers.
good,"A typical day at work consist of installing and removing batteries, headlights, and check engine lights. management is well educated and the co works are great."
good,"A regular day would consist of typical retail duties such as stocking shelves, cleaning the store, attending to customers and sometimes their vehicles, and refilling displays."
good,"Nice place to work, pay is okay for retail sales and management is a bit shaky.  If you like customer interaction and a good team culture AutoZone is your place.  The hours stink but hey it's retail!"
good,"everything is taken serious, make 1 mistake and have others yelling and jumping down your throat. when others are assigned jobs, and they dont do it or not able to get it finished it gets blamed on someone else that wasnt involved with the assigned task."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of cleaning up the store, helping customers and making deliveries to commercial accounts. I have learned quite a lot while working here, including diagnosis of batteries and other engine management techniques. While using our computers, I have also learned names and descriptions of parts I have never known about before. As far as management goes, it was very well when I first started working there. But as our staff changed in and out, the store was getting poor in terms of management. Things were not as well kept, and the store started slowly looking worse. My coworkers are very friendly, and enjoyable to work with. The concept I struggled with the most would be learning all the parts and expanding on them. This relates to the most enjoyable part of my job, which would be having more knowledge after studying the parts."
good,I was the Store Manager so I was able to control things my way and that's being very productive
good,"Its a place where customer satisfaction is the main goal."
good,Autozone is a great company to work for in a retail environment. There is a lack of advancement unless you are willing to relocate and the pay is typical for a retail job. Store Manager pay is below  market average though.
good,Stocking the products and making sure that the customers questions were answered according to their needs. Translating for Hispanic customers.
good,"-Typical work day consisted of working the parts counter, walking to the many customers vehicle to diagnose a problem, incessant phone calls, ordering parts, pulling parts, checking overstock, planogramming, end of day store cleaning, and fronting a facing."
good,"Between the pushing of suggested sales, and the requirement to wear slacks in an environment that deals with corrosive battery acid, it's a job that pays, but that's about it."
good,"Great company and good people to work for.Good working enviroment and very people friendly,"
good,"Daily activites included store operations, inventory management, and providing excellent customer service. Most difficult part of the job was the installs required for certain headlights, wipers, and batteries. Was a mid level manager that held a store key, combination to the safe, brinks pick-ups, and recieving of inventory from distribution center. Worked well as a team, and was able to direct other team members in order to run a successful store. Most enjoyable part of the job was my abilty to help and provide good customer service for those in need."
good,"The company is a great place to work, however they need to treat their employees better."
good,"Great people in the Shamokin Dam store."
good,excelente institución y se aprende mucho y muy buenos lideres lo malo que los contratos no son por tiempo indefinido
good,"Good days mostly, some rough days"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and came in contact on a daily basis. The physical work was fun and I enjoyed keeping a close eye on details. My store manager was a really nice and fair man. He cared about his employees well being. He worked with each employee on their needs and wants. When I was interviewed, I was told it was a high likely hood of reaching full time hours. I never became full time. I also then started delivering and was told I'd become a full time driver, which never happened. Only part that really upset me. I was very good at my job. I was very friendly and knew exactly how to make someone smile. I went into the company with very little knowledge and blossomed. I learn quick, I'm detail oriented, and know how to keep my game face on under pressure."
good,"I have many different types of days, try my hardest to make every customer leave 100 percent satisfied. When I am able to do this I feel great about my job and when I cant that is when the job is the hardest"
good,Its a great place to work!!! Always something to do and oversee. Never a Dull moment.
good,It was a very nice place to work. Staff was nice businesses were nice everyone was nice.
good,"People i worked with i miss and the job is fairly easy though to say any day was paticularly easy or without a learning experice would truely be a untrue statement. I learned alot about cars and their care from that store. I would say my managers were good people and that they were productitive. hardest part i think was sometimes the "
good,AutoZone is great job to have because of management. They really care about the employees which is important. I believe if your employees are happy then your company will be in great hands. The only thing is that I am part time and no place to grow in the company. I like to be challenged and able to grow higher up in a company that I work for. But I am truly grateful for the knowledge I have learned with this company.
good,I'd see if there were orders to be delivered and pull orders and deliver orders. I learned how to read planograms. Management was readily available.Co workers were team oriented as well as independent workers.The hardest part of the job was not being able to locate a part a customer requested.The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees treated each other like family.
good,The Job was great.  After more than a decade in the retail environment i learned a lot.  Dealing with different customer situation to how to look for those new recruits to join our team.
good,"take commercial calls, pull parts, dispatch drivers"
good,"As a Delivery Truck Driver:"
good,"a typical day at this job was go towork by 6 am open the store run the day before's numbers, double check schedualing, adjust as needed, prepare for the day,run hr management for store, submit all sales and invintory to headquarters, send orders needed to coorperate, ship  merchendise and recieve shipments, recieve comercial and retail merchendise and schedual shipments as needed."
good,"•	In charge of meeting weekly sales objectives "
good,"A typical day is hard work everyday"
good,"AutoZone is a great company that is very solid in their financial position.  They have been #1 in the industry for many years and continually work to innovate their product and marketing strategies to remain in #1 position.  Their benefits are great with about 70-80% of health and dental paid by AutoZone depending on which plan is selected."
good,"I started at AutoZone with a limited knowledge of a parts store. But I have learned so much more in my role as the Assistant Store Manager. I have learned about shrink, and how lowering shrink ( merchandise) increases profits. I have been taught  and have done cycle counts and inventory matrix's and how those two inventory standards keep more products on the shelves and increases sales. I have been taught how to use overstock and how to move overstock from its location to the sales floor. I have learned so much working with this company that it can be one of those things in my life that I can say will help me get to the next level in my career. My manager has challenged me in ways that builds my confidence and expanded my knowledge in general and rewards me for my efforts. She gives me assignments, coaches and monitors my progress with passion and concern. My manger is truly interested in my success. This kind of leadership has allowed my to grow and to be confident in my role as captain , coach and co-leader of our location.

good,A typical day would usually require me to drive most of the day helping clients get their automobile parts.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the clients.
good,"•	Ensure adherence to policies and procedures. "
good,"Great company for a part time job, outgoing people and great management"
good,Usually I work a 5-8 hour shift. I learned how to work on some vehicles and about regular vehicle maintenance. I enjoyed working with the management and co-workers. A great atmosphere and great people and company to work with. The best part about my job was the people and customers I worked with.
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo es con el seguimiento a metas y objetivos previamente establecidas por el Director regional, aportación de mejoras para el proceso y logro de objetivos, generar  estrategias para el aprovechamiento de la amiba de clientes, revisión y seguimiento a procesos, motivación al equipo de trabajo, mantenimiento y estandarización a tiendas."
good,"This is a fair place to work, it keeps the bills paid, however you will never get rich there."
good,"Day to day operations usually went pretty smooth, the shifts ran with little to no difficulty and most everyone got along and enjoyed each other's company."
good,"keep customers satisfied, very easy to where the computer really tells you everything you need to know to obtain a part for the customer, nice managment."
good,"At Autozone, I engaged in my pursuit towards auto mechanics. While working I gained knowledge of the consumers as well as the parts in a variety of repair issues. As I stood out as a hard worker, I was given the opportunity to advance with the company. With managing Autozone, I soon came to see each employee has the own role as a team member. As a manager, I had to fill in for any others that couldn't play their part. Throughout it all, Helping a distressed customer always made my day worth being present."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Auto Zone. The crew I worked with was great! We all got along and had fun together.
good,typical day was managing the store. Learned how to run a store. Great boss and good co-workers for the most part I was a clean-up manager so I ran five different stores. The hardest part of my job was going in cleaning them up and the enjoyable part was the end resaults.
good,Almost always something to do; learned a lot about vehicles and parts. Coworkers became like another family.
good,Fun and good management team. I worked in setting up the commerical department. Keyholder...
good,I do not have a review for this employer......................Not applicable.
good,"working for autozone is perhaps the most fun job I have ever had. I enjoyed my fellow employees and the workplace. It's also a nationwide, secure company to work for.. I picked parts for the area stores from the HUB (warehouse), unloaded trucks and answered inventory inquiries. Occasionally I was able to work up front with the public and I love customer service and making people's day when we had the part they needed. Management... They promote from within and while I liked my managers personally, I don't feel they did their job as well as they could have. They were more concerned about their bonuses than jumping in and helping. I also had a young manager that got power hungry and had very few people skills. He also played favorites- not good. I was not trained following company procedure and I felt it hindered my over all job performance"
good,"I learned great customer service skills and a lot about cars. my coworkes were a lot of fun to work with. I had a lot of expirience with diffrent jobs around the store, such as the register, inventory, testing batteries etc"
good,"un dia comun y corriente llego antes de la hora de trabajo checo mi unidad preparo mis flyers para los clientes cargo mi venta de impulso ,hablo por telefono a los clientessi necesitan algo de material salgo a entregas ago labor de venta de los productos que tengo en la venta de impulso entrego folletos regreso ala empresa abolver allamar aclientes si es que antes otro cliente pidio algo de material para llevar a su negocio asi sucesibamente hasta la hora de comida, despues lo mismo hasta la hora de salida no hantes si hay algo que acomodar en los estantes."
good,Every shift started with a meeting while everyone stretched out to reduce the risk of pulling a muscle.
good,"Everyday was different. There were days when i opened and days that I closed, but everyday was an adventure. I really learned how to manage people at AutoZone. I learned how to deal with issues between co-workers as well as problems that customers would come in with."
good,"At Autozone I was allowed to expand my horizons into Training and the Human Rescources side of the business and became fairly proficient at presentations. I was allowed to implement a regional, manager training program, that was in place for 3 years in the San Diego Region. The program was not picked up by the Corporation and We were instructed to only utilize the Corporate program. The results were great at the Regional level, we had 75 manager designates and actually promoted 40 into the manager role through 3 years. In addition, I was a District Manager for up to 15 locations and worked for some really great supervisors. There was not typical day because each day was a new adventure in people development. The hardest part of the job is letting go of the good people that you develop to other Districts but that is what keeps the Region strong so being a true team player, I was in."
good,"great place to work, hours, easy to move up in company if work hard"
good,"Open and close store when manager was not present, this included reconciling cash registers, process deposits and nightly books. Assist customers with automotive needs, either with products in the store and or order availability. Deal with customer complaints and returns. Re-arrange product placement within store when directed by corporate. Assist Manager in seeking new ways to increase sales."
good,"It was fun visiting customers, seeing what was there needs were,How I can make things better."
good,"A regular day consist of the regulars coming thru going out to fix a windshield wiper blade or two and just taking in the scene. I learned alot about cars and how the work as well as hands on experience with differnt small jobs. My managers were great I had alot of fun with them. The hardest part of the job was nothing, the most enjoyable part was helping customers out at their car."
good,I like Auto zone they are OK to work for they don't rely on my expertise And knowledge of there employees no room for advancement.
good,Good manager and co-workers at my location. Pay is decent if you can get full time. It’s not a long term job more of a secondary income or stepping stone type job but not a bad choice for people who can handle retail and know much about cars
good,"You'll be treated fairly amongst your peers. Won't make a fortune in pay, but you're definitely going to learn something new about the automotive industry"
good,Good place to work if you like to move up eventually.if you get lucky enough to get started at a higher position then you’re lucky. They do work pretty well with your schedule.
good,I was always told that I went into to much detail trying to help the customers.  Other employees told me that I went out of the way to much to help the customer.
good,"Autozone is great, fun, and a great place to work. The managers are knowledgeable. Upper management is very hands on which makes for smooth transitions for beginners"
good,Great company to work for just not happy with health insurance costs going up and coverage going down. They need to offer more money to their entry level employees so they can be more competitive and retain their help.
good,"As a driver, we are judged largely by our driving skills and timeliness. The road requirements are strict, and do not really reflect a lot of the real-world circumstances that occur during the everyday driving. If you get behind at any point in your schedule, it is nearly impossible to make up that time and stay within the expected guidelines. As for managers, some are very positive and helpful, while others seem a bit heavy-handed, rude and unprofessional at times. While the pay NEEDS to be improved for the average driver, with that one exception, it is an excellent job."
good,Fue muy facil de poder acoplarse al equipo de trabajo. La administracion trata a sus trabajadores como personas y por eso es facil de llegar dia tras dia. Tambien pude accender a otras areas en la misma compañia al momento que discubrieron mis talentos para otras areas. Lo unico que me hizo seguir avanzando a otro distino laboral fue que la barrera que encontre que el salario.
good,Its a good job to start a career in the automotive industry. Benefits are applicable for full-timers. You will expand your knowledge in automotive parts.
good,"Constant customer interaction "
good,"It’s a good company changing out batteries, there’s good workers that treats you like family , I learned things everyday, the hardest part is the rude customers there is a lot of rude customers but I’ve learned they are dealing with problems on their cars"
good,Pay is low and work hours are high. Always short staffed. Work is easy but need to have patience for customers who don't know what they drive or the name of parts needed.
good,"The main part of the job is assisting customers. A lot of multitasking is required to perform this job. My tasks included doing store planograms, setting up employee schedules, opening the store, closing the store and counting all the money in the registers and safe. "
good,If you like cars and would like to learn more about them then this is for you. If you cant deal with people or if your a slacker you wont do well here. My managers were very supportive always there when I needed.
good,"Very relaxed place to work with great team work."
good,Working at AutoZone has helped me improve my customer service skills and helped improve my knowledge on Automotive Technology and Parts. Definitely would recommend this to someone looking for a fast paced environment and a great stepping stone into the Automotive workplace!!!!
good,"es buen lugar para trabajar, en su momento el gerente que estuvo a mi mando nos dio la oportunidad de poder crecer, y tener mas conocimiento en refacciones."
good,"even tho this store had some minor issues, it was a great place to work. made plenty of friends, enjoyed the customer interaction. working there will keep you busy"
good,It is a good company to work for it can be stressful at times but that will help an individual succeed. Work hours vary due to sales but pay and advance meant are fair for each area
good,"Working for Auto Zone helped my management skills grow for my future career. They enjoy days working together, try to focus and stay focused on that days goals."
good,Typical day to day was manning the cashier and doing clean up at night. Laid back job with the right managers. Learned a lot from both the customers and management on mechanical work.
good,"I just started with AZ back in May."
good,"Great job to work at. Good benefits in great opportunities however advancement was a little slow. Good work environment, great training good teamwork, and good opportunities to expand your knowledge."
good,"AutoZone is a good place to work, if you are willing to be a self-starter, ask questions, b a team player, and not assume that you know everything there is to know about vehicles. The stores vary from area to area some are always busy, some are not. As in every place of business, there will be some managers that you can and can't work with, no matter how hard you try."
good,"Great work environment, great team members, provides excellent tools for advancement, great classes, diverse environment, however career advancement is slow."
good,Schedule varied week to week.  Money weekend and week night scheduling.  Very face paced and very physically demanding.  I enjoy my co-workers.  Hardest part of the job is the physical demands.
good,Good place to work however pay does not match work expectations. Store Managers routinely work more than 50 hours a week many times having to work 6 or 7 days a week. Good benefits package however pay is on the low side.
good,working here I gained a lot of automotive knowledge and sales experience. Management was good but the down fall was dealing with terrible customers. Some of the worst people on earth shopped at the autozone I worked at.
good,AutoZone is a great company to sharpen your skills and expand your skills. I came in with previous management experience and was quicky promoted to Part Sales Manager. I'm working on moving up as we speak.
good,"Is a fun job with rapid advancement for those interested and willing to come to work. If you desire to succeed and are willing to work, skys the limit."
good,very easy going job. doesn't pay very well for the amount of work required for the job. many competitors pay at least $2 more an hour and most food-industry pays even more. job is okay. really easy once you learn the system and where parts are in the store. most people that come in are very friendly and appreciative of the help you give but there always is the few a-holes that come in too. that just retail though
good,During the time I’ve been working for this company I’ve learned so much about auto parts and have had the opportunity to work with an amazing staff. However I personally believe that this is an entry level job and not as challenging as I would like.
good,"I was a commercial driver for the store delivering parts to dealers shops, muffler shops, Mechanics shops, Tire shops and more. And some time i have to be a cashier, be a customer service, and o sales, and do other jobs in the store"
good,It depend on the location of store some are fast pace others are slow . if you like dealing with people . great learning experience. You will learn about every part on a car
good,"Enjoyed my family at AutoZone. Trreated you well, but lacked in compensation. There were many opportunities to advance! They offer good benefits that you would expect from a major corporation."
good,I liked working at autozone. It’s a good place to work if u want to pursue your career. You can learn a lot about auto parts. There’s a lot of things I didn’t know and I learned.
good,typical day  was prepping for opening stocking helping customers. Management was cool and friendly. hardest part was dead hours. most enjoyable was the freedom you got
good,"Fast pace environment but a fun place to work at. Sometimes it can be stressful, other days kind of chill depending on the day. Get to meet a variety of different people/customers. Some you will Love some you wont."
good,"Love the job, struggle with the pay.   I love helping people get what they need for their vehicles repair or maintenance.  Workplace culture at our store is good.   A good extra job is needing something extra, hard to do as a FT making a primary job.   Open 7 days a week and on most holidays, great for customers, not so great for those who do not get the time to spend it with family."
good,Great company to  work for 50 hrs per week.   Hard to find workers willing to be committed but great team environment.  Management takes the majority of job responsibilities.
good,I loved my managers and the people. I don't know how it would be in any other Auto Zone. The environment was pretty much either super slow or super high paced.
good,Some of the Managment is very poor and doesn't do their part to help out. The communication can be better. Upper management needs some work too. Some of the people I work with are great.
good,"It is indeed a great place to work, especially if you are a motor head and have the drive and willingness to help others with the same passion. I do wish my newest manager would have communicated more with what he needed done in our store."
good,I absolutely love the managers I have worked for.  I broke my ankle and was not able to work for 6 months but I went to work every month for a test to keep me on the schedule.  I did deliver parts but I talk too much and that has stopped delivering.  I was told that when a kid that was in college and I was not delivering anymore that I was only going to work one to two days a week. This is fine for me because my husband has a great high paying job. I just texted my boss about how I got another job but I want to stay on the schedule one to two shifts a week to be able to keep my discount of 20 %.  I admit they do not pay very good for as hard as I work. This is why I found another job.
good,"I learned a lot in this company. I learned how to do recalls, planograms, inventory, schedules, management and many other things. I appreciate everything the company has done for me."
good,"Autozone is an okay place to work, Hard to get Full time unless it is for commercial drivers, otherwise you need to work at least a year before getting promoted to a shift manager."
good,The work at Autozone was fun. You got to mingle and meet with customers and help figure solutions to their problems. It can be very rewarding in the fact that you help people with one of their basic needs of transportation
good,"Great Company to work for but the Multitasking ~  Positions are most stressful on you!!  "
good,I personally liked the autozone culture a lot. But honestly the management cares way to much about meeting sales and often jeopardize the state of the store over it.
good,Did matrix once a week. Put away stock shipment every week. WITTDTJR (what it takes to do the job right) selling points. Training new employees about selling points and the software.
good,Auto zone was a wonderful place to work. the people were friendly and the driving from place to place was the best job ever. Only downside there wasnt a lunch break.
good,It helped get me by each week. I wanted to do something that I loved and it was Auto Zone so I went back to school. The people that came in there would tell me how to do my job which is something that I do not like.
good,I liked working at Auto Zone my position gave me the chance to help customers and do other management tasks. the retail schedule sucks but that's any retail job. the higher ups seem like they would higher off the streets for less money than promote someone that is worthy of the position for more money.
good,"Other than the typical headaches of customer service, I don't have much bad to say about AutoZone. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. It's a nice place to work if you're a student and need some spending money."
good,"I worked for AZ seven years ago and remember that it was pleasant going to work every day."
good,"During my current time apart of the Autozone team I realized how to adapt to fast-paced environment. The amount of customers would range from 150 - maybe 250 a day depending which day of the week it is. Finally, the team chemistry is great."
good,"With any retail position, you can count on 50 plus hours a week..sometimes 6-7 days a week.  Salary is below the industry standard for Management. Raises are up to 3% annually."
good,The company definitely puts customer satisfaction above anything else. Once you hit a full time position you will enjoy working for the company but they do prefer to hire mainly part time employees
good,If I had to work here again. I might give it another shoot. I didnt care about some of how my old co workers did things but thats just how they are i guess.
good,Maintain orders to customers. Offer price matches and bargaining with customers for repeat sales. Also delivering parts & taking returns for our customers. Get to meet a lot of people and businesses.
good,"It’s like any other big corporations, management was good overall but the business has many weak points that can make them difficult to work for at times"
good,this job was a learning experience taught me a lot of customer service skills how to create situations to meet company goals and how to run a store as a manager
good,I have a great time working for Auto Zone i began to bond with the regular customers and learned even more about car parts than I thought that I knew.
good,"As a commercial driver, my typical day begins with getting the vehicles ready and then I start delivering orders. However, because I have a strong work ethic, I also assist with plan-o-grams and other projects. "
good,"pace changed regularly, slow to slammed, great to help customers troubleshoot car problems, total vertical slice of humanity of customers, from skilled to novice"
good,"I enjoyed working with Autozone, despite the compensation not being at an acceptable level to be able to support ones self. If you just need some spending cash, i would say its an alright place to work."
good,"Good place to work, pay is Fair. Stores are always kept clean customers are always taking care of promptly. Always have the opportunity to move up within the company."
good,Working at AutoZone nothing special. For me it was kind of a regular part time job that I just went and did every day. It's nice to be able to help people with their car troubles and the work environment is pleasant.
good,AutoZone was a great place to work at time was sometimes flexible  working there was awesome  because  The coworkers will help you in anything you need
good,"Was a really good place to work. I would still be working there if I didn't have problems at home that needed my immediate attention."
good,"Okay job if youre interested you can learn alot about motor vehicles and will improve your social skill as you have to interact many type of people. Your problem solving skill will sharpen because people come in with different problems you have to pin point and find solution for them. you will learn communicate with people who do not speak he same language as you and you wiol learn patience through dealing with frustrated customers,"
good,it was a good place to work i received lots of training. i started that job and learned so much about customer service and the people there were great. it was just starting point and found something better a few months later.
good,This was not a bad place to work. At the time i was much younger and the money was good for that point in my life. If I had to live off the salary now it would not be practical. Overall enjoyed the job.
good,"Autozone is great place to work, more so if your a car person. The culture in most stores is a loose enjoyable environment. autozone is place where you can learn something new everyday whether it is by employees,  or customers."
good,For the most part AutoZone is a nice place to work. Only downfall is advancement in the area of Commercial sales/driver in this area.  The rules seem to change everytime the subject comes up to the regional manager.
good,"A fortune 500 company and is well managed from top to store level"
good,At autozone it was a good place to work. Each day was pretty busy working with customers getting to know people. There was plenty to do. The management was good in training and operation there. Other employees were great on helping in training and got along with everyone. The only problem I had was stocking inventory. It was bothering my back. Which I had a disability. But they tried working with neon that issue. Which I was sorry to leave do to complications with my back injury.
good,buen ambiente laboral donde aprendes todo sobre refacciones para vehículos.
good,"Good job experience, but needs to be more relaxed and focused on employees. Management is good about customer service and profit margins, but thinks very little of the team and employees, and does not focus on long-term solutions for the team."
good,"The store is clean, the staff is friendly. When you work there the staff becomes family. We had to deal with a lot of rude customers, especially when you are a female in a mans job but the the men who worked their had our backs."
good,It's all about the customer servie! If you have great customer service skills you will love the people you meet! There are very few real world places where people come to you for help and walk away completely satisfied and empowered with the knowledge that they can help themselves!
good,Autozone spends time and money investing in their employees.  Training is a key part to the business and success of each.  the ability to be promototed from with in is great as long as you learn the autozone way and not do it your way.  The culture of the company is instilled in each employee.
good,"This was a busy job where there was always something to do. I didn't know much about auto parts upon hire, but learned very quickly and I loved that! I was promised a full-time position if I quit my other full-time job, so I trusted my boss and quit my other job. I waited 4 months to be promoted and I was still being given the runaround, so I quit AutoZone. I was only being given roughly 30 hours a week and I was traveling 45 minutes to work, so I wasn't able to make ends meet. I feel that the pay could have been higher."
good,"There is a lot of dispute in between management. Store managers being moved around too much no stability. Great company to work for,bit hard to move up without contacts from within."
good,"how well your day went will heavily rely on the customers. depending on your location you can keep things pretty consistent. you do have to go outside and work on vehicles no matter the weather, but it is well worth it to help the people out."
good,Autozone is a company that is very interesting. You have to know how to talk to work for a company like autozone. They have allot of people who know how to talk. You have to be smart and listen because things change in a matter of seconds sometimes.
good,It Was a great job. Very easy to learn the computer system.  Very helpful staff and knowledgeable staff.    Very easy to advance in the company and plenty of. Hours. To eork or pick up
good,I didn't mind working at Autozone for the period of time i did. My co-workers and managers were all friendly and helpful for the most part. I only left there due to a better paying job.
good,Only thing I can say is that it’s a minimum wage job and they don’t usually give u a chance for promotion unless your a company favorite other than that it’s a really good job u work with good people and u learn a lot about car parts
good,A typical day at Auto zone consisted of helping DIY customers with their projects. Help assist Commercial Department when needed and deliver parts to various dealerships and stores.
good,Depending on management this could be a great place to work. Everything is company mission focused. Putting customer first is the main objective no questioned asked.
good,One of tge best places to work for. The people are great and there are so many things to learn. Moving uo in the business is fast and easy if you apply yourself
good,AutoZone has given me a tremendous amount of experience to prepare me for the future. I travel 3 days out of the week. I have manage the salespeople here at AutoZone.
good,I enjoyed working at Autozone. I learned a great deal about vehicles. The pay should be better for the amount of work you actually perform. It is a good part time job.
good,very fast sales need to increase witacher or sales . sale promotion products at discount prices. know how to install batteries and troubleshoot. put parts on their store location and keep the store clean.
good,"A bunch of great people doing challenging work to keep a Fortune 300 company growing."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo agradable y calido, ade desarrolo profesional"
good,"Most of my  time was productive and rewarding. The last 6 months were challenging due to the deterioration  of the operations team which affected both my performance success and my commission income.  In the end, there were too many challenges beyond my control to overcome.Overall, AutoZone is a great place to work."
good,"Fun place to work at, especially if your in school and need to build some experience. Working for this company has been a blast. I would consider working for them again, but I would need reassurance of stability and a long term career."
good,"I enjoyed working for Auto Zone, I met new people everyday, I learned about auto parts and how to fix automobiles. This job gave me knowledge and understanding of different vehicles. The management team overall was okay to work with, you had some managers who stayed in the office and others who got their hands dirty just like the other employees. The hardest part of my job was the heavy lifting which put much pain on my back."
good,AutoZone is a great inspiration for you to love an want to move forward in the company great mangers great operators a family feel to the company which they call there employees autozoners

good,Buen ambiente laboral excelentes prestaciones y ademas tiene eventos muy muy frecuentes de mucha motivación para el personal ademas que contribuye a apoyar en problemas personales de su personal.
good,"I liked working for Autozone.  The only issues I had were when my store manager was promoted to a district manager and left.  The new store manager came in and ruined everything.  The stores morale and productivity plummeted.  This was a HUB location.  I was one of two Inventory Associates in a store that was about 4 times bigger than any other location.  Having found another job, the old store manager offered me a raise and guaranteed OT to compensate for the difference in pay as he wanted to keep me on so much.  The new store manager ignored the deal he and I had made and instead cut my hours from 45 hours a week to as low as 25, even though I was listed as a full time employee."
good,The work day consisted of helping customers find automotive parts for their vehicle. I learned more about car parts along with managing sales and employees that were older than me.
good,easy to advance if you put in the work fast paced fun environment You get to learn many things about the automotive business and you get to gain knowledge about automotibles
good,You train your employees on setting Goals.Dealing with unhappy customers was difficult at times but keeping cool and relax would always calm them down plus a small discount. Great people and very friendly.The Crazy Hours.Happy Customers.
good,Responsibilities were large but the rewards were greater! Had an excellent crew and we were deemed Top Sales crew in our district. Days would start off slow and would ramp up quickly so it would seem short. Management would always reward with weekend lunches or some other way to show our appreciation! Hard to leave a place that you enjoy working for!
good,The hours are very very long. but one can learn so much there and can grow very fast if they put in extra effort. team work is valued and also individual contribution is also recognized there.
good,"I loved my job, it just got stressful because they refused to hire enough people and refused to give me full time even with scheduling me full time every week"
good,"The people there are real nice and help you in anyway they can, very dependable and easy to work with. Glad I was able to work with them as long as I did."
good,i liked my manager and store staff. hardest part of job was truck day in my store. in store theft was high  district manager doesnt care about you  your just a number not a person
good,Great company to work for very stable and plenty of opportunity to help you succeed. Sometimes the paperwork gets redundant but overall the experience was good.
good,The company is and always be what it is and that is an automotive Gaint when it comes to auto parts. When else can I say about them. Great opertunite.
good,"Autozone is a great place to start working as a first job. You learn valuable information about how to care for vehicles, something everyone should now."
good,"It was a great place to work, liked the people, liked the customers, the work was not stressful or hard.  Shift were flexible depending on availability of personnel to cover.  With the exception of low pay it was a great place to have to go to work every day."
good,Great place to work at because you get to know about parts. such as you get to here the common problems that some cars intend to have such like the fuel pumps on the silverados intend to go bad.

good,"they will give you hrs based on sales volume. they do not pay you for getting under the hood customers think they do. don't allow you to receive tips for work you do under the hood of a car. changing a battery at any service center is anywhere from $50-$80"
good,I had a amazing time working for autozone there managers and training is amazing there all good people and care for each of there employees and fellow co workers
good,"It was exciting learning something new.  I realized that I truly enjoyed serving the customers and helping to make their lives easier by finding solutions to their problems.  My co-workers were awesome and accepted me completely even though I am a more mature female, they didn't make me feel inadequate to do my job well.  The only reason I left Autozone was because I needed full-time employment and they were not able to offer that to me."
good,Good career to have. Easy workplace to grow and learn knowledge of Automotive industry and parts in general. Great teams and crew that you work with. Great management staffs and upper-intendents that help you along the way on everything that you have a question on.
good,If you like a ok pace and like working around automobiles this is a good job to start. You will learn some computer skills right down to the name of parts you didn't know.

good,"This store allowed one to learn a lot about automotive parts and systems. Plenty of knowledge can be obtained through in store programs to learn the systems. Also, discounts on parts are nice."
good,I used my experience with looking up parts for customers as a learning process to fix my own vehicle. We get all types of customers. Mechanics that you trouble shoot with and customers who don't even know how to open the hood or install wipers. I loved working there.
good,Aprendi a trabajar en equipo a un volumen alto de clientes
good,"Good place, fun people, good parts. Clock in get straight to work helping customers which I really enjoyed, also working on cars was a plus because I love cars and my superior was awesome"
good,"you will mainly help people with their questions on car problems. what i like the most was the learning experience. after being there for a couple of week, you get to learn more than you knew when you start"
good,my work days were up and down varied depending on the time of the day. Some days we had stock to do and allot of store traffic and at times we would have to balance our job duties between cashier to stocking.
good,"What  I learned  at AZ  is how  to  determine what types of oil weights  work best  according  to what  year  your vehicle is ...Also  the  most important is accurate troubleshooting,  what  with  the number of competent  mechanics that come through, if  you cultivate the  right relationship with  them  and make sure their supplies  are in reach,   they  will  keep you employed!!!"
good,"Productive, good working environment. Busy store location. Good place to work if you like interacting/helping customers. Opportunities for advancement."
good,honestly if it weren't for the fact I was offered more fore another job while going to school I wouldn't have left. great management. they are willing to work with people on hours.
good,I had the pleasure of working with an amazing manager.  We had our ups and downs but once the staffing was set all things went great.  Only real issue was the fact that there is no growth with Autozone unless you are willing to relocate.
good,"It is retail .. it can be very stressful - hours can be there or it can not be there depending on how the company is doing ,, overall it is an good company to work for ."
good,you work with different people everyday. at times its a fast paced environment like on weekends or busy days. its a fun job unfortunately it was only par time and didn't pay enough. also had to work during some holidays.
good,"While working for Autozone, I received my ASE Certification (Automotive Service Excellence), which meant that I was considered an expert in my field, which was automotive parts and repair."
good,"Working for AutoZone was a great experience. I was able to apply my past parts knowledge to help various customers; with many different automobiles, find what they needed for repairs. Management was good and always able to work with my schedule. I worked in commercial and it was always a fast paced department. It was enjoyable to deliver parts to shops and get to know some small business owners in the area. I would recommend anyone to work there."
good,Good competitive working environment I worked with a good supervisor that gave the work life some balance  but always with the eyes on the ball ......
good,"Just like most retail businesses, labor is monitored closely and you work with 2 or 3 team members during each shift. Great environment to work in providing all team members work together to keep the store in good condition."
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo, pero no hay buen ambiente entre compañeros, incluyendo superiores"
good,to much pressure put on management to produce. cheap company computer system is way outdated. penny pinching in areas where it should not be. to much working outside in all types of weather
good,Manager not there assistant overbearing. if I wanted to be a mechanic I would have went to a auto shop and at least worked inside. spent more time outside changing batteries etc;;; than inside
good,"Overall atmosphere is a team building relationship between peers and associates. We all strive to ensure customer service is at it's best. The environment is busy and fast pace due to the constant demand of products, sales and competitive price market."
good,Auto Zone is a good place to work if you need a job with flexible hours. Managment is willing to work with your schedule in order to provide you with the work times you need.
good,"Run front desk taking applications answering phones. preparing loans for new and renewals. keep count and responsibility of my drawer and also doing deposit for all drawers at end of day. keeping prints full of paper and filing all files before close of business day, posting payments in compass system."
good,"A typical day at work  in the weekends or aternoons is bussy because most mechaniscs and people work on their cars. Ilearn car parts, prices, brands, quality of material of the parts. Management was not very organized and showed inequality in the work place. work place culture tends to be more male dominated and females are not seen as a capable of knowing the job well. Hardest part of the job is learning the system and car parts and different cars without prior knowledge. most enjoyable is having a flexible work schdule if you are a student."
good,"During the week most days are slow and mostly doing tasks like stocking, cleaning, and training. On the other hand weekends are busy days and focused on customers and sales."
good,"Great position for those who like to get their hands dirty, literally. Great knowledge of vehicle mechanics you start to learn and apply on customers daily based on their needs."
good,Working at the store I worked at wasn't terrible. However the customers weren't the easiest to deal with. I learned a lot. that was the best part. I'm more of a hands on guy so I'm not much of salesman. Id prefer labor jobs that pay a little better. also I commuted an hour sometimes hour and a half. it wasn't good for closing. I hate driving in the dark.
good,"quick paced, meet a variety of people , both employee and customers. Plenty to learn from both employee and customers, will gain knowledge on auto mechanics"
good,Tired of buddy buddy system. No matter how hard you worked you don't get noticed. Mostly went to make money while going to school. Had a lot happen in my personal life and had to take time off. When I did I was cut hours severely and only working 3 hours or so a day.
good,Great learning experience and very fun environment. Since being with this company I have done deliveries and learn some more about a passion of mine. Store manager is a great boss to work for.
good,"I was employed with AutoZone for 14 years.  My final position was Regional Loss Prevention Manager.  AutoZone is a great company, with equally as great leadership.  Strong focus on driving sales and the customer experience.  Tight rope approach to company policy and procedure,"
good,You work hard and prove your worth you will move up in the company. I started out at the bottom and moved up to Store manager and I would have done it sooner if I didn't drag my feet.
good,great company with a few exceptions as usual poor upper managemant.  I started part time and was subdued to numerous store investigation cause of the location i was in. Store completely emptied to just me an a store manger and was still bypass for a management position. I took it upon myself to relocate to Ohio instead of qutiting where i was promoted within 6 months. Most enjoyable part of my day is helping someone who has been ripped off by a janky mechanic.
good,I've learned how to give customer service that remains unmatched. I have managed the new hires for manager when a new team member arrived. When apart of the commercial program I lead my team to a profit over 50% compared to the previous year.
good,This is a good place to work if you can handle a life in retail.  It's a well managed business with plenty of opportunities for advancement.  I liked the ability to transfer to an endless amount of locations.
good,Autozone is a great place to work.  The company provides many opportunities for advancement as well as great benefits.  The store culture has propelled Autozone into becoming the leader in the automotive aftermarket industry.
good,"autozone was a great starting job for me, dealt with customers threw  out the day with gave me good customer skills. restocking of the store gave me good organization and memory skills."
good,"AutoZone is the only company I've worked for or with that actually strives to keep its pledge of putting customers first.  The job has been demanding and rewarding.  It is a conservative company so making changes and improvements take longer than other companies and do require a high degree of political alignment.  As they are a retailer, there are limited options for quality and engineering roles to move into leadership."
good,"It's a Great place to work , easy the work is not hard at all it's very quick to catch on too I've been there 5 years I'm just seeking something better"
good,"Driving  for auto zone is very easy ,it's just that your driving long distance,you drive in bad or good weather and you  must get plenty of rest.you get really good benefits but I think the pay should be a little better.you also get 1 hour break and when you request days off they usually grant it if you request it in a timely manner.you will work 3 -12 hour shifts and 1-8 hour shift a week."
good,"Management is kind, helpful"
good,"Management accumulated information on a daily basis on each employees work and sales. Then they would grade the stores performance every Monday. Based on their matrix, you could be counseled by management."
good,"laid back environment. professional, coordinated, believed in acknowledgement when something is accomplished. customer service is key. enjoyed the work place and the workers."
good,"A typical day at work is understaffed and stressful."
good,It was a great job great work environment  some of the best staff members I have worked with.it was reassuring to no that Autozone created a great work place
good,Good Place to work if you need some cash working while in school. They will typically work with your schedule.  On the Down side upper management tends to care more about their bonuses than the employees.
good,I would get my job and go out and get it done as fast and accuracy as possible. Then i will get my next job.  The company is great to work for and get paid well for it.
good,sometimes fast past stressful but sometimes great customer co workers breakfast lunch fun interacting with customers and helping them with their car and getting the right parts
good,I have to say as long as i have been with this AutoZone i have seen and learned a lot but and one of the most imported things i learned i have to say... would be that autozone puts unqualified people to run their day to day operations starting from the some of the district managers down to store managers. I have learned that if you are friends with the district manager you can get a store to run but not only that you can get away with failing all of your audits. But there is a positive side to Autozone you meet all types of of people and get to work with a great crew.
good,Any job working with the general public can be very daunting but management should take over and help you in unforseen circumstances which is company policy here .Good advancement opportunities here as well . Pay could be better but is somewhat negotiable upon hiring.
good,Stock aisles and maintain all cleanliness. Assist customers on the phone and on the floor. Open truck pallets and put away the item in the correct space and if it cannot fit then it's put in overflow and documented.
good,The store I worked at was very fun. We had good management and problem employees didn't last long. Plenty of opportunities for awards and advancement. Feels good to help the customer. They prefer looking outside the company to fill some positions.
good,"Clock in and find something to do, help customers, re-stock shelves, organize inventory, run the cash register there was plenty to do, management worked with you and was a big help dealing with customers when it got hectic, it was a great environment majority of us got along, hardest part of the job was dealing with multiple customers at the same time but that was also the best part of the job because it kept me busy."
good,"The work/life balance at autozone and benefits are great. But if you're not in one of the main office branches, you can't expect any personal development or growth opportunities."
good,Great work place very understanding and willing to work with you when life happens. Worked for a short time period due to health issues but management was very understanding
good,Working at the Zone was pleasant in the beginning and the customers were great but changes at the district management level (which seem to occur frequently) disturbed the efficiency and morale of the store team members.
good,Good place to work and try to my ahead in the company. I like the way everyone works together as a team to get the job done the right way.
good,"I lovd working foe auto zone because of the customers I loved helping others."
good,Es una empresa muy noble y con muchas oportunidades de crecimiento pero existe mucha rotación de personal por la multifuncionalidad de los empleados y la sobrecarga de trabajo originada por la misma razón.
good,"I enjoyed working at Autozone, besides the low pay. I learned a lot about auto parts and components. Meeting with different customers and helping them out with their vehicle repair needs. As well as, delivering parts to local garages."
good,"Learned a lot more than I knew coming in about cars, parts, systems, accessories, batteries, tools and more. Hands-on learning, close relationships to local automotive businesses."
good,love my job always got treated right love working as a register helping customers out in everything I can.never had a problem.
good,Es una buena empresa aprendi todo muy rápido pero el salario era muy bajo
good,"Great place to work, good management, good upper management! Friendly work environment! Good benefit packages when there for required time!! Very social place to work!"
good,this job was a great experience and would do it again in a heart beat. so much fun to do this job. its like working for yourself and not really bothered much as long as your doing your job
good,the people I worked with are very hard working and some were knowledgeable but I did not like the idea of working for little pay with small raises for the rest of my life
good,I repeat my previous statement about this irrelevant review and don't need this time wasting nonsense. I don't care if anyone else gets a job at the zone.
good,"With a high volume of people in and out the store, and much cultural diversity, the never ending learning environment is great for even someone who may not know much about cars. Best thing yet is that they're open to training new bees"
good,"I started working at Autozone sometime in 2011 and left in 2015. Started off as a red shirt and left a Parts Sales Manager. One of the pros working at Autozone is how fast you can move up to management, and of course your learning of vehicles."
good,"great place to work. great place to learn about automotive if you have never had any experience. But if you go up for a promotion, Don't! you get a 50 cent raise and the new work load is not worth the pay."
good,"Una de las cosas distintivas de autozone es el ambiente laboral, es de los mejores en los que haya estado a pesar del bajo salario"
good,I enjoyed this company.  Customer relations was great and I loved the training programs that the company offers.  I would have remained there for many years had I not been offered something much better from another company.
good,"I am a college student and had recently been let go from my previous job. I looked for a job and had stumbled across and opening at my local Autozone, I got the sales job and I love it except for a few things,"
good,"Overall good place to work, helpful management, advancement opportunities, classes and continuing education to help further your skills and knowledge"
good,Autozone has a lot of growth and plenty of benefits. A typical day at work is anywhere from a 5 to 10 hour shift. You learn about parts and get up to 20% off as an employee
good,"Depending on your location, the work experience will differ.  With great management you get a lot of training and knowledge within business and the automotive industry.  Opportunities for promotion is available to hard workers that strive for it.  Automotive knowledge is a bonus but not necessary to do the job which entails the selling of auto parts and products.  Customer service is the primary focus.  With poor management, recognition for outstanding work is rare and lazy employees will become problematic to a happy work environment.  While automotive knowledge or being bilingual is a bonus to have, it will not translate to increased wages and will leave a feeling of being devalued."
good,"Es una empresa con trato cordial con mucha exigencia hacia su equipo de liderazgo en todos los indicadores como lo es rotación de personal,seguridad,asistencia,productividad,efectividad en sus funciones,"
good,A typical day at work is helping customers solve there problems or guide them in the right direction to a solution by giving the best advice possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see a customer leave satisfied when me and my co-workers work together to solve the customers problem.
good,good for those pursuing a certification in the automotive industry ASE Master certifications allows to become familiar with vehicle parts and use  good for those who like cars
good,"Usually fast paced, I've learned there's a lot more to sell car parts then just pulling a part off the shelf and giving it to a customer. All necessary training is provided."
good,"todo bien"
good,"The job is fine, it isn't back breaking work, I learn alot about cars, and management is fairly easy to get along with, as well as my co-workers. As far as I'm concerned, the hardest part of the job is the pay. It's not nearly enough money or hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, being embedded in the community somehow. Springfield is nice and small, and everybody shops at my site. So we're all kind of a big family."
good,"Depending on the amount of customers, one can spend the entire day providing customers with excellent service.  During downtime, one can restock or front face the store, and learn more about the products being sold by asking those that are more experienced.  Managers are very well informed at customer satisfaction and good mentors to the part-timers.  The coworkers are very professional and exceed what is expected of them by company standards.  The hardest part of the job is being able to remain organized and in control during a large influx of customers.  The enjoyable part is being able to learn something new everyday in regards to car care."
good,"I started working with Autozone in Northern California, within the first week the regional manager came and visited my training, and personally introduced himself.  I worked as a Commercial Driver, delivering parts to garages and driving sales, while also assisting regular walk in customers.  My entire management structure was amazing, with room for advancement in a very short amount of time, within a few months I was making a dollar more than minimum wage, and was trained to advance into a management position when one became available.  Due to an unfortunate personal issue I was required to move back to MA, and having such a great experience with the Zone, I put in my transfer request (2 months before I left).  When I got to MA, I was forced to wait an additional 6 months because the regional manager here was looking for a store to place me in.  After a very long wait they placed me into a store that was managed by someone who initially seemed very motivated and excited that I was already trained for management.  I was informed that I'd basically be starting over from square one, but based on my previous experience I felt that I'd progress as quickly as I had before.  I was wrong.  I was made a permanent driver, all previous training was disregarded, all attempts to transfer to other stores for advancement were denied, and friction grew between myself and management. After 3 years with the company, generating thousands of sales, new customers, and positive customer reviews I was given a pin and a paper with the wrong first name congratulating me for my time with the company."
good,Working at Autozone as a summer job was very exciting and fun. They are a great company who takes pride in what they do and what they stand for.
good,"A typical day at Autozone would be to clock in at 5:55 a.m on the weekends. After you clock in you do your daily stretches, then your advisor will come out and explain to you what your requirements for the day are. After all that I would go to my work station and pick up my first store. The hardest thing about working there is the long hours you are walking and that it gets really hot in the summer. It was a challenge but I got through it with the amazing advice my co-workers would give me. My managers were very helpful and i will always appreciate there patience with me."
good,"would consider to anyone looking for a part time job regardless off car parts knowledge. Great environment, and easy work."
good,Pay is just ok in my area but overall a great place to work. Learned a lot and enjoy working for Auto Zone. Still employed there now
good,if you love car or seek car knowledge you should apply. Meet tons of fun people that are willing to help you if you have any car problems
good,The work area at AutoZone will always keep you on your feet. You will friendly Co-Workers while working there. If you don't know much about cars part you have people there helping you.
good,"Friendly co-workers, everyone is willing to teach you, very easy place to work. 1 hour break, discount on parts, great automotive work place."
good,I counted the safe. I made sure no one stole anything or at least i tried. My main purpose was to assist customers with any problems they might have with either my employees or parts.
good,"Every day I started my shift was a new challenge with the same goal....Customer satisfaction. I learned to deal with several personalities in many different situations. I enjoyed working to help others achieve their goal while achieving mine. There was always something to do, working with very good people in our team was  very helpful to make any hard task possible"
good,"A typical day involves solving minor diagnostic problems for customers' vehicles, providing sales, upselling, and assisting customers in buying all the necessary items for the repair job they were performing. I have learned much about vehicle maintenance and repairs, as well as how to manage a store and a small team of employees. The management works as a team to ensure inventory accuracy, store cleanliness, and excellent customer service to both walk-in customers and call-in customers. My coworkers are all willing to work, fast and friendly towards the customers, and are reliable. I would say that the most difficult part of my job is quite simply being a female in the automotive industry. While I have worked very hard to prove myself as knowledgeable, there are still some customers that doubt my capabilities due to my gender. Another challenge for me is my limited knowledge of in-depth automotive knowledge, although I am working daily to increase what I know. My favorite part of the job is helping my customers accomplish a job, knowing that I am able to answer any questions they may have and being able to create a reputation and professional relationship with them."
good,Auto Zone is a company that relies on team work. I would help anywhere from 30-50 customer daily. My co-workers always stayed busy. The hardest part of the job was learning everything about auto part. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers
good,A lot of people did not enjoy Autozone because of management I had a great store manager. The company does not back you up even if you are following their rules they always side with the customer.
good,"loved working at AutoZone. very pleasant management and co workers. learned how to change batteries, wiper blades and light bulbs on several models of vehicles. worst part is having to change batteries in the cold weather. my co workers were just amazing to work with"
good,"It was nice working here as they helped me get on my feet. Also, they allow you learn and the time to be with family. Salary was part-time, but it helped me throughout college."
good,"It was overall a good job, but for the most part they are not too flexible with hours. The pay is appropriate for the work load, however there arent many hours to go around."
good,Fun working environment allowed for a better connection with customers throughout the day.  Upward mobility was encouraged by upper management.
good,"Working at autzone was great for me, because I love cars and working on them as well. The management could definitely use some more training."
good,Good place to work and benefits package is one of the best ive seen. Lots of opportunity to learn about cars. Needs better store level leadership.
good,"I deal with different types of people on a daily basis, and every day is interesting, because you do not know what is going to come of it. I love the individuals I work with. Everyone is loving, caring, respectful, and helpful. I have learned how to master automobile mechanical techniques, how to manage inventory using RF Scanners, and I have even learned that I possess more patience than I thought; because as I stated earlier, I deal with many different people and although the saying is: ""You have to give respect in order to get respect"" or ""Treat others the way you want to be Treated"", it does not always go as hoped. I like my job, it is just not where I desire to spend my life working."
good,"All depends on your team. If they don't help you better get people that will. Be patient, but do not let people run you over with their do not know anything work ethic."
good,"worked here part time after school and after graduation. Store manager was fair and expected only the best, Some of my coworkers were lazy but every place has one of those. Hardest part was trying to do the salesmanship, they will go as far as writing you up for not getting checkout challenge. I enjoyed helping customers and solving some of their problems with their vehicles within my knowledge."
good,"As store manger you're expected to be on site no less than 50hrs per week. Reality is an average of 54 to 70hrs weekly. "
good,"My time at Autozone was fun at times and stressful at other. more specifically was the lack of managing schedules and trying to figure out some internal problems. However, I enjoyed my time at Autozone and i would recommend this company to any personal looking for a job."
good,Working at AutoZone DC taught me that there is always room to teach yourself new things. Always strive to push your personal best.
good,"Its a good place to work, specially if you like cars. I did learned a lot about cars during my time working there. However they could improve the process that they use to hire managers."
good,"Everyday I would go into work early and usually got put onto the clock immediately. I would sign out a car for the day, help out on counter until a delivery was ready to go out. Then I would get into the commercial vehicle and deliver to my destination then head back once delivered."
good,Working for this company taught me many things that helped me with my career going forward such as customer service and inventory management.  The crew that I worked with was great and we got along great and created our own fun while working to allow time to pass by faster.
good,"Typical retail. You learn about automotives and maintenance of motor vehichles. Hardest part is its not very easy to advance. You can get to be a counter manager fairly quicly but anything beyond that, you better be able to relocate or you may be waiting for many years."
good,"A nice steady flow of customers most days, my store was a little lacking on manager communication but other than that a pretty good place to work."
good,"The autozone that I was working at was the one located in my neighborhood. A typical day over there would involve helping customers with what parts they need for cars, offering them assistance with any installations they would need, such as battery replacements. We would get our truck once a week, and the entire staff would be there for the day to help unload it. I also worked the closing shift over there. The closing shift involved sweeping and mopping the store. Throwing out the garbage and front-facing the store meaning organize the shelves."
good,"With a continual training program and interaction with customers, Autozone provides the individual with the opportunity to engage in real time problem solving with customers and their needs."
good,Customer service and patience are key skills that I have learned by working here. The hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with the customers.
good,"Great work environment, decent pay, good hours. Good management, thorough training. Works well with schedules. Always has room to grow."
good,"I enjoyed working at autozone, I would stay busy and felt productive. I learned a lot about how important it is to maintain your car in good conditions. Good environment, my co-workers were very friendly."
good,"A typical day at work included helping customers to find vehicle parts and keeping the store organized and in good clean conditions. I learned many things working there like over to generate and work overstock, plan o grams and flex a grams, which I enjoyed, and the basics of how a vehicle is ran. My management was pretty awesome, I learned mostly everything and more from them and they could really count on me to run the store on my own. The hardest part of my job was probably slowing myself down so i wouldn't make mistakes, some times I would be going to fast and not focus. But after I slowed down and just focused on doing a right job I picked up seed anyway. I enjoyed everything, the environment, the work, the customers and staff and just all the knowledge i could access."
good,"Great company for a first job, basic minimum wage pay.  you learn alot within a short amount of time. great if you love or have knowledge of cars as it is and if you are bilingual"
good,Typical day is fun most of the time our team works hard to provide the best customer service we can I love helping people with there cars and the hardest is dealing with outrage customers but we stillget the job done.
good,"Dealing with customers face to face at the parts counter, or over the phone.  helping customers with diagnosis and trouble shooting automotive issues.  I learned probably more about cars than I ever thought I could stuff into my mental library.  Co workers were great for the most part.  The work environment is pretty upbeat and fun.  the hardest part of the job was dealing with all the shoplifters, it was insane how much merchandise just walked right out the door.  Because I am a gear head it was great talking to old timers how would come up to the zone with their sports cars and race cars."
good,Overall a good company to work for as far as a part time job goes. They work great with your schedule and allow you to come in to work for extra hours if you request so.
good,Autozone provides incredible opportunities to advance within the company if you work hard and dedicate yourself. With Autozone I developed many new skills in management and in retail Sales. They can be very encouraging but at times the work load can get a little overwhelming.
good,"Typical day at work would be liaising with my group of work mates 20 minutes before the work clock began."
good,Auto Zone is a large corporation that is trusted by their local community to give them the correct parts needed for their vehicles. Auto Zone is a fast paced work environment and the employees deal with customers all day long. Overall Auto Zone is a great company to be employed at.
good,"A typical day at work was either opening or closing store, doing the daily banking and scheduling, taking care of day to day store tasks including setting plan-o-grams and taking inventory. With AutoZone's computer daily schedule I learned to have a more disciplined work day. The local management was great, the upper level was not as good, I feel that was only because Autozone  was new to the market at the time and did not fully understand it yet. We had a good store crew that flowed really well, each member went about their tasks well. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell certain brands of products that the local clientele did not want to purchase. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the store crew and assisting customers to get what they needed"
good,"Worked through breaks on busy days."
good,I liked working here it was a chance to grow and to challenge myself to other coworkers. I loved my management team and would love to find that kind of teamwork again in my future career.
good,"This was your typical retail job, with one exception, you worked with blue-collar customers, which made the every day a bit more relaxed."
good,"Working at Autozone a typical day consists of setting sales goals and delegating tasks to employees to encourage productivity. There are customers in the store, customers calling on the phone, and commercial customers who are from local automotive shops. I've learned to multitask and communicate well with both my employees and customers. The hardest part of working at Autozone is that there always seemed to be a problem with staffing. We were constantly short staffed and that would put a lot of strain on our workers and on our customers. However, I feel that as long as you are open and honest, apologize to customers genuinely for the wait and explain to them the reason why, they are understanding and patient. The best part of working at Autozone is definitely how close we get to work with customers. Autozone extends the four walls of the store to the parking lot and so we get to walk outside with customers and really see what kind of issues they are having with their vehicle. This breaks out of the business/employee mindset and creates a friendlier experience for customers. They see us as helpful and kind as opposed to someone just trying to make a sale."
good,en general es muy buena escuela por toda la cultura de trabajo y atencion al cliente que hay asi como la fomentacion de valores tanto al interior de la empresa como en el trato y servicio a sus clientes...en contra esta el salari que es algo bajo asi como la falta de pago en horas extras e incumplimiento en la hora de salida que se te asigna trabajando aveces hasta 4 o 5 horas mas de la jornada sin recibir remuneracion
good,The day to days at this facility were inconsistent the customer flow determined the situation of the days.
good,I worked in four different stores in this company and every store was different some were so busy you could not even breathe others so not busy that you would almost fall sleep
good,"Autozone is Commendable with its employees when it comes to needing time off due to complications. Pay is Kind of low and its all part time unless a manager, however speaking spanish is a big asset to have. there is room for improvement and raises. overall a good company to work for"
good,"The schedules are flexible and organizational goals are reasonable. I learned a great amount of knowledge in reference to ""do it yourself"" automotive repair. Co-workers are general nice approachable people with great interpersonal skills. The job can be very detailed oriented at times, but interacting with people and helping resolve their automotive problems is fun,"
good,was a great place to work just needed a better paying job. great starter job for someone that's looking.
good,"I loved working for AZ.  Helping customers solve their vehicle issues, and helping maintain them as well.  Loved playing ""Name that Part"". Many of AZ's policies are counter intuitive, confusing, and detrimental to their own employees."
good,"Opening store, assisting and meeting new customers,how to give good phone service,listen and learn good advice, how to communicate with fellow employees. The hardest part was some of the men customers didn't think I new about vehicle repair or parts and some of the male employees didn't like to be told what to do by a woman.  The enjoyable times was when everyone got along and done their job and worked their scheduled hours."
good,"I was a front end supervisor, a typical day would be me making sure that no registers had an excess amount of money,  make sure all staff  took meal breaks, and helped all customers with refunds or other request they may have such as special orders. Lastly, I would check up on all departments making sure the deli , meat department, and produce was clean and all dates on products where up to date."
good,Great place to work. It is fast paced and have to meet daily quotas.
good,"A typical day at my job includes opening the store at times and others close store. Tasks includes paperwork, safe count , inventories, sales, customer service wish can be from selling them the parts they need for the job or install a battery or wiper blades. There are times were the store needs new set ups and it is one of my favorite things to do since I am an attention to detail kind of person. My co-workers are very knowledgeable as well and very easy to get along with. I have been in the company for 12 years but it is time to move on to get a better career."
good,"you must sell,sell,sell, great customer service, motivated co workers, must be a multitasking person if not this is not the job for you."
good,"Opening store and getting employees set for the day. Good manager at store and I enjoyed being the Asst, Mgr.  Long hours erratic hours made it difficult to have a family life. Enjoyed customer interface and ability to show my automotive knowledge."
good,"A lot of research involving a broad range of car parts."
good,"Muy buena empresa en lo general, solo el area de call center, tiene muchos favoritismos y bajas ya que el personal a cargo de call center se encarga de contratar o promocionar a gente conocida de ellos. Recomendabl para laborar en cualquier area, el salario no es tan alto pero te deja una muy buena experiencia."
good,Loved working here. The management is extremely easy going and knows their cars. My favorite two things about working here were the customers. And the learning experience.  It's a great feeling to have your customer leave with a positive attitude and happy that you helped them with whatever problem they may have with their car. Customers #1 always. Also learned a TON about automobiles and tools. Learned to diagnose vehicles.  Very great company. Will enjoy my next autozone career when In Saint Cloud Fl.
good,I enjoyed learning and working in the company and was willing to move up but did a poor job with managing and keeping promises that was made for their coworkers
good,We have fun at work dealing with customers and between team members. There isnt anything hard about this job and i enjoy it but the most enjoyable part is the feeling i get when i have a satisfied customer that leaves the store happy.
good,"Chances to move up are based purely off store volume and initiative,"
good,"Testing alternators, batteries, and starters, also performing dynostic test was a typical dayat work! I learned a lot about cars and there car parts. It was very interesting to me. When i did work there before new management, my managemnt was awsome! Im a tough girl, so the hardest part would have to be, being a girl and all the doubts I had to prove wrong. Everything was enjoyable about AutoZone!"
good,"Es muy importante recalcar que la empresa es muy buena, las politicas de la misma son muy especificas y nunca tratan de afectar a el trabajador. el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, ya que, como mencione, las politicas defienden la diversidad de las personas."
good,"Waiting on customers, pulled parts, ran the cash register, answered the phone, delivered parts, & maintained store appearance."
good,"Would re apply. Great benefits. Learned different things everyday,"
good,"Autozone is a great place to work especially if you like interacting with the public,working on cars, and enjoy retail."
good,"They work well with scheduling around personal life. Working for this company I cant help but feel underpaid and over worked. I've been labeled as full time for three years and I have not earned any vacation, medical,  or any other full time benefits."
good,able to socialize with many people and help them about their problems
good,"This was my first job and it was awesome the management and co-workers were great.  Easy going work environment very relaxing and light stress job. Just be ready to stand for long periods at a time, basically the whole shift."
good,Ran daily operations of retail store along with hub delivery warehouse. Managed 40+ employees on a daily basis
good,a typical day of work involved first and most importantly customer service. I greeted and assisted each customer in finding the auto parts they needed as well as up sell products. I had run shift and directed other employees through out the night. I also would keep account of the cash for the day and preform closing tasks and paper work. the most enjoyable part of this job for me would be the customer service aspect. I personally find interacting and providing a excellent experience for customers the most enjoyable. i am a very out going and very good at interacting with customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of opportunities for me to grow with the company .
good,"Cashier "
good,"I am a part sales manager, soon to be promoted to commercial manager. We diagnose car troubles and install certain parts on vehicles we keep our work areas safe and clean. We help all customers right away and be sure they get exactly what they need and help them figure out what is wrong. I enjoy my position and all the responsibilities I have in taking lead and helping out everyone at work. On a day to day basis we unload trucks to receive parts on Sundays. Tuesdays we have to send back any returns that came from our warehouse back to them. Thursdays we have bank deposits being sent back. But everything changes daily on what we are doing that day. I'd say the hardest part of my job is trying to calm an angry customer down and get them what they need to be happy and continue business with us."
good,"I learned many things at this job, and as long as one applied theirself there was many opportunities to learn more and advance.  "
good,People are great to work with and very team oriented.  Lacking in advancement for women.  Overall a pleasant company to work for.
good,Worked 50hrs a week i learned how to run and operate a business I was the commercial sales manager had alot of great co workers along side of me the hardest part of my job was to maintain a happy work place and keep all the co workers happy with there amount of hours worked. I really enjoyed meeting new customers and maintaining a friendship with them
good,this job is only for people that want to be part time and not go any where else in the company.
good,AutoZone is a good Company but they are more focused on there own money then taking care of us
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work. We had a very quiet workplace, and good co-workers."
good,The only issues that I had with working for the company is the constant turnover of the management. In the 4 years that I was employed at the same branch there were 3 different district managers and 5 different store managers.
good,I enjoyed this job. It is a great place to work. The managers are nice and the work is quite easy.                                                                 
good,As Assistant Manager It was my responsibility to open or close the store.  I would over see the staff and assign their responsibilities for the day.  I checked parts availability against computer records and set up store displays
good,I changed batteries and constantly helped customers all day. I learned a lot about cars. The managers are amazing. The hardest part of the job was trying to interpret what part the customer was trying to ask for. 
good,"had a great experience working their, really enjoyed everything and"
good,"Working as a cashier at an automotive store was a little challenging, mainly because I did not know much about cars. Besides that, we were always very busy and everyone helped each other out if necessary."
good,"I learned a lot about cars and really enjoyed working with people. IT was typical retail hours, but plenty of room for growth and the people were decent."
good,La convivencia y comunicacion es factor para el exito de la misma
good,Every day is the same process. Once in a while we get crazy customers who make our news for the entire day. If they are too crazy we will talk about them the following week too.
good,I worked for this company years ago when I was younger. Found it to be a good job for the time. Enjoyed the atmosphere and customers. Found it to be helpful in furthering my knowledge in the automotive filed.
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for with a good staff and supportive management team. In my daily activities depends what shift I'am on, but my basic routine is to help customers with their automotive needs, assign and ensure daily tasks are complete and to make sure the store is clean for the next shift.."
good,"Opening and closing the store. Go thru all sales figures on a daily basis. Review the P&L with with management and identify areas to improve. Review new hires to be interviewed, make appointments as needed and go thru the interview process until hired. Train and motivate staff on a daily basis."
good,"working at autozone was a green pasture compared to the company i left them for. The day is fast paced, informative, and fun. My coworkers were the best part. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers. The very best part was my old dm and our hr manager they are the bomb."
good,Delivered to other AutoZone’s and auto shops on time schedule.
good,"Helping customers and re stocking shelves,parts counter.I liked working for this company."
good,"typical day consist of walking in helping customers, waiting for commercial delivery to start, i learned a couple of ins and outs of the business, how their retail market worked and the system they had set up for it. Management was fair as long as you did your work they where not complaining much, Co-Workers where jolly funny staff made the best out of the worst situation.Being on time with my deliveries was the hardest part of the job traffic, or making 3 deliveries at a time and then getting an on the road call of other things i need to do before i head back. Driving was most enjoyable, Boss having the trust in me to drive a vehicle was awesome, i was basicy my own boss on the road and managed my time fairly well."
good,I learned a lot about cars and their parts. The guys at work helped me a lot to learn about the terms at work. The hardest part about the job had to be that a lot of people didn't really want my help because I was a female and they thought I didn't know anything about cars.
good,Assisting customers and helping them find the right merchandise was a very exciting aspect of this job.
good,working for autozone and learning about the company was a great experience
good,"Start out compiling all paperwork and filling them away properly. Then went about my day doing recalls, checking in returns, and setting up for new planograms. Then i would be up front on the sales floor helping my co-workers with looking up parts on the computer and selling and pulling parts for customers."
good,It was a great place to work . Very fast paced . Just great to work at
good,It is a good place to work and learn a lot about cars. the management is OK to work for. Like working with the customers.
good,"I loved working there,my co-workers were great to work with.The management team was poised and focus,they had a clear vision where they wanted the company to go.I learned a lot about customer service and dealing with problem solving.The hardest part of the day was getting up for the early shift,and the most enjoyable part was having a solution to a customers' problem"
good,fun eviorment
good,"Good,fast and always meeting deadlines. Learn how to work in different departments of the distribution. Managers and co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job they relocated out of San Antonio,Tx"
good,I was the store manager for a year. 3 days a week I would open the store and close the store. The hardest part of the job was keeping up on the paperwork while running the store short handed. I really enjoyed my loyal customers and the relationships I developed with them
good,Always had a fun day at work. The money is not good but I loved going to work anyway.
good,managers let you work with out the hassle great enviorment great customers. i never had any problems
good,"A typical day was answering the phone, dealing with walk-in customers and commercial accounts, selling parts, installing batteries, testing batteries, stocking, inventory management and installing wiper blades. I learned a lot about automotive parts as well as more info about vehicles. The management was not bad they promoted within. I worked with some great employees in the time I was with the company. There was not a hard part working here. The best part was making customers happy."
good,"Autozone is a standard auto parts retail outlet. We joked that it was the McDonalds of the auto parts world. Expect to hear and see a lot of simple or silly questions, some of which will give you a laugh. Most customers are good-natured. You'll have your fair share of ones who can't ID a funnel or who act like they know everything, but you can experience the same behind the counter."
good,"I respect my co-workers. We all work together to make the sales goal of the day. A typical day at work is very busy. Sometimes we have lines wrapped around the aisle. We take our time with every customer to get them exactly what they will need to do the job right and to get them out timely so they can go about their day. The hardest part of the job is when we are short handed and we can't help the customers as quickly as they would like. The most enjoyable part of my job is the face to face interaction with the customers they are very nice. I've been working with the company for 3 years now, so I know all the regular customers very well. I always provide great customer service."
good,I tried to put in my two weeks notice for three months and my store manager refused to take it. I finally got to the point to where I had to relocate and did. My store manager put me down as not rehire able because I didn't put my two weeks notice in.
good,"Autozone is unique, team work is a must working here challenging sometimes but overall a fun and a great learning experience."
good,interesting work place. I have been there for four years an have learned a lot about cars and car parts. this job has taught me numerous skills that I believe will help me in other work environments.
good,Jobs was very simple. Everyday I had a route that my manager assigned me and very nice friendly people you get to meet.
good,I very much enjoyed working for Auto Zone. If i would not have ever moved to san diego i most likely would have stayed here.
good,"Great place to work, if your in the right area. If your looking for advancement you have to land in the right location. Some locations can allow you to get promoted quickly either being due to bigger markets or high turnover rate. If your in a smaller market and no one leaves then your pretty much stuck in your same postion."
good,"Great people to work with, as well as the ability to learn new things in the automotive industry. I was able to learn new ways to do things and different ways to research possible problems for the customers."
good,It has its ups and downs changing batteries in a blizzard is not fun but like I said there is a lot of good perks I learn new things about cars get to see different faces everyday
good,Very good place to expand your knowledge in the automotive industry. You can learn and experience hands on training with cars and trucks to learn basic functioning of vehicles and their parts. Good work environment with the help of flexible scheduling and employees.
good,"Fast paced and challenging. Multiple departments to learn. I have worked in the Inbound, IC QC, Returns Recalls. As an Inbound Advisor I manage 50 to 60 people on a daily basis. I am responsible for the daily operations of the Inbound department which includes daily set up of people needs, truck deliveries including vendor direct and LTL deliveries, managing product flow, timely processing of purchase orders. Scheduling and people skills are a must. WE also do daily yard checks, QC audits, PIE observations, payroll, and other duties as necessary."
good,Auto zone was a good place to work at I was dealing with alot of car parts that I knew a lot about I had good customer service my boss was happy and so was the customer
good,"Most of the day consists of basic cleaning and maintaining the work environment. Throughout the employment, if you are fortunate enough to have as great mentors as I have had you will learn a lot from both the customers and coworkers"
good,"Everyone's motto was putting customers first"
good,"A good place to work. I been with the company 2 years. Flexible  work schedule. Fair work loads, and routes. Management tries to help you the best they can."
good,Enjoyed working with my team and representing the company through amazing customer service. Learning more about vehicles and making sure people got what they needed and it was correct the first time
good,"I have worked here for a couple months I really enjoy it, once you learn the computers its not too bad. The employees are fun and do a great job, and are responsible. The only bad part is customer reviews are everything. For example my store last year had under 5 complaints for an entire year, keep in mind about 100-200 people come through a day, and my boss who is a great guy, and one of the most hard working people I know didn't get his bonus because 5 out of 1,000s of people had a complaint about something small."
good,"Every day was full of task to complete (organizing shelves, pulling recalls, cleaning the store and inventory management) but our first responsibility was always to our customers.  Being a store manager comes with great responsibility and can often feel pressured to do everything yourself. Managing is more than planning but culture building. The work place culture I built in my store was one of excellent customer service,  hard work, respect, teamwork and fun. Establishing hard work through teamwork built respect and resulted in excellent customer service. The hardest part of my job was learning how to balance multiple responsibilities without lacking on the quality of my work. "
good,"Manage financial responsibilities to exceed goals through positive &"
good,Handled the day to day obligations as a sales manager while maintaining high company sales goals and breaking records a year after taking over my position. I was able to maintain 10% turnover for the 2 years I worked at Autozone and customer service score was a 96% Satisfaction.
good,"The hours make schooling more manageable. Also, the pay is decent but there is not much room for advancement without becoming a manager or a full-time employee. Besides that, the workplace environment is great and the management is considerate."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Large meetings can feel like a waste of time/ overly corporate. If you are a smart and dedicated employee, you should have no trouble rotating through areas of the business and moving upward over time."
good,"Kinda wish I stayed there. I would've become in a few months if I stayed. I'm grateful for the experience the job gave me, I feel like I'm a better worker because of it."
good,I mainly delivered  parts to commercial  so that part of the day was in and out of the store. In between that you may help customers  in the store. Worked there while going to college so they worked with my class times.
good,AutoZone is a great place to start at and earns experience for life with automotive vehicles. The management works well with my schedule and other needs.
good,"A typical day at work would include ensuring the store was completely stocked, and asking every customer who walked in if they'd like some assistance. More often than not, you'd then help the customer with their problem, and then resume with restocking and ensuring the store is clean."
good,"Dealing with the professional technician, as well as the novice and hobbyist automotive enthusiast, taught diversity in assistance of locating the proper parts or information on proper repair procedures. Working in a management position also lead to ever increasing opportunities to improve customer relations in the art of creating the satisfied customer when dissatisfaction appeared. As a manager the job required the opening and closing of the store, handling of register tills and refunds, bank deposits, assigning tasks to workers according to their abilities, inventory control, restocking of showroom floor and parts bins, ordering from the local warehouse for same day deliveries to the store, stocking of parts delivered from the regional warehouse, diagnosis of some system faults, repair tool rentals and warranty searches and explinations."
good,"Great Job security as well as room for growth. However the district management team is not the greatest built. Great work environment, extremely poor pay."
good,"Auto Zone still remains one of the best places i have worked. The pay is not enough for the cost of living but for the most part, it was enjoyable to go to work, mostly because of fellow coworkers."
good,It was an enjoyable place to work for because there was something always to do. I really enjoyed working there because it was fast paced and it made the day go by fast.
good,"AutoZone is a decent company to work for, the staff is very friendly and helpful. The management is fair and informative. If you want to move up in the company the opportunity is there."
good,"Its your basic retail job to be honest, not much to say.  They do provide lots of training and coaching to get the job done.  There is always room for advancement and the turn over rate is pretty high in certain areas especially within management.  The job is pretty easy and self explanatory, the hardest part like any retail job is dealing with the public which can be challenging at times.  The best part of the job is making the customer happy, clocking out and going home."
good,"Cada día es una nueva oportunidad de aprender del trabajo y de los clientes, apoyo constante entre compañeros."
good,Staff had favorites and if you didn't fit in then they would find ways to get you into trouble. Work from previous shift would be left for someone else to do.
good,Very fast paced. good people to work with. The days can get hectic and there are times when you are very short staffed. there is positive room for advancement if you apply yourself.
good,"Autozone is a automotive retail store."
good,Auto zone was the start of my interest in the automotive business. A typical day at auto zone was fun and a learning experience! I learned about almost every car part there is out there! Management was fair to a point. there was not much that was hard to do at auto zone. I enjoyed interacting with customers.
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was learning about vehicles, helping customers learn about their vehicles, and assisting to keep them on the road rather than having to buy a new one.  Hardest part was the customers that have a prejudice that women know nothing about cars.  It is out there and every day is a new chance to convince a customer that a woman can be just a knowledgeable on a vehicle as a man is."
good,AutoZone is a good place to work if you have automotive experience.  They hire mostly sales oriented people with some knowledge of the mechanical side.  They do offer a program you can take to hone those skills. The employees work together as a team.  Sometimes there is a barrier in communications between the store level employees and corporate.  The people send down new procedures that do not work so well in the stores. But the stores are made to abide by these procedures.  They overload the store employees with other task so that the customer is not getting the service they deserve.  Some staffing practices hinder the scheduling process.  Most employees being hired now are for part time positions.  Advancements in the company is based on who you know as well as how well you perform your job.
good,"You have to have thick skin to work here the customers will get under your skin quick, there is usually only two people working the counters at all times so when it gets busy ot gets stressful."
good,Constantly training someone due to high turn over.but awsome place. They make sure you need to know everything you need to know. Good training environment.
good,"Work with a great group of people. Different departments work cohesively. I really enjoy my job. Have learned so much, supportive manager. Pay is low though."
good,"As a parts sales manager, I was basically an assistant store manager. I initially got offered $10.50/hr, but turned it down because I was making over $5/hr more at my previous job. They bumped the offer up by a dollar and I took it because I needed a job. However, that pay for a manager is truly pathetic."
good,had a great time working there for 4 years moved up from a delivery driver up to manager was working toward becoming a commercial manager left before i had the chance
good,"Be specific on when you can work when you apply, they will abide by it.  Great opportunities and company to work for.  Must be able to multi-task and understand time management skills.  Most difficult part of the job is simply learning how to stock the store."
good,"Auto zone is a very good company. Nice co workers/managers. Great place to work, the pay isn’t good but the environment is great. I did customer service/sales/ cashier"
good,This is a job that teaches you how to think on your feet. It also teaches you how to manage time efficiently. The most important thing is the customer!
good,"Auto Zone is a great place to work if you're available to work full time. If you are flexible,  you can make good money. Full time employees get paid time off and benefits."
good,You learn a lot there . You can go far into the company and learn a lot and can move up with the management team. You interact with other on a daily basis
good,"The hours were flexible which was a plus, though sometimes you wouldn't know your schedule from week to week. Pay was modest. My colleagues were friendly."
good,"Slow and fast paced environment, understanding that life happens, decent benefits...It was fun getting to know the customers and learning more than i already did about parts and how engines work."
good,Good place to learn different career paths in the automotive sector. they give you the opportunity and pay for any ASE testing. Scheduling is very forgiving.
good,You learn a lot from regular training updates and meetings and the people are great at teamwork and collaboration. They recognize and appreciate good employees.
good,Take forever even after you complete everything plus more.They do train and go by we know our parts and products. Able to talk to a manager any given time.
good,Working for this place takes a toll on your body. It can be decent but you are asked to do things you dont know how to do with training. There is often little reward for thoughs not above store manager. You are accepted to not only sell the part the person wants but try to upsell on everything down to selling checkout challenges.
good,La valoración de mi evaluación la puedo describir que es buena comprensible y exacta ni existe error en ningún dato.
good,Great teacher to make you grow and improve your skills. They understanding and flexible with you. Like I said there easy to work with and there basic motto is great to follow “put customers first and the product on there hands so the can leave happy and confident that the part they want.”
good,Working at AutoZone is very flexible schedule at the one I work at. My manager is very understanding and tries to work with you personally with your schedule each week and I appreciate that very much.
good,very good company to work for.Every one is happy including the customers no one has ever been upset with this company that I know of since I been with the company.
good,Great Place to work if you have the right management in place. Great opportunity to move up in the company if you do your job and follow the guide lines that AutoZone has set up. The guide line are there to help you grown and advance you to the next level. The most enjoyable part about the job are the people I work with . If your having a rough day they pitch in to help out and vice versa. All in all not a bad place to work if everyone just does their job.
good,"I am only the yard spotter, don't think that I would or will drive for them hauling freight. I am totally against hauling freight and then unloading it, especially at the pay rate they offer. "
good,es una institucion que a diariohay que trabajar en equipo para lograr los objetivos
good,"AutoZone is a ""big""machine.What that means is that there is a lot of structure and it is technically driven.You must be comfortable with your computer skills,especially advanced EXCEL and Power Point.  You will have to do presentations to get review our projects of get anything approved."
good,I talk to commercial customers. I invoice there orders. I call them to see what they need and when. And I also wait on the retail customers and ring people up in the register. When u worked at O’Reilly I opened the store. Did the paperwork and the deposits and made sure everything got ordered right. I have closed the store.
good,"Good team building, great management employee relation, great opportunity for advancement, great training programs, inventory management, coaching, coaching training and mentoring, great sales training, great store to corp comnmunication"
good,"Acknowledgements given regularly, reviews and rewards on the regular. Work with high degree of independence with no micro-managers here. Company provided meals for safe record, birthdays and productivity goals being met or exceeded."
good,Stressful work environment at times but overall easy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to work in mechanics. Customer service is best if you like working with people.
good,"Great place to work with multitudes of opportunity if you put the work in. People really make your success, so if you understand people and can motivate and help grow then you can easily move up in this growing, great culture, small box retailer."
good,"The beginning of my automotive and retail career."
good,Good place to have a first job. All task are easy to do. There is a guideline for advancement there. A lot of locations to work at. Learn a good amount of basics for automotive inquires and customer service.
good,Go to work and clock in. Stock  the shelves and make them as full as possible. Help customers with any questions they may have. Look up prices. Order parts.
good,Wouldn't have left if I wasn't moving. Enjoyed the people I worked with and the environment created by the company and employees. I would work for Autozone again if the circumstances were correct.
good,Working at Auto Zone gives you the ability to learn about cars through hands on training. The company provides all the right tools needed to do your job.
good,"Many things need to be fixed, however, it starts above my manager.  And it is not in the cards.  In the area I live, it is not a bad paying job, but not great either."
good,"Great environment to learn stuff, grow within the company into a management position. Auto zone offers comprehensive training and opportunities for growth."
good,Great company to work for outside of the pay The benefits are great. The co-workers are good. It's s very relaxed place to work for. You can definitely advance if you want to but the pay is not worth it
good,"I love delivering parts for them, and getting to know where they are for more deliverys, it was a good place to work but needed better pay, worked like 7 months and never got a raise, but other then that i liked it."
good,Nice place to work but not a whole lot of room for advancement. Benefits could be a bit more competitive and the need a better business model to accommodate growth...but overall a good company.
good,"Fun place to work, especially for a first job. I enjoyed learning new things about cars and their parts. I would work here again if they paid enough to sustain my standard of living."
good,"typical day was just like any other retail experience.  If you enjoy your job or the people you work with, its a great way to make some okay money if you dedicate yourself to hard work and commitment."
good,I enjoyed this job. The only thing management is not fair and pick sides and dont get people in trouble when they need to only to some.  I loved doing what i did and would recommend other people to work there.
good,"All in all, AutoZone was an enjoyable work experience, with a good group of people to work with. If you are not mechanically savvy, this position will give you the opportunity to learn all you can. to me that was one of the best parts of the job, the ability to learn about things i would have not otherwise thought to learn. The hardest part of the job, mentally, would be, handling the criticism that comes with upset or rude customers that either expect you to know about vehicle mechanics and degrade you when they realize your learning as you go, or talk to you as if your dumb because you're a female working in that field. Not every customer is like that obviously, but as with any job in customer service, you will inevitably experience some sort of negative encounter."
good,Met great people and learned tons of things. Great industry to get into and you’ll meet tons of people that will teach you so many different ways to test and repair things.
good,Good job if you know cars and like to work with people. worked with a lot of good people. liked helping people to get what they need to work on their cars
good,"It is a good place to work,you must be able to learn quick since you are dealing with car parts and get a lot of crazy questions. The manegment was really helpful."
good,AutoZone is one of the best places to work and I would still be there if the pay was higher. I found that the Managers and District Managers were very positive and wanted you to do well. Holidays off and the slow days gave plenty of time to learn and keep your location looking good.
good,Even though I haven't worked for them in some time. I would consider returning to AZ. I loved the culture they had as a company. The people I worked with were great and helped me out in a difficult time of my life
good,"fast paced, always something to do and new things to learn. Fun environment to work in. Lots of things to learn about parts and vehicles. New tests each month to teach you new information."
good,Having to work on management tasks between customers can be a challenge depending on the store you are working at. Time can go by fast or slow depending on sales.
good,"AutoZone is a productive but challenging place to work. It has its days where it can be rough due to coverage. The overall training can be improved and once that's done it would improve the company. I really enjoy working with my shop owners, my customers is what makes me love what I do."
good,Not a bad job but pay isnt what it needs to be! Started and within 2 weeks became manager but barely any pay increase! Pretty easy work but management is expected to do too much for too little pay.
good,Sometimes it can be busy. Sometimes it can be slow. Do your best to stay productive. Get to know those around you. Learn Spanish fast because the majority of our clients here in the Central Valley in California are Spanish speakers that are limited on English.
good,"Auto Zone is some what flexible with hours for part time employees. Good over all work environment and gives you plenty of opportunities to develop your skills needed to be successful. Customers get to know you and vice versa you get to be family. As one of the managers there you were never able to get a full weekend off. If so I would still be there. If you come to work with some initiative/effort you will do fine, as with any job you do have to perform not just show up."
good,It's a fun safe working environment I do love   The people I work  With From the customers to my  Employees I couldn't have a better 1st job then on a zone
good,its a great place to work and to learn about car and trucks learning how to install batteries wiper blades and lights troubleshooting and code reading.
good,During my brief period working here i learned alot and was a good early job but the management was not great and could be improved. I know it was just my store but if management was the same through out all autozones then i can guarantee that it wouldn't be a career there.
good,Auto Zone was a great place to work but the lack of hours and promoting that they were hiring did not mix well. While employed there I had minimum hrs
good,"training  was done on individual basis, all employees  trained on line. day started out answering phones , taking orders from customers, locating  and having parts delivered. work place was casual sometimes was hectic but enjoyable. answering phones could get hard with only two people and 4 phone lines. customer relationships and fellow employees was the best."
good,The work environment was very relaxed and comfortable which helped productivity when things would normally start becoming stressful. Management was also great.
good,A pretty good place to work if in a management position or if you just like helping customers. Decent benefits. 20% discount on hire. Quarterly 30% discount weekend.
good,Decent co-workers. Good supervisors. I was only a temp but from what I heard the benefits are alright and vacation time is flexible. Employees feel appreciated and important. Safety first and customer satisfaction were main goals.
good,"Can get somewhat hectic, but is for the most part laid back. Can teach a lot about car parts. Friendly hard working staff. Starting pay is low, however."
good,Organizing the shelf's by front facing all products check out all customers and treat them with respect. stocking shelf's on Wednesday's. The hardest part of my job was finding the parts customers needed because there's so many part numbers for the same type of part they're just for different vehicles
good,A fantastic place to work! It's a pleasure to be able to service my community with their automotive needs and to work for a company that values their employees and offers retirement and insurance benefits.
good,"Gran enfoque en la capacitación, seguridad laboral y cultura como empresa."
good,"Well structured company, gives you all the tools needed to to the job. Regional Management did a good Job on supporting continuous training. Need to be more creative in producing strategies to increase commercial business."
good,"A great place to work and learn about car parts and car care. The pace is fast but everyone is willing to work with you to fulfill your goals. For a first-time or long lasting career, this will be a great start."
good,"I learned how to do inventory and fix quantities on hand."
good,not a bad place to work  the hardest part of this job is working with corperate management. I did enjoy working with all the garages and everything that I learned.
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for, however I do not believe they pay managers enough for the responsibilities entail."
good,The job was nice and were my fellow employees. Every now and then you would get a negative customer but most times people were super nice and grateful for the help and support.
good,it is a great place to work here specially if it is your fist time experiencing in an automotive field . great customer service and lots of understanding for employees. its good for all.
good,this was one of my favorite jobs ever. i learned so much about cars in the time i was there. the management will usually be very kind and helpful. working in the warehouse provided many options for growth. this is a great job if ur get along with many kinds of people and like hands on projects. best part of the days has to be getting to go be hands on with cars. the training is very extensive and long but worth the time spent. worst part/best part as well was m store is 24hrs so there was plenty of hours to be given out.
good,"This job was ok in every aspect. They certainly didn't have the most efficient or ""complete"" workplace, but they always manage some how. Overall what Autozone lacks is a helpful and structured management, and new hire system."
good,Autozone is a great place to work at. The staff are very professional and every tasks is well explained. The environment is fun and always steady. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to try it out.
good,"Fast pace job very involved with customers."
good,The work place was a good environment to work in. It was educational. The Co-workers were some times difficult to work with at times. Other then that it was a good place to work for.
good,autozone is a good company for people who are interested in cars you can learn a lot from there if you apply yourself and remain punctual. ggood place
good,"loved it. good people and great employees. its simple, come to work on time, help customers and take care of your daily duties. somedays can be slow but most of the time its very busy. busy days make the time go by."
good,"As with most jobs, there are obstacles to figure out. Sometimes there are hoops to jump through. It wasn't a horrible job, I just outgrew what they could offer."
good,Low pay and lack of raises. Good work environment and helpful system to provide better customer service. Focus is on making additional sales but at times I feel the customers just can’t afford any extra money.
good,"Working for this company is truly a joy. Fast paced, yet fun. I would Recommend applying for a position if you would like to start, or advance a career involving automotive interest."
good,sometimes work was easy sometimes stressful depending on the customer but as long as you had a good attitude your day should go by pretty smooth. co workers are nice
good,"is a fairly good job, "
good,A typical day starts slow at first but then picks up after 9am. You could have a lobby full of people and it get stressful. But if you take your time you can get through them with no problem.
good,"My supervisor is an excellent example of how a supervisor should be. Wish I had more like him. The folks I supervised were all good people."
good,"I started working at Autozone in the year 2012, good place to start at. they have the opportunity to let you move up very fast. The higher position you are, the more responsibility on you. and of course, the more stress over you too. The environment is so friendly, I can tell we are one family there, Autozone now is my second home."
good,"Let me start by saying Autozone is a great company to work for and the job security is awesome.  The days went smooth mainly because of the system that the company runs by.  First thing in the morning before we had to open the store me and my fellow managers came together and gave all of our team jobs for the day and we made sure we completed each task as a team while still assisting customers.  I enjoyed the fact that Autozone had a system that made even the toughest day seem not as bad.  The hardest part about Autozone, which wasn't actually a problem for me, is the fact you are on your feet all day now some people wont be able to deal ive heard alot of complaints about that but its part of the job.  Overall Autozone is a wonderful company and i wouldnt mind going back."
good,"The biggest complaint would probably be scheduling. You rarely get two days off in a row, and it isn't uncommon to close one night and open the next morning. The sales goals can be a little silly sometimes, but depending on your manager, there isn't too much backlash if you miss goals."
good,"ive been there a short time, people are great but its a little hard learning how to work the computer to look up the car parts and where they are in the store you will have to ask a lot of questions."
good,"Knowledgeable management and staff, decent & flexible work schedules, customer- friendly work environment, job security, new experiences for underqualified and average workers."
good,"Trabajo arduo,atencion a clientes como supervisor delegaba actividades y verificaba que se realizarán."
good,"i worked at autozone for 3 years and the first 2 were great. Great manager, great employees, regular 8 hour shifts. My last year there we had a new manager and that's when the job went from being good to being stressful. I worked at a location next to a major highway so it was constantly busy but with the manager i had my first 2 years it was a breeze, customers in and out and days went by fast. With the new manager everything felt like it got worse, the workplace moral got low, good workers quit or transferred to other locations because of his lack of leadership skills and managing skills. I was full time so my 8 hour days turned into working 6 days a week and some of those days they were 12 hour shifts back to back (9am-9pm sunday and then 5am-5pm monday) because of how understaffed we were because most of the employees transferring or quitting due to not being able to transfer. So basically what was a great job my first 2 years turned into a nightmare my last year there because of bad management. if you have a good manager the job is great, if you dont then it'll be a stressful job."
good,"Customers can be very difficult. Even though you'll be told in the interview that automotive knowledge is not required, it is essential to do your job well. Customers will come in and call expecting you to answer questions about their vehicles. Pay is extremely low for management positions and the hours aren't consistent each week. Overall the job is alright but definitely not somewhere I plan to work forever."
good,Una empresa con crecimiento en el país muy grande y rápido
good,I liked working with this company but I no longer wished to work in retail sales. I left because I was offered an office position close to home that I knew I would be more happy with.
good,this job was one that I did like but  I hade to leave for a better paying job to support my house hold. they had some fair beneifiets. I would recommend this to friend and family.
good,need more hours to help support a family.  some weeks I get 17 hours some week 20 but it not good to come in four hours a day.  Also needs a little more training before going out to do the job.
good,If your young and hungry it’s a great job. Very fast pace job with great Benifits.there is a good working environment when you have the right management in place
good,It’s a good place to work at. They teach you anything you need to know. Many opportunities to move up. I prefer it as a part time job while going to school but some people find it to be a good career.
good,I worked in the commercial department at Auto Zone and sometimes helped out the front counter. I learned how to look up parts and print the invoices. I had a great manager and I enjoyed my driving job at Auto Zone.
good,"Usually, you help customers find parts, work the cashier, help customers put on wipers or put in oil, stock truck items, do overstock. It's fast paced at times, but it can really help you learn about cars fast!"
good,"Had to multi-task so we can provide the best customer service to all customers. Had to order part's/invetory. I had the responsibility to go on conference call's two day's a week. I did weekly performance reports on my team and our sale's. I made sure our store was cleaned/maintained on a daily bases so our customers got the best experience everyday they walked in. I deligated responsibility to other employees so we were able to work as a team to provide the best customer service. We went above and beyond for our customers by installing batteries, light bulbs, and wiper blades. I was given more responsibility for my position then most. I followed banking procedures."
good,"For me personally, this was the best job I have had so far in regards to learning about something that I had no knowledge in (cars and the parts in said cars). It was challenging for me which I loved, and it was also fun to meet new people and also learn new material from them. The chemistry between the employees was great we all got along and there was never a dull moment while working at this autozone store."
good,"muy buenas personas, se apoyan mutuamente y te apoyan en todo las dudas que tengas."
good,"Autozone was a fun and fast paced place to work. Management was always nice to work with if you needed a day off and was scheduled due to family issues, or working another job."
good,Auto Zone restricts us from commenting on Auto Zone workplace.  We are not allowed to talk about the position or what we do on a daily basis.  The only thing I can say is it is very busy.
good,Autozone is the first place to offer me an employment opportunity after my retirement from the United States Air Force. I am grateful for the opportunity that the company offered me and the management at that I have met at all levels are phenomenal leaders and always put their customers first. It is an excellent place to work and I would recommend working there.
good,"Walking is always feels welcoming. Most to always will be told to front face or mop when there is down time, not to mention always make at least 10 buckets to sell before the end of the shift. Sometimes when you get caught up with a part that the customer doesnt know or figure out you might look for it until you find it , the customer always comes first.. as stressful as it is there are always rewarding moments."
good,Good environment. Great place to stay in the job market. Competitive pay with usually friendly staff.. thier system is easier to use than the competitors. Also product availability is a lot better. Only downside is having 2 sperate lines. One line for checking out and another for looking up parts. Also a good majority of the people hired there are new to the work force so urgency is not thier priority.
good,it is a very quick paced job. you should always stay busy. its not a bad place to work tho and you can always move up quick and even relocate homes when you move up 'I WILL BE' 'SAFE TODAY'
good,I like that it wasn't easy and that there was plenty of room for growth.there Point system is not like any other job i've worked at before. I'm not sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing.
good,Fun place to work. Fast pace environment. Easy to become knowledgeable in the automotive industry easy to learn as you go. Great place as a first time job
good,"On Mondays we rotate, in which I either help customers while everyone else puts trucks away or I put truck while so one helps the customer. Any other day, I help customers, ring them out, straighten up the store, and clean up at the end of the day."
good,I loved the people I worked with and the manager is a very hard worker that tries to keep the store in the best shape possible. The customers were great.
good,"this company has it's finger on the pulse of the auto parts industry. well managed, but a bit too micro-managed. they want to be the wal-mart of the auto industry, they won't let their managers manage the stores. they want to oversee everything from corporate office. big brother is always watching."
good,"A typical work day was to serve customers needs about their vehicle. This included reading the check engine light, changing a battery, or looking up specific parts for their vehicle and grabbing them from the shelves."
good,"Aprendi mucho en esta empresa, el sistema y la administracion estan bien estructurados muy facil de aprender, mis colegas estaban capacitados para su puesto, lo que mas me gusto es el sistema que se maneja es muy facil de aprender"
good,I enjoyed delivering parts to the different mechanics and being able to supply them with parts in a very timely manner. This company was amazing to work for and I would do it again.
good,"Great culture & customer service great training in inventory & loss prevention, P&L statements daily customer interaction & daily commercial accounts problem solving."
good,good hours and great team. Autozone has great benefits. Friendly customers and good rewards for good work. Flexible schedules and vacations. Strict dress code!
good,When i enter that store you always feel welcome i really like the job because i was always a hard worker. That job i think its a men job but hey. I live to work and i can work anywhere. I live meeting new people and learning new thing
good,"Los compañeros son siempre muy serviciales, buenas personas y siempre te ayudarán cuando lo necesites. "
good,"Autozone is a good place to learn a ton of information, but the pay isn't that great for all that you have to deal with. The hours vary a lot and you have to meet quotas for certain items."
good,"En DataZone el ambiente es muy bueno, tenemos valores muy importantes que si siguen la empresa y trabajadores."
good,"I loved my job, it just has gotten to the point I can't handle part of the job anymore. There are a lot of men that work for the company that make it harder for me to do my job. Like I said it can be a fun place to work at with the right team memebers"
good,"Great job, you must love automotive industry, obviously! Helping people out all day with vehicle issues is great, but the novelty soon wears thin.  everyday is a learning  experience and working with management is overall, okay."
good,"typical day at work would include locating correct parts for customers, setting planograms, preparing bank deposits. processing returned merchandise, returning returned parts/merchandise to the correct location. Receiving daily shipments from Fed Ex and local hub, ensuring the merchandise was added to the inventory. The culture was a good one, diversity was a big part. The hardest part of working there was trying to assist customers who did not want a female helping them."
good,AutoZone is a great pace to work. You will learn so much working here. Room for growth is very promising. Management cares and will help you succeed!!!
good,Inspect truck and trailer to safely deliver products to stores in various locations and states. Safely deliver products and pick up returns to bring back to Distribution center.
good,Quick paced can be fun to work sometimes but overall its just busy work that is pretty repetitive. Discount is nice but only if you work on cars and my only issue is for the work i do i felt like i wasnt getting paid enough while other people my same job title are getting paid more than me. Its a corporation so the people that decide your pay dont get to see you work.
good,"Good culture and people to work with. Friendly hard working team members, customer satisfaction is very well taught and followed daily. Good parts, good Fortune company"
good,Company was perfect and environment very good. We work long hours no extra cash for long hours. More sales then you will get more commission. All in all Auto Zone is a pleasent workplace to work for.
good,Overall a very financially stable company. Management will put high expectations on sales with some questionable sales tactic to use with the general public. If your a sales driven kinda person then you'd fit right in.
good,"Fun place to work at but I don't like the schedule so days early others late and I hate working weekends, it's also my first retail job so maybe that's how it works"
good,"I started as a red shirt, worked exceptionally hard, and became a store manager within 6 months.  If you take your training seriously, work hard on the up sale, and show up for work in uniform and on time, the sky is the limit."
good,I enjoyed getting to work with cars and parts while also getting some learning experience in. I was able to advance into a management position after 1 year and would have stayed if they could have worked with my schedule.
good,they have great benefits in dental and medical. they have long hours more than 40 hours a week. monthly meetings with DC to talk about our achivements and what we could improve.
good,I traveled more than I cared for was demanding job. Lots of training not alot of opertunity for advancement.  Main focus is hvac and lighting was good company
good,The company hires good people. Makes sure you have some basic knowledge about automobiles. They have an online inventory of training modules that lets you learn as much as you want to about car repair.
good,"I'm still learning things at this corporation. I've dealt with a manager who does not how to treat their employees, and with plenty of managers who are eager to teach me how to do things properly."
good,"Making sure that all the managers were focus on the daily task and aligned the day with the P&L."
good,Fast paced job. Must have good temper skills due to alot of rude cutomers. A great job to learn your way around a car and has a lot of room for growth.
good,Good place to work.  Generally very flexible with hours and time off if needed.  Good work environment.  Lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"AutoZone, overall, is a great company to work for!  Truly a company that operates according to the Values set forth, and keeps their values foremost in the daily routine."
good,"I was hired right after I graduated high school and I'm very thankful for the skills I learned and was able to improve. The manager is very friendly, easy to talk to and will work with you the best he can to ensure that you feel comfortable working there. There is always something to do and that store really does dedicate itself to customer satisfaction."
good,Management was great there. Pay for a manager is really low to have alot of responsibility and only get $11 a hour for pay. Overall I liked working here just not the pay! I would have stayed forever of it was not for that.
good,"At Auto Zone a normal day for me is wrapping batteries , stocking shelves and helping angry customers . For some reason I manage to be the only one to calm down any angry customer. I spent my shift organizing things and solving customers problem."
good,this is great place for a student to work. you learn a lot on the job about auto parts. management was always good for me when I needed a day off it was easy enough to switch shifts with another co worker. customers can be rude at times
good,"If your interested in learning and working with cars and customers, Autozone is a good place to work. The job work/life balance could be better, and personal relationships with higher up managers could also use work."
good,"A typical day is helping customers and putting returned items to the core bin or back on the shelf for sale again. Checking batteries alternators and starters every once in a while check the control modules. Interesting if you like cars and checking parts easy work, plus they have a book to help you and the computer will tell you what to do step by step or your manager can assist if you don't know."
good,"Great Company to work for... learned a lot about automotive,teamwork, and sales.. co workers friendly. the hardest part of the job is knowing all parts.. the best part of the job is seeing the customer happy about a problem being solved"
good,"Great place to work, fair pay, good hours, plenty of opportunities for advancement, family oriented company, great place to learn about automotive components and how they work."
good,I love to work in a team environment and my attendance and punctuality are outstanding. I can run a pallet jack and a forklift very well I've had about three years of experience driving a pallet jack and about a year-and-a-half on a forklift. I respect my coworkers and treat my co-workers the way I would want to be treated. And I would love to have a chance to work with your company.
good,"Working for Auto Zone r for 12 years. I have reached my goal in taking all the opportunity that this company had to offer me. I am not unhappy where I work, just looking for different challenges and something new."
good,work hard get recognized can get overtime learned to work on my car. Management was always willing to help if you need time off. always had a smile on when working
good,This job has trained me to meet customer satisfaction. Most workers were eager about their job and willing to do whatever to build to business to success.
good,"good place to work, never the same day twice. good people to work with. managers do an amazing job. its a nice place to work."
good,Autozone is a great place to work for a retired mechanic or student attending tech school. If you can handle customer service and are a ppl person you will do great
good,"Customer service is number one in retail and at Autozone that is no different.  My day vary, one day is a lot of deliveries for our commercial accounts and the next could be one or two deliveries.  On Tuesdays we get our deliver truck in which is basically restocking our shelves.  I also do a major part in the plano's, which is the stores resets/redo's of the merchandise.  I also pull recalls every Friday to get ready for the new plano's that come out on Monday.  I take phone calls from customers and of course handle customers who walk in the door."
good,I think it is fun working here because you get to learn a lot of different car parts about cars and it gives you a better knowledge of what to replace on a car.
good,"Very focused on customer satisfaction, and having the best part at the best price. Hour of operation are great and they have a huge network to find what you need."
good,it was a good work place .had good learning to move up.the management time was good . part I didn't like was working nites . the most enjoyable was always doing something new
good,"Walk in and there is a lot going on, already have to start stocking items, I've learned to be organized through this job and to follow precise orders, the hardest part of this job is truck days, and the most enjoyable is having very awesome and smart co-workers."
good,"Managers are willing to work with employees."
good,"I strive at my job to be the best I can and take care of my customers in a timely manner.. I enjoy helping co-workers, but as a whole Autozone could do better for hiring store management"
good,Autozone was extremely useful for teaching me more advanced Customer Service skills. It also helped me further my knowledge of mechanical engines and components.
good,"Fun good place to work, pay is a little on the low side fast pace always busy. Management  very good upper Management very good."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, muy estable y en crecimiento. Desafortunadamente es difícil crecer en ciertas áreas debido a la buena estabilidad que tiene. Horario de trabajo cómodo."
good,"This job was good. It was kind of a typical job, but it was interesting. You didn't know who was coming the store and what kind of conversation you was going to have. The one thing I can say about this job I learned how to deal with a lot of different personalities."
good,"very fast moveing job"
good,AutoZone is one of the worlds largest auto parts retailers which strives to expand business into new job markets.  The small team environments in each store are like small families.
good,"A typical day at work is fairly simple, so long as you're driven and enthusiastic to be there. While maintaining a tidy and presentable sales floor, we as Part Time ""Red Shirts"" will acknowledge and help the customers with any questions they have and assist with what they're working on, providing excellent customer satisfaction to everyone that comes into the store. "
good,Working at AutoZone is an easy job in terms of physical labor. I enjoy helping customers and I enjoy even more convincing them to buy products that they don't plan on buying when they walk in.
good,"I like cars and helping people, seemed like a great fit for me. I usually worked the evening shift so it was a bit slow and I would usually be in charge of cleaning up and restocking. But occasionally we'd get that last minute walk in. I liked it, wished there was more room to move up within the company."
good,I enjoy working for AutoZone because I get to work in an industry I with which I like to associate. My tasks include driving a company vehicle to deliver parts to shops and helping customers when they shop in store. AutoZone has a great system for selling and delivering parts and it's nice to meet new people and do something different each day.
good,"llegas a tiempo, o tratas de hacerlo, si hay clientes esperando a ser atendidios les das prioridad a los que van por alguna pieza o  adquirir algun material para mantenimiento de su auto y en segundo lugar  los que estan alli para los servicios gratis como son escaneo de vehiculos, revision de sistema de arranque y carga, etc., si no hay clientes o cuando te desocupas vas a tu area a seguir con alguna tarea pendiente o simplemente a ver de que manera puedes mejorar el desplazamiento del producto esto es un correcto etiquetado, producto limpios y en su lugar, si tienes algun ciclocuento (conteo fisico contra existencia en el sistema) pendiente lo realizas o si algun parte de tu area cambio de productos o de precio o de orden, tambien hay que realizarlo."
good,This company is a shining star in a world of dark clouds. the only this that i have an issue with is the fact that the pay could be raised just a little bit.
good,"The Autozone in brodheadsville is a very good location to work and be a part of. We have amazing sales and projected numbers, we have taken most of the customer base in the area, The store is always spotless and clean and every item is neatly placed on shelf every night. The store manager works so hard to keep it that way he basically lives in the store and has sacrificed a lot for the company and every single worker their from the managers to drivers are like family to each other, we all help each other out and no drama or anything, you can go to work expecting to get a lot done, help customers out the best you can and still know your gonna  have fun and enjoy your day."
good,"Slow advancement and low salary made this job difficult to maintain. Needed better pay to help support my family, employees were great, just needed better pay."
good,"Very hard working, always at work on time.  Will come in to cover other persons shifts, when they call off. Work well with management and other co-workers."
good,Any position besides store manager is hard to justify the pay for the amount of hours. But if one is motivated they can advance as far as they want.
good,The work is fine and the customers can get a little interesting. Not a bad place to work if you enjoy retail and talking about cars.
good,"customers can be a little overwhelming, but with the right team work and employees, it makes it helpful to help them. Being organized helps work task easy."
good,"like working around automotive sales helping people . with sales parts trouble shoot their problems."
good,Autozone is an awesome place to work. Helping out people solve their automotive problems is great. Team members are also grreat to work with.
good,"The company itself is great! The management at the lower levels is where it starts to fall apart. It is like any other retail, sales and up-sales are important. Some, not all, managers are not qualified to do their jobs and upper management is aware of the problems but do nothing to change the problems. Would rather keep poor managers than keep the great workers. They tend to hire inexperienced or unqualified employees. Management says they want you to follow company policy but rarely enforce policy or choose which policies, an employees to enforce the company policies on."
good,coming in to work a starting up the computers and calling accounts to tell them of the deals for the week. receiving order to take to mechanics.
good,Very good company with excellent benefits and pay package. daily routes and plans were provided. dispatching could have been better but i guess they really had a transportation department that had limited experience in their field.
good,"A typical day at Autozone would be as soon as I clock in, I am ready to work in any task that is handed to me. I make sells and help customers, answer phone calls, mange inventory, do general maintenace, as well as drive to other store pick up products and deliver them."
good,Being a delivery driver is a great way for not so social people to be productive.  I like it very much.  I like the chance to be a free thinking problem solver.
good,If you're a car guy like I am or just starting out in a field involving automobiles this is a great place to work for. While the pay is typical with any retail job working in this environment taught me a lot.
good,"A normal opening day at work would start off by disarming the alarm, making sure all cameras are functioning correctly, and counting the safe/registers to verify they're balanced. Once all that has been completed we go on about our normal duties such as helping customers, putting up parts that have been received."
good,"it was a good job and I leave because I moved to United State, I worked from 8 to 5, I learned many things such as to use different computer programs, helping customers"
good,"for a sales job there is a lot of politics, management says its all about costumers but you have a quota. other then that theres a lot of room for you to move up if you want to"
good,"This job is very physical as well as mentally challenging. Testing customer's parts and making recommendations for repair takes knowledge and a willingness to appreciate the customer's situation. Cleaning and auto parts store is one of the hardest tasks, as plenty of chemicals and oils can be spilled. Telephone sales can be challenging, as you cannot see the part a customer might be describing. Management can seem overwhelmed sometimes, as there are 100's of thousands of different parts and products stocked in one store, but most are vehicle specific."
good,"A typical day at consisted of customer service and daily tasks. Autozone is a good place to work,where I learned quite a bit. Management is helpfull and always there with an open door policy."
good,"Everyday I have between 15 and 20 shops ordering parts and needing delivery scheduled. I manage 10 employees"
good,"I do enjoy working for Autozone. I work part-time, but I've been trying to get full-time. The managers are great and my co-workers are very helpful. The managers are very quick to resolve any issue in the store."
good,Great job and great people to work with especially my boss is a great boss that takes care of his employees and my job is simple but not easy at the same time
good,AutoZone is a great place to work. especially when you have an interest in automobile knowledge. And want to grow with a fast paced company.
good,"Autozone is a nice place to work, however there is very poor compensation such as pay and benifits.  their idea of holiday pay is if you work a holiday then you get an extra day off during the work week, there is no double time."
good,"Most of the day is spent helping customers and answering phones, looking up and pulling parts. Inventory maintenance, like pulling overstock, and putting parts away, are also done daily."
good,"Typical Day would consist of calling on Automotive Shops, New Car Dealerships."

good,"Auto Zone is a nationwide company with locations all over the United States, one of the top lending provider of auto parts. Fast and courteous service has made them popular in the community, assisting neighborhoods with fundraisers and sponsoring national and local events."
good,"I've learned that i have gained a passion for cars whether its physically working/repairing on them and or just simply admiring cars. Co workers was a blast to work with as well as management. "
good,if you are look for quick hire this is a good place to start but it is not a career work place.  It is a great place to learn about the make and models of different vehicles but there is not a lot of money to be made even if you advance in the company.  Overall good place to work and if they paid more which there employees really deserve it would be the ideal work place.
good,"I went from Restaurant environment to Retail for a change of pace. "
good,"A typical work day you clock in take care of Customers and Train new employees and answer the phones making sure to get the right parts that customers are looking for. Then in between helping customers set new planograms or floor layouts for merchandise. Next I would make sure all paper work was completed for the day and call District Manager with any variances that were above or below the accepted amounts.  Hold team meetings when ever there was a problem that needed fixed and hold individual meets is necessary.  I learned how to wow customers with great customer service.  Make sure all returns were scanned and put away correctly, and make sure all stock was put away as it came in.  I loved doing inventory management and doing inventory for the district.  At times I would be moved to other stores when there was suspected theft and if there was any found report it to the District manager and the Loss prevention  manager.  If a store in the district was behind in setting new planograms or floor layouts I would help them get caught up as well as help them with their customers."
good,they are ok for a period of time but you have a problem with a child like i did they are ok with it for a while and then decide its not important anymore
good,"A typical day involves helping customers to get the right parts for their cars and everything else that goes along with the part they needed in order to get the job done the first time without having to come back because we didn't recommend something to them."
good,"learned a lot about auto parts, co workers were friendly and always made sure we worked as a team, hardest part of the job was the occasional disgruntled customers that argued about the help we were trying to give them. Enjoyed working there everyday."
good,"A typical day at work was unlikely. There was always new customers, new demands, and different goals and task to achieve daily. I learned the value of team work, management skills, and overall a great way of understanding and communication with all persons who stepped through our door. My co-workers were very supportive with almost everything, including their constructive criticisms which I am never too shy to hear. The hardest part of the job was standing in one spot for numerous minutes/hours at a time. While I do like to attend to all customers needs, sometimes we got too busy to even think about multitasking and extra task, but that's where I learned the power of teamwork and a strong determination. The most enjoyable part of that job was my ability to help others (including co-workers) and trying to satisfy the needs of everyone to send them out with a SMILE!"
good,Typically I would help around 75-100 customers a day with all sorts of vehicular problems. also processed returns and placed orders for restocking low inventory items.
good,"AutoZone encourages a culture of One Store, One Team which promotes the idea that, regardless of what your job description is, everyone helps everyone else provide excellent Customer Service. I developed a good solid customer base and do miss my customers. AutoZone has developed a culture exclusive to the company with a variety of acronyms for many aspects of this culture."
good,"I spend my workdays selling parts, coaching employees solving problems for customers as well as staff members. The hardest part of the job is not being able to give hours to employees that want more. The most enjoyable part of my job is training staff members and solving problems."
good,A typical day consisted of opening and closing procedures. Providing excellent customer service while running the day to day operations. I obtained an ASE parts certification. I managed up to ten employees a day. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers to ensure they had the parts they needed and get it done in a timely manner.
good,"My typical day would be to travel to whatever event I would be working. For instance, one of my favorite events would be the Museum of Science. I would go and set up for the event and then serve the customers of the event. I would also bus and clean the tables when they were done. My co workers were great and a pleasure to work with. I learned how to serve people with a style that is very professional. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with certain difficult customers because they always exist. However, just keep a smile on your face and that's it. The most fun part of the job for me was meeting new people, not only employees, but the people at the events."
good,"The position for this job was an experience that i have attained a lot of knowledge from, great environment to work in and great people, the most enjoyable part of my day was helping others."

good,"Very fun job, never knew what to expect during the day. Learned a lot of management skills on this job."
good,typical of a franchise its the same wherever you go with different management
good,"Autozone is a fantastic company with very good pay and incredible benefits, however after reaching the position of store manager there is very little chance of promotion as the company has a very long waiting list of employees awaiting promotion.  As a store manager I learned alot about how to successfully run a company and what to look for when hiring new employees and how to properly discipline employees when it is necessary.  The hardest part of the job was trying to run a store with only two people working at a time as it was company standard and upsetting customers because of the wait times.  The most enjoyable part was definitely the customers and helping them fix the problems with their vehicles."
good,My responsibilties at AutoZone on a typical day are.Pulling parts and placing them in there designated areas according to the routes.Once that part of the job is done then we are assigned to a route so that the stores are able to receive their parts in a timely manner to shipped out to customers.The co workers that I work with are easy going and fun to be around with.Manangement is strictly about business they oversee everything to make sure that the job is done correctly
good,"Very knowledgeable workers, broad amount of reading material from cars, motorcycles, diesel trucks, and improvement machinery. Ive learned a lot about combustible engines and am able to do my own repairs on most kinds of vehicles. Hardest part long hours with low wages. The older managers know how to run the stores as the new ones struggle most of the time. most enjoyable i must say is learning about cars and how to maintain your own vehicle when needed."
good,"Professional retail sales environment.  Continuous training and learning experience in auto repair, parts and service.  Experienced employees helping newer ones.  Manager's to deal with customer problems."
good,Selling car parts to individuals who would rather work on their own cars than let a mechanic do it.

Just busy all the time cause we're in the most busiest street in Orlando City and my bilingual abilities helped a lot in that store I helped a lot of people with there cars then got many good Compliments in the job and the work site online. I'd say the hardest part of the job was most customers we're for Jamaica, Haiti, Europe, Different parts of the world and had a very high accent Then was the computers updating all the time but I still was able to figure out the updates without any help. I am young and energized for work looking for a new Career to stay and get better in life."
good,had to sell in the call center push the parts not really a sales person
good,Everyday is something different and comes with its own challenges.
good,I enjoyed working for this company and with the employees. It gave me a lot of experience in inventory and sales.
good,"My typical day would involve pulling generated orders, pulling for local stores and staging the parts to go out. Details of the job would be customer service, resolving store and driver conflicts and ensuring the parts get out on time since it is the only time based program in the company. Middle management is there for us and tries to help us through most conflicts. "
good,"Rewarding job assisting customers and delivering parts to commercial accounts.  Management starves you for hours at times giving themselves overtime during the holiday season, left a bad taste in my mouth."
good,"Good place to work just not enough hours.People good learned how to pull parts from a list on the computer.Day consited of taking care of customer . Good days stay moving and not much down time. Bad days slow an not much to do.Co - wokers were good an good to work  with. The hadest patr of the job , would have to be lifting parts up while walking up the ladders.The most enjoyable is the people.Managers were good did what they needed to do."

I deliverd parts to the surrounding auto shops, installed batteries, windshield wipers, headlights. run engine codes and determind what was wrong with the customers vehical. stocked parts and done resets in the store and managed the parts and commercial counter."
good,"typical day starts at 08:00 am, the first truck comes with stock that includes car parts from the smallest to the largest size. we would check the invoice and match it with the stock that is physically present . after a check list is done and all the stock has been verified to be present with the right quantities,the stock is taken to its storage location in the warehouse, where they are classified via BIN number. this process would happen three times a day all year around. the place was managed by one person (top management) and had two middle mangers that supervised   "
good,Autozone was a great company to work for. I learned what it takes to be a manager in this store and went on from there. I became a manager and felt proud to serve the people who come for help. As a manager i made sure my co-workers where enjoying their job and keeping the store in shape as well as my part. School was hard to work with the work schedule. Meeting great people everyday was the best part of the job.
good,"Hired as a assistant manager, pleasant enviroment,learned more about cars than previously knew"
good,Working with the customer's and solving their problems.  The uniform was a plus knowing who was the mangers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the employees.

good,"A typical day at work is not unlike other customer service/retail businesses.  Some days you're busy, and some you're slow.  The atmosphere however, is set by the employees and their management team.  If you come to work with the intention of having a productive and fun day, everyone will eventually catch on and attempt to do the same.  While working here I've gained knowledge such as, How several different automotive systems work, How to troubleshoot those systems for problems and solutions, how to work on certain parts and systems of an automobile, how to maintain inventory accuracy and integrity, how to positively affect shrink and more.  The skills I've acquired from this job will help me obtain and maintain any job opportunity I desire in the future.  Management operated in a very efficient, safe, and employee-conscience way.  My co-workers and I worked hard everyday, by competing with each other to make a difference in the store we worked in.  By doing this constantly, we developed a strong bond that helped form a formidable team, as well as great friendships.  The hardest part of the job was learning about all the technical/mechanical aspect of a large variety of automobiles.  The most enjoyable part of the job also happens to be the hardest part.  Because this is the case, I never get bored, and there is always something new to learn."
good,"Co-workers were fun to be around and helpful."

good,A typical day at autozone is fast pace. I encounter many different personalites while delegating projects to sales associates. As one of the managers we must keep our store clean and customer friendly while completing our daily task.
good,customers are great and training is decent. just everyone is kinda boorish
good,Safety is number one on their list. They stressed that at very morning meeting. They watched us like a hawk I guess so we don't steal anything. I'm guessing that was a major concern of theirs. They did give us free lunches every time we met our safety quota and provided us with popsicles during the hot summer months.
good,I enjoyed working at AutoZone while going through school but now that i have finished I'm looking for a little more. If you are looking for full time employment then you must be flexible but if you like lots of hours during summer and less during winter(if you are in school) then this job is great.
good,"I work with a great bunch of people, some co-managers along with me and some csr's. It is a lot of work being a woman in a mans world but I have been able to stand my ground. My day starts off very busy with opening procedures and getting resisters set up in time for opening the store. Set assignments for staff and make sure we are all on the same page. I work not only in DIY, but assist Commercial as well. The hardest part of my job is completing opening procedures in 15 minutes, I can do it but wow. The best part of my day is working with staff that is like a second family."

I'm mostly to my self. Hardest part is trying to find the parts for customer at different location to keep customer happy. Enjoyable part is discounts on items"
good,If u dont kno anything about cars autozone is the place to go. they willl help u with anything you will need for your automotive needs
good,Working for AutoZone was fun on the most part. It definitely had huge advancement opportunities. I went from part time working 20 hours a week to Assistant Store Manager in about 6 months. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers. A lot of times AutoZone doesn't have a part for a lot of foreign cars. They have to be ordered or the prices are ridiculously high.
good,Great learning environment and fun place to start a career. Management is very helpful and gives you room to advance easily with hard work. Helps tremendously with people skills and communication skills.
good,"Enjoyed my time. Great management team. Had fun competing with other stores in sales incentive programs. Pay wasn't great, but I was a kid with a bit of an attitude."

good,When it comes to drivers..need to have better pay..as well as flexibility...i also work dyi and answer phones...managers should be more caring as well as better job training
good,Just looking for better money opportunity  it is a good place to work because of the culture one of the few companies that feel the customer needs are important

good,"For a job in retail and as a Hub Employee, this company isn't half bad. Yes there is always room for improvement, but I have never worked with a better crew of people considering the environment, in any of the 24 stores I have worked with and at."
good,I have nothing negative to say autozone was a good place to work. i worked there 7 years. the managers are laid back the shifts are all good. the pay is great
good,overall a great local postion - but just needed more money and need for overtime at that time in life.  store was great manager was great and tried to work with everyone
good,It was always great to work there. All of the bosses were very nice and treated me well. They always focused  on giving the customer a great experience.
good,I enjoy working with the public and making sales. Bringing in New Accounts. The job was fairly easy but at times challenging but there was always something to learn and it was  team and family oriented. Management was fair and equal. I enjoyed working there.
good,Love working for this company but it seems as though some of the management takes special privileges too far; opportunities for advancement depend on being in favor with management
good,Start off the morning by clocking in and seeing if we had a shipment in the back for the store to put up. then I go up to my manger letting him know I have arrived and going to the front of the store and start greeting the customers that have walked in the store and offer any advice that they would possibly need. I will also cash them out whenever they have found whatever they need or look up parts specifically for their vehicles. I have also learned what a lot of parts do and what there function is and how they can affect a vehicle if damaged and how to explain to customers if they are not certain or familiar. The workplace tends to be busy a lot of the time helping the customers and seeing what we can assist them with. The coworkers are great and same goes to the managers and we all treat each other with respect and help one another when ever needed. Hardest part is trying to get the customers assisted when there is not a lot of us working on the counter. The most fun is seeing the customers find exactly what they are looking for and letting them know exactly how to fix their vehicles as well.
good,"Pretty easy work, but you must have good Customer service skills. Must be able to tell customers about what they need and why. Also, you must be able to perform simple tasks."
good,Love working here was very high pace and allot of customers was one of the busiest locations I have ever worked at had to move and that's why I no longer work there
good,It was a very nice place to work. Get to meet a lot of new people daily. It seemed like i was learning something new each day. Learned more about different types of vehicles just by dealing with the customers.
good,"work day can be either busy or slow. depends on location and customers."
good,I learn a lot its a great company you will learn a lot they train you I enjoy my time working there the management team is a great team they promote from within.
good,Most positions are recieving/stocking and order selecting. It is fast paced production work with challenging demands. Management is constantly changing but all are great at what they do.
good,loved working for them Wish I could go back   might try again in march or june  I loved the schedule and the work  only hard day was truck day and handling customers on the same day
good,"Low raises for the amount of work done and advancements made. Brand new employees getting better raises, most managers making low income also. Usually stressful, managers crying at work and quitting. But I can handle a stressful environment well so I overall had a good time there. Managers usually didn't listen to recommendations to improve the work environment or problems unless a big scene was made about it. Then eventually something would be done."
good,"Autozone was a good learning experience for me. I would wake up at 2am and arrive at work by 3am. The job itself made me more disciplined. We would unload the truck then stock the store, placing all particular parts in specific locations. Sadly our store had to cut hours and I slowly got let go."
good,Dealing with customer who car is down and looking for a part to fix it become hostile if you give them the wrong part of bad customer service. This make this a detail oriented job.
good,"Good working environment. Lots of training and they will provide supervisor or management training if you show the aptitude, skills and desire to move up."
good,"During the warmer seasons, it can be very fast paced. You learn quickly about where the parts are located. You learn to help explain the parts and how they work. I like my stores management because the store manger is laid back but he keeps the store up tight and clean and makes sure the store is running top notch."
good,"Great place to learn about cars, auto parts, and providing customer service. Everyday is a new learning experience and you get to do hands too. Nice place to work."
good,"some of the store needs to improve the management team because some of them don know what they do. but the rest of the job is very nice, but all depend in war part of the USA you work."
good,Autozone provides needed training to ensure top notch customer service. Competitive pay and flexible schedule. Overall a great place to work and still have time for your family.
good,"I would start my day grouping all the items that I would need to pick and deliver to central valley stores.  Pick, sort and ship to stores.  I was in process of learning all of managements duties.  The job was slightly stressful but very enjoyable for me.  My manager was awesome."
good,I enjoyed working at autozone very much you learn so much about different items that you would never think you would need to know. The interactions that you come across meeting new people. Learned to install car batteries wiper blades very structured job.
good,Very cultured driven company great job security in an industry that will continue growing. Great job growth opportunities and ability to relocate nationwide. Company is very KPI driven everything has a report but allows you to understand more about the business.
good,I have worked at Autozone for a little more than four years while I was attending college and they worked with my schedule for the most part. I am only a part time employee.
good,Managing other co-workers to watch for customers and to help with stock every Tuesday and Fridays when stock comes in. also it can mean when you work addition hours on top of your schedule shift time.
good,"Good company for advancement.  Salary was good.  Learned a lot about automotive repair, and questions to ask when purchasing a vehicle as a female.  Enjoyed  working for the company."
good,"I enjoyed my time here and won’t forget all that I learned here at autozone, the mangers were always nice and understood that everyone has a bad thats what I think I loved the most about it"
good,helping customers cashier duties receiving phone calls placing orders  store replenishment changing wipers on customers vehicle checking battery cells and customer warranty on items really fun environment
good,it was a fun place to be but its not a place to be able to uphold a family the pay end hours just inst there i wish i could have stayed if i made a good living
good,"Compensation has changed and for those that are top performers it hurt their pay rates. The people are great, culture, but at times does not feel that we are valued. Great  training"
good,I really enjoyed the people at AutoZone the breaks weren't very long they really learn you ALOT there and learn you how to operate equipment that I never knew I could operate.I really liked all my supervisor's and I really learned a lot from this work pkace..
good,"great company to work with. so far have no major problems. staff is good, customers can be a little rude but there is always those that come and brighten your day"
good,Honestly my job is pretty awesome. Everyday I learn something new while working at Autozone. It's a great feeling going to work knowing you're helping someone out and helping yourself out as well. I've enjoyed my time with this company.
good,Typical day at AutoZone is making sure all the parts that came in from the truck is put in the correct place. Counting the drawers at the end of the day to make sure the correct amount of money is in the drawers. Most importantly helping out customers with their needs with car parts.
good,"I worked at many different stores, like my job, pay wasn't great, no real acknowledgement for jobs done well. Not easy to move up in the company. Left for more money"
good,Every day was fairly pleasant. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the repetition. I enjoyed my opportunity to help people fix issues. Or to be able to point them along the right path to get them back on the road.
good,good working environment and very educational for people who want to expand on customer service or in the automotive field.  Very friendly work environment and employees are team based.
good,A great place to work if your in school or are looking to get into the automotive industry. The work environment is positive and encouraging. Online classes help you develop the knowledge needed to help guests.
good,"fun friendly and customer service, online training management was great, stock was high on how company and things were ran. Overall company as a good company to work for"
good,handled daily customer issues with thier cars. analize the issues and sold the correct part to customer. I learned about the use of different parts to cars work was all about teamwork.
good,I helped out customers with locating parts they need for their vehicles. Restocked shelves when there was a delivery and made sure the store was clean. I enjoyed working there meet a lot of good people.
good,A good place to learn to manage employees.  Autozone teaches managers how to write a schedule and to make coverage's for employees.  It also teaches you how to delegate tasks to make sure that daily tasks are executed.
good,"Learn a lot about vehicles and was a good work environment fast pace and fun, great customers and great people to work with and if you aren’t the greatest with car you learn a lot fast"
good,Autozone very concentrated on their culture of putting the customers first and developing their employees so that they can grow sales and develop a bench of potential managers. They prefer to promote from within rather than hire outside of the company. It is a very fast pace and there always are tasks to be done between helping customers.
good,AutoZone lives up to its core company values. Cares about people. Embraces diversity. Helps team succeed. Energizes others. Safety is the biggest priority.
good,Very good workplace and on the job training. Co workers are very helpful and patient with on the training as well. I had a very good work experience at Autozone
good,"just not enough pay or hours needed more hours."
good,"Definitely a good place to work if your interested in cars. I've learned much from my years working there. The jobs there aren't hard, but can be challenging."
good,"Depending on the time and day can be very busy. Customer can be irritable but that is best their car needs fixed, if you can over look that easy job if you can be friendly"
good,It was a learning experience on quite a few levels. it definitely helped build my leadership skills and gave me opportunity. the most enjoyable part of working for Auto Zone was being able to work around people and making them want to come back because of great customer service.
good,was good work experience feedom of not staying in store to work all the time and working with other stores in the company. good team work with other employees .
good,great place to work. Managers care about the employees but the pay should be better. I really enjoy helping the customers diagnose problems with their vehicles and making sure they get the right parts to fix the problems.
good,"Excelente ambiente labor "
good,Autozone is a great entry into the retail parts business. The company has a strong culture and values from beginning to end.  Great place to start work.
good,A typical day here is stocking parts and taking care of the parts counter. Making sure people find what they need and make the sale. Attach extra items that would normally be required while performing work on a car.
good,I worked for Autozone for about 7 years. I learned a lot and gained a lot of skills from this job. I started as just a sales associate and was able to work all the way up to assistant store manager.
good,The hardest part of the job was traveling 45 minutes one-way to work and passing 4 AutoZone stores along the way....Some of the part timers were just there to get a paycheck not really caring about anything but themselves.
good,Loved working here..I just want to further my career..The staff is very wonderful. They do make you feel like family..No major problems. They do offer benefits.
good,"I delivered auto parts to auto shops on a daily basis. Make a lot of friends.I also collected payments. Some parts like batteries were too heavy, but there was always a coworker or mechanic willing to help."
good,"Work pace is fair. Although I got my hours cut because they transferred in a new additional assistant manager, it’s still a good company in my eyes..."
good,Everyone welcomes you with open hands. They are all great people who make u feel like a family. There is no discrimination in the work place. And there is a perfect balance of work and downtime.
good,"If you can set a schedule that works for you consistently within the company, you'll do well. After some managerial changes shortly after my hiring and some rebuilding of the store staff, I enjoyed my time with AutoZone. The hardest part of the job is that, at its core, it's a customer service retail environment. You'll deal with disgruntled customers and corporate pressure like any retail chain. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people with their automotive problems and a little hands-on work when possible. If you're not good with following corporate metrics and don't enjoy car talk, your better served finding a different job. The pay is decent for a first job, and if stick it out long enough there is possibility for advancement, but only if you work for it."
good,Fun exciting environment to work in. Helping and working with others. Also come prepared for many different personalities working with customers. Overall good management and comfortable environment.
good,"Typical day was full of customers that needed your help and you were happy to help."
good,I have worked for autozone for 5 years and it was my first official job and they gave me the opportunity where others did not and its a great first job it will train you in customer service as well as cash register trained it is a great starter job if you are looking for a job right after high school.
good,Auto Zone is a great company to work for. It is a great place for entry level managers to learn basic management skills.Auto Zone is also a great place to grow with the company and is always looking to promote from within.
good,"Autozone is a good company to work for and a great team to be a part of. For full time employment, there are great benefits. The management will recognize those who are ready to advance."
good,Everything was fine working at the time I just had to go to school and they were not welling to work with that new Schedule I had to make so I put my two weeks notice in
good,"Autozoner employees with the international car parts retailer mainly work in a corporate capacity. Autozoner main job duties include customer service communications. Store support workers feature major departments like finance, human resources, marketing, store development, supply chain, and distribution"
good,I enjoyed helping customers.  I learned a lot about the retail community.  Management was good and coworkers were helpful.  Environment was nice and everyone did their job.
good,Well the company was a good company to work it wasn't a really the best place to work in all actuality but ultimately they give everything in order for the work place to be peaceful.
good,if you like helping customers and talking to them about their automotive problems this is a job for you.  They have a really good computer system making it easy to look up parts
good,This was a great job I learned how to deal with customers making sales on top of learning to stock shelves and basically starting from the bottom and working my way up to bigger roles on the job.
good,This company worked around my school schedule and I am happy they gave me the job opportunity being so young. Here we did a little bit of everything..
good,"Audit cash registers, counting and maintaining petty cash, verify customer returns, review previous days returns, monitor inventory status, maintain inventory on sales floor, monitor sales floor employees. "
good,Sales are key. Most all things are measured with reports. There are plenty of opportunities for moving up. You can also transfer if your willing to move or relocate
good,"When I worked for AutoZone, i was paid hourly. The work ethic is good and upper management strives to assist all employees to reach company goals. Training was intensive and helped to provide advancement opportunities."
good,"A typical day at work, working the truck quickly so all the part get put away correctly. I help customers in between putting parts away, to find the parts they need to by."
good,"I would recommend this as a job to someone who is willing to be in the heat and like to get their hands dirty. A typical day, there was no typical day. Everyday was different and full of surprises. You never knew what the day was going to bring you. Managers where awesome and always was there to help when it was needed. The job itself was not a difficult job it was more played back then anything. I really enjoyed helping customers that came in with an issue with their car and seeing the smile on their face is PRICELESS."
good,Great place to work but is very corporate and tightfisted with pay. Women that work there have to put up with so much from customers who don't think we have automotive knowledge.
good,Autozone was more like a family. The people there cared about your life outside of work and was a great place to work. If yiu were struggling with a job or task others would try to come and help if there was time and no customers in the store.
good,as a part sales manager I was on the front lines of customer service. I enjoyed the WITTDTJR challenges. the opportunities seemed very good with AutoZone. the culture was clear on mission
good,A typical day at Auto Zone was a fun one. I love helping costumers find what they need. I help checked engine lights and also insisted with installing headlights and tail lights. I was also in charge of the sales floor. I opened and closed the store most times. I helped stocked the shelves and helped keep the store clean. I learned how to interact with people and I learned how to lead a team also. This one job helped me talked to thousands of people everyday. My store was really busy most times. I'm use to getting any job done quickly. The hardest part I had to say was calming costumers down sometimes when things went wrong. Most of the incidents were that they bought a part from another store and it was wrong. I also was a commercial driver. I delivered parts to costumers shops and helped get anything on their task list. I would even to to the competition for parts.
good,"nothing bad to say, great place and people were friendly. great place to lean about atuoparts. I would most likely recommend to a friend. great place for students who who into the auto field for a part time job"
good,Company provides room for advancement dependent on the individual. Very flexible in upping management but it can also be stressful when managing numerous stores.
good,Auto zone is a corporately owned auto parts store.  It is a fast paced  and requires employees to be flexible.The hardest part of the job is meeting deadlines and the most rewarding part is setting goals and meeting them.
good,Good part time job while I was in the active us army. Was just part time to supliment my us army income. Was a good job overall especially with the 20% discounts on auto parts.

good,AutoZone is a great company to work for with lots of room to learn and grow! Everyday is a new experience as you will never know what may come your way next!
good,The company was great I feel like there's something else out in the work field that I should be focus on at this point in my life I'm a hard worker just trying to take my skills somewhere else AutoZone is a great company.
good,It’s good pay nice environment good benefits. As long as you stay on task you will be successful and keep your numbers up but there is not much room for growth .

good,"Great job! "
good,Busy I learned Auto Zone doesn't care like they used to about their customers because u cant help them like we use to they took the tools to help them
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, sometimes they understaff and expect you to pick up the pace which is ok if you have someone competent working with you.  Can be a little too much for the pay."
good,Typical part time job with a fun environment and great people. Would not hesitate to apply here as a place to work while going to school or to make a career out of.
good,"Promotions are there if you want them, very quick paced environment, fun personnel. I was able to learn so much from the job and the people around me that make the job that much more fun."
good,I stayed busy at Auto Zone and if ever I needed help my manager and co-workers were never hesitant to give me a hand. I still communicate with a few co-workers from the job.
good,For full time employee's the shifts would change. for part time it varied based on your availability.. i floated to multiple stores to get the extra hours i needed. The Auto zone employee's are great people . and you get to learn a lot about automotive parts.

good,The benefits were pretty good and the pay was decent but could be better for the amount of hours worked. Had to work 7 days a week when someone called out or the assistant didn't show up. Helping customers was fun but having to stand all day was tiring. A stool to sit on occasionally would be beneficial. On the job training for employees is better than for management.
good,If you have a passion for cars you will love AutoZone.  A company you can grown with.  Many people working there have been there for over 10 years.  It is very busy 7 days a week.  You can move into management quickly if you apply yourself.

good,This job help utilize and develop my knowledge and passion for cars of all types in the retail world. As a car enthusiast this job was great and as an employee this job was even better.
good,"While I felt that Auto zone was a good overall company to work for, I felt that attempting to advance in some areas were extremely difficult. It seemed increasingly difficult to move from being a general merchandising representative.

good,"Great friendly environment. Hands on experience. Teacher basic automotive skills such as replacing wipers, installing headlamps and batteries which can be useful in everyday life."
good,I liked working with the people there. Customers were great to deal with. This is a very hands on job. Should have basic knowledge of vehicles to be able to work there.
good,Nothing to say. It was easy work and fun to work. Don’t get me wrong one had to work but it wasn’t rocket science. Helping people wasn’t bad. At first I had a hard time because I didn’t know much about cars but once I learned how to use the computers to my advantage it was easy.
good,"At my store it was pretty busy which made time go by quicker, loved my coworkers and the discounts. When it was slow we could work and talk but I've heard some stores being very slow and boring."

good,"Assisting customers, as well as cataloging inventory on a daily basis, I learned more about car parts, and management. Management was amazing at AutoZone  they worked with my schedule while finishing school and working at Home Depot. The workplace culture was a helping culture. There was no real hard part to the job, I enjoyed the job while I was there and still continue to shop at my old employer to this day."
good,good for those beginning their work experience o the interested in automotive. good to get retail experience and to decide whether or not they like costumer service
good,I started this job at entry level and advanced often and quickly. The hardest part of the job is the stress of the deadlines and not going over hours.
good,Less hours then told but good work environment try to stay of head and out the way people who have been there longer knew some of the customers which was cool

good,Good workplace culture with a drive and commitment to service the customer. Regimented on process and procedures with a solid history of growth and success.

good,"Working for AutoZone was the best position I have had yet. Prior to getting the job, I knew nothing about cars, but now I know the basics of car parts and what their purpose if. Also my co-workers at the time were willing to help me with any questions or concerns that I had and we had fun while working. Lastly the customers that came in were very interesting, and I have learned a lot from them alongside learning from my co-workers."

good,"I advanced very quickly from a delivery driver to a Commercial Sales Specialist. I was willing to put forth the needed efforts to gain the knowledge, and the upper management was willing to give me a shot. Did veery well the first year, then they wanted more and more sales generated. They let me go, brought in a veteran man from Advance Auto, and the commercial department quickly closed. I learned alot, but anyone can learn anything, i believe, if you're willing and the necessary tools are provided."

good,It's a easy job if you know your Parts. If you don't know anything about cars/trucks you're going to have a hard time. Only down side is you can know how to fix just about anything on a vehicle but only be in sales. While someone who worked at McDonald or anything of that sort can walk in and get a Parts management job.
good,Inconsistent schedule and stressful place specially when the store manager is around. Everyone are good and helpful. Short of work hours. Good place to work. I am only part time the deal is 30 hours per week that I didn't get.

I learned so much about vehicles and how the systems run, parts and how they work together and how to do more than just basic maintenance on vehicles.  I also learned more about organizing in small spaces, plan-o-grams and how to handle different types of customers.  I loved the variety and helping so many types of customers.  Installing and stocking the heavy parts plus working when others called in (frequently) were the worst parts of the job."

good,"I had 3-5 employees under me to supervise at a time, a good team that took care of sales and customer service while i took care of payroll and inventory and occasionally engage in customer service and cashiering."
good,I encouraged all of workers to take ownership in their work and assigned store areas. provided incentives to staff for achieving weekly store goals. provided all the necessary tools to provide excellent service.
good,Some of the managers were not the best. Employees were the goto people in most scenarios. I did like a couple of the management team. While I was there I enjoyed it.
good,No matter how big of a risk you take to step up in the company you still fall flat on your face. I stepped into a Store Manager position and after 6 months I decided it was not the job for me. I was expected to act as the SM till the position was filled and to do so on $10.00 an hour.
good,"The Parts Sales Manager (PSM) assists the Store Manager with leading company initiatives and ensuring maximum productivity, training high performing AutoZoners in a safe environment, driving sales, controlling expenses and shrink, and remaining compliant with company procedures in accordance to AutoZone’s expectation. A PSM exceeds customer’s expectation by delivering a WOW! Customer shopping experience on assigned shifts by Living the Pledge everyday."
good,In autozone the woman had opportunity for advancement to be certified on all equipment . I loved the bar-b-qu parties for employees.  Autozone taught teamwork.  I had good friends there.
good,"I now fully understand why Auto Zone is the best Parts company period. We have better parts, better warranty, and cheaper prices. Plus now we price match online prices, along with other retailers."
good,Working there had its ups and down. You had your good day and your bad. At times we would be extremely busy and other time it would be dead. Sometimes we were fully staffed then other times we had to work under staff. I feel that management should appreciate their employees more then they do.
good,it was ok till the stress took over then i wasnt happy there and i try not to shop there any more unless i really need a art that no one else has or can get cheaper
good,"Great work experience, very good management. A great place to learn a lot, hardest part of the job is assisting customers with default parts. Most enjoyable part are the people and management."

good,While I worked there for only a few months in the summer it was a fun and local job with most of my coworkers being upbeat and interesting. The work was relatively straightforward but prior automotive experience is a must.
good,Muy buena empresa pero por grande los jefes que deveras tienen la cultura en la piel y se preocupan por las personas no están ahí y muchas veces los empleados son victimas del favoritismo eso se mira mucho así que tu conocimiento y carrera en realidad no siempre es tomado en cuenta por el criterio de una sola persona
good,"Great Company, Bad Upper Management. One of the best Jobs i ever had, until i moved up then it went south due to poor support from upper management, I miss the job."
good,"It was a fun environment, most of my co workers were friendly. The Management team was impartial and fair.  My job was to assist the customer in identifying locating and receiving  a part and sometimes out source parts."
good,"A Basic Automotive background will help, however, it is not required. A lot of the job is hands on training and depending on the locations you work at, it will determine if there are fast days or slow days. Ask numerous questions. The grey shirts earned the shirts for a reason and they may or may not have knowledge. Research automotive equipment and the parts, especially what they do and why they went bad. That knowledge will determine a sale or not. So sell yourself as well as the part, and you can grow within the company. This is a great starter company to get tons of experience at the right store."
good,When I started I learned fast with good help. I learned about the parts and what they were needed for. Things went along smooth and was always something to do.
good,"You get paid training, paid life insurance, you must be able to work on your feet for up to 12 hours sometimes, most of the work equipment is in poor working condition and finding the right one takes some time."
good,I had a great time working at autozone very nice place to work I was changing batteries checking costumers cars make sure they were good and I unloaded truck
good,"Horarios flexibles"
good,Again it's ok as part time job. Won't get good money in it but it's  easy job as well if you know a lot about cars. The worst part is often customers come in just to ask how to fix something or what's the problem with their car even though it's not our responsibilities to help them with this matter.
good,"Resolve customer complaints via phone, email, mail, or social media. • Use telephones to reach out to customers and verify account information. • Greet customers warmly and ascertain problem or reason for calling. • Cancel or upgrade accounts. • Assist with placement of orders, refunds, or exchanges"

good,"Autozone is a wonderful company to work for if you get in the right store with the right people.  Even with this though it is still an entry level retail company, so don't expect all your co-workers to be top of the line. Some stores have poor management, and others are great.  I for one, had a great store, with great management, great people, and lots of fun working there."
good,"over all the job was great, Just have to balance with the customers and all other team members, going to stores to get the job done right. over all it's fun."
good,i worked at auto zone as a cashier on my down time until it was time for me to go back out on delivery. i was delivering auto parts to different auot zones in the city and different locals outside of the city
good,Auto Zone has alot of Good workers that hard working and friendly but lack in making some customer happy with not picking up the pace with the customers waiting to pay and leave in a hurry.

good,"At this job you will learn the aspects of many different parts and cars, you will get customer describing the problem and at first you may need help from a manager or coworker but at the end you'll have some idea to what your costumer needs"

I had fabulous managers and ones that couldn't tie their own shoes.  Fortunately there were more of the prior.  Atmosphere was typical shop environment, and part retail store.The hardest part was finding obscure parts that only the best minds could identify, and the most fun part was digging in with other people passionate about their vehicle."

They also offer to send any motivated employee to take the ASE testing to become an ASE Certified employee, which teaches you the knowledge to better yourself both at AutoZone and outside of AutoZone.

My DM is the Best one I've ever had the pleasure of working for because he believes in bettering his team and setting them up for success.  The team I have at My Store is a very well trained team and like all jobs we have some that hinder us from getting things done.

good,I never did the same thing each day you were at a freedom to do what is needed to be done to get the project completed. Management is there but stands back to let you do it your way and only steps in to help when they see a better way then it was like maybe we could do it this way to make it more efficient. You were part of a team not just a body.

good,"This review is regarding a corporate position I held in the IT department. Working in the corp office definitely has its perks. You have free parking for downtown events, because you are allowed to park in the garage after hours. I worked in the IT department. The people tolerated one another, but nobody really seemed like they liked each other. Lots of long timers were in the department and they definitely had an attitude problem. The personalities of all could be on the sterile side. But, that's not to say they weren't good people. You kind of have to expect that when you put a room full of IT people together. I didn't particularly care for the monthly meeting where the entire department would get together and begin with a chant and cheer complete with spelling out AutoZone with your body. That was a little too much, although I do understand it is a team building exercise. But, the bagels were good!"
good,I don't have anything negative to say about the company. It was part-time work so I did the job. I was hired for. Great evening job
good,"If I still had my old job, I would still be at AZ. It was a great job and AZ was a great place to work. I hear now that many employees don't like the new way of doing business. But I would still be there if I had not been laid off."

I would also go out prepare trash cans, clean outside and go back inside to tend to phone calls. when a customer would call id look up parts, and let them know if we had them available or if we had to pick them up from somewhere else. i then would drive to shop to drop off parts if no one else was available. at the end of the day i would make sure all cars are locked, count money, and made sure to put notes on anything else we would have to send in the morning."

Obey what the managers ask you to do and always go that extra mile to get things done for them. Being friendly with co-workers is n o problem because I'm a very friendly person and I get along with any diverse groups of individuals. The hardest part of the job has to be the rude customers that you just have to keep your composure for because its not personal. most-enjoyable part of the job is getting things done because its my job and also i LOVE keeping my customers satisfied."

The most enjoyable part is helping people and giving them a smile on their faces. I also very much enjoyed answering the calls and doing invoices and the paper work for the commercial department."

good,Days were always fun and full of energy and great customers. I learned a lot at that job more than what I knew. Managers were always helpful and co workers were always cool.
good,"Autozone only hires in part time employees now.  So, if you're looking for a job that pays all the bills, this isn't it.  You will need another job.  Some older employees are grandfathered into full time and insurance.  I was hired in as Parts/Sales Manager which is the equivalent of Assistant Manager.  Computer systems can be a challenge (limited information on boats, ATVs and practically none on tractors).  All my coworkers were pleasant, but I imagine that varies from store to store.  Opening and closing was very easy.  Autozone provided in-store, online training for various automotive systems which is helpful if you're a bit rusty with, say, A/C systems service.   Overall, it was a great experience.  You have to be a people person though.  There is a LOT of interaction with the customer.  A lot of people come in who don't know what their problem is, nor do they know what they need.  It's your job to help them find out (or find out for them).  Reliable information is critical.  Otherwise, trust is lost."

The rest of the day was dedicated to work with my team members in order to achieve our daily, weekly, and monthly goals, in addition to assist phone and walk-in customers. Every day was different because customers came looking for solutions to different automotive problems which made my days more interesting and challenging. I had the opportunity to work with very experienced knowledgeable employees that provided useful information regarding automotive issues. It was very fun to work with friendly employees and managers. The hardest part of my job was when I was not able to find a solution to my customer's problems. Although I was required to work at least 50 hours per week, It was fun to be there."
good,this job made my at the time very easy a flexible and I was thankful to managers that would work around my school schedule. I enjoyed going to work here I would always have a smile on face working with the customers and helping them figure out what they needed to fix the job they needed to get done.
good,"I have worked at a variety of locations with AutoZone. One location was more laid back while another was fast paced and non-stop almost unrelenting. It is an excellent place if you like to provide a service to people looking for help with their vehicles. A typical day for a manager is to open the store, prepare the registers, count the safe, obtain daily reports, prepare the deposits, restock the shelves, manage the returns and of course take care of customers. Closing duties are store recovery, manage returns, shut down registers, count safe, prepare end of day reports, recover the store and take care of customers."

AutoZone have a great supportive management team and system that allows me to get the job done effectively and positively. The most difficult part about working for AutoZone for me was when the company introduces a new operating system or services, The company will provide the proper information and training needed to better educate their employees of the new changes. the most enjoyable part of working at AutoZone for me was the recognition for the initiative I take and the compensation that comes with it as a result of customer satisfaction."

Our management  team are very communicative   on what they expect from us and are wiling to answer any questions that we may have before and through out the day.

We had a lot to accomplish everyday so I made plans to have the entire crew involved to have everything done for daily/weekly/monthly tasks while we took care of our customers with 100% customer satisfaction at all times.  I coached my crew weekly to have their weakness turn into strong points of their growth with the team directions.  With sales being so great, I must say that to accomplish everything that my boss wanted me to get done was the hardest part of my job.  I had to work 6 days a week and take no lunches for over 2 years but I really did enjoy having the nearest community enjoy their each experience in my store and want to come back for anything they would need in the future in my store.  If I had to do it again I would definitely change a couple of things but for the most part it was an excellent experience.  I can't wait to see what life has for me in my near future."

good,"Auto Zone is a very nice company to work for. On the job you stay busy, you have a good customer service atmosphere, and most importantly, products are satisfying for consumers!"
good,"My only complaint with this company is that I am still not there. When the new CEO took over back in 2001, the company did a large downsizing and eliminated three regional offices. I happened to be part of one of those regions that was effected. My only recourse was to take a transfer some 3300 miles away from my daughter or to take a three step demotion. I elected to leave the company and move to a new chapter in my professional journey."
good,The same as any customer service job. There's a need to pamper and upsell. Good place to start work ethic in your youth. Everyone should work customer service at least once. Us people need to understand how ridiculous we are and unlock our potential. It's not hard to LEARN to put on a wiper blade.
good,Easy going and fun work. Sometimes I was stressed out due to low staffing or a numerous amount of customers and not having enough hands to help them. Lifting heavy objects and staying on my feet kept me from being lazy and kept me moving.
good,Time management is a huge part of working at Auto zone. As well as being a team player and motivating your peers. You learn to interact with different types of personalities.
good,The management team could use some work on communicating with their associates and improve the promoting process. The lack of communication caused me to have unfair pay and a lack of knowledge of how the deeper system worked when I was promoted.
good,Started as a part sales manager and was quickly promoted to Assistant Manager.  The store I worked at had a great manager that cared about his employees and would treat them with respect.  He would make the shift fun and exciting by challenging us.  The one downfall to the company is they don't pay well unless you are in Senior Management.
good,"You know car people. 4 barrel Holley is better than a 4 barrel Edelbrock. No matter what, people will argue with you if you actually know about cars. At this job, don't argue back. Let them think they are right. Management has always been questionable here. Sell, sell, sell. Meet quotas, and exceed, you'll always have a place."
good,"I love working and meeting new people, I learn something new everyday about an automobile and people, great work place. The bsd is in subzero weather replacing a battery your fingers get numb."
good,"Getting in the door takes a little time but other than that it is a good place to work and very stable and you have job security. "
good,Face paced workplace while providing customer service to a diversity of people each day.  A continued learning process through the interaction between associate and customer.  A close working relationship between associated and management is required.  Parts are heavy and can be a challenge at times to navigate.  The ultimate reward is when the customer has everything they need to complete the task at hand.
good,"Autozone is very flexible with hours. I worked part time, and the accommodated my every need. My full time job had me working different hours on a weekly basis, and autozone was fine with that."
good,Very good company leader in the auto parts world have what you need if you need the parts they will have it or get it they take pride in that and the customer
good,No complaints. The Company's willingness to work with you when you have a personal problem is great. Great benefits from a personal standpoint. No other concerns.
good,this place is a flexible and all organized but the reason why I cant work here because I couldn't take the task over there so I would want to try another thing that's easy and learn another stuff
good,Great work environment. Not enough hours. The management is great and they want to see you succeed. All the other employees are friendly and great to conversate with.
good,"Had a lot of fun with the co-workers. The customers were nice. What i didnt know, the manager helped out.  When busy, you take care of one customer at a time to insure no leaves with the wrong part."
good,Was a good experience great management they were always helpful and I leanered alot. Sometimes you would get slammed with customers and it would be a little stressful but wasnt nothing extreme.
good,In charge of daily sales goal for the store provide good customer service through out the day. Have employees each work on different task through out their shift must be completed by the end of every shift.
good,While employed by AutoZone I received a few promotions. I liked that they did promote from within. Most people were friendly and patient while you were helping them. It was a pleasant work experience the management and other employees were easy to get along with and helped a lot when I was first starting there. I would suggest working for them.
good,"They made it possible for me to promote to management within 5 months of working very hard there, they weren't like other companies who would promise promotion or hourly increase and  then not do it no matter how hard you worked. The manager there trained me to be the best at what I do in my new position as a manager. I always been a leader and wanted to turn it up a notch and succeed in my goal to be a manager"
good,"Great place to work at."
good,"Store 3357 is a really good store with great management and a great team that gets along very well to get the job at hand done in a timely manner. The job helped me learn how to switch some lights in a car as well as how to properly switch out a battery. The most difficult thing about the job is having to deal with some rude customers, but even then, its a small thing in comparison to how well the management treats you and trusts you in completing tasks."
good,AutoZone recognizes hard work and dedication and there are many opportunities for advancement. I've enjoyed my years working there and will continue to.
good,If you show interest on the company they give you opportunities to grow professionally. Its very easy to be promoted when you are good with customer service.

good,Management was great but hours was the only thing lacking. Besides hours everything including the work environment was great. Nice co-workers and a flexible schedule.
good,"A typical work day involves working with at least one member of management, and 1 or 2 other part-time employees. The job is to take care of customers who come in to purchase parts for their vehicles, or to find the problem that causing their vehicles to not function correctly."
good,They really work around my school schedule. Managers are good  it is a fun place to work.  I ahve learned alot about cars and working with cars. I likment.  The stor is very cleairone my co-wrokers and it is a very laid back.
good,Fun place to work for once you get the hang of it plus you learn a lot by the people you work around with. There is a chance for advancement if you feel like you have what it takes.
good,"Customers asked for me daily because I was the only employee that could identify parts they needed from pictures or describing what it look like or connected to, helped and made sure customers were satisfied and felt safe leaving out the store knowing they were satified"

good,"AutoZone as a whole is an excellent company to work for.  I have been able to grow my skillset as a financial analyst through excellent guidance and excellent coworkers.  AutoZone's management is exceptional in the way of transparency across all levels of employees, their dedication to the company, and how they act as examples of leadership.  The most enjoyable part of working at AutoZone is working alongside excellent coworkers while knowing that your work is appreciated and impactful."
good,Its a good place to work if you are self driven. Lots of work overnight stocking parts. Plenty of opportunities to move around positions and very flexible with hours.
good,Working at Auto Zone taught me a lot about sales and the ability to be able to move up into the company's work field. It also teaches you that everyone there is to help others improve and become successful.
good,"I likes this job alot acutally, friendly environment defiantly place for growth and advancement! Management was excellent took the time to show you how to do things the right way other then just being a boss. Good experience!"
good,I learned many things about costumer service and also how to interact with people and cars. Working with other co worker was always fun. The hardest part about the job is when customers thinking that we know everything but we only help them on what they need.
good,"Es muy buena empreasa, aprendes demasiado y si te empeñas sacas lo mejor"
good,"no se me respetaba el horario, aprendizaje muy bueno en autopartes"
good,Good place to work! Very friendly coworkers. Not too bad of an environment! Pretty fast paced work but not too high of a pay for your services and very slow advancement
good,Become a grey shirt fast or manager. You'll get bumped up 1.50$ higher pay raises also. Dont work with your schedule a lot unless your part time. Certain managers are great others arent

good,I can honestly say this is one of the view jobs that has  taught me skills and knowledge that I can and will use in the real world.  I am more automotive aware and can now notice key red flags or symptoms on my vehicle.
good,AutoZone is a very team oriented company and is awesome to work for but I have recently had slot of family issues that are no longer an issue but over all AutoZone is a great place to work
good,Busy work day consistently helping walk in customers in the diy portion of the business as well as taking calls for the commercial side of the business. Very hard to move up once you are a csm. the best part of the job is getting the costumer the right part and information on time all the time to have them keep coming back and building a great relationship.
good,"I enjoyed working for the place at the time ,made a lot of friends and had a lot of loyal customers overall it had its ups and downs but that's life anywhere you work"
good,Everyone tried their best to help me out and answer any and all questions that I had. They did a great job coaching me along and giving me pep talks. They really wanted me to succeed.

good,There is only two things I can complain about working here is the pay and the lack of staff which the two go together. Other then that I love everyone I work with and the store manager goes above and beyond for her staff!!
good,"All in all my on going experience with AutoZone is pretty well. Being as though I am a Commercial Driver, I spent a lot of time on the road. However, there are times where I need to assist customers on the floor. I've developed DIY customer skills, as well as knowledge on cars."

good,"I was a little concerned starting as a female at this job, but since my manager hired me based on my ability and willingness to learn, I really had nothing to worry about. I started out as part-time and was promoted to full-time management within 6 months. I worked at the busiest store in the region which kept us busy and running all day long. It was an exhausting, but fulfilling job. I was always learning something new, whether from my coworkers or my customers who were always willing to help me do my job with all the tools in my belt.We did everything as a team, from replacing batteries and windshield wipers to setting up commercial and personal accounts and sales, Hands-down one of the BEST and funnest jobs I have EVER had."

good,The team was great. The job was fun. Left due to other career opportunities. I would return in the future if I ever needed to. AutoZone was a great company to work for.

good,Clock in assist customers with there car needs. I liked the helping of people in need. I leered there are all types of situations that people need your education and advice on car repairs & parts. Cars & Trucks are simple if you have the education to repair them in most cases. There was a lot to be learned with training classes that I took once a month to improve knowledge of cars and there operations. the hardest part was dealing with customers wanting something for free. Helping people was always a joy.

good,Autozone is a great job. I work part time and deliver auto parts so I'm in and out the door making deliveries but I also work behind the counter selling parts to walk-in customers. I enjoy the work pace because there is down time but it also can get hectic.

good,"really great place to work, great oppritunity for advancement."
good,Autozone was a pretty good place to work.  The biggest drawback is the lack of hours available regardless of the length of time that I was employeed.  Good employer.
good,"Es una gran empresa para trabajar , solo es cuestion de afinar algunos detalles ,como por ejemplo cuidar que los trabajadores tengan beneficios mayores a los que estipula la ley ,como vales de comida , algun dia libre adicional etc. Por otra parte el ambiente laborar es genial y aprendes mucho, si el sueldo fuera mucho mas y me dieran mas beneficios  en lo personal ahi me queadaria."

good,Ive been at the zone for over 2 years and enjoy the flexibility and great environment. With different locations nationwide you have an option to work in different areas.
good,"The manager I had was great, as well as the people I worked with. I worked here for a year and honestly no job is perfect and most of the reviews are probably from people that want a good job with no skills. I loved working here and it was great if you want this to be your career work hard and put yourself out there you can advance."
good,"I worked part time nights, great place for a job. Friendly coworkers, relaxed environment. If you know some automotive stuff you will fit rite in. Not much training need."
good,"I would say overall positive work experience. It was very competitive. and the company stresses your selecting rate as being most important. it is labor intensive, but keeps the heart beating. So if a person doesnt mind that being said, the job could potentially be something you may like."

Enjoyable part is off on holidays"

good,"As an Auto Zone Driver, my duty was to deliver car parts to local businesses in a timely manner. I would take part requests by phone and deliver them to site requested. I collected payments through the phone or other methods such as; cash,checks, and member accounts. The best part about working here is that I enjoyed learning more about car parts and their functions. I learned how to search the appropriate parts based on Car make, model, and year."
good,"I've an AutoZone employ for 2 years now, I like dealing with customers and kind of helping them get the correct parts for their cars. I've learned more when it comes to cars and how to deal with customers.

good,"A typical day at work is cashiering, stocking, inventory management, doing schedules. Just making sure everything runs smoothly in a work day. The management team work well together. The hardest part of the job was doing inventory management, you had to make sure things matched. the most enjoyable part was the customers and the staff."
good,"overall a great working experience, enjoyed the flexible works hours but they could use better initial training for beginning employees, but the overall work atmosphere was familial and friendly. i would recommend"

good,"Front Face the products before closing or opening "
good,"Store I worked in had good people to work with. Not stressful and accommodating to employee needs. Good managers. Overall company could do better. Pay and benefits are lacking. Want employees to sell and give good effort, but little is given in return. Sell well and your manager might get a bonus, you get squat. Employee discount not much more than afforded most customers."
good,Autozone was a great company to work for . they had great benefits and it was easy to get promoted. If i had the chance i would work for this company all over again.
good,I enjoyed working here the emery was positive and advancement was nice the only down fall is you didn't hardly get any family time

The other store associates were always very nice and helpful and we all pushed to make our store a better workplace and an enjoyable experience for our customers."
good,"Help customers with auto parts needs from testing batteries,starters and alternators to scanning the cars computer for trouble codes.  Restocking merchandise is fun."
good,"The day was always fun, got to go deliver parts to our commercial accounts. As for someone who only knew what an air filter was I got to learn more about what goes into working on a vehicle. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. I would say the hardest part of a job was not knowing what the customer wanted and trying to figure it out before they got upset. And the most enjoyable part of the job was working in an environment that was always friendly."
good,Your co workers are very friendly and will help with patience. There is a lot to learn about cars and driving safety as well as sales and how to become a good sales associate. Lots of fun making deliveries for car repair companies. Management will work with you as far as your scheduled hours go. Just a fun and great place to work overall. I would most definitely go back if I could.

good,The best job I've had. You learn what it means to give great customer service and have people appreciate you for that. Hardest part of the job was keeping the store looking great and getting the customer the right part for the right price.
good,"Buena comunicacion entre todas las areas, hay mucha oportunidad de aprendizaje de procesos de rh, conocimiento de mecanica y autopartes, una muy agradable cultura."
good,"A typical work day consisted of me checking 3 work trucks and helping with walk-in customers until commercial customers started ordering. From that point on I kept in field customers supplied with shop needs. I learned very good customer skills, some days an overheated mechanic is not the easiest to deal with. My manager in customer department was a wonderful man who taught me a lot. We were a tight group of employees throughout the store. The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with my customers. The hardest was leaving."
good,Autozone is a good place to work if you are going to be a mechanic or just love cars and the racing culture. It doesn't pay much but you definitely gain knowledge and skills that will last a lifetime. Everyone I work with and have worked with in the past were great. Autozone hires good people in my book. Hardest part of the job can be when the system tells us we have a part but when you go to look for it its not in its proper place. The best part of the job is everything else.
good,"I actually enjoyed working there, I ended up leaving because of attendance issues but its one of the few jobs I'd consider applying for again."
good,"It an outstanding, growing retail company that's main focus is customer satisfaction where all associates are trained and treated with dignity and respect."

good,Autozone was a good place to work. Everyone got along well together. Management was willing to go the extra mile for customers and staff.
good,"Typical day at work would be checking the aisles and looking for any misplaced items, restocking items on the shelves and attending to customer questions along with helping customers look for parts. While working there I learned to keep up a good pace between being on the floor and being with customers who needed help with vehicle  parts. Management was kind and very helpful in showing us what to do day to day and keeping us busy with tasks that helped the store keep a presentable look while also attending customers. Hardest part of the job was lifting heavy objects and the most enjoyable part was being around cars."
good,"Great pay, fun to work. I only had a bad run in with management a few times. Good hours, Learn a lot about cars, customer service"
good,I was management and had a great staff and boss. The hardest part of the job was some heavy lifting. I learned a lot about cars and how to fix minor issues.
good,I managed the normal day-to-day jobs of a sales manager. The Group I worked with was fun and hardworking.Dealing with disgrunted customers was the worst part of the job but other than that was a good job to have while I was in College.

good,Day to day is usually very busy. There are customers all day and the phones ringing constantly. There are always several tasks that need completed. The people I have worked with have always been great and the district and regional managers are always pleasant and helpful.
good,"Good job, any employee will gain valuable customer service and automotive knowledge will be acquired. co-workers were respectful and the companies values are professional. The company will not tolerate ill behavior and follows all laws and state standards. The company also gives a discount to employees, which is very helpful."
good,"Long Term, Quality presence on Stock Market."

good,"I went in and got ready to ride the forklifts,cherry pickers,carts, and pullies then I packed foreign car parts to be shipped off"
good,"On a typical day at work I would come in prepared to lead no matter what shift I had been scheduled.  If was opening the store I came in and opened properly and efficiently making sure all paperwork and proper opening procedure was followed and I did it all while smiling, leading and being a great team member.  If closing the store I went directly to my store manager and found out what they needed to be done on top of my closing responsibilities for that day.  I have always gone above and beyond for my store to be successful and I have always me a model leader doing it all with strong character focus and a smile. The hardest part of my job was being able to figure out what a customer needed when they weren't quite sure.  The most enjoyable was seeing customers leave happy and satisfied knowing they would return."
good,Great place to be employed. Loyal team members that help out when ever you need them always will  to learn. The most enjoyable part is when you help a customer solve a problem and making them happy.
good,"Very Interesting Work place, I definitely learned more than I could ever imagine; and I appreciate it. Love working with my coworkers, we all get along so well and it helps keep the company running smoothly."
good,"I worked the register, loved looking up auto parts and learning about their function. The management was very supportive and coworkers were fun to be around. I enjoyed the lifting and physical elements of this job. I was able to get experience in opening and closing procedures for the store, safety procedures and valuable knowledge about automotive parts and service."
good,You have the opportunity to attend training classes to gain knowledge of the auto parts and the business. I started as a cashier learning about auto parts and products. I worked over time and at times at sister stores. We had contests to give incentive to increase sales on products. Cleanliness and organization of the store was very important.
good,good pay and benefits. good place to learn about automotive industry and customer sales.
good,"Started out as a part time sales representative, and was quickly promoted to a management roll. This company recognizes and rewards individuals for showing competence and good work ethic. Also, automotive knowledge is a big plus. The only issue I ever really had was with upper management, not standing behind their store managers."
good,"Working at AutoZone I learned so much. When I came to the job I didn't know anything about cars or the company. I learned how to treat my customers with respect and to always think about the customers best interest. I learned so much that in a year I became Manager and in 6 months i became an Assistant Store Manager. Through out this time I learned how to make deposits, count safe, and registers. I learned how to handle all the paperwork at the store and learned how to manage the team. Learned how to print price changes, planograms,and how to do matrix. Working for this company has become a great experience"
good,I deliver automotive parts to various mechanic shops and provide sales and promotion information to the customers.  I answer phone calls from mechanics for parts information and orders.  Perform final financial closing procedures and review sales goals on a daily basis.
good,"a typical work day is coming to work very happy and ready to work, costumers come in and gather information and quotes on auto parts from auto zone and offer the costumer a wide variety of prices on a auto part he/she is willing to purchases. If our does not have it we transfer the part to our store or send the costumer to another store. the management there at auto zone is very well and respectful and the mangers are very helpful too. I learn everyday something about auto parts and how they connect to one another to have a reliable vehicle moving. the hardest part of my job is the Spanish speaking costumers and keeping all costumers happy. i enjoy my job very much and willing to learn."
good,"Been here for a while and I deliver parts, promote sales, customer satisfaction every day. I really enjoy always learning something new. Management is always asking me to move up in position, I don't take it because I am not going to make this my career . I'm just here to learn and have a job to pay bills for right now while I'm working for my degree in physical therapy assistant. Only hard thing about this job is my schedule is not consistent."
good,There are very good work hours and they will work around your schedule. The management there is very involved with their employees.  They will teach you many things about the work place and in the automotive department.  They have fairly good benefits and the wages are also fairly good.  You do receive paid vacation after a year of full time work.
good,"Autozone is fun place to work at if you enjoy talking about vehicles all day and educating people with repairs.  The down side is that the schedule is erratic and you must be available from 6:45 to 10:00 pm 7 days per week and if you are not available you will not receive more than 15 hours per week.  The management is great, staff is energetic, and the customers are great.  The pay is a little above minimum wage and makes it hard to support a family on such little pay.  great for school goers or those looking for a weekend job."
good,"Estar en buen ambiente , con ascenso por logros y metas logradas"
good,At my time at Autozone I enjoyed my work team and some of the customers.  I will say if your interested getting on the Autozone team get ready for some interesting customer requests and questions.  There are times when work can get overloading and times were its slow but be assure you will learn a lot about vehicles.
good,"Was a good place to work, just had a different opportunity come up"
good,"Clean up in the morning to make sure the store looks clean for the customers, put away any parts that need to back to the warehouse and then make sure everything in the store in facing the right way."
good,A typical day at work involved interfacing with customers  and associates and learning about the newest parts on the market
good,A typical workday would unpredictable. I learned how to deal interact with the public. Excellent management. Hardest part would be not knowing what the day was going to bring. Most enjoyable was working with my co-workers.
good,Great place to work with good management who are ready and able to assist in advancing your career with Auto-zone.
good,"Great culture"
good,answering phones pulling parts delivery of parts and sales flyers
good,Eccelent management and good work environment good comunication skills and customer srvice experience
good,"Fast, fun, great service. Their corporate office is always involved and on top of things. Benefits weren't that great, but the staff alone is what made it. They sold a good product, and was very interested in the happiness of the staff. Great starter job for anyone."
good,"This is definitely one of the most comfortable positions I have ever worked in. You become accustomed to the small town, homely atmosphere working at this store. The most difficult part of this position is dealing with the tempers that accompany those experiencing car issues, but the upside to it is that people begin to trust you and your knowledge allowing you to build customer relationships that make every day easier. Co-workers were all good, down to Earth people who only expect you to do your job to the best of your ability and who also do not mind assisting you along the way."
good,This job was one of the ones that I learned the most from. Not only the customer satisfaction part or the automotive knowledge but the great experience that this growing company has.
good,Great company to work for. excellent people to work with they treat everyone like family.
good,"systems in place to assure that everything went smooth on a shift, management was supportive and well versed on polices, never a need to pressure sell anything always provided the customer with quality service."
good,I worked at the DC
good,"A typical day varies on a day to day basis. I'll begin at the end of the week. On Friday mornings, I start by balancing the real estate the impound accounts that I manage through out the week. Once that is completed, I am able to finish up any non time sensitive task or projects that have not been completed. On Thursdays, I run several queries to help the reconciling process and also check the bills log in list to make sure AutoZone has a copy of all of the upcoming real estate tax bills. On Monday through Wednesday, I process all of the bills that need to get paid, build tax set up files that contain important real estate tax information, fill out income and expense reports, and perform any maintenance to the accrual."
good,"I usually worked four to five hours a day, mostly the closing shift."
good,atmosphere was upbeat..good structure of values..competitive with other automotive retailers..
good,"Autozone great environment great people great service, provided wow customer service installed batteries, intalled wipers, inventory management, loss provention, delevoping employees, coaching employees,motivating teams,I had great team well rounded proffesional great customer service. Sometimes situations will accure where employees lose their jobs and have to let them go was the hardest part of my job for me. Autozone is a great company always big chances to move up get promoted always had the resources and tools to develop yourself and coach others always enjoyed coaching and developing my fellow co-workers my team"
good,"I opened and closed the store. I counted the register as well as deposited end of day earnings. I supervised 6 team members to ensure that they were proficient in product knowledge as well as excellent customer service skills. I learned an abundant amount about vehicles, parts ordering, data entry, and inventory management. My co-workers were very respectful as well as fun to work with. Management allowed me to run the store with very few interruptions.The long days and weekends were very difficult to deal with. Meeting and dealing with new and regular cusomers."
good,"i enjoyed working and getting to know the customers.good environment, fast pace which i liked made your work day go by fast."
good,A great place to work. I was working there while I was in school so it was remp for me.
good,always busy their is always something to do.. i learned everything know how to do every thing i went to all the training classes that was offered. As a manager i was always busy because of my knowledge i was called upon all the time by employees and customers. of course everywhere has good and bad the problem is not all employees like what they do i found it a pleasure there but some just work there because they needed the money the hardest was meeting sudden deadline.the most enjoyable obs was presentation of the store i loved a fully stocked store neeT and organize i love when my store is busy i like doing customer service i like the good compliment.love to do inventory planograms store set ups love to visit my sister and I LOVE TO COMPETE. i HAD RALLY LOVE MY JOB. I wished i could worked back there.
good,Im so ready to become management and move up in the company. I am the right person for the job. I have been with Autozone for 4yrs. I like everything that there is to like my job an my co-workers help get the job done right for our customers
good,"busy days, learning more and more about cars/trucks,management is great, co-worker are great, nothing hard. getting to interact with customers."
good,"Make it your career. The benefits are the best, they have an decent employee stock plan and retirement. If you want a warehouse career this is the best one in the area. There are long periods of time where there is full of disrespect here but that's the only bad thing I have to say."
good,its a fast place to learn sales management skills and learning new thing each day and new people you see each day and happier out come ins with people
good,You can become a parts expert with all the knowledge you can obtain that is readily available. You can access it all on the computers located at the store
good,"Team members and customer service  "
good,Working at autozone is a grate place to work if you like working in a team setting and motivated enough to get the job done. My time there as a commercial manager was not a waste I enjoy working on the front line being the first call and growing the commercial accounts
good,Overall was a good company plenty of benefits for full time workers. As a part time worker i was never given the hours i was promised. Management was helpful.
good,"Having a cool relationship with customers and learning each and everyday about parts and how to fix and replace products."
good,"You don’t have to know a lot about cars, most of what you need is learned in training and it’s always fun to learn about what the customers are working on. It’s a great job to get experience in cashiering, selling, and stocking as well as learning about cars and it’s easy to work your way up the ladder. All in all it’s a great place to work."
good,"The people working with me were great people, but i wouldnt recommend working here if you arent a handy person, customers would often ask questions i don't know the answer to"
good,I work with a fun and friendly staff every day. We always set out ways to achieve sales and customer satisfaction to keep the business flowing. Commercial businesses are great to deal with around the local area as well.
good,Always ask questions and don’t get too comfortable. Ask for opportunities to move up because that’s the only way you’ll make any sort of money and even then it’s not enough for what they expect
good,Autozone is a great place to work at. I have a good time helping out the customers to what they need. I like to work with my coworkers. The management is out standing.
good,AutoZone is a fun place to work. It can be very busy at times but also has its slow times just like any other job. You get to talk with a lot of different people and learn about all the different vehicles on the road.
good,Autozone is a great place for those who need a flexible schedule for school or other reasons and they will promote from within when they see you can do the next job above ours they will promote you quickly. in 4 years at this company i received 4 promotions and had several coworkers advance up with me. this company will value your hard work and effort put into your job.
good,Work is good. I enjoy learning to work planograms. I have the ability to find what I'm looking for with ease. Other employees are a delight to work with.
good,"The work is at a fairly steady pace, they train well, and  the Autozone team us very helpful.  The company has a very positive atmosphere.  Glad I had the opportunity to work there"
good,I enjoyed working at Auto Zone and would work there again. They pay good and are very understanding people. The warehouse is very new and the equipment is new as well. The warehouse has a very nice setup and is easily navigated.
good,"Overall Autozone isn't such a bad company to work for. Granted my first few months were terrible as a red shirt but when it comes to being on the management, everything runs smoother. Realistically if you show up and do what is asked of you with out any lip, Autozone is the place to work."
good,good employees and management. very clean and organized work area. computer system was sufficent . It could be difficult trying to locate less common parts.
good,First off this is for the distribution center not a store. It’s not an easy job. You will work your self into the dirt sometimes to make your production but the pay is above the media. Average for the are. We are in a rural community and the current top pay is almost $20 an hour with the ability to make incentive pay. Also lots of opportunities to volunteer for overtime but also lots of mandatory fifth days (10 hour shifts).
good,"AutoZone is a great company to work for, you are rewarded for your job duties and they are always looking for people to move up and grow with the company"
good,"Working at AutoZone you encounter a large variety of people, and from there your learn how to manage each and every type of person that comes your way"
good,"A very good place to work. "
good,"I worked the counter to help customers; scheduling; ordering; merchandising; training; conflict management; cash management.  I especially enjoyed working with customers and helping to supply the parts they needed.   Because the work environment could be very fast paced at times, it could be a challenge to keep staff morale high.  But most of the time, there was great collaboration among co-workers."
good,Great environment to grow up the latter. Many opportunities given to grow up with the company and become a manager of some sort. Also flexible with owns lifestyle.
good,"If you love challenging tasks while working this is the job for you! Their management team made me feel welcome and taught me everything i know today about cars, YES they taught me about the basics of what to expect when dealing with cars and it didn't take two years and a degree. I joined the management team and whether you are a red shirt or grey shirt you are one family when you clock in lol it sounds cheesy but if you like to stretch your daily knowledge on how to help, solve problems, and show nothing but love to the consumers AutoZone is a great place to be. i was blessed to be apart of Store #6373 in bessemer Alabama and Enote and Fred is the best trainer, manager and father of parts to local shops and neighboring stores. Even though my parts knowledge was like a strong 3 but management was a solid 10 he took the time to teach,show, and carry out my experience there! Anyone looking for a breath of Fresh air  Shoot there, they will teach you and push you to be more than just an ""employee"". If you are very experienced with cars They offer commercial positions as well and trust me you'll know more in three days of training instead of what you knew when you started. Alright enough reading ...go apply ! Be Blessed y'all !"
good,"great place to work in. helping people getting what he or she need, just greeting them to see them evering day kwoning they will come back because they knew coming back we would be took care of."
good,"I liked that this job kept me on my toes, the 10 hours went by quickly almost everyday, my co workers were the highlight of the day and the job was very easy, you just need to do it fast"
good,Exciting to work there. New and enjoyable happenings all the time. Territory and regional managers are excellent people bar none. Chance for advancement is great.
good,"I worked part time. I got normally 25+ hours. I learned how to keep calm in sticky situations, learned that I love helping people. The hardest part of the job was putting up heavy car parts."
good,Autozone has been good to me. I would for sure recommending people to take a shot at this industry. I just believe it's time for me to make a better move for myself and my family.
good,great place to work i loved my job. learn a lot about light maintenance and other automotive knowledge. management gives you a lot of freedom to do your job as you see fit.
good,It's a good place to work. They supply the uniforms. If you do your work and go home then it will be pleasant. I enjoyed being a driver even tho they watch your time so you get the deliveries done speedy.
good,"Constant balancing of customer service,inventory maintenance and business management. Also covers customer advisement,marketing and scheduling and occasional installation of minor auto parts, i.e. batteries, windshield wipers,etc."
good,Autozone trains their people very well and provides lots of advancement opportunities. They provide ASE training to all of their employees. Its demanding work but can be rewarding.
good,"management is great"
good,"Good environment, great people to work with , working with target, team building ,motivated by supervisors, can work in different departments and allowed to help other departments"
good,Opportunity to excell your automotive skills and help customers at the same time if youre looking for a career in the automotive  business the management programs offered are great
good,"Overall a good place to work. Pay is limited, but the work isn't overly complicated and is only occasionally physically demanding. Environment may vary by location and manager, but for a first full time job or as a second job it's great. Flexible hours. Also not bad for those nearing retirement who want to stay busy."
good,"Autozone is not a hard job at all. If you do not know much about cars, you will pick it up fast. Customers can come off as aggressive but it is not a common occurrence. My manager is very flexible with working with my school schedule and is generally a good manager, inspiring the people in the store to work to the best of their ability."
good,A typical day at work would consist of restocking from the previous day's sales.  Depending on how busy we are I would learn new tricks on how to navigate the computer screen.  The management is okay hard to get in touch with the boss while he is not working.  Hardest part of the job is trying to get people to buy brake lube because they think they do not need it when they actually do.  The most enjoyable part of the job is putting in batteries because you never know what you are going to run into when you go outside.
good,I love working here. The people are good and the team is strong. It is fast paced and hands-on. I did get a lot of overtime because we were short-handed.
good,Autozone is a great company to work for.I learned a lot about cars and the auto parts business.I moved up from a part sales manager to Assistant manager within 2 years.
good,Working at Autozone I've learned a lot about different parts of a car along with how to install or remove the car part. The employees are very nice to each other as well.
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo, ambiente positivo, respetuoso y flexible"
good,i loved working for autozone. i used to drive to different autozone in Louisiana work in the store and put up parts on truck day. it was fun working for autozone i would go back.
good,"There was an abundance of opportunities to advance in this business. The company itself was family based and everyone in the work environment treated their coworkers as they would like to be treated. Management was always on call so if any error occurred or any questions need answered, they were at hand to do so."
good,"time flies with how busy it gets during the day, given it's a busy store. tons of resources to learn more about vehicles and their parts for advancement in knowledge, skills, and position. management is fantastic (in most stores)."
good,"Since working with my current employer, I have been responsible for the daily operations of the store, troubleshooting customer concerns, daily sales and upselling of merchandise, responsible for training new hires for their position, working closely with the store manager and assisting other stores in my district as needed for sales or inventory purposes."
good,"a place were there's always things to do which makes time go by.."
good,"Help ur fellow Zoner help the cuteness achieve the goal of finding the parts, either hard to fibd or easy. Help shkw them the the correct way to install or uninstall the parts."
good,"Got along with everyone there, always fun helping customers and assist them in concerns they may have with their vehicles, you need at least a year before you're promoted to manager"
good,very good management at my location. fast paced customer oriented company.built relationships with employees and customers.Very respectful working environment.
good,Auto Zone was a great job the people I worked with were fantastic.  Put simply there was no room for me to move forward and make the money I was looking for.
good,"Very productive atmosphere and very knowledgable but management is not the best. They hire people that has no customer service skills or sales skills. When we show them how things operate, they usually walk away."
good,"Love my coworker and the help that we provide for the public. i learned how to change a battery, windshield wipers, and light bulbs on most cars. Also learned more about cars and hen i should change my oil and where all the oils go."
good,autozone es una buena empresa pero lo unico que no me agrada es de que al iniciar los sueldos son muy bajos lo genial son las prestaciones que superiores a la de la ley si eres soltero y sin responsabilidades autozone es para ti
good,"This was a great first job right out of college.  I learned a lot about cars, repair, and working a real job.  The management was not afraid to do the work of the low level employees.  This was a lower volume store, so it wasn't uncommon for management to train the lower-level employees in management duties."
good,AZ provides a fast paced environment for those who are competitive and have a sales nature. The work day is ever changing according to the needs of the customer. Customer service in #1 and AZ will provide adequate training to meet those needs.
good,"The beauty of this well structured company is that they encourage their employees to achieve their ASE certification. They will pay for your testing if you pass, and gladly help you find the resources for further education in this field. Unfortunately there are few who take advantage of this, and this one little fact hurts the company as a whole at street level. Effort is recognized and rewarded. "
good,"A typical work day varied."
good,I did ntknow much about car and. 6 moths learned alot . And meeting new people everyday. Nice on teaching you new things about cars good co workers. Would go back any time
good,"I was a fun fast paced work environment but it was hard to get more than 25 hours a week. I ended up leaving for a job that gave more hours, If I had stayed they would have offered me a managers position."
good,its a pretty cool job part time no more then 30 hours. management is  hands on and actually around answering questions and other people are helpful as well. i enjoy working here I'm a delivery driver and its probably one of the easiest things you could do and I've seen friends that are already starting training to manage their own store so advancement is here.
good,Autozone is a job the requires you know basic computer skills and to be willing to get your hands dirty. Have to be able to pick up 50 pounds from the ground and lift it up to your head.
good,i loved going to work everyday. my coworkers were amazing i learned  so many different things about cars and life it was just amazing. there was so many friendly people i got to meet.
good,"I like working at the autozone mostly due to the fact that i get to help people all day and be around things I enjoy older cars hot rods and such. The only thing that is a major deal breaker for me is the inconstant schedules, i like most people enjoy having similar work schedules on the day to day basis. Typical work day includes helping people change wipers, removing old batteries to install new ones, showing people how to remove and install light bulbs on their vehicle, help people diagnose what is going on with their car (by either using the check engine device, or as simple as explain what can cause winding noises under the hood..) Hardest part about the job would be having to explain to someone who has never worked on a car a day in their life how to do a job at the house without confusing them to much in the process."
good,"I've worked for AutoZone for 2 years and during my time I have been offered management positions on several occasions, which shows that you can move up in the company if you work hard and show it."
good,Always something to do. Challenges everyday. This job keeps you on your toes because of the verity of customer you deal with on a daily bases. The only real problem I have with the company is there pay. How can you pay a person who has been with company 2 months more than someone that has been with you for 10 years?
good,"What i learn in my job how to find the right car parts for customers.And make sure that what they are looking for andy door make sure they get greet by door and help them out finding their items.The hardestst part is memorizing all the new thing i learn."
good,"It's a great company for advancement.  You get to learn something new everyday. Fast paced environment, must know how to multitask. Happy and friendly place to work in."
good,"At this job i enjoyed being able to put my expertise into effect, allthough is not directly getting my hands dirty but being able to explain and give the customers my opinion and or help ment alto to me."
good,First day on the job i didn't know anything about cars but for working there for over 2 years I have learned so much by talking to the customers and my coworkers.
good,"Fun fast paced environment, increase in pay will keep the staff happy for their hard labor. Great people to deal with. Great enviorment. Only thing that boiled my water was assisting with the building of a new store for 9 dollars a hour. That was pure slavery and didn't even provide fee lunches."
good,great company to work for if only they gave you more hours and paid a little better but other then that i have no complaints about the compnay. the only place i buy parts at.
good,"Enjoyable work, but the merchandise was a lot and heavy. The management seemed a little more unbiased, but with some ego. Typical retail job with all the fun."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with coworkers who are fun to work with. Management is ok depending on which branch you work at, but overall the company has a lot of perks so it's a cool company to work for."
good,"at autozone you learn basics on parts and how they work and affect the vehicle when not replaced when needed. co-workers are great we work as a team to help customer's get their project done right. the hardest part of the job is getting familiar with the commercial accounts but once you get the hang of it, it will be a breeze."
good,"Autozone is the best of all automotive shops that exist now, it fun and you have great leadership and mentors not only in cars not life as well."
good,"You basically  help customers with getting the parts for their vehicles and advising them how to use the rental tools. answer their questions as an example what toe of oil, or transmission fluid, what size wiper blades, etc. You look them all up on a computer, then check them out. The hardest part when I started their is the fact I was only 1 of 2 females working in a mans inviroment and I had to prove to the men I know what I was doing, and I actually after about 3 months of proving myself I had customers come in and ask for me  to take care of them. Ohter wise I enjoyed my job"
good,I enjoyed working with the other employees. Taught me what I needed to know to work there. They employe discount was my favorite part of working there.
good,This company has been the  best of the best in their management team. The manager i had was the best and usually are Responsible men and women that lead by example.
good,"A typical day involves troubleshooting, diagnosing, and customer service"
good,"Typical day at work is I go in, see if any parts need to be delivered if not sometimes we put auto parts on the shelves and work with customers that come into the store.The managers and co-workers all get along great sometimes it can be stressful but that happens at most jobs but a lot of the time it's stress free. The hardest part I would have to say is when some customers come in and not really know what they are looking for. The most enjoyable part is being able to help customers out."
good,Customer service.  helping other fix their cars.  100% customer service. Fun place to work. great leadership.  Helping others in need.  more sincere place to work.
good,Walk in and greeted warmly. Provides great customer service. Knowledgeable on all products offered. Fast and easy service.
good,Working at Autozone is always a different day. Management is great and everyone is willing to help. Most of the time we keep busy and I learned so much about the company and my job title and continue to learn something new everyday. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job would be the people I work around. We keep it fun but do our jobs in all seriousness.
good,"A typical day consisted of looking up parts, restocking shelves, checking batteries and check engine lights. The management was easy to get along with as long as the assigned tasked were done. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the customers but this is most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Auto Zone is a nice place to work. The only complaint , is that they don't offer full time to enough of there employees."
good,The training received is very minimal so most lazy or non self starters are weeded out quickly. There are not many hours to cover what is needed to get done but management prioritizes well.
good,this is one of the best places I've worked yet! district managers really care about the employees that apply themselves. not the best pay in the world be the benefits are good!
good,"through my journey with Autozone I learned a great deal about "
good,"grate company to work for i am very sad i have to leave but i really have no choice!"
good,"great place to work the staff at my store was very friendly and always helped each other out, flexible work hours they were always able to give me the days off i requested as long as i requested them on time. and if your willing to work hard and learn your products promotions come quickly."
good,"A typical day is multi-tasking answering multiple phone calls and helping customers at the counter. "
good,While at autozone i had a lot of hard workers that i was able to learn from. It was very easy to get along with everyone. I learned how to better myself in my time management and leadership skills. The hardest part was dealing with some frustrating customers in bad situations. The best part was my regulars that would come in and would directly ask for me because I always got them exactly what they needed.
good,Was a friendly work place and made some lifelong friends. Picked up some very useful skills along the way. The hardest part of the job was the costumers. Trying to relate very little information into a full solution was trying at best.
good,"IT's pretty much like i said, it is a very fun place to work at. the People are nice and polite and very easy to get along with. Also the benefits through them are very well."
good,"Fun place to work. Meet all kind of people. See almost every car possible from classic to exotics. Learn so much about car parts and what they do. co workers are fun to be around lot of cultures. "
good,Just using a alpha-numerical system to put parts in right place.
good,"AutoZone's culture places the customer at the forefront of our business. We are constantly advised and trained in ways to place the customer first, whether it is from greeting them promptly or going out to their car to test a battery."
good,"Knowledge about the automotive field is imperative and with quality management, learning the industry is attainable. Laid back place to work and fun to be had."
good,"Fun friendly work environment, Enjoyed interaction with different customers knowing a lot of them were coming into the store with automotive problems and being able to help them solve their problems/make recommendations to help get the cars fixed."
good,Autozone is a great company to work for. I've learned a lot about car parts and how to fix certain problems that cars may have. Everyone on my team is very friendly and awesome people. I love my job but what I love the most is providing excellent customer service. Nothing feels better than putting a smile on your customers face.
good,"One on One customer service"
good,Very corporate place of employment. All orders come from the top down. A typical day here consists primarily of customer service and product knowledge development.
good,"it has been one of the most fun and fulfilling experiences of my career , everyone is very friendly and I learned to manage myself in a fast paced environment , I enjoyed my costumers and help them even beyond of my job requirements. I got promoted to a Parts sales manager within a year of working and going to different types of training."
good,"Good place to work. Good co-workers. Fun to work with. To be able to work at Auto Zone you must be willing to work hard and truly love customer service. Taking care of the customer is important for the Diy customer, and return business."
good,"The day would start with a quick staff meeting, establish sales objectives, cold call customers, take commercial orders, fill orders, dispatch drivers, train coworkers on daily duties."
good,Meeting New People from all walks of life and keeping busy! Selling auto parts and having great product knowledge.
good,"Everything was Great In Easy About The Job, Everyone was Nice In Helping each other."
good,"In the beginning I knew nothing about cars, customer service, management, inventory, or really any key aspects of what my job description was. Through a very knowledgeable management staff above me, I quickly picked up on many different areas which lead me to becoming a manager.  Furthermore, one of the largest and most exciting areas for me that I picked up on was inventory management and the skills that came with it. Even more so, I feel like I have become very experienced in the customer service department and still recognize it as the hardest aspect of the job as you are always learning new ways to handle situations, whether it be with actual customers or other members on your team. Lastly, one of the most enjoyable aspects of my job would have to be managing team members. I love being able to lead and teach AutoZoners on their daily task, or even what they could do to help make our store better."
good,"Orders come through fast and at a high volume, all members of management including myself are always in touch with surroundings, everyone is nice."
good,"Love the driving and the schedule, love the repour you build with your clients.  Management are great as well."
good,"Finding, selling and delivering auto parts to commercial businesses, assisting cash customers with auto parts needs, parts issue diagnoses, suggesting best parts for specific needs, suggesting special 'helper' products."
good,"I see hundreds of customers a week, and oversee up to six other employees per day. The store I work at has had some mismanagement issues in the past, but I feel with the crew I have now, we are raising the standard of customer service. I enjoy being challenged in my vehicle knowledge everyday and always learning new things as technology progresses."
good,Its a great place to work.  The company has been around for over 30 years. There are people who have been working there as long as the company been in existence. That alone tells you something about the company.  But overall very professional IT department with lots of great talent.
good,"Really enjoyed my job there. Just wish it would have worked out,"
good,"I enjoyed my customers that came to the store, I knew that the reason they were at Auto Zone was not for a pleasurable reason. I tried my hardest to make them feel at ease and enjoy being at Auto Zone. I wanted to make sure they knew how important they were to us and how we appreciated thier business. Auto Zone is a great company to work for but unfortunately the team work was not at all present with the store I was working with."
good,"It can be overwhelming with how many people need help. "
good,"good morale, fast paced always something to do and we had fun doing our jobs."
good,I would deliver parts to many different auto places. Take orders over the phone also. I had a good manager and even better co workers. The hardest part of my job would ave to be getting used to being around mean all the time. That was a little difficult. I loved every other part of my job.
good,"Been going to this AutoZone for years and finally landed a job there when I graduated High School. It was fun at first, learned a lot about cars and customer service, but needed something more challenging after two years."
good,team work and customer service miss it there. great team work and willing to show you and coach
good,"A typical day would consist of clocking in and doing your job, which is fairly easy, having a few laughs clocking out and go about your day. It was easy to pick up on anything that the job required i.e.: computer skills, cash register experience, automotive, etc. Management teams are very respectful and always are willing to help beginners and whoever else is interested in advancing in the company. Co-workers were friendly and always looked to do good for the team. Hardest part of the job would be the typical angry customer, but with good people skills was easily solved. The entire job itself was enjoyable."
good,"Como supervisor de personal y ventas fue muy satisfactorio, pues se veian reflejadas en el incremento de ventas y de clientes hacia la tienda, en general se manejaba mucho el trabajo en equipo y la cultura optima de atencion al cliente"
good,All of the employees I worked with were very helpful and I got along with them very well. I learned a lot about servicing vehicles and how to be good at customer service. The hardest part of the job was the discrimination against me because I was a woman working at an auto parts store. I loved working there though because we always had awesome music playing.
good,"Stocking up parts ,cashier , and Customer service . Learned how to greet and meet customers. Management is good very hard workers.Co-workers were excellent worked good as a team together. The hardest this was that we had to stand the whole time. The most enjoyable part was being recognized as one of the fastest workers and hard working person."
good,"A typical day may consist of putting wiper blades on a car, checking a starter or alternator, or even installing a battery. Being that we assisted all customers with their cars that meant you were going to learn something different everyday because of the different cars you deal with."
good,Enjoyed working with customers trying to help solve problems. Inventory control
good,Helping customers with everyday car problems
good,"Fast paced, customer oriented job where team members are encouraged to promote sells to provide customers  the opportunity to only have to make ""one trip"" essentially getting it right the first  tome."
good,"If you honest and enjoy people and don't mind learning sales."
good,"Working for autozone Is both good and bad. They have wonderful and understanding management at all times, but for me, the pay doesn’t fully compensate for all the work that’s being done. Loading and unloading a lot of parts from the floor to the van and from the van to the floor, and then drive all over the city making deliveries for only $11.10/hr."
good,"I ran three Autozone branches in my career of which all three were successes, I moved on on started four other new company which to are successful to date."
good,I applied to Auto Zone to increase my knowledge of cars and retail. My expectations were met fully. The people were the greatest part of working there.
good,Managing employees was great. I learned a lot from it. Employees will trust honest people they work for. Unfortunately I got fired for not making the deposit at the bank because of people hanging out at the deposit area.
good,"Autozone is good place to work even if you're not too familiar with vehicles. As long as you are open to learning, you can definitely move up. I prefer the commercial department over the front counter part of the job. In commercial you work with the same accounts every day and same people. I find it easier to work with people you're familiar with. A typical day of work is pretty straight forward and there's always something to do."
good,Very good company to work for and stable. Great for advancement. They have great full time benefits and opportunity for part timers. I would recommend to someone looking for a stable career.
good,The most enjoyable thing working there was working with people being able to help them. Your always going to get customers that are difficult but one situation will help you with the next.
good,La empresa tiene una gran apertura para hacer crecer a su gente.
good,I enjoyed working there but probably more so from the people I worked with. By no means is it a hard job you do have to work but it isn't complicated.
good,This is a really busy store and like any other retail store you have to work hard to go up the chain. It's a normal 9-5 job except for the schedules are different every day depending on when they need you etc. Management is really nice they always go by the book and those who do not follow orders will be written up.
good,"Everyday at Auto Zone is exciting and challenging."
good,A typical day will start early with phone calls. There is always something new to learn. Znet provides a lot of information to help all types of clients.
good,There’s always something to do while working here. You pick up a lot of information on cars and the discount is always nice. Good vacation time and sick leave.
good,helping customers find what they needed and scanned vehicle for trouble shooting the problems. I did pick up a few things working for autozone. Management was helpful and teaching me more. hardest part of the job was rude customers. Most enjoying part of the job was helping people get what they needed the first go around.
good,"A typical day working at an Autozone Store in the morning involved completing morning paperwork, counting tills, setting up and positioning the tasks for the following employees. Daily goals were posted to reach production and enhance sales. Providing customer satisfaction was a key component. To make sure the customer got what they needed to get the job done and help them get what they might have missed. The hardest part truly working at Autozone will be the mid-day rushes of customers."
good,"porras todos los días abierto al publico y en cualquier momento, mecánica automotriz, oportunidad de crecimiento, la cultura laboral: vivir día con día la misión de la compañia, la parte mas dificil es que el sistema no detecta la falla concreta, la parte que mas me gusto fue que la empresa siempre pone al cliente primero"
good,You are able to learn new stuff within every shift. There is always a different experience once you enter the store. Managers and co-workers encourage each other and help each other to do better. It is more team based when the store is full.
good,Parts knowledge is essential. The most enjoyable part is being able to assist customers who are having car trouble. The hardest part is trying to find parts for cars when the engine has been switched out or modified.
good,"Friendly environment, great staff , and a fun place to work. helping customers, and answering questions. great schedule, and they promote within the company."
good,"A typical day would be clocking in and waiting for customers to come in, if the day was slow you would be putting things on the shelves or cleaning. You learn a lot about cars if you are completely new to them in general."
good,"Typical day: Open store, get store set up for customers, answering phone and give advice to customer with any car problem."
good,"Very engaging and interactive culture. No mission statement, instead there is a pledge and values. I loved the people culture. The caveat was the distance. I lived out in Bartlett and the drive was like 40 minutes."
good,Really enjoyed working for them. If you like cars and being a great salesman its a great job for anyone! They have a great advancement opportunity if you can prove you are worth it.
good,"great management and work environment. friendly work employees and customers. going in with no knowledge of cars, I was able to pick up on a lot and know a little more than average at work and in my personal life with my own vehicle. would definitely go work for autozone again."
good,"muy demandante con alto enfoque a al cliente a resolver sus dudas ,conocer muy bien nuestras marcas y servicios extender el diagnostico de sus vehiculos con consejos profecionales para incrementar tiket promedio ,administrar en su totalidad los recursos de la empresa , manejando toda las herramientas y personal humano ."
good,I am a deliver driver so my job is pretty easy.  I go in and get a sheet of parts that I have to deliver to different autozones.  The one I work at is a hub so it carries more parts then other autzones.  Once I check the parts I load them and drive to each store dropping off the parts they need
good,"Un dia tipco,seria llegar al lugar de trabajo y encontrarte con un mundo de cotizaciones,clientes en espera,pedidos para ya ser enviados,etc."
good,"I ran the commercial dept every day is a diff day at the zone , the exciting part was finding  rare parts . Autozone gives the tools to do the best for its employee and really puts customers first !"
good,Job was good overall have my life to it but it became consuming . There is room to advance but it takes so much time . And you have to make sure your always on your a game
good,"Good place to work, good benifitscan gain automotive exoperience if looking for a career with hard work and dedication advance from customer service representaive to district manager."
good,"Extremely busy and requires extreme organization . The hardest part about the job is,the number of phone calls you take everyday. Overall the job is pretty easy"
good,Busy and a pleasant place to work a diversity in the company with everybody respecting one another.  Most days everybody are team players.There is room for advancement and also you get to experience each job duties.
good,This is a great company! I learned a lot here.Diagnose the customers car problem and give them the advice they need to get their vehicle running like new. I set up different planograms to displays our different sales an offers that we're offering. Price changes an different sale strategies to help up our sales on our DIY and commercial side. I changed the customers batteries if purchased at our location also their headlight bulbs and air filters. I took different test to help me learn about the different products they we have to offer to insure that I lead the customer with the right advice on the product.
good,Autozone is a meritocracy where one can expect to advance as far as they want as quickly as they can put in the effort required. The best organization I've worked for by far.
good,"a typical day at autozone consist mainly of, installing car batteries, checking out customers, answering the phone, maintain area of work clean. receive  shipments"
good,"The work is sometimes challenging but definitely satisfying due to the help and patience I get from my mentors/managers. Initial training is to be desired, it consists of  watching videos and reading up then some discussion about the company, expectation from a new hire, job related information and finally doing a few tests. Fortunately for me, my co-workers all help in continuing my education about the job."
good,"I enjoyed the Job (not as much after they got the Ford Fiestas) I worked with good people, and was treated fairly. If had not moved, I would probably still be there."
good,This was a fun place to work if you are into cars. It had good benefits and vacations. Up beat and busy at times. Great company!

good,"From the moment I was hired I was automatically joined into a ""family"".  We always worked together no matter if if was in our job description or not."
good,"I love working at Autozone. The store i work in sometimes gets involves in drama due to some of the women management, and my store being a hub store."
good,Great place to work. Management is flexible with hours if need be. Compensation is adequate. I've only worked in the store for a couple times so I don't know much about it.
good,"Five star service handling customers, products and prices. wonderful place to work, great benefits and a warm and friendly atmosphere"
good,"Clock in , Register Audit, Friendly co-workers, I learned and furthered my knowledge on auto parts, Hardest Part was of working was putting up stocks on the shelf but overall it wasn't that hard."
good,"GPTW - great place to work."
good,I have learned better time management skills. Inventory management and customer service skills. I enjoy my job very much. Every day there is something different so you don't do the same thing all the time.
good,"Diario er"
good,"A typical day of work is a normal flow of customers looking for help with everyday automotive questions and concerns. I learned more about auto part . Management and co workers are extremely nice and helpful. The hardest part of my job was when I first started, locating some parts in the store, and the most enjoyable part was help my customers."
good,"Working Retail has its pro and its cons like every job. A typical day at my store is very busy you must be able to multitask. The most valuable thing I have learned at my job is diversity and how to embrace it. Being a member of management is awesome because you set the moral in your store. Co-workers are a huge part of my work day because as a team we work together to reach sales goals, contest goals etc. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people."
good,Great enviroment to work in. Lots of them work. The hardest part is going out in the weather to look under the hood of car.
good,I lorne good knowladge of parts and how the part work in a vehicle.
good,"es una buena empresa que continuamente esta capacitando a sus trabajadores, buen salario, buenas prestaciones"
good,A typical day at Auto zone is always interesting helping guess diagnose there automotive problems. what i have learned is everyone has there own problems. Well i am the most experienced manger so i find the different ways that all the other managers interact with the guess. I enjoy working with my co-workers because they are much younger then myself. The hardest part of the is generally recieving the truck and getting it processed. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the guess!
good,Get to meet a multitude of people ranging from the DIYer to professional automotive technicians.
good,I enjoyed working for Autozone. It had a friendly environment and was a fast paced place to work. Everyone got along and enjoyed each others' company.
good,"Drove customer service and sales meeting monthly sales goals , Managed tills, cashiered and performed various accounting functions for the store. maintained merchandising standards, created displays, placed inventory orders and restocked shelves. wrotes all schedules for associates within the department approved pto to ensure suffcient coverage............"
good,Autozone is an great company to work for. Customer sales is the main forcus also to insure costomer recive the correct part the first time
good,I learned a great deal of knowledge about automobile parts. I loved the challenge of identifying problems and solutions associated with car maintenance.

good,Autozone provides a great opportunity for management and it is a relaxing environment.
good,"Good Atmosphere ,geared towards customer Satisfaction ,Clean organized"
good,"My particular employment may not be typical. As a large corporation, communication with the headquarters was efficient. I ran the store's nightly closing but up until then, I'm assisting my crew and making sure all the day's tasks are completed. At the same time, I am available for any counterman with a question or problem related to parts sales or application, technical or otherwise."
good,"Can get really busy at times but then it has its slow moments when we can get stuff done. Management is easy to get along with and fair. The hardest part of the job right now would be lack of staff. But we are improving, just got a store manager back so now we can start hiring."
good,aprendi mucho y agradezco la oportunidad que me dieron para poder llegar hasta el puesto de supervisor.
good,"I have worked there for a year now. It has been an excellent experience for me. I like the commercial side. Delivering parts. I am a manager there. And I love my job.  In order to be a manager, you have to give up all free time. You literally can’t have weekends or holidays off. The store manager at my store can be mean. He gets all the bonuses for us working so hard. So that’s a downside. Nobody gets them but him and the hirgher ups. It’s kinda sucky. But other than that, it’s a great company to work for."
good,Sehr gut. Guter arbeitgeber und nette Kollegen. Angenehme Arveitsatmosphäre und gute Arbeitszeiten.
good,Great Job I learned a lot from management and the team. Loved working with the costumers and getting to know new things about cars and product that we sell.

good,"Auto Zone is a great place to work at, you learn new things everyday.There is always something to do and the managers are very helpful!"
good,Very easy job very flexible schedule was able to attend work and school. Great management.Learned the name of vehicle parts learned how to check a battery an alternator and to replace windshield wipers.
good,A regular work day would consist of driving sales to expectation and targets. The most difficult part of the job is resolving customers issues that were done and not resolved. Every customer is different therefore there always has to be a different approach of resolving issues to each and every unsatisfied customer. Working with this company has matured myself as a person and as a manager to want more out of life and to achieve goals thought impossible.
good,I a day at Autozone was very busy and people constantly in and out There was never a dull moment. i enjoyed meeting all the different people and helping them.Some days it was hard because i didnt have the best knowledge about cars. I worked with some amazing people that helped me out alot.
good,the hardest thing at this job was lifting iron steel all day long in the heat but some days was fun with the right people.
good,"Walking into work I always make sure to have a good attitude not only to make it a better day but also for the customers as well. I learn that not every car part is going to be applicable for every car, and not every customer is going to be happy when they walk through that door. My job is to get them what they need as fast, yet efficiently as I can and get them hopefully in a better mood then what they came in with. My manager is always challenging me to new things to learn to better myself as an associate as well as for my company. The team that I work with is phenomenal and we always are finding some way to work together as a team not just one on one. Some days are better than others and sometimes you cant always make a customer happy, and that is the hardest part. However I am always learning something new, no matter what it may be in the system or with a vehicle and it is never a dull day."
good,I was there a short period of time. Everyone was nice and helpful.
good,It was fun and the people were nice and helpful there was never a dull moment the managers always had us doing something no matter how slow or busy it was
good,I have really enjoyed working at Auto Zone since it is a small store and we all know each other. If one calls in sick then we pull together to cover that shift and we all know each other weakness and strengths which will enable us to get the job done right in the est way possible.
good,I will be going back to AutoZone as soon as possible it's at u learn new things ever day that goes by it's a nice environment to work for I will give anything bto go back and work for the company
good,some days are faster paced than others very easy to learn the computer systems and how to answer phones customer service is a plus this is a great place for college students as they are helpful with schedules
good,"This company makes Billions of Dollars but doesn't reward the employees in any direction.I have been there over a year and worked with 35 different people."
good,"Loved everything about this job. Learned alot. Net alot of people. Got to travel to other stores for inventory , company paid gas and room and board"
good,I loved working here and really enjoyed my co workers and the manager was a great teamplayer was a safe  environment truly a great place to work and grow with the company.
good,"Very busy atmosphere - management of daily activities "
good,This internship gave mw the opportunity to grow as a sport professional. The management placed a great deal on my plate within my short tenure.
good,"helping customers, looking up car parts, helping customers with wiper  blade replacements battery changes the best part of working there is you learn as you go.  the least enjoyable part is the little amount of overtime available to regular employees."
good,"Autozone is a great place to be the environment is great, fast paced and everyone is there to work and doing the job right the first time. the Boss works around my school schedule and the company is paying for my ASE certificates."
good,"I started at Autozone at the bottom as a Customer Service Representative. I worked my way up to Store Manager in a 2 year period. My duties included working with customers, putting up merchandise, verifying returns, counting cash registers, taking care of inventory, writing schedules, and keeping up with paperwork. I loved being able to solve the problems that were presented to me, weather it be with customers or within the store, problem solving is a passion I have. The most complicated part of my job was keeping up with inventory. It was an easy task that I did well, it was just a tedious job. I don't mind doing it because I can do it, it was just a lot of steps to take in doing so."
good,Trying to know everything about all cars can be tough. Slow times can be filled with keeping the store clean
good,Auto Zone does not have day shift available so you need to work evenings as well as weekends. Be ready to be cross trained and not just focus on driving .Benefits are unavailable to part time employees.
good,This place was great to work at until management decided that they did not care about their employees
good,"Interesting experience"
good,If you’re not in the click you want make it.  The manager does what her friends tell her to do.  No thinking for herself.  Need someone to be over the returns and recall warehouse that is not good friends with full time employees.  They do not respect her as a manager or person.
good,A typical day at work is full of customer service and me taking care of my customers. I havent learned anything or advance since i started working for Auto Zone a year and a half ago. The management team needs to learn how to be more of a team to better help the employees. The hardest part of my job is working in a disfuncuntional work place. The most enjoyable part of my job are my customers.
good,"I enjoyed working there, the pay was just horrible with no benefits included. If I ever worked there again I would have to be in an higher position with benefits."
good,for the most part Autozone allowed me to meet new and exciting people it also advanced my knowledge about cars and how they work. and also just what it takes to get the Job done right.
good,"Although Autozone is a great place to work, it has its challenges. very high turn over rate. Poor management. Salary is not up to par. It is great for a part time job not for a career."
good,The harder you work the more they push. Honest work for decent pay. Seniority on the job means nothing however. If you plan to move up have experience elsewhere.
good,"A parts delivery driver often starts the workday by loading goods onto the delivery truck. A delivery route is then planned, and the driver travels to each customer's location to deliver the parts."
good,"Nice place to work "
good,Worked long hours only to not be appreciated
good,The company overall was good but the upper management from the District manager on down sucks. You have a Dm who only promotes a majority of females due to other things than just job performance. If he likes you your promoted while others are passed over and looked at as nothing. You have alot of favoritism shown from the dm on down and is why I left along with a host others.
good,I answered all of your questions accordingly. It’s pretty self explainitory. I wouldn’t work there for the rest of my life and don’t see myself happy working there for the rest of my life. It’s just not for me. It may be for others that is their own prerogative. To each his own and I am no one to judge. Good Day 😎
good,I was hired and told that they didnt hire full time.  I offered to take a cut in pay to take a lower job in order to get fulltime.  Instead they hired a male from outside the company.
good,"Sometimes long days, working with customers to ensure the right parts are sold. Managing my subordinates to ensure all procedures are followed and completed."
good,"Before i transferred to an Iowa location everything was going great i loved my job, but then i transferred and my new manager was just taking over a store and he did not acknowledge anybodys request for hours off or days that they NEEDED off"
good,overall it is nice I love the people that come in you in up build a relationship with them.
good,"A typical day at work was really busy and dealing with a lot of customers. I learned a lot more about cars then when I started. Management was horible once we got a new Manager, Co-workers were great, The hardest part was dealing with customers who didnt even know they type of car they drove then got mad thatwe couldnt give them the parts they want. The most enjoyable part was solving a problem with the customers needs."
good,I did my job. It was easy. I followed the rules. Easiest part was delivering parts. Hardest part was managing people who didn’t want to work. Customers were friendly and made me love my job
good,It's ok! I would recommend someone to work there! A typical day is pretty busy! Job security is pretty good there! The managers and staff are very friendly!
good,I scanned auto parts and handed them out to people. I learned how to change my oil. Honestly management was useless. Co workers where fantastic and the hours where awesome
good,"I really like working for Auto Zone everyone is very nice. I like stocking the shelves on truck day, driving the delivery van and talking  the other employees and customer. I like helping people with what they need to purchase."
good,"help customers with parts, stock shelves, deliver parts. overall fun place to work."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and my favorite part was installing. They teach you so much about products and auto parts. I also did my own studies to help my customers find exactly what they needed. Good job for a younger guy or girl that has a passion for cars and trucks.
good,"They taught me to do planograms,unload and put away stock.To multitask with answering the phone and assisting a customer.Great invironent to work in.."
good,"Horrible pay and managers, not the best place to work, pay u less for what the expect u to do. Dirty store. Horrible communication. Wouldn't apply again."
good,Autozone was a great company to work for if you really need a job and like working with auto parts and automobiles in general. Advancement opportunities exist but it can be very biased. Upper management seems lost on the touch with the personal work on a store sales level.
good,"Es muy buena la compañía, me encanta bregar con los clientes poder brindarles un buen servicio, ya que el servir es algo que me apasiona."
good,Was thankful for the chance to work there. Was a driver hours fluctuated too much. Some weeks 2 hours others 25-39. It’s a great job for someone with auto experience.
good,"would clock in and start my day i would answer phone calls till i had a delivery and customer service in the front of store.. Management wasn't really around, i learned how to work with computerized systems. The wasn't a hard part in my job everything was fairly okay."
good,The job and learning about automotive equipment was fun. But customer service was not so fun. People can be very rude and cruel and even steal at times.
good,"This would be your typical retail job where you're ask to push items on sale, the customer is always right, and most of the opportunities are part time so you get no benefits."
good,"They dont belive in growth within the company"
good,"The pay wasn't all that great. The manager was awesome though, he seemed to care about everyone. It was a learning experience, everyday u learned something new"
good,Over all a great place to work. The things you can learn there even if you start out not knowing much about cars you can learn. Most of the management teams are good. You always are busy.
good,My job was challenging but i enjoyed it.Sometimes the customers are very rough but i ended up sattisfying the customers by solving the querie.Im always polite when it comes to clients
good,to help DIY (do it yourself customers) have been a automotive technician for over 10 years wanted to get out of the field put in head lights tail lights and even scanned codes and told them my professional thoughts.
good,"Great supply chain that support business strategy and highly advancing  industry. "
good,Assisting co workers cashiering unloading freight stocking scheduling etc typical managerial position
good,"Working at auto zone was very fun, simple fact that I am a female so the males thought I didn't know about cars, Co-worker i enjoy working with them. The manager were very understanding and helpful, well the hardest part about auto zone is not being able to find a car part."
good,"The company on a whole is a good company to work for, just don't ever quite if you ever want to work for them again. Once you leave the company for any reason, they will not hire you back."
good,"Comfortable work atmosphere,  hard, fast, competitive,rewarding not much chance for overtime but,  everyone is cooperative management was helpful in training, your independence is required to get the job done..Nobody has time to look over your shoulder."
good,"I go in 730 am to 1230 and i do commercial so i inspect the birth chomping cars and whither down ln the binder. I also put items back where they go , answer phones And deliver to shops. I enjoy what i do."
good,"it could be fast paced, but typically relaxed, management was great, but the hours and pay were not, I never experienced to much trouble from customers at the work place, and management was always on top of things!"
good,i enjoy working at auto zone  i try my best to take customer needs and solve their auto problems    always finding warranty  parts and helping when i can
good,"had to deal with people in and out of the store, learned alot about cars while i was there, stocking the shelves, charging batteries running diagnocis on there vechicals"
good,"Working with garages and shops to get customers vehicles back on the road . Promoting sales, retrieving cores and receiving account payments. The downside is that this is still retail."
good,Working at Autozone is a good start but shouldn't be a life goal I have learned all there is too learn wouldn't make it your life long job.Its a good job for part time while your in school.
good,I would help customers find parts they needed for their repair. I learned of different car parts and general knowledge of my car. Management did need improvement. The work place was also clique like at the store I was at. The hardest was misinformed customers.
good,"Autozone is a very big business, the managers are all about their business. This being my first job it is very fast pace environment, the customers can be very rude at times. my coworkers are cool but also very gossipy. everyday is something new at that store, im constantly taking over other peoples shifts because they decided not to show up, the kind of work that i put in just isnt worth my pay."
good,"My typical included inventory control, lose prevention, accurate part sales, opening and closing the store IAW set policies.   I learned to slow down."
good,Auto zone was a great place to work gave fair hours and good wages. Was just looking for job I could grow in not a place to stay in an idle position. Would not mind working there again later in life. Thanks AZ
good,Working at autozone was great with dealing with customers but management was very unprofessional. I was pushed it quiting from there but the manager and fellow employees.
good,working at auto zone is a great experience you for someone who is interested in cars to touch base and learn about how they work.for  me the most enjoyable part of working for auto zone was going outside and changing customers batteries and light bulbs or anything  i could do to help the customers
good,Employees at my location were very helpful and friendly. I learned a lot of new stuff while working here.The hardest part of the job was dealing with some difficult customers. However it was very enjoyable helping customers solve there problems and putting a smile on their face.
good,"AutoZone is a great company for younger personnel, and great for older persons looking for a part time job that don't care about high wages. The younger group are generally getting started in life and not expecting high salaries."
good,A typical 3rd shift day at work was long and busy.. This is a really good company to work for the pay and benefits were awesome the only thing is you really have to kill your body to get that good check and you have to work frequent overtime.. the management (advisors) were not good at all. None of the advisors got along and they had their favorites. To me that Is not a good work environment we should all be treated equal.. there was also too much drama grown adults acting like kids.. the most enjoyable part was truly just the work. Time always flew by fast..
good,"A typical day at Autozone consisted of stocking shelves, taking care of customers, and working with auto parts. I learned about all the different parts of what it takes to replace auto parts and ordering for the customers. The management and co-workers were great to get along with we all worked well together. The hardest part of my job was the computer system. The most enjoyable part was the customers"
good,"A typical day at work would involve assisting ""do it yourself"" customers (ones that come into the stores) with finding specific car parts that they need to complete their job. When a commercial delivery was ready, I would sign out the company car and complete that delivery to the designated commercial account. I usually learn something new everyday that I work, whether its what a part does, or something new about a specific type of car. I typically interact with my managers and co-workers throughout the day. The hardest part of the job, is when we don't have the product in the store and I need to drive to another store to pick that up. The most enjoyable part is knowing that I am making the customer happy with assisting in their project."
good,"Busy, all employees assist customers, and help each other as a team. The hardest part is winter, installing batteries, and changing wipe blades."
good,"This place is a great job to learn from experiance the the auto industry."

good,"Work day starts off depending on shift. If mourning open the store, if closing close the store. Look up parts, set up displays and talk cars all day through shift. Only negative was random work days and once you are hired up to sales management there is no where to go unless youve been with the company for years still making 8.50 an hour and one of the store managers positions open up."
good,"I started my management career here, and am glad. AZ has culture that reflects true customer service down to the last penny spent. I say that because the utilize a culture of thrift, and pass the saving to customers, price match competitors, and save commercial shop money so the the end user of the part gets quality and save money too."
good,Very rewarding job dealing with the public. The other employees are ever easy to get along with and have a good laught with. I really liked how relaxed the atmosphere was.

good,Bad upper management. Need more help from upper management. Need to learn to promote from with in the company. Or teach what they employee need to do to further there career

good,"You must be a driven and goal oriented individual to be able to advance with this company. Selfless and motivated, good things will come afterwards. There is a little bit of luck and a lot of patience needed. This company has allowed for me to work from the bottom up all the way to a store manager. The daily life is a struggle and very stressful if you care about what you do. In the end, it was a fun and fast paced environment that I would not mind going back to. Life balance was difficult and the sole reason I parted ways with this Autozone. ie:call ins, covering shifts, mandatory weekend rotations. As a store manager, your life begins and ends with staffing, but it is ungodly difficult to find quality employees when you are pay minimum wage. You truly get what you pay for."
good,Autozone was a great company to work for. I was always busy with phone calls and it helped me develop my skills. I learned a lot while working here. I really enjoyed it.

good,"As well as a good place if u love to drive back and forth. But it got stressful at times, usually towards the end of the day would be the busiest. Overall it's a good start up job."
good,"As long you put the customer first while abiding by AutoZone policy, it was a good place to work. The customers can get rowdy and flood the place, but you just treat everyone with a smile and respect and do what you're suppose to."
good,"I only worked for this company for side money. I didn't care enough to pay attention to anything, but since there is a 150 character minimum for this mandatory review, here you go."
good,"A typical day was selling parts to customers, I learned more about selling parts and working with new people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the angry customers."

good,My head boss was awesome however it was the Assistant store manger that caused me to leave. I would gladly go back to work fo my store manager but he isnt there.
good,"I haven't been there for long, but the few months I've been there have been awesome. The manager who's in charge is understanding, he is fair, he appreciates things that you do. Overall a great place to work and to go up the latter."
good,This was a basic job. You help customers and get along with the people you work with. The hardest part would be finding a part the you don't know about. The customers don't always take it well when this happens.
good,Me and my son both worked at this great company. The reason for me leaving was to relocate to Florida and pursue a career in music. However they hired my son and were very good to him. Employees at AutoZone know there  thing.

good,I enjoyed my time here and the manager was great to work for.  Job allowed me flexibility to go to school and also keep a great job.  I would recommend AutoZone to anyone looking for a great job with great people to work with.
good,A typical work day would be quiet busy quite busy depending on who your asking. Ive learned how to multi-task in a fast pace working enviornment. Between the management and the workplace culture it is a pretty darn good company to work for. I would say the hardest part would be standing all day but the most enjoyable part of the job was being there with my fellow employers and managers.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Auto Zone, the only problem was that there were lack of hours, even though the manager tried to give me as many as he could, it was still difficult for him to find the hours.  Sometime I would have to work at one of the other stores and I appreciate his effort in trying to help me."
good,I really loved this place and i would go back if i could. Management was the best Ive ever seen. They were very nice and willing to help out if you needed it
good,lots of stuff to learn about vehicles and how they function. Customers can be a hassle since most don't know what they even need for their car. Coworkers are very helpful

good,I enjoyed working here because I enjoy talking about cars and I get along with everybody so meeting new people was a big thumbs up! Sometimes you would be under staffed but that's nothing if you know how to step up and get the job done!!
good,"It's an auto parts store. High speed, high volume, with plenty of customers to keep you busy. Usually too busy, as upper management (Regional) throws higher and higher arbitrary upsell pitches to you, when dealing with this area's customers, they dont want to spend any more than they absolutely have to."

good,"Everyday is different, a customer comes in with a different problem everyday. The workplace is either constantly busy or slow, there is no in between. The people I worked with were awesome and even consider them personal friends. The only down side about Autozone is the location, the people we got, and the thieves. We would get robbed at least once a week and there would be extremely rude customers with occasional fights. Get past that and it's a fun job!"

good,Already wrote  review in a previous review. It's a great place to get some work experience and learn basic car care. Great benefits for full time employees.

I learn the computer skills and knowledge  to be a parts sales men .  i never really found anything really hard work there . the most enloyable part of the job was knowin the customer  is leaving the store happy and satified as they walk out the doors because that was the most important detail about the job

good,"Life at AutoZone was fairly laid back. The atmosphere was open and friendly. They expect you to do youyr job and be good at it. Surprisingly enough, you're instructed to upsell and get the customers to buy other things that are reccomended to be replaced during their project. As long as you're fast, friendly, customer service oriented, a bit of a salesman, and do what you're instructed to do, you'll go places."

I would have to say the hardest part of the job was the plan-o-grams. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with a majority of the customers.

Once the two make it back, the part time sales associate begins the cleaning tasks for that morning as well as take care of as many customers as possible without the help of the manager on duty. At this time, the manager on duty is on a conference call with all of the surrounding AutoZone store managers or managers on duty. After the conference call, the work day really begins. Phone calls, which must be answered by the third ring, come in, parts may be put on hold for a customer that may come in, customers come in and get their cars checked out (battery, alternators, starters, engine lights, or wiper blade change). During the end of the month, inventory is taken by a team member. Through out the day, it's hectic and fast paced, which is exactly how I like my  work day to go."

Even the guys who, having never looked under the hood of anything before buying a $30,000 vehicle, need help replacing their wiper blades.

We must call each store ahead of time before arriving in case they need product from the previous store. We must ask for any returns. If we arrive early to work, we put away go backs and make sure all product displayed in the store is aligned. We must maintain and check our vehicles at all times, making sure it is safe to drive. Or we help up front with sales to live customers. It is fun meeting new managers everyday. We don't always get the same route each day. I like interacting with others. My co-workers are awesome, fun and love to joke around with each other. We are like a small family. The hardest part of the job is being timed, with traffic and red lights can make it challenging."

good,"Retail jobs tend to vary based on location and those with whom you work with. I can however say that the Friendswood location has fully deserved 5 stars all the way around. Though my time there was very short, it was certainly sweet."
good,drive auto parts from store to auto shop. when im am not driving im on front and center helping out customers.
good,"Working at AutoZone, I gained a good amount of knowledge on all the different parts of a car and what they do. A typical day at work would be using the znet application on the dell computers to look up and retrieve parts for costumers as well as do returns and warrenty lookups/exchanges and VDP (vendor) transactions. Also, working the cash register, charging batteries and checking them along with starters and alternators and being in charge of the truck inventory that comes twice a week bringing new shipment to the store. Management and co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job would be when costumers come to find a part but don't know exactly what the car part they need is or the name of the part, therefore making it difficult for me to help them find the part they need and also makes it hard for me to help them figure out the problem because I am not a mechanic and even though I may know certain parts and things about a car, I still do not know everything. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help costumers find what they need and making the store look and feel just right."
good,I drove and helped customers at the counter and restocked products and cleaned the store. I did enjoy driving.
good,"Fun and educational. How to deal with the everyday rigors of working with store duties and customer issue's. Exceptional management team. Energetic, ambitious, and dedicated to the task. Having to say good bye to an associate for one reason or another after so long. Coming to work everyday and greeting the customers of the day and strating the days business."

good,I learned a lot working here and really enjoyed the people I worked with. There was a lot of interaction with great customers and learning and sharing of automotive tips.
good,"I got to learn about several different aspects of IT while working at AutoZone. I ended up having my hands in mainframe work, PC work, UNIX/LINUX work, and AS/400 all at the same time. I was on-call 24X7 for the computer operators. They respected the fact that I took the time to truly help them with problems and train them on how to handle the same situation in the future."
good,great company to work for lots of great people great training and teaching
good,great customers and always learning new things from all the co workers
good,A nice part time automotive job. They are flexible with hours and the pay isn't bad either.
good,I worked at two different locations. I left due to going back to school and raising my son. I learned management skills and was treated as a manager without the pay
good,"what stands out about this company is that you get to help so many customers and fulfill what they were looking for,also the environment is great to be in"
good,The management is poor but the company is solid and takes care of customers for the most part the service is great and shop is kept predominantly nice and clean
good,You will definitely learn a lot about vehicles. The more you work there it will become second nature to resolve a customer’s questions and assist them as well.
good,I enjoyed working at autozone fast paced company with great job advancement opportunities. The ability to learn and become knowledgeable about auto parts
good,The customers were the best thing about working at AZ ! Beware the schedules change weekly so its hard to plan your social life and If you need full time work don't accept a PT offer you won't ever get it !
good,Auto Zone is a great place to work with freindly people a great environment and u meet new people and its also a chance to help someone with all there car needs.
good,Autozone depends on your area maybe very slow or the opposite. There is always something to keep you busy. If you are not putting away parts you are on the computer training or  assistance of customers
good,"Often slow, tedious, and boring, but allows for team-building activities and camaraderie among staff. Prior management at my store was fantastic, but the store is on its third manager since then, unknown if this is due to sales/profits or personal issues."
good,It was a cool place to work at but i couldnt do it anymore bcuz of my tooth abcess couldnt produce the doctors note in a fast enough matter. I loved that they gave me a car to drive.
good,"Always great energy around from the customers to the employees around you. And if you're into cars as a hobby, its that much more of a pleasant environment to work in."
good,"Working at AutoZone is a good place to learn easier ways to fix your car. I have learned that there are several different ways  to fined out what parts people need. "
good,"good people to work with, I enjoy working for auto zone. management is ok not to bad, most enjoying part of my job is dealing with the customers, I don't think theres a part I don't like."
good,I enjoyed working  there.  Would  like to go back. The manager  was a excellent to work with.  I enjoyed the the company  in a whole. The team members were great
good,"Super fast passed."
good,I have learned more about cars and trucks here than i ever learned at my auto class in high school. the up keep with customers can be frustrating at times but you get to show them how to fix some issues with their cars.
good,"Company is a high performer however lacks advancement in local markets and capped out on pay years ago, Made over 240000.00 over annual sales target and after multiple approvals managed to get a .32 cent an hour increase and a target increase of 235000.00 over prior year."
good,Loved the company and had a few really good bosses...but once you get to know the team and leadership it has all the signs of a who you know type of career. Slow to promote unless you worked yourself 24-7 and did whatever the RVP said. Tough to have family time when you were looked at working 24-7
good,"I got to spend time with fun people, help customers, I was allowed to joke around and make customers laugh, the management was friendly and helpful and made sure our work got done at a reasonable time. I'd happily work there again."
good,Good company to work for good teammates  good pay great benefits 401k health insurance very good environment to work in great team dynamic great room for advancement.
good,Enjoyable and fasted paced at times.  Easy to handle loads of work if you understand a vehicle if not the computer will help.  Always doing something to help others is enjoyable for me.  Can work easy hours and advance at anytime you want.  Offer decent study material for the SAE test and online learning.
good,"There is a large variety of tasks to perform which keep one busy.  Unless it is very slow, it is unlikely that you'll get board.  Some heavy lifting is required."
good,"I was only a temporary with nothing offered to me. However management often offered full time positions and the temporary employee would have to apply for a position. While I was there the positions available were night time positions. The people that were hired would have a great benefit package, lots of incentives. And a fun place to work. They work hard and play hard."
good,Pay not competitive but very strong company and great advancement opportunities. Very organized and user friendly systems. mininum  50 hour work weeks for salaried employees
good,"Loading up parts into company vehicle and dropping them off at auto shops and picking up parts from other stores."
good,A day of work at AutoZone usually requires to work the exceptions and answer phones and help customers or other Auto Zones find parts for customers. if there is any freight left over from the truck you work it on the shelf or scan into the bins for overstock.we would also help customers on the phone and in the store as well as do modulars o price changes.
good,a typical day at work can be easy but get busy i learned alot more about cars and to handle certain situations .my  manager was a really good guy treated every one equally and was a hard working man . hardest part of the job was sometimes short on employees when it gt busy during the day.the most enjoyable part of my job was being around my coworkers and getting everything done that the boss wanted done to see a smile on his face :)
good,a typical day would consist of arriving at my scheduled time and clocking in. Next i would go find something to do like helping with customers or fronting and facing. Then we would close for the day.
good,I loved the company and the people i worked with but I hated the low pay for the amount of work we performed. As much money as the company makes they can give raises to the few that deserve it
good,After seeing the double standard that the district managers have and in the injustice I see it believe it is time to move on to a better opportunity that will value a good employee
good,"was a parts sales manager loved it ,love taking the test it kept me on my toes ,and my customers loved me ,I worked on floor planning ,recalls ,and installation"
good,Es muy buen abiente nada mas q el horario no es muy correcto apollas pero cuando necesitas no tienes su apollo y no descanzas los dmingos solo entre semana lo bueno es alfinal de año q te llega tu fondo de ahorro y aguinaldo

good,"love it here just needed better managers and better shifts"
good,"As a former employee of Autozone I must say that, looking back on things, the environment was lacking a lot in a few areas, however that was primarily my location and the management staff that I interacted with. Otherwise it is a great place to be."
good,Lots of fun and entertainment but the pay and benefits are not great unless you get into upper management. If you are looking for part time work for fun or supplemental income I recommend it
good,Great company! A well advanced automotive store for the DIY customers. Well balanced and good place to work and shop overall. Managent plays a big role in the succsess of the employees.
good,"Loved working here...people friendly "
good,"A nice place to work. Co-workers: We all help each other if we need help with parts or customers. we go outside to help customers install Batteries, Wiper blades, Headlight and Tail light bulbs."
good,"Not the greatest job in the world, but pays the bills... Mostly. Worker experience varies greatly from location to location."
good,"I would come in and work hard. I learned a lot more about parts for cars also. The people I worked with were great and friendly people."
good,"I worked with a great set of men, who respected and valued my opinion.  They helped me if there was something was to much for me.  If I didn't have a way to work my manager would come and pick me up if the weather was bad."
good,I really enjoyed working here learned many new things and was also able to help many customers. Learned a lot about car parts and was able to use mechanic knowledge outside with customers which is a plus!!
good,"I love working at my job, and being able to do different things throughout the day. I am always on my feet and doing something productive. I am either helping a customer with finding the part they need, or I am updating a shelf and adding the products neatly displayed."
good,A lot of comfort at that job. Different people everyday and student from across the street nice to get to know people by their name.
good,"it was fun"
good,"Living in a small town, we don't get as busy as the ones in a bigger city. that's what I like most about it. I work part time, and part timers only get up to 25 hours a week. Which is hard, when you have to live paycheck to paycheck. Other than that I like it. I've been working 2 years now."
good,Great place to find all of your auto part needs at a great price
good,job was fun the busier the better made your day go by management was great and treated employees well
good,"Auto Zone is all about customer service. I enjoy helping our customers find the correct car parts and tools. Our management and fellow employees are easy to get along with, friendly, and very knowledgable."
good,"I was unaware of the amount of physical labor, it isnt hard and I actually enjoyed it but I thought I would work more with the public and have more teamwork. Management is great and flexable with hours. everyday is something different, you never know whats going to happen with customers or the parts, which makes it interesting."
good,"find parts for customers, keep store cleaned and stoked, break down schematics and reset, break down and set up cash registers, make deposits"
good,Autozone is a great  place to work the staff are caring compassionate and all in all treat one another like family.  I couldn't ask for a better manager/ manager's  and staff members in general.  Everyday I learn a little bit more and grow a little bit more and I actually am very  pleased with how much more I learn everyday.
good,"Autozone taught me alot about vehicles and how the Invetory, stocking and pulling item procedures work, they also taught me how to check for bad batteries/ replace them and how to decode a check engine light."
good,Not a bad place to work while in college. If I had to complain about anything it would be the upper management that will deny a yearly cost of living adjustment if the person has been there for 3 months short of a year.
good,Fast pace and great place to work. Take care of most employees as long as you make them money and do your job. Can also be a fun job and very rewarding helping people with automotive problems
good,i loved working there i really wish you could have the opportunity to advance more often and make it a career move one of my favorite places of employment
good,a day tends to be helping customers out with getting the correct parts that they need checking batteries and alternators while still in the vehicle...
good,Great value to customers .. they need structural work ethic not very strong on fairness or what is the right or wrong way to proceed in better situations
good,It is a nice way to work yourself into the workforce. Very nice and calm environment at times. The jobs tends to fluctuate and doesnt put more importance on appreciation of workers.
good,Management hires friends and family instead of promoting within. I don't how it was at other stores but you basically have to jump through hoops and kiss a lot of butt to get a promotion.
good,"I love working here, the people are nice and everyone gets along well. Management does great with assisting employees. No person is to big for a job. I love this job."
good,The work schedules are very flexible and the work is not stressful at all.  The vehicles you drive are well maintained and comfortable to drive.   The interaction with the other stores that you deliver to is not complicated at all.  It is a great job to have
good,It’s a real good environment to work at. My co workers were fun at someone until they started hating on me cause I moved up fast in the company. So they all stab you in the back. Now they think they’re on top. They all snitch on each other now I can’t even go inside the store.
good,"a.typical 12 - 14 hour days "
good,"love working I have a passion  for it very detail ,To things I do .I'm always on time to be ready when I clock in ,I'm a people person ,Get along well with everybody ,Clean neat,"
good,Great place to work can be stressful at times. Weekend and some holidays are required .Pay was minimum wage. Room for advancement. Maintaining the store is probly the biggest responsibility.. reasonable hours. You unload truck stalking the shelves organizing the end caps keeping up with Mark downs and keeping the shelves fronted.
good,Enjoyed learning about auto parts and auto accessories. Management could be a little more compassionate. Fast paced and customer service is number one.
good,"Average day of work would consist of selling parts as well as giving good trustworthy advice on the part, sometimes installing and helping customers outside of the store. The days are sometimes long but the gain of experience is worth it."
good,"While wrking at this company I get to help assist customers wit cars and help them find what they need for to get the car up and running and keeps it going so we change batteries, light bulbs and help wit the right part for the car."
good,Fast paced and fun. Could be better paying and better organized. Managment and advancement is unstructured and unfair in most cases. Overall not the worst job.
good,"Decent place to work for someone starting out, alot of advancement and benefits for one person to turn into a career. AutoZone is a good place to work"
good,auto zone is a decent place to work. most employees are friendly. some times the customers are out of hand. short handed. not enough hours. pay is not so great
good,It was a great experience. Learned a lot about cars that I didn't know. The work environment was great everyone got along and helped one another. The hardest part was leaving.
good,The only reason I quit was because of my hours getting cut due to commercial not getting enough sales. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I enjoyed what I did there too.
good,"Great place for a part-time person going to school full-time. I like the management, and the hours are really flexible. There training really doesn't have to do with cars so I recommend knowing about vehicles."
good,"I love changing customers car batteries and installing them and also organizing the store."
good,good company to work for but the management is not great at all the only thing they care about but i loved my job as a driver  is auto zone not their employees i am in process of finding a new job
good,I enjoyed working for this company and the people who worked with me on the AutoZone team. Unfortunately I had to leave due to lack of childcare of my son.
good,"This company can may lay you off with no explanation."
good,I really did enjoy the things that I'd learned and the coworkers I'd learned to know. The most enjoyable part of the job was being solo on the road and going different states and cities.
good,This was an awesome job hands down. But the area I worked in had a Terrible manager that had her favorite workers. Once I got on board I heard about my manager how she don't play for the least of things but I made it long as could they paid great and job was very good
good,I love working for Auto Zone. They need to learn how to pay their employees better then it would be perfect. Other than the pay it's  a great company to work for.
good,The store has minimal hours available to it's employees. The staff is amazing to work with. It is a relaxed enviroment and everyone gets along with eachother.
good,Good overall if you're into working with auto parts sales.. they treat you with respect and care about your self being. Good company and management of autozone is great.
good,I leaned a lot of good things about the company and management. I was very happy with the automotive industry and was able to also move up within the company.
good,Easy job and fun to work. Very professional company with great customer service. The employee discount is very fair. It's very easy to advance in this company.
good,This is a place were if you would like a fast past and want to always be on the move AutoZone is a great opportunity. there is a lot great communication with fellow employee and management.
good,This was a temporary position for me. The work was not promised. A lot of the time they were sending us home early or asking us to not return for a few days. The management is great and the work is easy.
good,"Working at Autozone is a great experience,"
good,I enjoy working at autozone overall. I get along with the employees and managers. There have been rude customers but it happens. A lot of marines came in respectful I've made friends.
good,I would over see cash register transactions and help customers with automotive question as needed.  Moreover I would load and unload trucks as needed.
good,"each day I would begin as cashier, answering customers questions about their cars, and looking up what parts they need, and once a week, a truck comes in and I would be one of many to stock the product received."
good,"I learned a lot relating to parts customer service and management."
good,A typical day at work is making sure the customers have a successful shopping experience and receive what they need. It also has the time of day where we make sure all the money is accounted for and everything is in order.
good,Hired in as store manager with no experience.  Received adequate training and a decent rate of pay.  Enjoyed working with the public and helping to solve there automotive needs and problems
good,I had the opponunity to meet a lot of good people and help them also . the parts business is not for everyone you must have patience to work with people when they are having car trouble . A lot of people can only describe what they want but dont know what the part is nor the name of it. i really enjoyed it .
good,"Autozone is a very enjoyable and up lifting environment. I enjoy helping the people with what they need to know or find. They have supplied a variety educational materials needed to succeed and progress with their company. All the people I work with, whether management or coworkers, are friendly, kind and helpful with any questions that I might have."
good,For the most part I found all of my coworkers to be friendly productive and always willing to help and as well a place where I learned more about auto parts than I ever would have without crossing there path.
good,its was fun we all enspired one anothe rwe helped each other do the task that were given to us we did not leave a co-worker behind we all worked toghether this is a good job my manager was very understanding so i rate this as a good work place i learned how to use a register the hardest part of the job was truck it was early and long

good,Learn new stuff about cars everyday. My co-worker was always willing to help. The hardest part of my job was nothing. It was a easy job.

good,Great place to interact with customers and expand automotive knowledge.
good,If I had a question all I had to do was talk to a manager and they helped me directly
good,Atypical day was helping customers with vehicle maitnance.
good,They really don't put a lot of people on the counter. They expect the computer to do everything there and they are not very realistic on working hours.
good,"ambiente de trabajo bajo presion, y fijacion de objetivos aprendi a manejar diferentes areas laborales en direccion y / o geencia se preocupaba por la formacion laboral y la participacion para el logro de los objetivos, para tener una mejor espectativa, buen ambiente de trabajo compañerismo y lo mas dificil los horarios por los medos de transpote kienes terminan temprano su ruta y habia que trasladarse a pie una distancia considerable y sobe todo por la situacion de la seguridad en la actualidad lo ke mas me gusto la enseñanza tecnica de las partes automotrices y la orientacion al cliente"

good,Deal with customers having problems with their cars and give advice on how to repair them.
good,i liked the job there but I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life.
good,"My typical work day would be starting at 9pm and working till 6am on any job that the supervisor gives you on any given night. I have learned how to do inbound work at a warehouse, and how to use a RF unit to log in inventory through out the warehouse. Management is very good at AutoZone they know there business and what is needed and what is not. My ex-co workers at AutoZone where friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job was learning the RF unit. the most enjoyable was working the job itself."
good,great customers and great management. relaxed workplace 90% of the time.
good,good work place enviornment

good,would open store and count the registers and get everything up and running receive a shipment of parts answer phone calls assisting customers both over the phone and in person. Installed batteries bulbs and run codes helped people figure out what was wrong with their vehicle and then help get them what they needed to fix it.i loved the job and would go back again.
good,"I drove a route each work day, I made 3 runs a day.  In between runs I help with customers in the store by looking up auto parts on the computer and making sales. Sometimes I helped put up stock and some cleaning when time permitted.  My fellow workers have been fun to work with."
good,Really good place to work at. I work with wonderful people. I work at 0379 in New Albany.. have a new manager and hes  No better than the last maybe a little worse.
good,Everyone will to help you out when you need it. Management very helpful.lots of room  for advancement. very good place to work I enjoy who I work with.
good,"I always get aggressive demands (not shouting) and told to make more sales than needed. Always up my rear end about nothing more than customer and sales. Never willing to teach me about parts."
good,"a typical work day would consist of approving returns, making a bank order/change order be accountable for schedules an employees. knowledge about the sales an customer service an also planograms. i learned alot about customer service, sales, an management. store manager typically mistreated employees an set a bad example in my opinion. The culture was comfortable an clean thought. Nothing was hard about it since have prior experience in sales an customer service. I enjoyed the job to fullest potential but disagreed on the pay an manager"
good,Always something to do. I started from the bottom worked my way up to full time to manangement to assistant to store manangement the opportunity is there but as for me 5 years i want to see what else is out there
good,"AutoZone is a great company to work for. Once you are there a year you receive paid time off,for health 401k, and other insurance. The breaks are a(n) hour, you have a simple dress code."
good,I work with this company for a number of years off and on and it was a great experience in management and customer service skills was used and the opportunity
good,"Busy days and slow days. Upper management was always on you for sales but if you love auto it was a fun place to work. Hours are flexible, pay was ok and a typical day of work was pretty easy."
good,Was a great place to work. As long as you didn't mind staying busy . Was a fast-paced environment. Where you are expected to perform at a high level of customer satisfaction.Their pay stub even says this check made possible by a customer to remind you why you're there and have a job
good,Learned a lot from working here love what they stand for and how they teach. I will refer anyone to work for these company. I have grown from working.
good,"No other autopart store could compare to autozone. Hands down their employees are on top of everything there. If you love a good sense of humor but keep everything business, this is the place to go. Everyone is friendly, kind, and all around great human beings."
good,"Logged in pick up part orders and deliver when not busy worked at  do it yourself counter, pulling parts and putting away inventory. Management was great."
good,"my time there was 5 yrs in that time I did learn many new things, the only complaint I have is that I didn't get a raise in the 5 years that I was there"
good,"Autozone is a great place where people come to get advice. Not only about cars but about boats and lawn equipment."
good,Fun fast paced work environment good co workers great boss as a delivery driver went all over san diego got too learn alote more about different cars and thier parts
good,"On a typical day i would go out and inspect both commercial vehicles. When calls started coming in I would pull the parts, print out the invoice, then go deliver to various commercial clients"
good,Autozone was a good company to work for but they worked us long hours for little pay. There was job security but as I climbed the ladder there was the expected long hours with little pay syndrome which is what drove me away after three yrs
good,A typical day at AutoZone can be very busy you must stay very fast-paced. the hardest thing about the job is customer satisfaction.  What I enjoy the most is who I work with everyone is super friendly .
good,"this has been one of the easiest jobs i held didn't want to let it go but i had different interest in career path. they're extremely flexible with hours worked with mine while going to school."
good,"Everyone was great at what they did, we had outstanding drivers and support staff. We drove and delivered in the worst possible conditions. We had extreme heat in the desert and in the same week up to Northern Montana and blizzard conditions, I've delivered in -26 degrees to 122 degrees F. "
good,"If you enjoy working and guaranteed form of employment, and if you know about automotive science, you'd enjoy working at auto zone. Great people to work with, flexible hours and  expect to give great customer satisfaction!"
good,The managers are fair and easy to work with. The pace is simple nothing to complex. Working with managers and employees can be easy. The company had ops to grow.
good,great if your looking to make extra cash on the side. I was a delivery drive I really liked the job. But I have a family and I had to leave due to being hired at another job where I was offered more money and better benefits for my family.
good,"I enjoyed building their Commercial Department.  I was outside sales, at first, since there was no Commercial Department.  I had to get credit applications filled out and follow up with Corporate, to set up accounts.  Then we had to build those relationships."
good,Very fast paced job. Great for learning about car parts and different vehicles. Great work environment to meet new people along with teaching others about what you know and learned
good,"Start your day already behind. Many customers to assist."
good,it great place work but without no debt and a week after unproffestion installing a GPS in the car was canned but never show any documents and never was give chance to fight it
good,"I enjoy working at AutoZone its a competitive work place, were production rate is high. The AutoZone culture is strong every morning we start with AutoZone Cheer. Meet a lot of senior AutoZoners going on 20 plus year working for the company"
good,Overall a great place to work. Store manager needs training on how to treat employees.Customers are usually pleasant. I think the hardest part of the job is communication with the store manager.
good,"Work was easy going, nothing to difficult. It gave me experience in interaction with the customers. Pay could have been a little more but it  was doable."
good,"Pleasant work environment with friendly coworkers and management. You can learn a lot about auto care and maintenance. The most enjoyable part of the job for me personally was the hands on experience working on the vehicles, and dealing with the public and customer service."
good,Great company. Management was not the best. Has room for growth within the company but it takes years to advance. Employees are good and willing to help.
good,Assisting customers with their vehicular needs. Stocking all merchandise to floor and overstock areas. Product knowledge is a must. Produce knowledge was also taught throughout the work force.
good,"Overall I would rate this employer a four and a half. Not really your ideal professional work place, but I learned a lot from them. I am a historian who loves rich history. That's why I advocate for historical schools and communities around the Atlanta area."
good,"It was a wonderful place to work everyone was nice but it was hard to make a living on the pay there even working 40 hours a week, I enjoyed working with the customers and fellow employees."
good,Great work place very helpful with scheduling needs. Sales training is the best asset I've gain. Could use a better pay scale but for the most part I can't complain
good,"Autozone has been a great career ride. It has the normal up and downs, but I have enjoyed the ride. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers.  The hardest part was the lack of personnel to truly give customers a one on one experience."
good,I love being a team player and work well with others in any situation it wasn't a enough hours and it was a dangerous neighood to work in
good,Autozone is a good environment to work in. It has helped me improve and give the best quality for customer service.I have learned more with auto parts
good,"Its fast pace job wonderful get really busy mostly on weekdays, customers can be rough but they train to maintain the situation.you get raise promotions ect"
good,"AutoZone overall was a great job which gave me much knowledge over cars and parts related, they are a company which really does care about the customers but they are employees not as much, which overall they give us good breaks and let us have flexible schedules with work around us but they do treat their employees as expendable."
good,es un lugar de tranajo estable desgrasiadamente con poca posibilidad de crecimiento y una gerencia algo pesima
good,"working there is great and learning what the vehicle parts are meant to do to keep the vehicle in good running shape, the employees are all great to get along with from all other store locations its like its own family."
good,"Working at AutoZone was a different environment compared my other jobs. I learned a lot about cars and now I can take better care of my vehicle. The managers were really good along with the co-workers, friendly and always eager to help a new co-worker get the hang of things. The hardest part about the job was carrying products that were sometimes more than 30lbs. At any job things can become overwhelming but at the end of the day everyone liked to make the job feel like it was a second home, so they treated each other like family. That was the best part of the job."
good,"My typical day consists of taking care of customers needs, help troubleshoot issues customers are having, maintain cleanliness and keep product in appropriate areas, Always keep my attitude and behavior on a professional level."
good,"A typical day of work I can expect to deliver parts, when I'm not delivering parts being around my co-workers and management was going to be a fun day. There is always something to learn and the management are all willing to train you."
good,their is much to say about working in autozone i loved it their but and their is always a but autozone is like busy in the summer lol but is worth it not much too say because i never had a issue with this place loved it.....
good,"I dont work for Auto zone anymore. But when i was there i was a store manager, now i work for the Federal Government right now as a Federal Law Enforcement Officer for DHS."
good,"Hours aren't too long and starting pay is above minimum wage. You don't really need to know anything about cars, but you should at least know what parts you are dealing with."
good,"At AutoZone I installed batteries, wiper blades, belts, and other small items for customers who could not do the job. Everyday going to work I knew that I would get to be doing hands on work on many different types of vehicles giving me many opportunities to build upon this skill set. Every person that I worked with were always polite and listened to anything that I had to say. No matter what job you have you always get the angry customers and that was probably the most difficult part of this job. My favorite part of this job was being able to be around and work on cars."
good,"Auto Zone is a fortune 500 company. Starting as a sales associate, the regular day was opening the store with my manager, and making sure the store was ready for business. Cash tills rightfully placed in draws, shelves stocked, bathroom and parking lot cleaned. I learned a lot at Auto Zone, such as interpersonal skills, customer service, sales skills, computer skills, inventory skills, time management skills, Z-Net operations, logistics skills, and learned to handle large amounts of cash. Management is very compassionate and strive for growth. Upper-Management's positive attitude towards their employees helped me become an Assistant Store Manager shortly after becoming an Part Sales Manager. There was much room for growth in the fortune 500 company, their only negative factor was the lack of compensation for their hard working employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a ridiculously high volume of irate customers while applying loss prevention techniques, while man power is low. But the best part of the day was sending those customers home with a smile and the right products needed to get the job done right."
good,"I would still be working for them if the mANAGER named mark had not told me it would be better if  quit when the cash register came up short I AM NO THIEF and he told Todd now we don't have to give him unemployment after I had just bought  a new car..the most enjoyable part of the job was when the mechanics in the area would ask for me,"
good,"AutoZone was a great company to work for, I gained new experiences with them. Started with no automotive knowledge, now I can do my own oil changes. Not just professional but personal skill as well."
good,"Duties included opening and closing store properly, handling commercial accounts, ordering and shipping goods, answering phone lines, cashiering, stocking inventory, copy and filing paperwork and, performing all customer services. Additional duties included assisting customers to the appropriate products and answering customers' questions."
good,Took parts to the customers as requested.Was always nice no matter how they where to me. As for my co-works they where ok
good,"The job was really good i enjoy working there, The only thing bad about it was that i didnt get paid well"
good,"I learned to be a motivated dependable Medical Assistant, committed to high levels of patient care, with outstanding communication skills effectively with patients, family members, and other health care providers. Committed and highly adaptable individual noted as a model team player who is willing to assist when and where needed."
good,I had the chance to know lot about the automotive industry. Nice co-workers and nice clients.
good,"I start with morning paperwork, and some outbound phone calls to the different commercial accounts with questions, concerns, and promotions. I make sure that everything is lined up for the day in terms of part orders and future sales. From working this job, I learned an enormous amount. Not only on the automotive side of things, but I learned how to run a department and get the most out of the employees. I had a great team. The hardest part of my job was growing the sales from year to year. I was expected to do around 30% a year. The most enjoyable part of my job is gaining confidence from the different customers that I'm going to take care of them, and gaining first call status with as many different customers as possible."
good,"Dealt with customers as parts assistant manager and proud to have been a ""key holder"".  Learned to train other employees.  Hardest part of job was dealing with uncertainty of replacement of upper management frequently."
good,me encargaba de atender a los clientes de la tienda asi como realizar tareas de toma de inventario por las tardes y en ocaciones realizaba los diagnosticos con el escaner a los automoviles de los clientes que lo solicitaba.
good,Always something new to do in this field of auto parts sales. Great people to work with everyday.
good,I would do almost everything in the store.
good,co-workers were great good management staff great hours.loved the fast pace.
good,No real typical day. Everyday was a little different than the one before. I learned alot of good customer relation skills and how to deal with people in a managemnt capacity. Everyone worked real good together so we didnt have any real conflicts to speak of. The hardest part of the job would be a trying to make the weekly schedule for everyone and try to keep some of there needs in mind whille doing it. The most enjoyable thing was making customers happy and building a relationship with them.
good,opening was great. a typical day nothing was ever the same. i enjoyd the work cause i love cars all types
good,Worked with many good people while I served at AutoZone. Learned allot about good basic customer service. I would work for AutoZone again.
good,"lo que aprendi de autozone es el trato que se le debé de dar al cliente, tambien la forma de aser ventas,"
good,Working at Autozone is very enjoyable. You learn new things everyday and do something different very often. If you are an ethical working person you have many opportunities to advance in your career. People that work at Autozone are generally very friendly and helpful.
good,"Stocking, cash registers, helping customers and with management backup made job easier. When I moved to AZ, i was worked with to get an opportunity to Drive a school bus my career with them."
good,"what stands out about this company is that you get to help so many customers and fulfill what they were looking for,also the environment is great to be in"
good,Things can get crazy some times trying to get tasks finished and making sure we meet our goals for the day/week. Or there's an upset costumer comes in and is just having a bad day because he got the wrong part or a defective part. I hate seeing an upset costumer come threw the door and it brightens my day when they walk out with a smile because I did everything I could to help them and they were so happy when they left.
good,I like working with people and also my crew I like learning new things everyday and I would like to have a career with autozone . I also like stocking because were in are own zone getting things done and stocked put away nice organized.
good,Had a great time and made great connections! Overall was a very good experience for me. I enjoyed learning and i loved that if I ever had a question someone was always there to help me.
good,"a good company to work for especially first time workers, but only pays minimum wage and offers part time hours. that is not enough to keep up with the cost of living in the state of Maryland and therefore for that very reason has a high turn over rate."
good,AutoZone is a good company  one of the best in the country. It's all depends on which store you work in. It's no problem for me to build a team. Overall It what you make of it like anything.
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone mechanically inclinded and are good with computers the system is pretty easy to learn "
good,Great place with great people in an awesome environment great management they really take car of there employees and make sure that they are ready before they hit the floor
good,"The ability to be able to work under minimal supervision indicates trust in your employees.  The safety of employees is a top priority at this employer.  If you want to believe there are rewards for being efficient.  This seems like one employer who let's you know, nothing goes unnoticed when you go the extra mile."
good,Great company great opportunities there for advancement family eviorment great customer service training and management training process is super simple
good,I've loved working with these guys for a while. They treat you like family. Every day that I clock in all the way til I clock out. It's just a great place to work over all. Plus 20% off everything. Sometimes 30%.
good,"Working at Autozone has been really great thus far. The life at work is very productive and very fun. Whether it be stocking or helping the customer, an Autozoner is always on their feet."
good,It takes a while to learn the inventory however my team was helpful and patient when addressing questions I did not know. I was often one of the only Spanish speakers and therefore always busy addressing customer questions.
good,Buen trato solo son algo negreros con los horarios
good,"Working there was great,the people there care for each other and it's a great work environment. Plus it's a really easy way to further ur knowledge in the automotive field."
good,"Easy place to work at, but the pay could be better, but than again its more of a high school/college student job, to make money on the side. Other than that not a bad job."
good,Great place to work with chance of advancement managers and co workers are easy for the most part to get along with the only thing is that the managers have more relaxed rules when it comes to the corporate heads what goes for one doesn't go for all
good,"good management, friendly work team, many opportunity's to move up in the company, customers are very friendly, easy learning curve and easy to understand different things"
good,"Meetings in the morning before we head out on routes, make sure your vehicle is running properly. Grab you load and hit the road it’s time to work. You only have 5 minutes in each store. So you have to get scanned and get on to the next stop."
good,I honestly enjoyed working for the company. What enjoyed the most was the knowledge that a lot of the customers would bring you. Sure there are those customers that don’t know much but I was always learning something new.
good,I find that the job was always easy. the company had a program that will teach and give you information if you just read. their was not a lot of hands on training. The company do care for their employees especially if you where that 1 one employee. I worked with the company for 15 years and all the opportunities that where given to me I earned and had awesome mentors.
good,"I love my job at AutoZone. I come from a family that enjoys working on cars, so for me, its a safe haven. I have fun everyday that I'm working, sure, it can be stressful at times, but it all goes away once those doors are closed and the last customer leaves for 20 minutes. The managers keep me entertained, and I don't feel alienated by the fact that I'm new to store. I recommend it, 100%!"
good,"I loved working at Autozone, I showed up, clocked in, stood at the counter, and sold store merchandise, car parts, batteries amongst other items to the customers. There was very little overall responsibility in the associate position. Hardest part of the job was standing up the whole time, but that was a personal issue for me at the time, different people will have different struggles. The other associates could have worked on their social skills, but, you have to remember that each store geographic, and employee environment is different."
good,"AutoZone is a really good place to work. I just wish they paid their employees that have been there for over a year better. I understand the pay for new hires. But, I was with AutoZone for a little over 5 years and I wasn’t even making $14 an hour. Only reason why I stayed as long as I did is because I built a relationship with most of the customers, and because I had another job."
good,Great for someone to get into the car scene. Really helps you learn parts and some common failer on cars. Also helps your diagnostic skills and your listening skills.
good,"A typical day at work consists of reviewing what goal(s) need(s) to be met, motivating my team to succeed in the days goal, helping guests locate the part(s) they need for their vehicle(s) and making sure they, not only leave satisfied but, continue to be a consistent visitor. The hardest part of my job is making sure an unhappy guest leaves happy. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a smile on my guests face(s), that look of relief and  knowing that I made someone's life a little less stressful."
good,Part time drivers don’t get any benefits and the hours scheduled are not good . Work hours would be nice if it was a full 8. I did enjoy the fast pace
good,Autozone was a great and fun place to work with a lot of new things to learn i only left the company because they dont  pay well. I always enjoyed a day's work at autozone.
good,"Excellent place to work. It’s a good place to work. But there are some faults there. "
good,"I would have to go though a metal detector and if you beeped you would get patted down depending on who was there. You’ll also learn a few auto parts if you don’t know much. The supervisors are really cool, they’ll lead the stretches before you start working and after lunch. The one thing I didn’t like about the job is that you rarely get over 40 hours and also they would move you to another area in the middle of you doing something."
good,facing new challenges everyday that you have to overcome makes a fast paced yet enjoyable and challenging workplace.all the people that work with you are amazing and helpful.
good,"If you like cars, this is a great place to work. The only problem I had with this job was not enough pay or hours. If you can get that it's a great workplace."
good,"I took this job while I was beginning attendance at Universal Technical Institute in Orlando, Florida. I thought this would be a good way to apply what I was learning to some degree, and I was accurate. I learned the fine art of diagnostics. I did a lot of different positions at the Hub store on OBT. From cashier to stocker to delivery of parts. I set up the Plan-O-Gram forthe Store each month. I went through several managerial changes and even a different store for a while. When I returned to the Hub store there were so many new people it was hard to figure out who was who at first. But I was glad they were all there when I was back. I wound up dealing with my mother’s death while employed with this company. They gave me so much help and emotional support. They never gave up on me; even before they knew what was really going on.  I moved to where I am still and took a transfer to a store in a neighboring town, about 30 minutes away. I lasted about a month before telling them I could no longer be there and to not expect me back... and went home. I had too much on my mind to be trying to deal with the general public and work in general. I was never heaven geiveace time or anything like that."
good,Management is very fair and understanding. Good place to work. Other employees are very helpful. This is a fast paced job. Benefits are nor very good though. I enjoy working there.
good,It always depends on the crew. But my crew at my autozone is great and that why in still there.  Yes i think they should have more of a competitive wage but its a blast
good,"Fine no need to voice my opinion, because it's by choice,where you decide to work, and if God wants you to be somewhere  then you will ,my opinion doesn't change whether you should work there or not. The choice is yours!!"
good,it was an amazing experience I actually learned how to work on cars and I enjoyed helping all the DIY customers fix their problems also give advice on what product and parts where best for their cars.
good,"Some days it was slow and others were very fast. There really wasn't too much a person would handle. Every now and then there comes someone who doesn't know what they want, but you can help them out with basic info."
good,i enjoyed this experience. I must say it is not commission based. regardless of where you are as youth its a good job. Just be sure the office you go too.
good,Autozone is a great company overall  it takes years to make good money tho upper management takes to much advice from lower management and doesn’t spend enough time in stores that need special attention if you want to advance there you must be knowledgeable
good,At this job I learned how to set up order forms for shops and get parts ready to be delivered. I was in the process of working on my roadmap which is to move up to management.
good,"Working at autozone was very challenging, but fun. I was pretty much in control of my own future. I had a couple of very awesome personal mentors there. For that I was Blessed."
good,"Autozone its open for learning and a room of improvement company."
good,It’s an easy and fun job if you know what your doing. The pay is alright not too good not bad learn so much about parts and communication skills and cars your dealing with overall fun job
good,work long shift and to consistently lift over 50lbs of materials have to be able to multitask phones online orders and counter customer services. lack of employee staffing. hard working environment especially for a female. very physically demanding and very little employee support. it was not my kind of ideal employment. the store manager was supportive and always had employee backs and was kind and caring. what makes this employment of hard is the lack of support from corporate offices
good,Working for AZ has been a great experience.  The people and culture are fantastic.  I am not looking to leaving AutoZone; rather wanted to relocate to a new place.
good,It’s a great job fun and my coworkers had me laughing everyday!! But as a hub driver you don’t make as much and the hours are horrible unless you full time
good,I've been working for 4/5 years I have learned alot with the company looking forward to building my career with autozone very nice company to work for
good,This job teaches you a lot. Its a very flexable place to work.They advance very quickly. The pay is very reasonable. They support your schooling and advancement
good,"Its not easy. You are expected to sell certain items. Customers can be difficult and rude."
good,I have nothing bad to say about working here. Everyday I was encountering new problems which was great. The management was great. I guess the only bad thing I could say is the pay could've been better.
good,"learned a lot about parts ,management, customers good vacation time"
good,Was a good place to work just got very sick and could no longer work at the time. If I had not gotten sick I would probably still be there. People I worked with were fun and upbeat for the most part if I had a chance to work here again I would.
good,"Mucha gente que va desde pedir una pieza hasta asesoramiento de alguna pieza en especifico; ayudar a satisfacer las necesidades del cliente dando un servicio excelente como dando promociones de piezas, kits."
good,I learned how to do a lot while working at autozone. I learned quite a bit about cars as well. I would reccomend this job to others. Working here is like one big family.
good,"Typical day if opening is opening procedures, helping customers, a one hour lunch then closing procedures if your even there that long. No overtime available within the company. Stocking inventory, lots of lifting batteries and other heavy items, good communication is a must, deescalation skills are a must, memory of part numbers, driving to deliver parts, knowledge of processes and procedures for diagnosis of cars, knowledge of good shops in the area that do good quality work, knowledge of inventory and how parts operate along with their basic function, computer skills are a plus. I learned a lot about selling techniques and that most people want personal experience. Management at these stores is always pretty good, workplace culture is good overall but would like to see something actually happen to shoplifters not just let them go every single time they are in the store. The hardest parts of the job are dealing with disgruntled customers and dealing with the stress of multitasking. The most enjoyable part is helping diagnose a car that is for a family that they rely on or a customer that needs their car for work everyday. If you don't like to answer the phone or find the phone ringing annoying this job is not for you. The phone is overwhelming at times because of how much it rings. Good company, just not something I could see myself at long term at minimum wage with a 4 year degree."
good,Fast pace job. Wonderful coworkers. Easy going. Easy to learn. Managers helped extremely well with teaching and understanding.  Working with the public is amazing and knowing I can help in anyway is just an amazing experience for anyone
good,The first manager i had was great when i was in Phoenix the next was good but not as grwat as the first overall it was a good job to have but the pay for the type of work was not very competitive and forced me to find other work and i never really got the career advancements i was expecting
good,"pues la empresa es estable buena paga las prestaciones son buenas, el ambiente laboral un poco dificil por los puestos que hay y el rool de tiempo que aprendí ha tener mas comunicacion con el cliente la capasitacion es buena lo que mas me gusto de ese trabajo es ayudar a los clientes que llegavan con dudas"
good,"If you love automotive this is it. always something new for you to help a customer with the correct part for if you are the specialist and you have the parts to provide and the customer is there sell the right one with all related components most customers don't know are also needed, but you do."

good,"This is a fun, laid-back place to work if you are seeking part-time employment for college or a first job. I enjoyed the people I worked with and management was great. There is opportunity to be promoted to shift manager fairly easily, but the pay is low considering anyone working here needs a fair amount of automotive knowledge."

good,I worked in store 1890 at times business can get slow but in those rush hours you had to stay on your toes. There have times when I had to work multiple lanes at once.
good,"In my time @ the zone was a great place to work , a little stressful however the people I worked with were awesome . At sometimes of the day there were lines and customers get agitated. this only  because we were not allowed to have another zoner during some of the most criticle times of the day . Honestly though , I would go bac at some point but only as part time. I almost always got over time due to people call in sick."
good,The best thing about working for autozone is the coworkers.the management also  was  very  flexible  in working  with  schooling  and  my  other  job.

good,i loved working for auto zone although it was stressful at times. i stayed busy and helped to keep the store emaculate. this is a very fast paced company to work for
good,"AutoZone has a strong culture.  They are consistent in their vision and executives are engaged in the business and all have a good understanding of all parts of the business.  They will allow people to move cross functionally, but the advancement can be slow.  Base pay is ok but bonus is health and pays out consistently"
good,"I enjoy working on vehicles,  so it was very enjoyable to work here.

good,Easy place to work at.  Helping customers was easy most of the time.  The mercandise locations could use an update making it easier to find all parts.
good,Honestly it depends on you. I have worked at different stores and you have to be an open minded person with patience because your dealing with everyday people who do not know anything about vehicles or the basic functions. Other than that if you have an interest in automotive and your people person this is the place for you.
good,this is a great place to work the employees treat you like family and you can learn so many different things . and the pay and the staff are really cool  I love that I got a chance to work with such great people.

good,I learn a lot about vehicles. the Mgrs are very nice and fair. As soon as I clock in I start waiting on customers or stocking. a clean store that is fully stocked looks better then a nasty store. the customers love it.
good,"This is a place that gives you the opportunity to rise, I have seen people grow into high positions quickly. Personally this job just does not pay enough for the expectations they have on me. Overall, great place to work, relaxed, great management, I loved working with customers."

good,Autozone is a known household name.  People that are DIY come into the store and often ask for advise.  Being able to help them get what they need to fix their problems is a great feeling.
good,It is a team based atmosphere and everyone is willing to help no matter what. They are excited to fix the problem and stick with it until the problem is solved.
good,I love working on cars so what better job to have than to sell car parts. The people that work there are great never a dull moment. The customers are always satisfied.

good,"I enjoyed my years at Autozone.  The management was very fair to work for.  They treated their employees very fair.  The hours were usually very long for my position.  I was a store manager.  "
good,"Autozone was a great experience to get to help customers. Help them to figure out the problems that their vehicles may have.. Help other associates with daily duties, and help Managers with all their issues that may occur during your shift."
good,"Autozone is a great place to work at because of the team I work with and great management.  On a typical day, I assist customers behind the counter with finding the parts they need for their vehicles, helping to install batteries, headlights, and windshield wipers. I balance that with delivering parts to our commercial shops/clients. The hardest part of the Job, I'd say, is sometimes the store is so busy we barely have time to put up our truck shipment. My coworkers are exceptional and my boss is not a boss, he is a leader.  It's an honor to work with/for him.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people out that might not know much about cars.  I also enjoy that I learn something new every day."
good,"Typical day at work is usually pretty hectic, but it makes the day go by faster. I have learned how to talk with people of all diverse backgrounds and different needs and how to listen to customers concerns. I think the hardest part of the job is when all the phone lines are ringing, and an angry line of customers waiting to be helped. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people."
good,"Great team, good experience, helps teach you about cars, ASE ready. The company does anything they can to try and promote you."

good,Loved meeting new people everyday. I Learned a lot about automobiles and how they work what they need. Loved my management we were like a family. Hardest part of my job was actually trying to remember the names of car parts. Enjoyable time of m job at auto-zone was actually getting the customers problem ressolved
good,The management at AutoZone is the most understanding I've ever encountered. The co-workers help each other and don't shy away from assistance. Probably the most difficult part is learning exactly where certain auto parts are located but after a few attempts it becomes easier.
good,Typical day would include putting up stock and setting up planograms for changes in the store. It was a nice place to work i learned along the way so much more about vehicles.
good,"High energetic work place with friendly customer service."
good,"Not were I want to end my career, but for many it is a great place..."
good,"Well when I go to work my responsibility is always the customer first. My job is to give the customer the right parts at the right price. I have to analysis parts that other customers bring in that are no longer working, and try to help them fix the problem. I also delivery auto parts to other shops around AutoZone. I drive to the shop, give them the part that the shop called for, collect money, and return back to the story with the amount that are on the invoice. My managers wear gray shirts and none managers wear red shirts. The managers are there to further assist the red shirts if the problem is a little to much for the red shirts. We provide free battery change, replace wiper blades, and change lights bulb out from the headlights and rear lights of vehicles . we also check and charge batteries for free, and check alternators, starters as well. The hardest part about my job is sometimes when customers come in and have problems, they could take longer then other jobs. That could cause a problem when the store starts getting a lot of customers at one time. Other customers could get inpatient from time to time, because they have other things to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to learn about different problems on a car or truck and fix the problem. I love problem solving and helping people in need."
good,I have never had much knowledge about vehicles but working hear I am learning very fast. eachday I go to work I can expect to see many different faces and situations concerning many vehicles. My people skills are very great so I develop a bond with customers that come in all the time I love meeting new people and learning about how their life is going and how I can help service their needs.

good,"I had applied to AutoZone in hope for my flourishing interest in the automotive field. I got placed in the brand new Godfrey store, When beginning my work there, I was promised a raise as soon as I became NATEF certified.

You will occasionally have to go outside to do some diagnoistic work and install wiper blades. At the end of the day you will front and face (make sure labels are facing forward and 2 deep to the front of the shelf), you then will sweep the floors then mop."
good,A basic day at Autozone is like being in a nice friendly people orientient place. We were very quick and up front with our customers do the best with customer service. We know our products and knew our customers like they were apart of us. The best thing about working with Autozone its a great company to be apart of great benifits and discounts. Its great place to grow in.

good,"AutoZone was a great and exciting place to work. Flexible and always willing to work with me. Great company and management. Retail wasn't my thing, but definitely a recommended place to apply!"
good,Autozone has been like a family to me and I will be very sad to leave. The people I work with have become very important to me and the job feels rewarding and satisfying.
good,Buena empresa para desarrollo futuro buen comportamiento de los compañeros
good,Hired as a supervisor. Had to lear a lot right away but the management was very helpful in making sure I knew what I was doing right away. I would recommend working there.

good,I was treated good. Just done wrong by one manager that didn't like me. The customers were very friendly and talkative. I would recommend working here.
good,I have a love for car's so i really liked auto zone the environment was very professional an everybody loves helping out the new guys wouldn't mind going back
good,Company is great to start a solid manager resume. We as manager ware a lot of hats. But I feel it’s time to move to better and more opportunities. It’s always good to keep an eye open for a great opportunity.
good,The hardest part was adjusting to their fast pase. But if you work hard you were considered for promotion. Would have stayed if i had not relocated. They had flexible room for advancement and opportunities.
good,They have a topout on pay after 2 years and i dont agree with that we keep learning new job skills and company is growing but no more money for employees that do the job and they also do not do bonuses which the hourly should recieve because we are the motor to the company
good,I like working with the company. It has its moments where everyone can be hot headed but overall I love the job and have fun. They give you a lot of hands on training even throughout your time with Autozone.
good,What I don’t like and don’t like about the job was doing overnight delivery driving three hours there to drop off the auto parts and driving three hours back and being extremely tired getting there and going back that’s the only downside.  Safer  bumping into a shelf then a back of a semi.
good,"In beginning it was a great learning experience and I was willing to take on challenge, a little later management changed and things went down hill with teaching. They in need of new vibrant people managers."
good,If you don't mind working a crazy schedule and odd hours. AutoZone is a good job. For the most part easy to pick up and do. As long as ur automotive orientated. You may close the store one night and the next day open the store. Ex: close at 10:15 and open the next day at 7:00. If that doesn't bother you then this will be perfect.
good,Empresa seria y responsable..ambiente laboral eatable

good,working at auto zone tough me so much about cars and how to install car batteries . it was a very hands on job and very active job environment i really love working at an hands on job place.
good,Basic automotive experience or experience in retail a plus. Customers expect knowledgeable staff and efficient service. Great stafftowork with and answer questions. Some stores are busier than others so get a sense of the store when applying. Apply to the location you want to work at first.
good,i would move parts from store to shops who ordered them. i would come in on Fridays early to put up truck of parts for store. keep shelves full and faced for a great appearance to store

good,You are on the road alot of the time. Learning where the parts are in the store and loading them up can be aggravating but other workers will show you where things are. Pretty simple job once you get the hang of the routes.
good,Great people and great environment for a daily job. Helping others with troubles that you have knowledge of makes the day even more exciting. Along with fun customers
good,"Its hard to grow in my department, when an opportunity to grow appears they make us apply for the job but they already have another person for the job. They prefer someone from out of the department with less experience than the ones that know all the process."
good,it a very easy and fun career just make sure you have the right managers i work with a store manager that was not good and the district maager and the store manager were best friends
good,"Helping people get what they need."
good,"ASE REIMBURSEMENT "
good,"Overall it was a good experience. Went in knowing a good amount about cars and their parts, came out knowing more. Management was great until the store manager was transferred and the new one came in. After which, hrs were cut and payroll was spread out throughout more new hires."

I get to meet new people and give them sound advice if they are willing to listen.  My crew is awesome.  My store manager is great and pretty flexible.  I enjoy everything that I do with the exception of some of the customers that come through the store.  Dealing with the public can be a pain, but overall, it's worth all the hours because you learn something new each day."
good,Typically my days were fun and spirit full with particular mechanics and diy 's enthusiasm toward their particular vehicles needs as far as maintenance n optimum performance....... Daily
good,Auto zone is a great company to be with the interaction with the customers could be great sometimes they really do care about their employees they did help with a financial problem I was in because of the hurricane
good,Is a nice working place but with lots of heavy staff which they don't only expect males to do but females too.lots of racism and favouritism.has opportunities to grow in a company which is a good thing
good,working at autozone was fun due to the fact as a female I was learning a lot about cars that I didn't understand and management is very understandable
good,genramente es una empresa bien estabeida y en cnstante crecimiento

good,"I love to work at Auto Zone, the people are so great, you learn a lot from them. A typical day at work for me is going in getting things ready to go out for the day. Deliver parts to customers in a timely manner, answering phones for customers when they call to order parts, organize back stock, putting truck up on truck days, resetting plan-o-grams, doing returns for customers, helping customers that come into the store that need help finding a part or help with their vehicles. Management is very helpful when employees don't know how to do something inside of the store. Management have a lot of things they have to do through out the day and for them to find the time to help anyone when they need it is awesome! The hardest part of my job is.....There really isn't a hard part to the job. I love doing what I do!!! The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with and the customers that aren't rude! There are many enjoyable parts of my job but the people that you work with are what makes your job enjoyable!"

good,It's a great place to learn to build relations with strangers and help people everyday with their problems. Opening store times are really early which is good but closing time for an auto-part store is relatively late. And so it accustoms people to take things for granted leaving priorities for late uncomfortable times to work them.
good,Typical day consist of helping customers with issues dealing with vehicle operations. Helping customers chose the best products for there vehicle needs. Over time customers begin to trust and rely on information over mechanical troubles with their vehicles. Dealing with management is truly an helpful tool in every day operations. They provide proper support in everyday issues. The co-workers are very supportive in handling every day task to ensure customer satisfaction. The most difficult part of the job is providing customers with items that are less common for their vehicle needs. Also dealing with upset customers due to products that premature failure.

In the meantime I would set up my routes packages and merchandise. Then I would go on my route. If I was on a double shift, I would start the whole process over again. The management and co-workers were very easy going and good to get along with. The hardest part of the job, at the beginning, was to remember all the routes I had to take ( I had a map to go by, but eventually they were going to expect me to not have to use the map). All-in-all, the job was very satisfactory and it was very easy to advance the career ladder."

good,very fast paced work place. Always has the employees working on tasks. I have learned to resolve issues due to customers needing assistance with their vehicles. If i ever have to ask a question my superiors are always there to explain and teach me the right way to do what I need to do.

good,"I have always wanted a job in a part store. AutoZone gave me that  chance and it was a dream come true. I love the company and would recommend anyone to work there.

I learned of way to deal with customers, planograms, matrix, and dealing with customer accounts. They give you 1 hour breaks with is good becuause you have time to go pick up food and come to the store with enough time to still eat. So no need to rush eating. Hardest part of the job is the customers because every customer is different and you need to make sure they get what they need. The best part of the job is working with the other employees that make it fun to work."

good,"I really enjoyed working for AutoZone, and I absolutely would have stayed if the pay were higher. Unfortunately, trying to live on 8 and change per hour in Houston is a laughable concept. I can't speak for other locations, but the Mason Rd. store is well managed, and is a pleasant place to work at. They seem to care a lot about the employees, and if you have common sense and good judgment, you can go far. Good job as a stepping stone to a higher position within the company, or if you have some auto parts knowledge and just want a part time gig or a discount on parts."

And whenever a customer walks in the store, I was required to drop everything and greet the customer and ask is there anything that they need help with whether it be looking for a specific product or answering their questions/comments/concerns. "
good,I drove parts to different stores. It was very freeing. I got to help out so many people this way and it put me in a different environment each time. I took care of transfer items and learned how to keep everything organized better. I also put items that reached their destination on shelves where they belonged.
good,Working for Auto Zone was a breeze. They give you plenty of training and teamwork! Unfortunately the community I live in has a lot of non English speaking residence which made communication a bit of a hassle at times.
good,Working at auto zone was fun my boss richard was an amazing guy and leader customer can get a bit out of hand but richard or curt was always there to help us out and we too had really good customer the best service

good,"The job experience at AutoZone is almost completely dependent on the quality of the stores upper management.

The day is very busy and I enjoy that because it makes the day go by fast. The hardest part of this job is sometimes on stock day, having to carry some parts gets tiring due to their weight. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning about the product you're selling and about how exactly the parts work and function in a vehicle."
good,"It was a very busy job. You never really had a time to rest because there was always someone to help. Changing batteries everyday does hurt the back a bit, but it made the day go by faster. It was a hot job but I enjoyed it a lot."
good,Helping a number of customers and solving their problems throughout the day. Gives you a sense of pride helping someone and knowing that you solved a problem that they had no idea how it was going to work out.

good,The work was very easy and it was something that could get done everyday. I would go back and work there again in a heart beat.
good,While at work I was able to get along with my co workers and provide customers with advice and information on there problems. I also moved up to a manager where I was able to be a leader and take the role of sale and decisions that were made.
good,"I was with AZ for 23+ years, and held many positions with the company. They have grown way too fast and have forgotten what got them to the #1 retail parts industry. Stock price is all they worry about."
good,This was one of my favorite jobs. I met great friends. Management was good. I learned about car parts and how to change head lights and windshield wipers. Very flexible. Only thing I didn't like was the pay. They didn't pay much of anything.

The most enjoyable part of the job is the sight seeing part you get to see different cities etc.
good,"I loved working here, many of the customers were baffled as to why I was working there and every day was an awesome learning experience. I was mainly working in the back of the store stocking parts by a fierce numeric sequence (which I fully enjoyed). I usually got mini lessons on what parts I was stocking from my co workers and managers. The most difficult part of my job had to be when I was struggling with how to pay for childcare on a part time salary.

good,"To work full time you must have an open schedule, hours can get cut depending on your position and the stores income. They hire drivers, people for sales, and have a back counter system that deals with local shops that is run on a separate computer program and has its own drivers. Stores can be very slow, or fast paced depending on location, but there is plenty to learn even years into the company about the automotive industry and how systems work in vehicles. The pay is alright, seems that managers made around 10-12 and with experience it can go up, the part timers or autozoner's make around 8 or 9 an hour. For part timers they are able to work around school schedules, but don't expect three days a week at 8 hour shifts. Expect to work 21 hours spread all throughout the week. There is no commission. There are plenty of resources and ways to get a hold of HR or regional management if needed, opportunity to move up is there. The environment is great, management is pretty great."
good,Its a good and stutdy job if you willing to work hard. Plenty of career advancement opportunities and a very pleasant work environment. Heavy lifting and memorizing required
good,My typical day at AutoZone would start with me opening the store getting the registers together making sure the safest balance checking what employees were coming in for the morning shift getting all of the daily paperwork taking care of.

good,"Un buen ambiente de trabajo, buenas prestaciones,  buena administración"
good,"I began my journey with this company back in 2003 when it was a totally different company. I loved the vision of the company back then. New employees were matched with veteran and skilled employees and the learning was endless. I watched these veterans leave the company when it entered the current phase of selling car parts. When I relocated in 2015, I chose to not return to the company."
good,Walking into Autozone was just a breathe of fresh of air. I enjoyed my co-workers & all the customers that entered our door. I helped make everyone feel welcomed we a smile & greeting.

good,"Vale la pena esta empresa, se aprende mucho y hay forma de ayudar a mucha gente, los cursos en otras ciudades y las capacitaciones son muy importantes, el modelo norteamericano y la calidad del servicio son cosas presentes en esa empresa."

good,"I had been with AZ for 3 years, and loved every minute of it.  I was able to show great aptitude for planograms and working  on my own, as well as taking leadership with working out truck (restocking the store).  Driving was a piece of cake, as long as you know your area. I shifted into the commercial area, and found it very comfortable.  If you know your car parts, and know how to find them (catalogs, dealerships, hub store) then you will strive in this position.  Pay is the hardest part, the parts business is not one that you are going to make a lot of money in, it's a good padding, but not for sole income."

good,No matter what you do at Auto Zone you are pretty much always guaranteed a laugh around every corner. So many of us who work here like to have fun while we work some more then others but as long as your work gets done have as much fun as possible. However a few of us can be very hot tempered so while your having your fun while working be sure not to strike a nerve with any of us. Other then that we love to see fun productivity here. So if you think that you would fit in here then come on down and get in the Zone...Auto Zone.

good,I loved the store I worked at and my co-workers..............
good,"There are many pros to working for such a huge company as AutoZone. A typical day at AutoZone consists of three things. First off being Customer Satisfaction. There are different approaches to how we are trained to treat our customers from our WOW! Customer Service, to us going the extra mile, and WITTDTJR. Treating each customer as an individual not just a number, helping the customer with what they need to get the job done, and leaving with an awesome first impression of AutoZone. To guarantee that they will share their experience with other customers. Then secondly, Sales. There is a different C.O.C. every week. Each AutoZoner is required to sell an amount. The Check Out Challenge is something that will benefit both the customer and AutoZone. Last but not least, working with such a vast diversity company. There is so many opportunities at AutoZone, one just has to have the want to succeed."
good,"A typical day for me at AutoZone would start with me coming in usually to open at 7:15am. I would come and clock right in. I would the get my self signed on to a register by a manager and begin to count my drawer. I then would begin to walk round the store and maker sure nothing stuck out or didn't belong. I also would go pull over stock items and begin front facing the entire store. Usually being this early it was down time. When a customer walked in, I would drop whatever I was doing immediately to cater to the costumers needs, whether it be looking up and pulling a part or installing one. I would also occasionally drive to deliver parts whether it be to San Jose or shops around the area or as far as Hollister and Watsonville. I would repeat this process for the remainder of the day until my shift was over and it was time to count the register again before leaving."
good,"A typical day of work would first require you to clock in. Then you would wait on customers, try your best to satisfy there wants or needs. The customers are usually patient and respectful. Another thing with a typical work day would be the minor part installation. This could range anywhere from twin battery vehicle to a extremely small light bulb in the turn signal of a vehicle. Nearing the end of the day, you would start closing task which entail: Cleaning bathrooms, sweeping the sales floor, taking out inside and outside garbage, and mopping high traffic areas and any fluid drips that happened throughout the day. When the time came you would lock the doors, count the drawers, count the safe, then clock out and go home."
good,a typical day at work driving around the city delivering auto parts and learning the streets and my way around. had great management and co-workers we communicated with each other as a team.the hardest part not knowing an anwser a customer ask but the enjoyable part was delivering because i got to see other parts of the city

good,"En esta area donde cubri mis practicas profesionales, era entrar alas 9 am llegaba y checaba mi hora de entrada puntual y comenzaba con acomodar la mercancia de camión que se colocaba en piso o en hardparts, al terminar comenzaba a armar los nuevos planogramas de la semana que había pendientes mientras también daba atención al cliente que eso era lo que mas me gustaba hacer en todo el dia, la parte mas difícil del trabajo era reacomodar mercancía de hardparts ya que eran autopartes muy pesadas y delicadas, lo que mas m gusto de este trabajo fue la forma en la que nos enseñaron a dar la atención la cliente de acuerdo a sus políticas."
good,"Great management and a fun place to work. Like any other sales or customer service job you will have to deal with the occasional rude and rowdy customer. However, being able to help customers find solutions to their problems has to be the most rewarding part of the  job."
good,"I learned to be little bit farster on typing,to manage my department and work well with my collegues as we dit enjoy to capture."
good,Worked very long hours but loved this job. It expanded my knowledge in the automotive field and allowed customer interactions that would solve customers auto problems. I managed approximately 6-10 employees on a shift and was responsible for the store and sales goals. 
good,"A typical day at work for me is installing batteries, wiper blades, and headlights. My AutoZone is very busy, we're open until 12 a.m. midnight, so everyday is something new. I also help customers choose the best product and provide trustworthy advice. This job has some good benefits. I have learned so much, I went in without any prior knowledge on cars. Now if anything goes wrong with my car I know how to fix it myself. Another good thing about this job is because of the high Hispanic population I have learned a good amount of Spanish. If a Hispanic customer comes in and does not speak much English I am able to communicate in Spanish and provide them with full service. This job is great and my co-workers are awesome too, but I just don't feel like I get payed enough for what I do. I work so hard, I have never been late for work, I have never called out, and I never had anybody complain about my work ethics. So, I do believe I deserve a little bit more than $8 an hour."

The interview was a great experience as well. I started working under a new manager who was very accommodating for all of the employees.
good,This was a job that was supposed to be a fill in spot and I became a Manager instead.  I learned several things from training and coworkers.  Great team atmosphere.
good,"Autozone Warehouse is a great place to work regardless what shift you are on. A typical day is either picking parts and taking the finished order to the dock, or replacing parts that run out or are low. I learned how to stack really well, ride a double rider, train others on how to do the job, clean up spills, and make the most of my time. The management is exceptional and go above and beyond what they are required to do. They come around constantly to ensure you are being safe, performing your duties right, and picking what is required. They help you if you are struggling to make rate or stacking correctly. The hardest part of this job is making rate and being able to pull at a constant rate to ensure your rate stays where it needs to stay."
good,"I wish I could've stayed here longer but other jobs got in the way. It was a great workplace, even if you don't know anything about parts, they will teach you. Great, friendly coworkers. No needlessly stressful BS with needing to fulfill a sales quota. Laid back, for the most part and fun. Ive heard from other coworkers that being the parts delivery driver is even better. All in all though, I loved working here."

The store managers became  friends of mine. The workplace was a fun place to come and just talk like a barber shop. Hardest part was leaving it."
good,"Peole are awsome here learned alot if things , helped me with my automotive license & learn things new that i could use in automotive school. Very flexible place."
good,The job can be very exciting if you have the right management team. Our manager is lazy and horrible but she reaps the benefits of store manager of the year but failed to acknowledge her team for making it happen. The DM and the HRM is all a joke.  Nothing works for them unless it's beneficial to them. When employees reach out to the higher ups all the requests fall on deaf ears. No employee morale but they break their necks for customers who they know is getting over. Also the DM feels compelled to go to competitors and get new hires opposed to promoting from within with employees that have been busting their butt.
good,"great career move to learn and grow."
good,"Working at autozone was kind of challenging at first, because that was my first job. Eventually I got the hang of everything and it became quick and easy for me to get the job done."
good,"Successful identification of car parts."
good,Management at the store is very helpful if you wish to advance in the company with spending time out of their day to train you on things that aren't required of you but you simply have the desire to learn.
good,"fast paced, constantly changing. learned a lot about automobiles, and troubleshooting. multi tasking was a must. most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that you dealt with on a daily basis."
good,"Job and people were awesome, would recommend to anyone to work there. hours were flexible and off time balanced nicely with time worked."
good,It is a nice job im good at it me personally i think its more of a job for someone who is retired from one job and just needs to stay bussy doing something fun and not for the money. Pay wise the job isnt that good i cant live on what i get payed at the moment.
good,"Fast paced restaurant, super awesome team and outstanding management. I was lucky to be able to be apart of the team there, it was fast paced and easy to learn and grab on to right away. I didn't have a hard or bad day because in the end i always wanted to be there and everything about the environment was fun. I had so many cool, life changing experiences."
good,"At work, I would help with customers up front, occasionally deliver parts to a commercial customer, and test batteries and alternators and other parts. I have learned more about vehicles and how they run, I have been sharpening my multitasking capability in many different situations. They management is firm but fair, and the co-workers are a great group of people, Each care for one another. I think the hardest part about the job is when shipment comes and we are understaffed to organize everything. We still get the job done, but I think it is a lot harder the way the company have it setup. The most enjoyable part about my job is that I get to help people get moving again, provide some relief from everyday stress and to have an opportunity to put a smile on someone's face."
good,"very friendly and active co workers "
good,"esta empresa es muy buena y me gusto mucho trabajar en ella, ya ue te capacitan constantemente y aprendes mucho sobre autopartes."

good,This was a great family friendly job. Great start off job for teens or a great part time job for some extra money. The employees enjoyed the work and the customers continue to come and enjoy the games.
good,"I have only positives about Autozoners, with the one exception that they do not have open positions for fulltime work.  The environment is clean, orderly, and you are treated like a person while you are there.  The customer base is great too.  I really enjoy this job and would like to stay, but I need fulltime work in order to support myself."
good,"fun and fast pace, Getting to work on cars all day if that is your thing can be fun, but it is also a retail store. itsall about selling though..if u dont sell u might not have a job for long...but no commission"

They were very understanding and overtime was always available for anyone who wanted the extra hours. I enjoyed being able to help customers and learn about different parts as well."
good,"Great manager, always getting new furniture in for the show room, coworkers were great to work with, customer work great to work with while in their homes. The hardest part of the job was always unloading and loading the trucks on shipment days and at the customers house. The most enjoyable times of the job was getting to know everyone and making new friends and seeing all the new furniture and setting it all up and learning how to do delivery's"
good,"This is the best job I have ever had. If I had the opportunity, I definitely would. If you cant advance with this company then you aren't even trying."

good,"Customer Satisfaction comes first. Take care of the customer, they take care of the company, the company takes care of you."
good,I enjoy working at AutoZone. There's never a dull moment. I feel like my services are appreciated and I'm helping people constantly.
good,Good place to work. Great co-workers. Enjoy leaving customers with the satisfaction that they would come back to you only for advice.
good,"I deliever car parts to and from auto zones and to auto shops.I can carry to 60lbs of car parts. Also, I have to work in the retail area sometimes. So i have to help customers with parts they are looking for."
good,working at autozone was fun. I loved my job. the most enjoyable part was knowing that I was helping someone. I learned a lot from this business and would work here again.
good,My days at AutoZone were fun because it reminded me of my old life as a civilian before joining the military.  The people I meet each day helped me see how one day I can go back out into the civilian arena and truly excel in the workforce.  The management team that hired me were prior military members from way back that understand how it can be for veterans.  The only bad side to it was the management at the store I worked were really young and it showed.
good,"I enjoyed working for Auto Zone, I provided superior customer service to all customers. I was even allowed to open the store after being employed for a short period of time"
good,"Great Company. I dare to say that Auto Zone has a way to provide a feel of freedom work environment that allows the team members to want to execute their performance to the best of their ability. Auto Zone culture gives their employees a sense of pride."
good,"First job I really enjoyed working at. As a commercial driver, I enjoyed doing deliveries and going from store to store to pick up parts. Even doing in store work, coworkers were fun and easy to work with. Some days I would be inside doing sales and others I would be out all day installing batteries or headlights. Everyday was something different and the customers usually were grateful for the  services provided to them. It was satisfying helping people to get their cars back on the road again."
good,"Iniciamos a las 7 am la apertura, realizamos el recorrido de tienda tanto en lo exterior como el interior nos organizamos y damos el plan de trabajo a realizar incluyendo las horas de comida, tomamos en cuenta la exibicion de nuestros productos asi como los precios actuales, asiganmos cajeros y dotamos, a cada uno de nuestros compañeros se les asigna una tarea esto es aparte de la atencion que le damos a nuestros clientes siempre con la mejor imagen y el buen sentido de cooperacion al salir a apoyar o ayudar a nuestros clientes, nos apoyamos con catalogos electronicos, tenemos un area de devolucion de partes de la cual garantizamos, nuestras partes mas adelante hacemos un inventario de las garantias,He aprendido en esta empresa que tanto los hombres como las mujeres tenemos participacion en las tareas encomendadas el cual es bueno por la equidad de generos,, el cuerpo gerencial es importante ya que diversificamos nos apoyamos en tareas administrativas lo importante es hacer equipo, lo mas dificil por asi llamarlo es cuando tenemos una baja de algun compañero por salud pero por lo regular no ocurria estamos mentalizados y nos gusta lo que hacemos, lo que mas me gusto es que siempre hay algo nuevo que aprender de cada vehiculo y el compañerismo que existe entre nosotros."
good,"Great Co-workers, Managers are easy to get along with. Very understanding with any changes with availabilty"

good,I've worked in the Auto Zone stores in the Kansas City area for the last 2 and half years and i can say that it has been a thrilling ride. Handiling different customers problems helped to mold me into the problem solver that i am today. Moving up in the company isn't hard to do as long as you show that you want it. Keep your mind focused on the goal and you can go as far as you want to go.
good,"AUTOZONE IS AN AMAZING COMPANY TO WORK FOR, I WISH I COULD HAVE CONTINUED MY CAREER WITH THIS COMPANY . DUE TO MY INJURY AND OTHER MATTERS THIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE . AUTOZONE IS GREAT! I lost my job due to a stupid mistake on my par ,there was no way around the out come"

good,"Wonderful place to work , they supply you with the tools to learn the products and how to apply your knowledge."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed interning for AutoZone's Marketing department.  Everyone I worked with was so willing to teach and share their skills, knowledge, and experience with me.  "
good,"Answering phones and providing information to customers."
good,the typical day at work is with people that need help and you help them and at the same time may learn something new.
good,"The job is a very good one, but it is entry level. It is hard to get a full time position, you have to show that you can sell ""What it takes to do the job right"" The management is wonderful. The scheduling is very fair."
good,I had no complaints about the store I was working at. The management was superior. The store had great structure and the companies way of doing things was fluid.
good,"I hate having to leave the place, company is great and the people are better"
good,There was never a typical day. There was always a new obstacle and it kept me on my toes. I learned a lot more than I already knew about auto's. My manager was great to work with and as with all co-workers there was always ups and downs but we always made it work. There was never really a hard part of my job. I love a challenge and this job offered that.
good,"Muy buena, se puede comprar con Grupo Gamesa, aprendes , cada mes hay capacitacion via internet, capacitacion con evaluacion en el area de refacciones y autopartes"
good,"loved autozone only left to further my career  as a maintenance technician.  my boss was fair but stirn, alwase had the opportunity for advancement in the company and I enjoy helping people so it was the perfect place to work."
good,"Great opportunity to talk to customers one on one, address needs and help them solve their problems with their vehicles. One of the best parts of working at AutoZone is the environment that my co-workers create which enables all of us to work a lot more fluid. An enjoyable aspect of the job is to see customers come back and thank you for helping them fix their problem instead of paying a high amount of money to a mechanic."
good,Overall i enjoyed being apart of the AutoZone family. I normal day at work would be me entering the store and everybody greeting me including customers. I would clock in and come out to the sales floor and begin helping and serving customers waiting inline or just walking into the store. In between waits i would walk the aisles of the store and fix anything out of place and then towards closing I would mop and sweep the floor. Lastly i would wait with other employees while the manager locked the safe and we all left for the day at the same time. If i had the chance i would love to work here again.
good,"I've worked here for a little over six months and the entire time its been great! Through everything we do, to the people we work with. Allot of busy work is envolved, but in the end there has been no better job I have had yet!"
good,"On a typical day, i would come in to the store and on a slow day, check the isle for merchandise that is miss placed or on the floors and relocate them. If there was a lot of people waiting i would jump on either the register to check out or on a computer to help the next customer. On this job i learned a lot of what goes on the workings of different makes and models. I learned how to properly install certain products, such as a battery or windshield wipers. Also I learned more accurately where certain parts go on a vehicle and their purpose. Management was stern, but understanding at times. They were flexible and very helpful in times of need. As for the co-workers as well, they were very helpful while being as competitive to be the best at helping each customer. The hardest part i think would have to be keeping each customer patient on our busiest hours and helping everyone in a timely manner. Other than that I enjoyed helping each customer with their questions and helping them further understand their vehicles. I also enjoyed learning more and more everyday about different makes and models."
good,Great place to work been there for 27 years in various departments.  I love the team I work with.
good,I like to work with people and have a clean environment place.
good,Be ready to sell sell sell because selling is very important.  It's also a good idea to be ASE certified
good,"Considering Autozone was my part time job, the flexibility granted was amazing as when I initially started I was also working full time at a Law Firm, and was a full-time student in a Master's Program. Everyone at the company is treated equally and management tries to grant everyone the time off they both need and deserve."
good,"Great people "
good,"I am to come in pick orders for our outbound routes. I get my assigned route ready to be scanned and loaded into my van. I deliver my load to the designated store/hub. I've learned that a well oiled team works. The goal is to make our customers happy. Our management team makes the job that much better. They are understanding and willing to work with you schedule and work wise. You have co-workers always willing to work and lend a hand. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay in the same position. You may not want to move up, but the more you know and grow the easier it is to make a great career out of AutoZone. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing our customers get that sigh of relief due to the car part, the help from one of us, or just the knowledge given so they can fix their car."
good,"I loved working at Autozone. It may be the best job that I have had my entire life. I learned alot about cars and also gave alot of knowledge to customers and co-workers. I managed a crew of 7 and i was kindly respected, and talked about very highly."
good,Great company. Plenty of opportunities to grow. Positive and enthusiastic employees. Always working as ateam to meet out sales and making our customer our number one priority.
good,"I would open the store at 6:30 with another person. While I was dinging paperwork they woul ull stuff from overstock to put out. Paperwprk done , Then i do the books, then count the safe and count and put the cash drawers. If i have time i print the sales from the previous day. I have to say that the hardest part of my job was nothing really. I leard to do th from my boss who is number one when it comes to the store and she trained me. I got along with my co-workers great. The most enjoyable part of my job, was knowin I helped someone to have the ability to fix there car. While doing the job right the first time."
good,AutoZone is definitely a place where you can advance and learn as a person as well as a worker
good,I loved working at this job. My co-workers were more like my family. Everyone looked out for each other and would be willing to help the next person if needed. The manager was very loving and understanding. The hardest part of this job was all of the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part was working with people that cared about you.
good,"You always have something to do and every day is different. Management, for the most part, is very understanding and are helpful. Co-Workers are usually great to work with. The best part is helping customers find what they need."
good,"Overall this was a great job. I got the opportunity to learn a lot about auto parts. My co workers were great, and they also had great management. The hardest part of the job was that I was not very familiar with too many car parts before the job, but somehow I learned. The most enjoyable part were my co workers and manager. They were all very friendly."
good,There really isn't a typical day of work at Autozone due to the fact everyday had something new to throw at you. I learned a lot about handling cashier responsibilities and how the management worked their jobs.
good,"Management is fun, staff is a blast and customers are fun as well"
good,"work with customers to help them look for what they need managment at your side to help, steady paced work."
good,A day at work for me is very busy love to help customers. Sense i been at my 1st job i have learned alot about autoparts and how they work/an what they go too.

My co-workers are great i work with a great team they are very productive an love to get the job done an love helping our customers.I would say the hardest part of my job is nothing cause i love my job. The enjoyable part of my job is getting to learn more an more each day cause u can never learn enuff about autoparts.

good,"I had great time working here. I learned alot and my coworkers were some of the best people. "
good,AutoZone is not for everybody and everybody is not for AutoZone! This is a fantastic place to work if you are competitive and self driven. While building a new distribution center we achieved the safest and most productive start up in the company's history.

I would say this is partially because the commission only exists for the head of commercial and the rest are just hourly.

That each store doesn't just run by how ""that boss"" does things. "

I learned how to improve my customer service skills and time management skills, yet always putting our customers first to deliver great service. As for management they all were good to me and helpful, however I feel communication could have been a little more clear as to how transfers worked as I was told my transfer was approved.
