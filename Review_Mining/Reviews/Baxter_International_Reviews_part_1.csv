rating,review
bad,I have not worked for Baxter Healthcare so cannot comment. Not sure who they are. they are healthcare who look after people in a wonderful way. great to work for I guess
bad,"Management sucks they use underhanded tactics to get their work pushed out ..  their is no communication behind the drivers and management , you are basically working blindly.  they are rude to temp to hire workers who are really the reason why the company stays afloat .. equipment is horrible , "
bad,Name brand franchise but really nothing else was good from there. i will not recommend anyone to apply because it is waste everyone's time. Culture was horrible
bad,"If your an experienced injection molding process tech you will be greatly disappointed. They use the job title and job description to lure you in. You will be lucky to get an opportunity to process, your time will be occupied resetting alarms (never solving problems), monotonous operator duties, material handler and quality personnel duties, anything but process technician duties. You will find that your coworkers are inexperienced and have no training in Injection Molding or processing. "
bad,Terrible company to work for. Expectations far to high. Food offer terrible. Senior management have no idea. Very clicky. If you’re face doesn’t fit your life becomes unbearable
bad,"The pay rate isn't enough to provide support to your family if it's the sole income. YOU WILL GET IN TROUBLE FOR TURNING DOWN OVERTIME. SERIOUSLY, YOU CAN LOOSE YOUR JOB FOR GOING AGAINST THE MANDATORY OVERTIME THEY DO EVERY SINGLE DAY."
bad,You can be the top performer there but they will not want to move you up because then they will be losing out on your productivity. Opportunity to travel is a big selling point.
bad,Unhealthy work environment. Always have to OT Everyday. No time off. Always have to leave workplace only after 7pm no diff from shift personnel. Equipments always having issue and management not doing anything to address it.
bad,Worst Maintenance Manager that you have ever worked for. He cuts corners and he is made of Teflon. Should have been removed along time ago when he first started.
bad,I enjoyed working here after my first few months getting to known everyone. I enjoy the health insurance benefits that came on the first day of employment.
bad,did not like working here overall management cery poor hr not great supervisor was on a power buzz could not approach i would not reccomend to work here at all
bad,"My position was sent to India,"
bad,"The hardest work I've ever done, There are only 2 delivery guys working there at the time and they've been there for over 20 years and treated me very poorly. Worked my regular shift and when I returned back to clock out my Manager from Illinois was standing at the time clock waiting to Fire me. Didn't tell me why just Fired me and walked away. Of course 1 day til my 1 year anniversary!"
bad,I initially enjoyed working in Baxter because i had to travel a lot however i wasn't  reimbursed properly.Hectic job profile and no support from immediate colleagues
bad,"Be prepared for the Good Ole Boy system. If you're family you are well prepared, but for an outsider ... good luck. "
bad,Baxter has very many problems all of which upper management chooses not to address--as long as they get their six figure bonus checks.  Avoid like the plague.
bad,"hard fast pace place to work, "
bad,"Only promotes the butt kissers, never fixes any problems, does not care about employees."
bad,"Some very good people at Baxter. Of course, all companies have bad people. Well, couple take the cake. One manager (CF) was the worst manager I have ever experienced and still to this day, even though I have left the company, those that are still there plan to leave because of her pretentiousness."
bad,"Expected to work non-stop. Mandatory overtime is enforced. Management members micromanage their employees. Taking on extra projects is encouraged, however the employee does not gain any benefit from doing additional work. Extremely difficult to move up within the organization."
bad,"I worked at Baxter for a short-term temporary assignment. I was overqualified for the position and they ended up using me for custodial duties a lot. That was definitely not what I signed up for. The recruiter who placed me at this assignment assured me that if I worked this low-paying, short term assignment that I would have a good chance of landing a better, permanent position with the company. That never happened."
bad,Management is very poor. They do not care about their workers. They do not ensure the safety of their workers. They overwork everyone. Too much mandatory overtime.
bad,Baxter International is a poorly run corporation that has no clue what happens outside of their corporate headquarters of Chicago. If you are not located at their corporate headquarters you might as well not even exist.
bad,"Come in and someone is always arguing. "
bad,Very bad management with no people skills. very low salaries and no bonus. no canteen. Toxic ambient and atmosphere due to extreme bad management. constant work under high pressure and stress.
bad,"This company is very unstable job."
bad,"Very out dated way of hiring and operating. Management consists of family and friends.. "
bad,everyone acted like 12 year olds.  the boss treated me like I was mentally disabled.  no one would just leave me alone to do my job. and there was to many clicks.  and staying employed there majors on weather or not the bosses liked you an if the top clicks liked you to.
bad,"Work 10+ hr/ days on Mondays and Saturdays (no overtime pay), lucky to get 40/hrs a week. May as well work in a factory it is so hot in the facility with scrubs, lab coat, and constantly running around. Management is awful, they dont care about anything other than stats, they all sit in the office while the center is so busy . You have to be friends with management to get a promotion, and those who do get them typically do not deserve them, or just are not qualified for them. Pay is not worth the hard work you will put into the place. Do not expect to be able to have a normal life, family and friends time  is not allowed here. You work 2 morning shifts, and 3 night shifts. Overall, do not work here!"
bad,Management takes advantage of its employee's situation and pays them poorly.
bad,The training class is n9t organized based on the manual book. If you're an organized person the book would make you think crazy. Please do not trust anyone upfront. Make them gain your trust and respect too. It's not both ways.  Communication is the key to success which some leader's doesn't have it within themselves. MMake th9s
bad,"Packing is a terrible department to work in and the reason for that is the manager/superintendent, and his name is mark miller. He is a real jerk and doesn’t care about his people."
bad,I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wants to progress and develop . The site is NOT Baxter is a small local company called APATEC purchased by Baxter. The staff working are very stressed and very resistant to any cooperation and change.
bad,It’s all a numbers game. They could care less about you or your family. You need to be part of the in crowd or you are dispensable. Even if your customers like you-your managers get away with anything
bad,"I lived in Georgia and commuted to North Carolina until i could find me a place to live in North Carolina. They never told me that it would take a month before i would get my first check. They didn't help me in anyway with my living expenses. I was forced to borrow money for my hotel stay and for rental cars. I eventually ran out of money and was forced to sleep in my car. I tried reaching out to homeless shelters but was told that because i wasn't a native of North Carolina it wouldn't be anything that they was able to do. I even tried reaching out to the area churches but my calls went unanswered.I reached out to the representative that offered me the job to see if the company could help me. I later found out that the representative worked for  the local temp agency and had very little knowledge about the company himself.  Not to mention the representative not only had limited knowledge about the company but was also kinda of new. The agent was also very short and nasty to me and kept putting me off until finally telling me that it was nothing that he could do for me. Finally, when I got my first check which was my bonus check it had been taxed not 1 but 3 times. After learning of the issue i reached out to human resources which told me that it was a default in the system and that it was nothing that i could do about it. I than reached out to the corporate office and was told that it was nothing that could be done about it upon my threatening to resign the issue was resolved. I was refunded the difference of my money. The human resources team at Baxter knew nothing about nothing."
bad,"Travail ininteressant , pas de perte de temps pour former les gens, production intensive au péril de la qualité."
bad,"Outdated software, Windows XP running on critical platforms supporting patient health interfacing with company infrastructure in most cases running more updated operating systems and software introducing high risk scenarios in the way of viruses, malware, and network security."
bad,When Head Chef left after a year I was left to do all the ordering. had no support from management. Kitchen was small and you was lucky if you got a break. the work was non-stop.
bad,I have no review for this company at this time. I've worked for this company a long time ago. I'm not aware of the changes that may have happened in recent years.
bad,"Toxic work culture, Heavy politics. Change is severely challenged. No management support to change agents. You speak up and they will punish you. Certain departments only hire people that listen to their bosses."
bad,Company closure in 2017 left quite a few people with no job. It didn't seem to matter to management. The carrer path was downhill just not a good time there
bad,"Promised loads never delivered, No training given, Think more about management then the workers."
bad,Terrible management and staff relations throghout the company. they do their very best to demotivate staff and show very little in the way of respect.
bad,Very less pay $640with 12 hour line job. Non stop work. Less break time not sufficient.  Tiring job. If we ask something to superior no immediate response. Very very tiring line based job. Break 15 mins in pantry half an hour to canteen and 15 mins pantry again break not enought for this kind job.
bad,"management is not very good, undetermined daily hours to work, no advancement, and certain supervisors do not know how to manage... instead they micro manage"
bad,"There is no progression in this working environment. "
bad,Their management definitely could use some educating on how to treat the employees. Very demeaning and also does not train employees on the job.  Nothing positive to say.
bad,This is not a company that values creativity or dedication to quality of employees. Extensive travel is required and takes you away from having a life outside of work. Their expectation is that employees are robots rather than having expertise and adjusting instruction based on learner needs. There is also no job security as they are contract based. Worst decision of my life to take a position with them
bad,"Not a great place to work. Heartless, Policy spouting Drones. and high rollover so they can replace the employees with cheaper labor so unless your perfect dont bother."
bad,"Very difficult to work there."
bad,"Everyone is related to each other, if they don't like you you're screwed. I was harassed and still am getting harassed for the 6 months I've been employed here. Everyone's out to get each other there is no team work in the manufacturing department."
bad,"no work life balance at all, 6 and 7 days a week doing work that can cause damage to your bodies; huge disconnect between management and workers. the higher up people do not understand that if their outdated and inferior equipment doesn't work we cannot do our jobs.  so to make up for equipment not running we constantly run 6 and 7 days a week. exhausting and stressful!!"
bad,"Not the job i was sold in my interview and after an initial settling in period people are thrown to the wolves."
bad,"Pros"
bad,Only place you can work.  Nothing else in the area.  Not a good place unless they hire you on permanent.  As a temp you are treated poorly and given very little.
bad,"Pros: None worthy of mentioning."
bad,Years worth of improvements needed and the company has only recently decided to make changes to be competitive and to meet standards.  It will take real resources and leadership that is really invested in fix issues instead of patching concerns.
bad,Managers rule through fear-based “motivation”.  It doesn’t work.  Great people leave and abysmal and uneducated managers stay.  Stagnant and depressing work dealing with ++ customer complaints.
bad,"Great co-workers put very poor management who plays favoritism and does not act on constructive feedback.  "
bad,"Management and supervisors don't work well together to enforce accountability.  They show favoritism. They don't want to hear ideas and or brush them off. Before leaving, I did see some improvement on pay increase."
bad,"One of the worst cultures I've experience in 30+ years.  Cut-throat, big time.  Upper management only interested in self-promotion and at the expense of everyone else."
bad,Culture was really toxic - bullying management and no job security - Melbourne office was terrible. Lots of gossip and real divide between Directors and support staff
bad,Management is terrible. Mandatory overtime is required about 2x per week on top of mandatory Saturdays. This company does not care about its workers. The company is divided into cliques and the employees are not friendly towards one another.
bad,"A typical day at work included being harassed by experienced, timely workers, The chain of command was never used. I worked for the company in Cleveland, Ms and it wasn't anything like the logistic company in Memphis, TN. Human Resource wasn't fair at all."
bad,"Don't know where to start! Training is so slow, not allocated time to be trained, I asked for time and they were ""always too busy"". Management is terrible. There is no communication between management and production staff. Salary is terrible. Trying to get time off is impossible as there is a restriction on 1/3 of the year now including Christmas and from may until September your only allowed take block weeks off not individual days. Lates are horrible you never actually get out at half 7 because something always delays us. Overtime is compulsory which is ridiculous! 6 hours overtime to be completed when your supposed to be on the early shift."
bad,"This company fails in almost every aspect, it stems from a lack of good management. It lacks the resources and the talent in management to solve even the most minute issues, turnign at every problem to outside contractors who perform poorly then walk away. The engineering is poor. The executives are out of touch and slogans are the common means of measuring outcome. The only plus I can think of is the company has been sold and resold so many times perhaps someday an owner who puts good management in place might make a difference."
bad,Major changes with the new COO coming in and it is necessary- company is in flux... looking forward to see some major changes and some old timers leaving....
bad,"VHB life sciences is indian pharmaceutical industry having a good turn over with good range of injectables."
bad,"I was told I was hired for part-time work however when I started working I was informed I would not be given any days off unless I used PTO.  So basically they own you! You are scheduled everyday for some hours and usually all the undesired closing hours so you will be working 12-8 or later some nights. "
bad,"Worked for this company as a Purchasing Officer. Very cliquey workplace. Would get the job of sourceing new equipment and machinery, spend weeks of valuble time and in the end  you get told the equipment had already been sourced in US and was being shipped over .Had to contend with the office snitch who was so far up the office manager/chief accountant's backside its a miracle he didn't have brown shoulders. Long hours were part of the job, home life was a no no. Baxter comes first middle and last. Little or no support from upper management salary nothing to get excited about."
bad,"This place is a good company before 12 years ago they care with their employees and hire based credentials and experience. If you’re looking for a high stress, high political mentality (not what you know but who you know mentality). This is the place to go. I work for 16 years at Baxter CIVA. You have a Manager that curse a lot in front of people and does not know anything about production but what is fed to him. Supervisors have their agenda and high favoritism based on a friend network. Team leads don’t want to work on all areas but just work on areas that are easy and sitting down job. Every month their are people either leaving or let go. If you suggest and speak the truth in anyway they purge you and look at all you movements. Sad sad place I pity my co-workers that are still there because they cannot fine any work outside. Lastly, this is run by inexperience management/quality/friendster network."
bad,Management was great when I first started and then went downhill. This is not the place to work if you wanr to further your career. They pretty much only have contract work there and they don't hire you on after your contract.
bad,"worst place I've worked they are so cut throat. don't mess up on the training they will fire you"
bad,"pay is decent not what they promise, have no time for family , so if you do have one ...you basicly never see them, managers have no idea of what there doing, they promise ALOT and deliver nothing  ! making them millions per day and they pay you pennies ...seriously....my dept. alone they make at a minimum 4 million a day!"
bad,"I really didn't enjoy my 3 years working for Baxter, they have very micromanagement team and it's like you are grounded if you end up late and making a tiny mistake not only that the company overload with commitments to sales contracts and they didn't have enough product line to meet clients deadlines. 2017 it was an awful year for customer service, sales, and warehouse."
bad,"sneaky human resource managers and supervisor who plot to terminate you, set you up when the time is right for them to get rid of you. in my experience I wouldn't refer anybody to this place which is under a new company now"
bad,"Management treats employees terrible, work 48+ hours a week, no time with your family and they do not care! Do not recommend"
bad,its a fast pace environment moving medical supplies/proucts
bad,"Generally extremely busy and fast paced. Mgmt only cares about metrics and not what the staff needs to succeed, in addition they rarely come out from their offices to help ease workload because it would interrupt their personal conversations. The environment their is that each co-worker needs to rat others out. Favortism is rapant. None of the policies are logical."
bad,"I joined the company with great enthusiasm to see lack of strategy at the senior leadership in IT."
bad,"Not the kind of place that breeds teamwork and loyalty. It is fear based, and no loyalty exists from company. Lacking innovation. People are scared to take risks and processes are overly cumbersome."
bad,"Worked there for a year.  Ended up getting carpal tunnel in my wrist and was seen but their own work doctor who declared it as a work related injury and put me on a return to full duty program.  Due to this, they sacked me saying that I could not fulfill my contractual duties even though I was on a return to full duty plan instigated by their own doctor.  Awful way they did it as it was so demeaning.  Most of the staff there were in fear of management and not supported at all."
bad,This department is a nightmare. I worked for six years in there. Management expects you to cater to their needs when it comes to mandatory overtime. They generally dont care about your needs so long as the metrics looks good.
bad,"Baxter CIVA Mississauga "
bad,"The new CEO is terrible and does not care about anyone - only the money."
bad,"Don’t even think about moving up in this company unless you know someone. Mandatory overtime which isn’t bad, but you are expected to stay at the last minute, or are told on Thursday you are mandated for the weekend. Can never plan anything on your days off, because 99% you’ll be mandated. Call off policy is a joke. A call off is 1 point you get 7 points & your fired. There is no wiggle room! Better hope you or your family never have an emergecy or you get sick!! Points fall off on their 1yr anniversary date. "
bad,"Management is horrible, matter a fact horrible is an understatement. Human Resources doesn’t do their job, and shows favoritism to their skin of color. No one in upper positions abide by the rules & will target you if you reach out to corporate about the bad treatment you receive. Doesn’t care for their employees. People in lead positions doesn’t know their job, yet have machine leads to do it for them without pay."
bad,"High Asian population, very stressful work environment and extreme gowning procedures. Sometimes very long work hours, regular 8 hours plus overtime.."
bad,High Turnover  speaks for itself .   Many people find out about the place and then leave.   Dangerous and Managers are nice but you get no say in your job or the working conditions
bad,"The pay is sad in Memphis, I work in the cold chain department and not enough money for the amount work we do. I heard and seen other facilities make good pay but the Memphis facility doesn't pay good. Its temp service out here that pay more than what Baxter pay coming thru full-time. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for Baxter because you will be disappointed trust me I'm trying to leave myself. They have people that's been there 30 to 40 plus years and barely make $18 a hour, not worth it trust me guys. Horrible management that treat you like kids"
bad,the schedule is the worst and they do not care about anything important in your life all they care about is if you will be a body not even a good employee just a body to throw around to tell what to do so that the people higher up do not have to do anything. A girls mother was dying and they looked at her and said so you will be here right bc we are going to be busy and she isn't dead yet. they don't not value their employees and they lie to you in the beginning and then when you are there its completely different.
bad,Schedules aren't posted for the week until the day before. Customers complain because of the training of new staff.
bad,"It feels like you are always being watched and are ""over-managed"", many unnecessary time-wasting tasks given, strange culture and management, they only promote phony ""yes-men"", you cannot speak out with your own opinion; if you do, it is not well received. A lot of finger pointing. Most people are unhappy here, there is a high turn over and no real perks. Rather unpleasant place."
bad,Avoid at all cost . Management look out for each other . Senior Management bully others & this continues throughout plant in castlebar.   People Management poor . Quantity over quality at any cost . Product recalls due to numbers games .
bad,"Do you want to work for a company that is constantly restructuring, reorganizing and constantly laying off employees! Then Baxter may be for you."
bad,"Poor training, does not value employees, poor communication, takes credit for your work without giving any acknowledgement, no support from HR, termination without warning"
bad,My days were not filled with enough challenging job duties.  The culture is cold and unfriendly.  I had the misfortune of a poor manager and unhappy team members.
bad,"Working for Biolife Moorhead was one of the worst ideas. Not only do they have crummy management, there is NO follow up from corporate HR on issues that arise."
bad,"Worked here through the staffline agency,the training is diabolical in my opinion.I had been there three days and I was running a machine,don't get me started on the paperwork,you had to sort into order for the next day,I was never shown this,so when I tried it for the first time and got it wrong I was basically called stupid,also personal insults like being called fat, long hours but good rate of pay"
bad,I enjoyed working here management was ok I had a hard time in life goin on for a min and they were not understanding at all n let me go wouldn't even give me a 2nd Chance didn't even wanna listen knowing I've always been a hard dedicated worker until I got into a bad situation and threw me out like no tommorow. Would not recommend working here they have they click circle of people if not in it your no good for em also it's all contract employee they never hire anyone on to ft
bad,Don't care for their employees! Favoritism towards advancement. Hire outside before promoting within! Get pointed for everything. Turnover rate is high!
bad,No path to advancement and no constructive criticism from management on good or bad work habits. To much last minute forced overtime with no concern for personal responsibilities.
bad,"MEDINA N.Y. "
bad,"Because of the manager I had, he created a hostile work environment where people feared him and afraid if they crossed him they would get fired. He stated he wanted our opinions however, he couldn't figure out why the team didn't. It was because of the above. I don't believe upper management knew about this. However, I do not believe they would do anything about it."
bad,"Lab situation was unorganized, and had to spend a lot of time just trying to figure out how to do what was being asked.  Not much on-site training that was relevant to my position."
bad,"Great place to work and advanced your career. Very passionate and dedicated employees. Not a lot of politics, senior leadership vey accessible."
bad,Not a great place to work if you are looking for something long term. Turnover rate is very high. Workload is unrealistic  for one person.  No clear vision of what needs to be accomplished.
bad,They have no concern for patients.  They allways look for ways to scam you out of your money and your time .  I'll try other find ways to get you to violate Hippa we have some of delivery procedures a method set they have. Is that to load super high sec and few of the truck to the door.
bad,"I have an online application and resume submitted through indeed and Baxter. I have been called for several phone interviews from Baxter...but never offered an Opportunity to a Face to Face interview here in Memphis TN. How can anyone enjoy their Dream Job through their Ability and Talents if a company refuses to let you be hired on to prove yourself. I have my CDL A License now for 19 years in Great Standing. I can see myself being a Great Fit for Delivery Driver for Baxter Memphis TN. It's saddens me how Employers in Memphis TN acts as if they comes to applicants homes, when the applicant are the ones choosing to submit to their company. So why is it a Big Picky to who they going to hire? Why post ads if you're not serious to hiring the Potential Candidates who seriously meet the Minimum Requirements as I know I do. But Memphis is still with Racism and Who You Know To Get A Job...and it's sad when you have desires to do a job...nobody's in the company has the Compassion to reach out to at least set up a face to face interview"
bad,Got cussed out by my assistant supervisor and got talked down too. Disrespectful people and was hit in the head by another employee and HR. Will not help you with anything
bad,They don't tell you how much overtime you will be working and when you are mandated for overtime you are not told until usually within half hour of when you are to leave. Worst management I have ever worked for!!!! Nobody is on the same page very dysfunctional and stressful environment
bad,"Une journee de travail typique."
bad,Nessuna possibilità di crescita e problematiche periodiche sempre in fase di risoluzione
bad,"Sat around a did nothing for days on end. Once watched a maintenance man clean a fan."
bad,"Overall its a great company, but the people in the company is where the problem is. The pay should increase because of the work load. The people who get paid the most are the ones who typically don't do any work but on the other hand the people who actually work don't get paid anything."
bad,"Not a good experience - constant lay offs, senior management not interested in people, all about the bottom line, and investor stock.  Very bureaucratic"
bad,"The pay is low,but at least you were inside from heat and the cold."
bad,"The best place to work hahaha joke"
bad,Very autocratic management at work level with senior management not seeming to have a clue what is happening or what their demands actually mean to the work force. Plenty of overtime which you will be expected to work whether want to or not due to peer pressure. Low moral as undergoing a 2 year review with no-one knowing who's jobs is safe and whether still be employed in the future.
bad,"This place did not explain the true requirements of this job and a lot of these areas are unsafe working conditions. There is also no set schedule, you find out where your going the night before."
bad,Little work life balance. Long hours and short staffed. Pay is good for the area. Management does not have a solid understanding of processes. Culture is very much beaten down and most people are looking to leave.
bad,"This is a meat market for cheaters and homewreckers. Breaks are wayyyyy too short and you're just a robot there. When it's break time, you literally have ten minutes but it takes 5 minutes just to get to the breakroom."
bad,"the hourly staff was great and a few supervisors ( like mine ) were wonderful, but upper management was awful. They touted work life balance but this doesn't exist."
bad,Slave labor camp that penalizes you for being sick or not committing to mandatory overtime. They give you points plus subtract from your PTO. They double dip to force you into submission or force you to look for another job.
bad,"I've worked in multiple positions during my career at Baxter, and every single one had an extreme amount of overtime,  staffing issues, a disconnected management, and too much focus on the negative. The pay is decent, and you get plenty of discounts, but management will ignore your good deeds while pushing their 'product released on time over quality' mindset."
bad,"I worked for Baxter as a Temp to Hire in production. I was told by the temp agency that I could apply for a permanent position after 90 days. Baxter forgot to mention to the temp agency that they changed their policy to 6 months. Then with only a little more than a month to go before I could apply for a permanent position, Baxter put a hiring freeze in place until further notice. Also there are some very reliable sources with in the plant, that Baxter will be closing the plant in Medina, NY at the end of 2019 They have already closed their service department as of 3/15/2019 and started to let go temporary employees (like myself) on the production line (8 as of 3/15/2019) I know that does not sound like a lot, but that is almost one full production line."
bad,"I loved my job at Baxter. I loved taking care of the patients and nurses no matter how stressful. My scores for productivity and adherence were close to perfect for over a year. Never recognized for it. I supported and loved my coworkers too. I got along with everyone and had a very good work ethic. "
bad,"I enjoy the job itself, there are many things going on here. The culture is now one of which everyone is worried about their positions and another possible lay off."
bad,Your just a pawn there.  Ivory Tower syndrome.  Work 60 -75 hours  a week and it isn't enough.  What more needs to be said.  They talk a good talk but don't live it.
bad,"Overall, the company has good PTO benefits for salaried employees, but lacks in almost all other areas. Leadership is disjointed and scattered with no discernible focus. Work culture and norms at the North Cove site are terrible. No one can show up on time for anything. Meetings rarely have an actual agenda, minutes, or deliverables and many people are outright rude and disrespectful towards coworkers. "
bad,Lacking team management. Basically a CYA environment. Almost never stuck to protocol. Assigned a ton of non-applicable remedial tasks constantly. No benefits for contractors what so ever. My contract was ended 4 months early due to cutbacks. No chance of being hired on permanently.
bad,"Always more work to be and not enough time or employees to do the work, lots of cut backs. Used to be a fun place to work and you went home at the end of the day feeling like you had made a difference in peoples lives by being able to complete your job/daily tasks."
bad,"Lots of politics, let’s just say out of the full maintenance team, everyone left except two employees. The management did not treat us right and constantly was asking to prove your worth and what you are paid. Expect a lot but compensation was not all that. Honestly if you are in desperate need of a job go ahead but just know if you make a mistake, bye bye to you it is."
bad,"While the mission of Baxter Healthcare maybe to ""save and sustain lives"" in reality they push there employees to take uneccessary risks in order to ""save and sustain income""."
bad,"Good Benefits and co-workers are good team overall. However management (teamlead; supervisors; manager) have no idea about production SOPs get change on a weekly basis. Promotions and election of key personnel are base on Godfather system actual qualifications and relative experience are not considered. Teams Leads are lazy and does not want to do other jobs. Management focuses on your mistakes and what supervisors told them employees have no voice. "
bad,"Not too bad of a workplace but could use a few changes."
bad,Baxter's can be alot better if people didnt have to work 12hrs get taxed so hard and hired more people so that one person not being over worked on the job. Also employees opinions never matters to most corporations just the money. Baxter's not bad just the people who run it.
bad,"they got rid of me when they no longer has any use for me, they work you so hard and give no recognition. DO NOT WORK IN THE LABORATORY HERE if you have any kind of mental health problem, they do not care."
bad,"-Not a friendly environment"
bad,Management lacked interpersonal communicating skills.  Cut corners often and did not show appreciation to the employees. Advancement wasn't based on experience or knowledge but solely on whether management liked you.
bad,"Vision, mission ever changing-no promotional opportunities, tenure not embraced.  Salaries extremely varied based on who you know not what you do.  HR running the show behind the scene while management is oblivious.  Age discrimination becoming the norm."
bad,"Not very supportive management, not a lot of training so a lot of the work was done on own initiative. Rather overly critical management and issues with the old fashioned till but some decent people to work with. Also had to work through a language barrier. Often had busy days but sometimes slow days where it felt I was not needed. The most enjoyable part was serving the public and dealing with money."
bad,Mandatory saturdays have been going on for years with no end in sight. Are you the most skilled person for the job? Doesn't matter. Popularity contest lets you advance in the company regardless of how much more experienced you are than the other candidates. HR is completely useless. They just do whatever management tells them.
bad,"I worked for Sigma when Baxter bought it. To them, u were only a number. Never really cared about the employees. Very poor management. I really loved my job and what I did. Unfortunately they had their favorites and bended the rules if it benefited the company. I loved my boss, but as a whole, working for a large corporation, they really didn't care about the employees."
bad,Most days you don’t know you’re working overtime (1-4 hrs) until about 20 minutes before the end of your shift and if you don’t work it you get points and eventually fired. There’s no life outside of work due to the hours which don’t seem to be getting cut back even though they say it will. Lower management gets there by being a favorite half the time. There are good people there that try and do their best but it’s few and far between.
bad,"L'ambiance n'est pas franchement le point fort ici, les cadences imposées ne permettent pas de travailler de manière sereine"
bad,"Incompetent management, somewhat perverted old man managing the Production team. As an agent -  you will be observed like a hawk, even outside of work - the way one conducts oneself, if they see and don't like it - you will be gone."
bad,"Be very wary!  This is a toxic and backstabbing environment.  Fear-based management and no ability to move forward in your career at this company unless you lie your way to the top.  HR the worst I’ve ever experienced - fake promises that never materialize and will never support employees!  Some managers are good - wait - they fire the good ones and leave the parasitic ones to throw everyone else under the bus.  Glad to be gone!  Investigate as much as you possibly can prior to accepting a position at Baxter.  Asking some employees or ex employees for their opinions on their roles, the state of the company and the future direction/strategy of their division may save you heartache in the future."
bad,Management has changed hands numerous times in the last 5 years and no one in management cares to learn what can makes this facility successful. Everyone just points fingers at the person under them placing blame
bad,"Culture change in the last 5 years has seen a high turnover of inexperienced staff that work there to make their CV impressive, and gain qualifications."
bad,"this place was so good but, as time went on, people became very cold to products that help people. i can no longer stand for that. it was son infuriating."
bad,One of the better warehouse's I've been through so far. Very clean and well maintained place. Free fruits and drinks and a very high culture of the workplace. Unfortunately very low pay and on my stand total lack of overtime and lots of work each day.
bad,"This is a labor intensive job. Most physical job I had. You must haul 180-210lbs up stairs, sometimes up several flights of stairs using a hand-truck, not easy at all. Be prepared to sweat a lot even in winter. You also do a lot of bending rotating boxes for patients. Some patients think you are their slave and boss you around. Management does care about you, just want the route finished. I worked in Dixon, Ca. High turnover because of physicality of job, most guys last a week or two. Pay started $21.50, benefits start day 1, but only .25-.50 cents raise annually based on performance (not worth it). You have only so much time for each delivery, you have to practically run just to get delivery done in time. Overall not enough pay for what they expect of you and how physical the job is. I worked there 9 months."
bad,"When I started in regulatory affairs, my job had multiple different demands requiring creativity and patience, and was rewarding in that I knew that what I did helped make a difference.  I learned even more about device regulations, database management, and Data collection methods than I came in with."
bad,Very autocratic style of management it becomes very apparent not long after you have joined the company that the culture is very old fashioned and out dated you feel a bit conned by the way they get you to join the company lot of false promises.
bad,"A great place to gain experience. There is a lot of opportunities for someone to get exposure, but that doesn't mean that you will get compensated for it."
bad,unable to match with work schedule
bad,"Great pay and benefits, horrible work life balance, at the whim of management, and toxic work environment.  80 percent of the workforce hates their life."
bad,"good place to work, good money, just keep to yourslef and dont bother anyone and uou willl last, keep detail to what your doing and itf you dont want something repeated dnt say it outliud"
bad,Genuinely no consistency between management. When interpersonal problems arose nothing was done about it. New management has started there so maybe things have changed.
bad,"Culture of management blaming shop floor for problems and not solving."
bad,"Bottom line: Baxter doesn't care about it's employees.  They are overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated.  Management is full of ""leaders"" who either don't know how to lead or don't know how the business works, or both."
bad,"you work both AM and PM shift you switch every month, its a huge health problem because you aren't getting enough sleep, 12 hour days, supervisors are glued to their phone and not caring about their people. I feel like no one but the production teams who run the floor only care about whats going on and care for each other. They never want to actually fix the problem they just try and put the problem off on other shifts to be fixed. They really need to update their old cleanroom, meaning they need to fix their machines  or get new ones"
bad,"As a current employee at Baxter's Healthcare, I can tell you this is not the place for everyone. The atmosphere and the people within it will make you hate your job. Oh, good luck getting trained properly as that's a no go. For example, being a new worker you would assume that you should be told and shown what to do, thus getting trained. However, my supervisor told me he felt as I wasn't showing enough initiative because I wasn't asking questions (That's because he wasn't showing or telling me what he wanted me to do). I would just go into work and just find something to do until he and I had a talk. Anyway, the hardest part of the job is dealing with people there, while trying not to go off on them."
bad,"I had to make sure all areas of the building were secured at all time."
bad,"If you are not the warehouse managers friend do not expect to last very long!!"
bad,"The management there, especially on first shift is just horrible. there are many different cabal's that have their own protection rackets in play. The authoritarian female cabal on first are the worst of the bunch. Step out of line, or question them at your peril. The work in most areas is soul suckingly boring, in all other's, too fast paced to be believed. It may have been a good place to put down roots in the past, but now you're reminded daily that you are replaceable. If you decide to take a chance and take a job offer there, make sure to leave your personality and your soul in the parking lot before entering there-in. The whole place is run on personalities and fear. Watch who you talk to, never...ever! tell your superiors how it really is, or offer any more than what is required to get them to walk away. watch your back and Good luck..."
bad,"Sometimes you find a place with great people and decent work, but it is ruined by decisions made by management.  This happens to be one of those times.  This place would be great if there was efficient planning and better communication down the chain of command.  I took this position to get a foot in the door and hopefully move up within the company, but they require 2 years in current position in order to change departments.  If looking for job here, find the one you want first, don't follow my route."
bad,"Spent a year and a half at Baxter, made some great friends and made more enemies. The pay was not worth the drama that supervisors wouldn't even squash. High school all over again with people old enough to be my grandparents. We worked 6 day rotation and 90% of the community events I was at work, my family seen me less than work did! There is no balance between work and home with them, you are expected to be there no matter what! The nurses are a joke and wrote off any issues you were having as you haven't been here long enough or oh take an ibuprofen and go back to work. Loved my immediate supervisor and most of my co workers but the lousy schedule and way too much overtime wasn't worth the taxes I got charged and not getting time with my family."
bad,"Overall too friendly HR, made the unexperienced lower level management ran over their associates, like there is no tomorrow. Now imagine how stressful that could been?!"
bad,"The company is a great company to learn and advance your skill set. The company is however very cut throat and it does not care about employee well being. The company is all about the bottom line and if you do not produce or add to their goal, you will be cut."
bad,Baxter is a great company to work for however it needs to revaluate the leadership in training new workers. It also needs to put focus on managerial empathy towards workers.
bad,all I remember about  that job was the long hours and the poor way a lot of us were treated.  the company was purchased by a holding company who started laying people off and dicing up the company.
bad,This company pays less than other companies in the same industry.  People are not happy about their salary and they constantly look for other opportunities.
bad,"Wrestling with legacy infrastructure (like many companies), innovating new technologies and ways of serving the patient population.  All products are genuine life saving or life saving drugs and devices.  The level of expertise and experience is generally thin and narrow."
bad,"Staff could be a bit sly at times ,but as long as you got your head down and got on with work it was fine. food lovely. great company"
bad,Almost good. But long hours of working which quite a times effects personal life. Products are almost good. But promotional support is not well
bad,"•	Responsible for the installation and commissioning of large scale automated pharmacy equipment  for VA hospitals and large mail order pharmacies in the private sector."
bad,"I loved my job and thought it was important for those in need. I worked there almost 7 years. I am not a disgruntled employee. In fact I was more disgruntled while I worked there. The management there is poor. When the new manager took over, we got an award for lowest company turnover. With in the last 8 months, 17 people have left. The supervisors belittle people in front of other employees and worse yet, in front of donors. When they are approached about their behavior, nothing is done. They have not done anything wrong and it is all your fault. They talk and gossip about the employees which creates a hostile and biased environment. Recently they have hired young, attractive girls into positions, and have made comments about the older (age wise, not employment length) workers there. The manager sits in his office and does not address issues and lets his supervisors run the business, and they often times do not realize they are doing things that are unethical and could be considered discriminatory. If you speak up for yourself, you are negative and non-compliant.There is little to no positive recognition of what you do. If they actually do thank you today, you will be wrong tomorrow. When a supervisor can raise her voice at an employee and tell them to shut up in front of other employees and donors, yet there is nothing done, there is a problem. It has been vocalized that this is a good job to have if you don't have kids. This is the environment at the Harrisonburg Virginia Biolife."
bad,"Working as apart of the relief Team it has given me fantastic insite in to how the company works. My role and job differs from each site that i have worked in, and it is this that keeps my job so intesting."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work at Baxters. unless you are someone's favorite you are basically trash. They are not fair with their promotion system if they don't like you they don't care about you.
bad,ambiente molto dinamico e competitivo. Internazionale
bad,"I enjoyed working with many different engineers on a daily basis, some of which were much more impressive than others.  I learned a great deal about how a product (in this case, medical infusion devices) goes through the design/development stage to finished product, from both mechanical and electrical engineering standpoints.  It was quite a rewarding experience to be an active player in the end result."
bad,"le personnel en cdi est très désagréable et regarde les intérimaires de haut."
bad,Company does not focus in improving productivity or their employees. Most focus falls on meeting timelines instead of being prepared and engaged in the work.
bad,Position was not treated fairly due to location in Company buildings. Was treated like I was in the Manufacturing shift Teams when I was corporate. Colleague with same job did not give same respect
bad,Equipment not being repaired properly. Starting to make us work holidays in addition to every other weekend. No chance for advancement unless you are friends with management. Understaffed so employees are overworked and underappreciated.
bad,"A typical day was travel to the customer and repair or perform preventative maintenance. Travel could be from 1-5 hours one way. there typiacly was not support from issues dealing with customers and the reps from Baxter, the customer is always correct no matter what. You learned time management and inventory management however the latter was not a good system to use. The culture was much you were on your own, working by yourself. The hardest part was again the lack of support. Most enjoyable was meeting new people and making good friends."
bad,"Initially a great place to work but this soon changed. Wanted so much work completed, workload was not achievable and the pressure from management was relentless. I started as a maintenance technician but ended up a pen pusher managing contractors. Concerns weren't listened to and mistakes happened. They forced me out and did this in a really nasty way."
bad,"Outside of the supply chain customer service area, the company is great. As a customer service rep, even as a CPhT, it is extremely difficult to move up and out to an enjoyable department."
bad,"It was fun with the team, a lot of hard work. My manager did not ever message me back about available working hours I could have so that's how I 'left' the job."
bad,Unfortunately during my time in the Chemistry department I felt that the lab was badly managed and the staff were over worked. They were under staffed for about a year before a left. There is also a one rule for one and one rule for another going on within the department. I felt very unappreciated
bad,"Most of the people are friendly and polite. I met a lot of nice people, learned a lot and enjoyed my job. To bad the management is acting weird under the pressure. If they are asked to get rid of some people, they will create false reviews, and start generating evidence against you. The performance improvement plan is designed to get rid of you, not to help you to improve. If you get one, you better start looking for a new job."
bad,"A very enjoyable job in my first ten years,however,the quality of upper management quality vastly decreased."
bad,I would not recommend working for Baxter right now as they have a new CEO that is changing the landscape of the company and culture in a negative direction.
bad,No handphone signal available in office and production floor. Office is located deep inside the building and far far away from the canteen.
bad,"I was a hard working engineering and projects manager looking after 4 sites.  Seven day weeks were not uncommon, neither were 60/70 hours per week, sometimes more.  Striving for process improvement does not sit well with the business culture, which is way behind some of it's rivals.  Lack of vision, and poor/non-existent upper management leads to many front line managers and production operatives suffering stressful, long hours."
bad,"I was still not that long from school when i joined baxters. A typical day would see you go the locker room and put on your overalls, hairnet and wellies. You would then swipe in to start work and assemble at your assigned food line to start the day."
bad,Lots of changes coming with recently announced split of company
bad,"Co-workers are helpful which is good because there is NO formal training for the job I had. Management dictates budget with NO regard to what really needs to be done. Management are NOT leaders and do not help when issues are escalated to their level. Management ""massages"" data/information each time it goes up the ladder so Executive Management thinks everything is going fine (when it clearly isn't)."
bad,Baxter has great benefits but feel they do not value there employees. Overall the schedule is great and most people there are friendly. Benefits on the first day are a plus side
bad,"Read the fine print carefully, do your own research about the company and how they treat the drivers more or less. This is a very physical job that includes stairs at apartments/in patients homes on daily 10 hour grind depending on the weather/location near you. A little insight, equipment as provide(1) non powered dollie @ company max boxes (7) around 25lbs to 30lbs, and (1) battery powered dollie @ company max boxes (8) around 25lbs to 30lbs. Lastly if your looking for a place/job for some type of functional management/dispatch or work friendly environment that seems like rental situation via working out of as a service specialist  rest assured your in the right place."
bad,"The job can be very stressful when you are not trained properly and the workers have poor communication skills. Moreover, when you are not accustomed to working around a lot of supervision. Also, the hardest thing is understanding your job security."
bad,"Baxter used to be a wonderful company and place to work.  With new CEO and new GC and other leaders and top talent leaving in record numbers, it is no longer the Baxter it used to be.  CEO will fire you to set example.  While he talks about ""failing fast"" and learning from mistakes, in reality, there is no room for failure.  Senior leaders are fired even when they have bee highly successful for years.  People in management and in regular roles are miserable and everyone is stressed."
bad,"Instead of properly staffing departments, they rely on mandating employees to work 12 hr swing shifts to cover vacant positions due to frequent medical absence and poor hiring practices. Also be expected to work 6 days a week due to poor performance of production equipment. Many employees have fake medical excuses to have unlimited time off, only making matters worse for those honest employees left to cover their absence. The company itself boasts precautions for safety, but unless observations are in a location that is immediately visible, management drags its feet on making changes and implementations. A place that truly sees you as ""a dime a dozen"" simply because you are paid and are ""lucky to have a job at all"", words that were actually spoken to me..."
bad,"Some mid/upper management best feel to motivate employees by publicly calling them out in departmental meetings."
bad,"fun employees, employer was very uptight and trash-talked about you behind your back. "
bad,"Loved learning my job..i had a great few folks who stood by my side during the ridiculous amount of bullying i along with a few others were the recipients of. I reported this SEVERAL times to my manager- which seemed to be a very nice man with a beautiful heart. The problem with him was he wanted to be friends versus a boss with everyone. He did not take my complaints seriously. I finally went to HR and they swept it under the rug and sent me back to work. The day i left was one of my worst there...bullying..laughing and snickering while i clearly needed assistance.  The PT guys both stood outside laughing thru the plate glass window while i struggled making me the joke on display. I walked out that day...now im reporting it to the EEOC. It was a 3 month long NIGHTMARE (bullying), loved the job."
bad,The company has a good atmosphere and management are fair. The hours can be very long. Deadlines can be hard to meet within working hours. There is very good opportunities for training.
bad,"Management confuse controlling staff with managing workloads."
bad,"I worked for Baxter for 28 years. For many years I felt like I was part of a family with friends and coworkers pulling together making a great team. A typical day involved preparing paperwork to fill work orders, fill inventory needs, and supply parts as needed."
bad,Promise of advancements but never happens. Work sucks back breaking and way too much for the money you get paid. Routing sucks never gives enough time
bad,Baxter used to be a good company to work for. Unfortunately the culture is becoming increasingly cut throat and aggressive. People are not treated with dignity and self-respect. Would not recommend it as a place to work especially under current leadership.
bad,company and culture does not allowing to give ideas as own business. poor leadership treats employees like they have no experience and does not and values employees
bad,"I seriously cannot stress enough how much you will be expected to work past your shift. The job isn't hard or bad, but it is a lot you have to put in."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. Yes, the pay and benefits are good, but the work itself is exhausting, the hours are terrible, its bad for your health and social life."
bad,"This place used to be a great work environment. Loved going to work every night/day. But all the changes that took place over the 11 years I worked there, made it a stressful act to even get ready to go in. They don't care about the workers. You work your butt off and don't even get a thank you. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians, so to speak. A lot of unfair treatment going on as well. When you treat people who have FMLA differently that you do other employees, that goes far beyond the line."
bad,"The company itself is an excellent company, good pay and benefits."
bad,"GREAT company"
bad,"Work late, not willing to teach for growth. Company had a very old manufacturing software which are very manual and slow. Lots of manual work need to be perform like entering manually the bill of materials."
bad,"Baxter was great early on in my career, but the company has a lot of uncertainty at the moment. If you are just starting out it is a great place due to the work place flexibility and good managers. Career advancement and development has all but vanished of late due to various squabbles."
bad,Stressful place to work. I was not happy with my manager. He did not work well with me or others. This was an issue as time went on and we did not get along.
bad,"Company has good products but poor marketing strategies,leading to a slow growth that available market need, need strong planning and marketing team for future success"
bad,"Good entry level work, can be distracting environment due to many differences in direction for employees. Can be toxic at times because of self entitled employees."
bad,"Rundown building, decreased quality of life for patients. CNA staff is excellent, high RN turnover and not enough time to spend with patients because too busy passing meds"
bad,Baxter is a huge business and you're literally a number there. Very high turnover rate due to poor management. Work is fast paced and can be stressful.  Benefits and pay are good. Worst part about Baxter is the people.
bad,A few months in to me working for baxter a brand new planet manager came into the picture and pushed ungodly hours on everyone. I worked an eighteen hour shift for them and they treated us like work horses.
bad,"training non adeguato"
bad,"nice and good people to work with,meeting new people everyday and good managemnet all d time and well productuve people to wor with,with great mind and creativity"
bad,"Constant pressure to produce big production numbers. Quality not important."
bad,Results are the bottom line expectation with this company.
bad,I enjoyed working for ups it was a nice place to work the people were good folks that you want to be around every day.
bad,was made fun of and cried nightly in the bathroom every lunch break because coworkers were stressful. when i notified my superiors they did nothing avout the situaton.
bad,High demand for output. Discipline was harsh and no room for error. Management does not take into consideration the open accountability of issues that could affect the company financially.
bad,"Baxter has great people working there but if you want a life i would advise people to not go to 2nd shift. Second shift will have lots of OT. LOTS. 1st and 3rd will too but not all the time. When i work at baxter I either choose work or work. It never feels like I get to go home. Also, we work every other Saturdays so about 5-6 days a week but about 8-12hours a day. NO LIFE. BUTT I love the people there. Friendly and kind. If you are singe and looking for money then do it!! But if you have a family it will be more difficult but not impossible."
good,You work as a temp and they don't hire you and then throw you out at the end of the year with all the other temps when the plant closes just be prepared for surprises
good,"I would plan & prepare the supper. "
good,"Baxter requires you to work 12 days on 2 days off which takes away from family time. Pay is based on your operator level (each year it goes up) but if you get to many NCRs you cant get a pay raise. Baxter is not a family friendly company, if you are a single parent looking for ways to raise children this place is not for you. no sick days, has a lot of favoritism. Mixed culture but not really favorable to them. "
good,"Baxter has changed their total dynamic on how they do business."
good,"Trabaje en ella durante 12 años y en general todo muy bien pero en el aspecto de compromiso con personas con discapacidad o incapacidad laboral es pésima."
good,"Very difficult to work."
good,"Carga laboral muy alta, no hay balance vida familiar y laboral, gran escuela para aprender sobre el trabajo integral pues en mi cargo no solo tengo responsabilidad de marketing si no comercial, logística, entrenamiento etc."
good,never learned much job procedures were always changing by higher management; several employees always did what they wanted and never repremanded for their mistakes; others blamed for their mistakes. Hardest part of the job lifting the packages and dealing with bad management my part of the job never could please upper management.tend to cover up mistakes
good,"Working here has many good points but also many negative points. One they do give us paid vacation, sick and 401k. Most of the co-workers are pleasent to work with. Bd side is management treats you more like a number than an individual. Getting yearly raises is next to impossible and moving up in the company is very hard."
good,I try to make all my days good. How to operate different machines and break them down and fix them. Management was some what difficult. The same every where. There was no hard part. Just having one.
good,"Stressful work environment, no growth opportunities, no team players, very competitive and high expectations with no appreciation "
good,"I went through 3 interviews, I let them all know I don't mind over time however, they said SOME OVERTIME not CRAZY OVERTIME. If you need to make a lot of money and do not mind not having ANY LIFE... Then its a great place."
good,Upper management seemed to overlook that their employees are the ones that make the day to day activities go smoothly. A little recognition once in a while would have gone a lone way.
good,I enjoyed my time at Baxter’s. It is a truly great company to work for. They treat all employees as equals and they make sure that all product sent out the door are up to code and nothing less than perfect.
good,"From my own experience and talking to people who had previously worked there, outsourcing is a constant with Baxter. When layoffs were announced, the people who remained were close personal friends of the managers."
good,Do not expect to be respected like an adult and do not expect human resources to handle your issues in a timely manner. Everyone above your immediate supervisor is selfish and cold.
good,Didn't like the people that was in charge on my shift. People there had no chill and would stab you in the back as fast as they could. I personally didn't fit in.....
good,"Conduct laboratory bench and pilot plant scale protein purification studies, including sample collection,"
good,"The new management team had a poor workplace culture.  Had to work 7 days a week.  The Senior management team was inflexible, and was completely date driven."
good,They recycle people. they hire and fire people every day. No job security. It would be decent but they lack communication and organization overall. no benefits
good,Baxter's management is very poor at communication to employees. The stress level is very high.  No matter how hard you work you never reach production goals. Mandatory seven day work weeks are a bummer.
good,The pay and benefits were excellent. The company exhibits a value towards the employees family. The corporate headquarters provivded a tremendous amount of information and training to help employees perform and advance. However the local managers did not share the same training opportunities that the corporate office promised to me when hired.
good,I am talented and always available to assist those who need help.  I am willing to expand my knowledge-base that I have attained throughout the years.
good,"I was placed in Baxter Healthcare through an agency as a temp. The role was as a data entry operator, entering medical supply orders for the major hospitals around Country and Regional NSW. The accuracy was of the upmost importance because of the type of medical supplies being ordered ie morphine etc. "
good,no recommedations
good,Benefits and pay are awful. Management and awful. Training is awful. Office smells and needs updating. Workload is ridiculous and your penalised for not working fast enough.
good,I worked far away and several days I would be sent home because of lack of work. There was a  lot of favoritism for the senior employees. truly not enough amount of pay for the paper work that you have to do in order to even work for them
good,"I will not say it's a bad place to work. Actually it's has almost everything you could possibly dream of if you are mechanically inclined. My problem with this company was that of supervisory and management. Besides that, it is an awesome facility like no other."
good,They say all the right things to get you in the door but once you are in unless your in the click your not going anywhere. The supervisors and the assistant supervisors are nothing more than a bunch of puppets.  I honestly believe the superintendents have to use a GPS to get from home to work every day.
good,"Main issues are higher-ups. Communication and organization between shifts and levels of management is a nightmare. HR and medical staff blatantly could care less about employees, and are only there to save the company money. Do not expect this company to have your best interests in mind, they will sacrifice your health and sanity if it suits them. Expect to be treated as an asset, not a person."
good,"Need to offer room for advancement. Alot of chiefs, not enough Indians.  This place does pay decent,  but they expect your life in return.  I understand you have to work,  but id rather go bak to school than continue here."
good,"Baxter is struggling due to too much internal processes and focus on Office politics. Processes that add no value to the customer need to be cut or reduced. "
good,"for being a long standing, seemingly stable company, it was not.  I was able to manage work-life balance, but there's clearly a management culture that isn't the best."
good,"But very hard when your higher ups make it hard for you and treat you like you gum on the bottom of their shoe, but it was a full time good paying job so I took and took being bullied"
good,i like working there but the manage team does not back you  if some thing comes up  like med  need on the job and will not help you throw it.  the job was great and i think they need to look at there management team.
good,"Responsible for supporting all licensing functions but contacting all customers via letters or phone calls in obtaining current licenses for product shipments.  I was also promoted to Customer Master Specialist which this role required daily interactions with internal and external customers via various communication methods.  I was able to answer customer questions, facilitate necessary research and resolve issues throughly and accurately.  In this role I worked with Baxter internal customers to resolve our customer issues and worked with Business Operations, Sales, Credit and Collections, Customer Service and others."
good,"overall I enjoyed my time at Baxter. The staff are extremely friendly, almost like a family. However the hours were very long and there was a lot of overtime involved, making it hard to plan out of work activities."
good,"It's difficult working for a company that doesn't recognize its employees for the hard work they put in.  I'm good at my job, rarely call in sick, have no disciplinary or performance issues, and I have a bachelors degree, yet after four years, I'm still stuck in a low level manufacturing position.  All of my attempts at moving forward with my career have been thwarted, and no one will tell me why.  The sad truth is, unless you are related to someone in a higher-up position, you shouldn't expect to move up very far"
good,"Needs improvement to management, they need to be more knowledgable about the floor operations and also need to think their decisions through more thoroughly"
good,"i worked here over three years ago, management and company name have changed it would be unfair to write a review."
good,"Baxter is a very large healthcare manufacturing company which comes with a lot of very convoluted problems.  It is a great place for someone starting a career, but I found it frustrating as time passed."
good,Cadences trop soutenues manque cruel de temps pour un bon contrôle des produits. Ne tiens pas en compte  les remarques à  ce sujet. Mot d'ordre PRODUCTION PRODUCTION PRODUCTION.
good,"Micro managed, hard to move up, repetitive work.  Have to work all holidays and bilingual people have the worst hours bc they are needed more.  Overall happy to move on."
good,it is a who you know place to work to get what you want. Management is known for FAVORITISM!!!! To many people that comes in trying to tell everyone what to do and they are not trained properly. they want Quantitee over Quality.They don't appreciate the older employees and the ones that really do all the work.
good,ok pay but lots of stress and pressure. large territories. people are generally friendly but management can be hard to deal with at times. The products are in a very competitive market and priced quite high while quotas are high too
good,"- Long days, including weekends"
good,"Great people and company, just wasn't the right fit for me culturally.  No independent thinking was allowed, mostly cubical work. Very few chances for advancement."
good,"Working for this company involved long hours an stressful situations on a daily basis. Fast turnover with employees and management, situations change in the blink of an eye. It is always a good day when you are helping others and making a difference in peoples lives."
good,"a typical day was very fast paced. The main thing I liked were the clients and learning new things. The management was very young."
good,"Baxter, formerly Gambro, was an excellent company to work for before but after the acquisition the focus was on making greater quantities of product and not on making a quality product."
good,"Typical day at work was very busy,dealing with lots of customers,their needs and complains."
good,This is a manufacturing company.  The innovation and R&D function has been effectively dismantled.  New products are tweaks to existing products.  This is a great company for spinoffs and divestitures.
good,"A very driven and forward-moving company, but employees have been reduced to ""numbers"" and profit seems to be the primary focus. Hesitant to accept solutions that fall outside of established guidelines."
good,"Rota is very flexible which was helpful for myself whilst my studies were taking place,"
good,"Upper management has no backbone and is very ""closed off."" With Cleveland being a small town, if you didn't grow up here, your chances of advancement are slim to none. Upper management refuses to make the changes needed to ensure that  the Cleveland location does not fail. They have no accountability for themselves and will not fix issues that are brought up multiple times to them. Then, when approached about an issue, they deny ever being notified and still do not rectify the situation. There is a very ""grade -school"" like mentality with the leadership and it is very unprofessional. "
good,"Learned lot about clinical activity"
good,"If in production and good at your job was not allowed to advanced."
good,"Very much no work/life balance. A stable place to work to retire from, have to know people to get in and move up in ranks."
good,New managers get no support and general personnel run the culture.
good,"Managed a team of hosptial Sales reps from Chicago/Texas-California. Call points were the ICUs in the key accounts. MDs, Midlevels and Pharmacists"
good,"The most difficult part of working for this company is the lack of room for advancement. However, I love the people I work with and the family- like atmosphere."
good,"I will never recommend anyone to work as a quality lab associate, this means that you will work for the worst manager on the planet.. Other positions within the company would be much better. Never any growth nor personal development."
good,This is a company still caught in the old trying to dress as new. It has a lot of challenges ahead but there are a lot of really good people in there to face those challenges. There is a huge amount of energy in the company and for those that enjoy being pushed its a great place but very political still.
good,"I worked there for almost 8 years.  I was nervous to leave because I knew I would miss many of the people, but would not go back."
good,recently got into this company they didn't require interview to be hired. lots of nice people although the contract lasts a year to be converted into a permanent position
good,"The drama that goes on at Baxter is unbelievable management does not care they sit on their bottoms and let it happen. if someone doesn't like you, they can get you fired. despite what others may say there is favoritism with the higher-ups and the workers. everyone will speak bad on your name. . dont trust anyone and keep to yourself . you do that youre  better off . i could go on but here are some of the major issues."
good,"Ca qui me plait le plus dans ce site, ce sont les personnes qui y travaillent, compétentes et passionnées par leur mission et fières de leur contribution à la santé."
good,Management was awful to many chiefs that weren't even qualified for the position of management yet they were management young kids with authority and it went to their heads supervisors never around when you need them always in the cafeteria talking and laughing while employees working. To many accidents on the job and the facility looked clean yet mold under the belts that the IV Bags ran on filling room had dust and mold in the filters and nothing was done about it the tanks of which the IV Fluid flowed through had many spiders and little bugs flow through it and that could cost someone their life considering they were selling to Hospitals and Dialysis patience for nasty infected  IV Bags.
good,"Work culture is pleasant and people at the site are friendly and helpful. Good entry level position for people who want to transition from academia to industry. However, not very competitive with respect to salary or innovation. Work can feel routine or mundane for individuals with advanced degrees."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting with the repair of the Baxter infusion devices, which could involve a number of jobs or tasks depending on the position."
good,"Baxter's a good place to work, but the salary is less than someone would need to survive in the present time. However, the supervisors are trying their best"
good,"A place where one can learn a lot about manufacturing and general business but not a place for technical learning.  Objectives were not specifically defined.  As such, it was difficult to understand how one moves up the ladder."
good,"Baxter overall is a nice company to work for.  The management team picks their favorites and helps for advancement that way.  It is not based on your work ethic. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work from home.  However, we have constant over time 3-5 days per week that is mandatory, and you're punished if you can not work the overtime if something comes up important. Employees are not valued as much as they should be valued.  Definitely different cultures depending on your department"
good,It was a great job at first but I was supposed to have help but it did not happen. Really over worked in the rework room. It was a job that you never could catch up on and be ahead especially for one person.
good,I personally didn't enjoy my time there. Lots of groups based mostly in people that lived in the same county as the factory. I lived a hour away so I had leave home at least one and half hours before work. Took 15 minutes to get all the sanitary gear on.
good,"Typical day would include 8 to 10 hour shifts, very moderate work environment and repetitive work. Ability to learn a lot of new things if you work hard."
good,There is little work life balance in the job.  If you are Ok with 50-60 hour weeks with no end in site then this is the place to work.  The work conditions are great but the senior leadership team wants everyone to work as short handed as possible and keep production running.  The burn out rate is high and the give a darn has run out with a lot of the employees.
good,"Word Class Company ,Good place to work and great product , Nice culture but not focused . People centrist company and give time to learn and deliver . HR is strong ."
good,"Good corporate sustainability, but a typical big company that often hides incompetence in the web of the greater organization."
good,"high turnovers, bad management  sums up the atmosphere at Baxter. HR and management needs a complete overall to boost morale in the company."
good,"Most people were friendly, but stuck in their ways. Weak management because they were not empowered to make decisions."
good,"Baxter started re-structures last year that could have and should have been handled much differently. End result there is no job security. How can a company ask you to dedicate yourself 100% to a place, when they are not returning the favor? Job seniority means nothing to Baxter. It could be a very profitable and stable business."
good,Très bonne entreprise mais qui néglige les règles. Ne prennent que des jeunes productifs.
good,Since I started working for Baxter in 2007 the work life balance is very low. If you like overtime you should definitely not have a problem getting it at Baxter. The pay is decent for the area and economy.
good,"there really is no typical day. I have learned that I can do whatever they put on me, but it seems to not do any good. Love my coworkers but management is basically a joke in the fact that you do the job and never even receive a thank you and only certain people who are friends or family have any hope of moving up in the company, regardless of whether they have a degree or not. The job is not hard. It seems overwhelming at first but once you take the time to learn and know what it is that you are doing it is not hard at all."
good,"When I worked at Baxter, the company was going through a financial hardship and it was not a good experience, in the work environment. As a pharmaceutical company, has a lot of challenge that make the day by day work very active, and gave me the experience of negotiation to convince of the benefits provided by each department in the company."
good,Management does not work with people very well. I have learned a lot being employed by Baxter that could be very beneficial at another company.
good,"Overall, Baxter is a decent place to work, really depends on the area you are in.  It seems they've lost the focus on coaching and developing their resources and are willing to outsource any work based on cost alone."
good,"Recent restructuring occurred in the fall of 2015 with almost 10% reduction in headcount. No job security. Low morale. The company has lost/spin off its hemo business. What's left with Baxter now is not as quite profitable as the hemo business. Therefore, future profit is cloudy and fierce competition from the medical device industry as a whole."
good,the pay is really good for the work that you do. I was trained well and started working after training under a week. but had to wait several weeks to be trained. it seemed to me as work progress that they just hired anyone off the streets. the turn over rate is not that impressive. I did however have a nice group of people to work with and it made the work day fly. the management system however is a mess. the communication between shifts is not there. so the animosity between the shifts was out of hand not at fault of the assemblers.
good,"Lot of diversification and level of transparency is require in Baxter. The family life is totally disturb in terms of Baxter work pattern at the same time need to give empowerment to the employee as per his/her job role, which is very important to grow any organization."
good,"shop was dirty, employee turn over, insurance didn't cover anything"
good,"Synovis is an excellent place to work."
good,"Entreprise qui paie très bien mais qui n'a pas une bonne politique."
good,You learn a lot about FDA regulations and following procedures.
good,"Baxter is a stressful work environment in which you have to deal with a multitude of ambiguity. Process/Tools/Organization structure is changing constantly, and its a very difficult environment to learn while getting a grip on whats came across as new in the past few weeks."
good,"It’s not well organized. We fall behind because of equipment failures/issues. Mandatory Saturday workdays. Twice a month. Mandated last minute, sometimes as you’re getting ready to leave. Mandated to come in early or stay late on average twice a week"
good,"Not given chances to develop "
good,At this position I learned a great deal.  I got hands on experience with phlebotomy and enjoyed working with the other phlebotomist.  I got plenty of practice that helped when moving forward in my medical career.
good,"Was a good company overall, but once they decided to shut down in Denver, moral went down.  We worked 4 10 hour shifts, with Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays off.  If they hadn't shut down, I would still be working there."
good,Facility is outdated. Had to make due with what we had. Meet a lot of great friends there that I still keep in touch with. Not sure where the company is now. Heard it was bought out.
good,"I was sent home constantly so I wasn’t able to pay my bills. Manager wouldn’t work around my court dates, or around my family vacations. The pay and benefits were amazing, but the hours were difficult. There was no communications throughout the plant."
good,"No lo recomendaría, es un mal ambiente laboral, rechazo al no ser de cuernavaca, muy notoria la discriminación, no hay oportunidad para mejorar nada, ni dar opiniones"
good,Everyone that I had contact with was very nice but the work I was doing was very tedious and boring. I tried to move into a different position but it didn't work out so I finally left.
good,"Like every other company these days they have lost site of employee appreciation. They rate on a bell curve system, so if you have 5 team members that work great together and they are equally hard working and reliable it doesn't matter because one of them will be at the top, one of them the bottom and the rest somewhere mid level. Even when a person is rated with high performance on their review they may be lucky to see a 2% increase, which most of the time isn't equivalent to the average cost of living hike."
good,"A day at work meant long hours. I learned that there is nothing more important than your health and if you are over-worked, it will take it's toll on your health."
good,Good place to work. I met lots of interesting people. The money and benefits were good. The managers were very professional and thorough. The hour's suited me
good,The pay and benefits are great but the work environment and management needs work. The kitchen food is way overpriced and some people need a better attitude and need to care more about the work they are doing.
good,"Good place to work, great colleagues.  Salary not comparable to other companies, especially living in the Bay Area.  Not pleased with restructuring in group leading to layoffs."
good,Baxter has it's ups and downs. Training is poor and when they are under pressure that is the worst. Some days are better than others but communication is not well rounded throughout. Seems everyone is out for themselves instead of Team oriented.
good,I have learned a lot about quality management/procedures and how production works. I have been a Quality Technician field for 3 years. I work a 12 hour schedule and work every other weekend. The best part of the job is my co-workers. We are a great team.
good,"okay to work there, but you have to corner management to get a comment on your work.  There wasn't really any advancement for a contract driver other than to agree to everything management wanted in order to become a company driver."
good,"i work close to 70+ hours weekly and have little to no time off at all every single week. i constantly get forced to work excess overtime on my ONLY day off (sunday). terrible managerial communication and direction. and most importantly you are just a number in their eyes, not a human being."
good,Employees were not held to a standard that made it a comfortable place to work. They were allowed to treat unfairly even when training other employees.
good,"Company has made several changes regarding compensation and benefits."
good,"Low rating is more reflective of recent changes within a particular department.  Baxter International, overall, would receive a higher rating as a top rated company to work for."
good,"working in Baxter India pvt. ltd.gives me opportunities to learn the process in the LVP  (large volume parental) sterile parental formulation plant."
good,I worked in the Validation area performing validation on equipment. I've worked here in the LA area as well as the IL area. for over 25 +years. performing in areas validating autoclave e to Steam In Place equipment.
good,"Every day had brought a new challenge, people were great, management was trying new ways and that required a lot of training and understanding of the new processes."
good,Great company yet the job security is little to none.Lack of strong leadership and structure within certain departments.
good,"Gained 6 years of Administration coordinator. "
good,"I would find out what line I was running, then I would talk to the groupleader from the shift before to see if there were problems on the line or anything had changed from the last time we had ran the product. I learned everything was subject to change and to deal with it. I had to deal with several personalities at once and keep them happy and working. The hardest part of the job was learning the new changes with very little training. I enjoyed working with the operators and running the line."
good,"Very nice company, but career progression is dependent on ever changing leadership - tough to plan!"
good,"Hectisch i.v.m. inkomende telefoontjes, omdat ik perfectionist ben en zo goed mogelijk mijn werk wil doen merkte ik dat door de werkdruk dit soms ten kosten ging van mijzelf."
good,"The work involves analyses and certification of reference standards for worldwide distribution.  Job responsibilities includes method development, validation and transfer, data validation, process review, technical writing, quality control/assurance, database management, inventory control and statistical evaluation.  Some jobs require project management,  coordination of services and professional presentations."
good,"It was a great experience for me to work in a environment where they make products for the hospital. When I first started, I made great friends with some of my co-workers,and the workers that already worked there made me feel welcome."
good,Its okay. as long as there is work to be done. Very hard work. Meet new people everyday.
good,I was in Renal Peritoneal Dialysis supply delivery. I loaded 26' straight truck and delivered dialysis supplies to in-home patients suffering from kidney failure.
good,I trained and help others develop the skills I’d obtained from Baxter. The benefits were good but working on 3rd shift for 5 plus years was not for me but overall a good company for those who need an off shift job.
good,"Enjoyed working there , plenty of work ,  good benefits good pay clean break rooms clean bathrooms air-conditioning heating most managers were very nice and helpful ."
good,"Baxter is going the way of outsourcing many positions in pharmacovigilance. They are continually trying to do more with less. Compensation and benefits were decent at Baxter, but no advancement opportunities."
good,A typical day work can be stressful Management has no concerns for employees When problems arise. The Company  in Opelika A has a since for favortism among employees. Management does not stick together with their assistants. No cost of living raise. HR is very poor in seeing about employees needs employees have to figure out an solve this themselves when HR is need on a regular basis they just give us a 1-800 number to solve problems.
good,"the daily work life is filled with meetings; working hours are quite flexible."
good,everyone out for themselves. Very secretive.  No trust. If you want to like your co-workers this is not the place for you.Going out of your way to help others is frowned upon.
good,"Good work/life balance. Unfortunately, there is little upward mobility and the management population is not properly trained. Employees rarely have good mentorship relationships or sponsors for development."
good,"Overall, it's a stable  place to work. Not enough African Americans are in leaderahip roles. The planet needs better up.keeping such as the parking lot on the South side. Pot holes every where and cameras need to be working on the outside as well for safety reasons. There needs to be equal opportunity when hiring temps because ai was once temp before hired as a full time employee and it took almost 2 years to become full time. In closing I enjoyed my job while full time but when I became part time it took a turn for the worst. Working 12 hours on my feet and every weekend for 2 years due to me being in Grad. School. There were some flexibility but not much because I had class on some Saturdays and Inhad to miss work without pay and received a point."
good,If Baxter would benchmark itself with its competitors I’m use it would better compete and retain talent.  The company has a bad reputation when it comes to retaining minority talent.  Strong business lines that are critical to healthcare systems continue to help the company succeed.
good,"Working for Baxter was challenging and exciting , however I wish the management had better communication with each other and their employees. A typical day was conducted very structured and professional. I did not agree with the removal of experienced technicians with temporary employees for less pay and no benefits."
good,"Environnement de travail agréable, mais pas de possibilité de contrat (travail intérimaire)"
good,Baxter is a very good organization for people who are ready for challenges and ready to take initiatives Baxter Culture believes in grow within and provide opportunities to groom your career.
good,todo muy bien hasta que se fusiono pasamos a ser un numero es lo que senti
good,"Significant changes occurred during my tenure.  While the changes themselves were often challenging to manage through, it was the PACE of change was most difficult part. Leadership changes, policy changes (including the freezing of the pension plan), systems changes and job duty changes--oh my!"
good,"Management gets away with questionable behavior and HR ignores it or retaliates against employees who speak up. "
good,"Having problems finding its identity.  Too much like a cult, sort of inbred, physically isolated location, too stressful and unwelcoming to newcomers."
good,"You’ll find Baxter’s products and therapies on nearly every floor, in every department, in almost every hospital worldwide.  Patients and providers rely on Baxter for lifesaving renal and medical products, including intravenous (IV) solutions, systems and administrative sets, IV infusion parenteral nutrition, perioperative care, pharmacy devices and software, acute renal care, and home and in-center dialysis."
good,My job was to fulfill orders on a daily basis.there was a lot of work so we stayed over ever night. Helped with receiving and stocking. Allot drove forklifts pallet jakes cherry picker.
good,"- Over 25 site projects (Major projects)"
good,Initially loved working here but unfortunately a high staff tirn over made short staffing an issue and this lead to having to work extra shifts and it becoming a lot harder work. But this job gave me a lot of experience amd training.
good,My job was self-motivating which I enjoyed. At many times I was more knowledgeable than management. I was often in charge of training new employees. The. Job did allow me to use my time management skills which I liked. The work force culture was somewhat adequate intolerable.
good,"Baxter France est pleine mutation."
good,I work 12 hour shifts in the mixing department which is a strict department. some of the smallest mistakes can get you fired. the management of Baxter if fairly poor due to in-experiance of mostly new collage grads.
good,"Working with Baxter is very prestigious, you get to know and work with the top notched people in healthcare industry."
good,"Baxter is a good company. They provide good benefits, time off.  Ability to work from home, Work-Life balance.  I was able to work at Deerfield and Round Lake locations."
good,"An important company in the Dialysis and medical devices sector, but workload is not well balanced, typically I am always willing to provide an extra support in order to reach project goals, but workload is so intensive for so little resource."
good,"Most people start out as a temp to hire position, you do not get to choose where you want to work.  after they hire you they move you from the job that you finally can do well.  They put you where ever they want to.  Quite a few manager's looking over one type of product line are rude, blame people for different flaws in the product even though the line is running as fast as it can.  If they would just slow down just a little bit their quality would improve quite a bit.  They move you to other places to work because the line you work on does not need the same amount of people for each type of product the are doing that day.  Main plant manager tries to find some where to work or he will offer you a 98 which where you can leave with out it counting against you."
good,I have spent nearly 3 years working for baxter storey and can say it was a good experience but i am ready for a new challenge and lease of life.
good,"- Baxter has a very diverse group of talented individuals."
good,"Good place to work but no job security or job advancement opportunity. "
good,i really dont know what to say about this company but i have to say something.otherwise i cant do this anymore. Seriously More? How many words do i have to write.
good,"Most hours spent in company office"
good,"se trata de tener una reunión del grupo de trabajo para ver las prioridades en general, planificar internamente todas las tareas. Por está razón se hace más fructífero todo conocimiento nuevo o tarea desde gestionar con un proveedor hasta calibrar una pipeta eppendorf."
good,Gain a lot of experience during my time at Baxter. Allows development if you're willing to take on greater roles and responsibilities.
good,"This is a good first job to accept directly out of school, but it is a stepping stone position and has very poor retention due to the monotonous nature of the work. Baxter uses the promise of upward development to lure people into this position, but there is very little opportunity to move on from this career within the company. It is a very good start for someone interested in a future in quality, but a trap for those interested in design."
good,"1-Passion de l’innovation et de la"
good,Delivering medicine on time  and making patient & Doctor happy was the best part in the Job
good,Work is centered on applying an ethical approach to developing and maintaining the highest quality life-saving devices
good,"I have started my career in as a HRBP role with some assigned roles in staffings, to now a HR Specialist, responsible for staffing for the Manufacturing Grp in Baxter. With this staffing role assigned in about 1.5 yrs ago, I have a HR assistant reporting directly to me, to assist me in handling of Direct Labour recruitment."
good,"Bon environnement de travail"
good,Delivered dialysis solution to home dialysis patients in the upper Midwest.  I learned compassion and sincere empathy towards people that had a life threatening illness.  Learned daily time management skills that I carry into my every day life.  This is a pretty solitude job - road warrior!!  Hardest part of my job was learning on any given day that a patient of yours would pass away.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing that the patients were so happy to see me on a regular basis and that I truly made a difference in their lives.
good,ma journée de travail consiste a la réception et expédition de matière première
good,I was treated fairly and encouraged to grow with the company. There were a lot of changes in management and it seemed like the focus was not always seen clearly by all.
good,"Not interested in commenting on the status of Baxter.  to be fair to the company, I have not worked at the facility in 8 years, the management has changed and I don't have any additional comments"
good,bonne ambiance et bonne cohésion d'équipe en 2/8 .
good,"Ok but stressful. Pay not in line with other companies. Management not a high enough standard, some most definitely not experienced enough to manage a team."
good,"Baxter hired me as a seasonal temporary worker. It was a black and white process. They met the demand of hire ons before I was even on site. I liked the job, but I wish I could've spent longer doing the work."
good,"Working there as a temp, we did most the work. No acknowledgement of good work and I was training new hires.They make broken promises of being hire full time."
good,"Over all  working with Baxter is ok as it’s expanding now but the culture transformation is not happening, due to which people are unable to perform accordingly."
good,"Great company, important work. Laser focused on shareholder return. Flattening out of organization under the current CEO leaves little by the way of career advancement opportunities.  Development programs recently cut globally thereby killing channels for new talent. High turnover across businesses as of late."
good,"A typical day of work would be finishing up second shifts work.  Then clean up all the rooms and turn them around for the next day.  Fill up all the paperwork and finish all the computer set up and sign offs.  Lastly double check everything and make sure things are ready to get started in every room,  and sometimes we start the days work as well.  I learned how to use a computer workplace system and some paperwork, as well as learning how to use a electric pallet jack.  management was no good very unorganized.  workplace culture was everyone just complaining, bossing each other around and bickering with one another.  The hardest part of the job was setting some machines sometimes they would not corporate or want to work properly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was break and lunch time."
good,Buena empresa sin embargo algunas prestaciones ya no son competitivas y los procesos muy antiguos
good,fine place to work I like second shift company also had a well stocked cafeteria with reasonably priced salads and sandwiches there was also a lot of variety with this job
good,"everything was average. management was below average, culture was average. hardest part of the job was hard. the most enjoyable part of the job was enjoyable."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"Fast paced work in test engineering."
good,Overall this was a positive place to work but the climate was uncomfortable because of frequent lay offs and tenured employees who are afraid to loose their jobs are less likely to share information and teach you.
good,"I worked at Baxter for many, many years.  My position was unexpectedly eliminated and I was required to leave the facility immediately.  Less than 2 weeks later, a position, with a different title, in the same department, was posted on the Baxter careers website.  One full month after position elimination, contingent labor was hired to assist in the department where my position was eliminated.  This was all very disheartening, as I had dedicated my life to Baxter and Baxter's life saving work was so very important to me.  Other changes had been previously made that affected my, and others, feeling of security and longevity.  For the sake of the area, I hope Baxter continues to thrive.  It will not be good for the community if they do not."
good,Excellent place to work. Management plays a huge role in the bad side of this company. Each manager says and does as they please causing a ruckus. Going higher up the ladder never seemed to solve any issues either.
good,Checked ID bags for hospice use. I counted inventory or a daily base. I prepped and cleaned the area for the next shift. team corporation was needed on a daily base.
good,"A place to learn global business management.  Working with teams in regions and countries across the globe is a great learning experience. "
good,"Poor decision making, unexpressed leadership team."
good,Easy quota driven assembly work. Workplace culture going downhill as corporate becomes stricter as departments are slowly being relocated out of state. Layoffs and Hiring Freezes hinder promotion and staffing opportunities.
good,Was a decent place to work. Systems were outdated and the size of the organization made if very difficult to implement needed changes...................
good,"For the area this specific establishment is located the compensation for time worked is adequate. The benefits provided are health, dental, vision, and paid time off."
good,"Not a bad place to work. It is rated fairly highly in the general medical industry."
good,"My responsibilities include:  Preparing deserts and sandwiches for RBS clients, contractors and other customers that the company supplies products to, customer service in the RBS Gorgaburn restaurant, cleaning, checking stock, paper work, answering telephone calls, training new staff and agencies that come to assist in busy periods."
good,A typical work day at Baxter was really about getting your work done and making sure to deliver results to the person you reported to.  I enjoyed working with the people.  My side of the company was bought out so we split.
good,"Baxter is overall a nice place to work. It is team oriented, good personnel, and a clean environment. They also give their employees the benefit to learn and progress within the company."
good,The company was great when I started.  It lost it's vision towards the end of my employment with them.  Baxter had a great pension program.  The plan is non existent now that the company became Shire.
good,Tôi đã học hỏi được rất nhiều điều từ công ty cả về chuyên ngành và và các kỹ năng mềm khác.
good,"The work place was always very cold, I worked third shift, I started out working in a vial tube inspection. This lasted for several months I then later on got to work on the lines. This is where I became qualified to set-up and operate the Vision counting system and the renester and the denester.  The work environment on the lines was not that bad, I really enjoyed this job while it lasted."
good,Company is undergoing a tremendous transition. Great deal of pressure at all levels of the company. Company has a great mission. Significant focus on near-term objectives.
good,"A typical work day consist of checking emails for the newest request on complaint investigations. Then on to New Product team meetings with review of documentation. Phone calls to identify new areas of focus and conflict resolution. "
good,"Global Software Leader for multi-platform Software for Medical Devices,Agile Scrum Master, Medical Device Software Process, Resource and Budget Management"
good,"maintenance department is a mess, the maintenance manager has no maintenance experience. Our maintenance department has already lost a few great long time trades and a great long time supervisor due to the maintenance manager. more trades will leave if the manager is not replaced."
good,It has been so long since I work at Baxter that my review would be of no value to any one who reads this. I am tired of Indeed asking me this for ever company
good,"great fun and geat work mates, just pitty it ended so short.  "
good,"Standard desk job, with opportunities for commission, but still lack of pay.  No room to adjust work hours, no paid time off, unfair expectations for employees at the same level."
good,Diversified environment. A good place to work but too far from my residence in Chicago. This is a fast pace manufacturing facility and has a 3 shifts work schedule.
good,Good work place. Corporate politics  exist. Executive level management not always polite in dealing with employees in public high level meetings. Was not thrilled at working at Baxter but I would work there back again.
good,Medical supply company that demands quality in all aspects of the operation. Being on top of your game is critical to your own success. Overall a good place to work
good,"Good Company, Good working standard Innovative idea and technologies, good culture to grow with your career."
good,It was a temporary job that lasted less than six months. The company was splitting and everyone was uncertain how things would shake out. My contract ended and I moved on to other opportunities.
good,this  company no longer exists . good  typical work day. Learned alot.  good management  good  culture. commute was the  hardest. Liked the  pretty drive.
good,"Baxter Healthcare is a great company, but there is little opportunity for job growth.  If you're looking for career advancement beyond what you were initially hired for, you're going to have a hard time finding advocates to help your career development."
good,go to the production lines do checks make sure paper work is in order . quality product is ran. complete quality trends and other paper work assist supervisor with exceptions
good,over all work wasnt bad if you could get along with the other temps. alot of cut throat people trying to get hired on that they are not teamworkers so go in knowing youll learn on your own. its not that hard of a job you just have to knwo how the machine works to because it runs on production and  the machines can be turned down to where its hard to meet production.
good,I worked 12 hour days at Baxter and it was a lot of paper work and information and know how to do it fast passes. there are three different room and they are all different things to do in it.
good,"Depends on who you work for or which group you work in."
good,I Enjoy working at Baxter Healthcare. The people are some of the nicest people you would want to meet. The typical work day is relaxed and fast pace at times.
good,good place to work and get to see other people from different areas. co workers become more like family and they have your back no matter what the situation
good,they usually don't care about the employee themselves mainly just sales and production aspect. had a temp agency and everything is running terrible. If you can handle constantly getting moved to a different area than this is for you.
good,The company is currently working towards a directive that will implement new strategies to make it an even better place to work over the next several years.
good,On average I work 8 hours a night. I build the filters for them to run the machines. My boss is excellent. I also enjoy working with the people that I work with. I'm just a little tired of my position in need to advance.
good,The best part of the job was that we had a lot of opportunity to learn and move around.  The changes with the new leadership brought about a culture of fear and saving your job vs.  doing the right thing for the company.  Two layers below the CEO is where this culture was developed and hence some very smart and productive people were handcuffed and became puppets.
good,I learned all of the warehouse tasks while working here. The workplace culture was friendly for the most part. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about people and working with them to complete assignments.
good,This was the place to be. Now under the Shire umbrella. We serve the patients and do everything according to cGMP and GDP operations. We are committed to ensuring product safety and we do it all for our patients.
good,"Great company to work for, good benefits and lots of tenured employees. Lots of team building events such as holiday parties, company picnics and luncheons"
good,"As a capper; wrapping pallets, cleaning, breaking down boxes, assembly management"
good,Need better organization on the management level. Plans and approaches to day to day operations is continually changing. Keeping track of the processes slows the work progress.
good,"Puoi riuscire a costruire validi progetti."
good,The facility's condition reflects the company's continuous efforts to maintain industry standard. It is obvious that a change in culture is brewing.The staff however express disdain and seem almost unconvinced.
good,"A company in process of many changes, which implies reduction of costs to optimize the investments. It is a good environment to obtain experience in structural downsizing."
good,The experience I had here after being hired as a temp was mostly positive. The down side was that there are a handful of long term employees who can make life hard for Temps and new hires. They know how to pull strings and they are generally untouchable. I was difficult to get trained. There is no formal training in place but the requirements for qualifying for different jobs are rigorous. Some tasks that you must qualify for do not happen very often so it is difficult to get qualified (experienced) in them with out some formal training program.
good,"High paying but slow moving.. Management has all been around for a long time, workplace culture is typical of big pharma, lots of egos in place."
good,gained a lot of experience there.  the environment is very business oriented.  fast paced and extremely busy.  baxter is pretty good to there employees as long as you go with their program
good,Good place to work out just wasn't for me. If u have a family u can definitely support them working here. Right now they are going through a transition so u may get laid off
good,"Providing healthcare products, long working hours, great responsibility pressure. Excellent coworkers. Sometimes, very insensible management. Satisfaction on helping people with health problems."
good,Closing Englewood Manufacturing Plant and re-locating Product manufacturing to out of state locations. Great place to work and I would remain if plant were to remain open.
good,"I loved the job, and workplace, Preparing reports and analyzing data. However after my contract ended they let me go.  I continue to review Baxter Jobs for the Data Coordinator to be posted because i truly loved the job."
good,"Good compensation and benefits.  Some organizations seem to really care about their employees.  Still, too much demand for high performance without providing the resources to enable performance."
good,Very goal oriented with metrics tied to work and quarterly quotas. A good training program in association with level of knowledge of products after completion.
good,Typical day start of taking calls from patient to place refill order for medication. Working closing with the nurses in the clinic to ensure that patient is receiving correct medication
good,"Reasonable working environment with reasonable supportive management. Reasonable of amount of work with few resources.  Regulated environment result in routine work on daily basis, lack innovation."
good,"Baxter Is a MNC Healthcare group which has it's branches in 68 countries all over the globe. It helps in developing many skills in an individual like ""Time Management, Documentation, Safety, etc"". The standard guidelines which are followed like US FDA & OSHAS add in grooming a way of working. "
good,"The hours are long and you work a lot of Saturdays but the people are good. If you get hired on the benefits are great. The schedule is ever changing and makes work difficult, but it is fulfilling."
good,A lot of procedures policies. Very boring looking at IV bags for particles. Not the job for everyone very hard not to fall asleep on the assembly line
good,"It was a very short term internship, lasted 5 months. I really enjoyed people, they were very friendly and supportive. On the other hand, particularly in my department there was a need of updated of an office, it just looked very sad and old and really opposite of motivating atmosphere."
good,"Great products, rewarding experience. Life saving products great people to work with, Enjoyable experience, commute from the city is trying at times"
good,"I have enjoyed working for Baxter Healthcare for eight years and the company has allowed me to grow in my field of interest.  "
good,Baxter is a fast paced production department of an infusion pump. Line workers are trained extensively for their position.
good,Productive environment but audit periods are the  toughest with lot of preparation and reviews going around.
good,During a typical day at Biolife we stayed very busy.  They describe the work to be similar to factory work. The work there was very repetitive and sometimes I would get bored because the work became to easy for me.  I was able to work with a wide variety of donors that made the day very interesting. I enjoy working with people and always had a great time with our donors.
good,"Clean well organized organization , good work culture , helped their employees succed . As good as most in the area."
good,"Journée typique : Matin         : Prélèvement échantillon"
good,"Performed tasks in SW engineering, SW Quality and Systems Engineering.  The opportunity to help in other roles if your tasks are complete."
good,"Good/solid place to work.  Great leadership, fun people."
good,"Don't come here on a contract. The change of getting permanent is very slim/small. The Canadian office in Mississauga is aggressively cutting costs extensively and hiring more contractors to save on costs/head count. People are being let go from management to analyst level especially in Finance. Many jobs are being outsourced to Costa Rica. Only join the company if you are offered a permanent job upfront. The next few years, the company will go through tough times with more massive cost cutting. If you have a choice to work at a more stable company, go for it. Don't come here unless this is your best option....Company is going through massive cost cutting, not adding head count but cutting head count instead!"
good,"Training program needs improvement.  Trainers lord their status over new hires and refuse to give out information unless the new person grovels.  If you complain, the managers will say that it's your fault for not showing enough initiative.  Training supervisors get paid a lot of money to do nothing at all."
good,This was just a temporary position. It snowed there too much. What took 20 minutes to work took over an hour and a half to get to. Other than the weather. The people there are great.
good,"A typical day at work: Support of other departmental staff in their procurement needs such as to guide them through an appropriate procurement exercise or negotiate a purchase price and Ts&Cs. Leading specific procurement projects within my spend categories - some periods spent at manufacturing sites."
good,I enjoyed working at Baxter.  There are a lot of good people there.
good,"This is a good company if you are in the right department/location.  Unfortunately, my location closed down."
good,This job has provided great opportunities to assist customer's with safe and productive operation of Baxter products. It is all about the patients' and their well being. 
good,"It's a good place to work, high community service focus, with a focus on saving and sustaining lives you really feel like your job means something"
good,"Good place to work, and an even better place to learn."
good,just depend on urself.
good,"This is the third time in the last 15 years that I have worked for a company I loved that was then acquired and subsequently lost everything that first attracted me to work there. HQ is working on a better PMO structure but with a strategy of growth through acquisition, it's hard to get caught up on common processes as there are constant integration activities going on. Hardest part of the job is the lack of structure from HQ and the lack of drive to get projects delivered. Also the slow bleeding of people leaving for other opportunities due to the limited opportunities and low morale. Love my co-workers and my immediate boss. All from the original company."
good,"Worked required to pack 1.,2,3 and 5 litre bags off hospital bags. most off workers was very good to work with. Hard bit off job was to put the bag into the bag sealer when the bags are coming down the line very quickly. The most enjoyable bit was when your working with some off your friends and you can have a good laugh."
good,To work and coordinate with all collige and managment and make continuos improvement on work place.
good,"I learned so much from baxter like MS-EXCEL, team work, presentation, how to work in hard times"
good,I have been inspired and challenged in this role and i am greatful for the opportunity.
good,I wasnt there long enough to give a review. It was nice the time I spent there
good,Many nationalities and languages in one company have only complicated team efforts. Constant misunderstandings.
good,Bra gäng och arbetsplats ; Bra arbetsmiljö och samarbete fungerar bra
good,"Rémunération motivante "
good,"It has it's good and bad points."
good,"Management whilst nice people are very keen to apply pressure to encourage advancement, which put me in a  position I wasn't comfortable with and as such I left."
good,Very good company to work for boss is very nice and will work with you on anyting lot of lifting physical work a little bit stressful I just did not want to be gone over the road for my family but I would recommend it to anybody that is single and likes to be on the road..and the guys you work for our great they will help you out on anyting...
good,"Good team, good training, but the work by itself was stressfull and not really interesting. "
good,Very busy. learned a lot. good management.good boss. good team leader. good culture.many friends. keeping your job. nothing to enjoy. work place.. not holiday..
good,Baxter is a good place to work and learn.I learned the value of proper change control. The workplace culture is good and there is team enviroment at Baxter.
good,"Overall, enjoyable place to work. Sit in computer chair all day doing work. The business like any has its issues. Excellent management for the most part. Good opportunities for advancement."
good,Visual Inspection summation....for two to three hours at a time you sit in a chair and wait as a tray of eight dialysis filters arrive via conveyor to your station. You pick up a filter with each hand...inspect filter for kinks in the threads of filter. Each tray has eight filters. When last filter is placed back on the tray it will move on to another phase of production while another tray of filters arrive to you. Process is then repeated. Two filters at a time. Monotonous and repetitive. Twelve hour shifts feel like twenty four. Easy work but mind numbing. Clean room environment with hair nets and coverall type clothing. Fifteen minute breaks. Thirty for lunch. 10 an hr to start a few years ago. May be more now. Just enough money to starve on.
good,Company going through new management (right from new CEO) and this is resulting in frequent restructuring and reduction in workforce. While benefits are great; employee morale is down due to constant change in priorities/ or management expectation.
good,"Always felt pressured, quantity over quality.  The best part was being able to work with my team, they made the day go by faster. Management isn't so great"
good,Employees were asked to work on a holiday but were not given holiday pay; some employees didn't work and were given the same amount as those that did work.
good,"Colleagues are always on the go, that makes working fun and enjoyable. The senior are helpful and always look out for the new staffs. It is a fast pace environment."
good,"I enjoyed working with my group,  We all worked together efficiently to build good products and in a timely manner to get it sent out on time.  Everyone was very cooperative"
good,Great! I enjoyed working there. Some people were friendly. I did not agree with everything that was done but I have to act like I did so I would not loose my job.
good,"Great pay and very nice work environment. Like many large companies in the Pharmaceutical/medical device business, there is no job security for contractors. This company has a 2 year limit on contractors and has a reputation for not offering permanent positions.  So there is no contract-to-hire possibility."
good,Gracias a BAXTER pude aprender muchísimo sobre contabilidad y les estoy inmensamente agradecida sin embargo ya no hay estabilidad en la empresa y un ambiente tenso por la misma razón.
good,"Management is making a lot of changes claimed flexibility is not the reality, but the work and purpose of the company is amazing and challenging. Over all a good place to work with growth opportunities in the Mid West"
good,"Baxter is a large company positioned well in the healthcare market. They have multiple product lines and divisions that hedge opportunities in a dynamic marketplace. Great employee benefits including volunteerism and stock options. Typical ""big company"" work life with matrix reporting lines and non-agile development and marketing."
good,The company is moving many operations to contract manufactures and eliminating many positions/titles. There is not a lot of stability within the company at this time.
good,"Worked on Start Up for Los Angeles Manufacturing Plant B8. Wrote over 100 criiticality assessments for instrument skids for Waste Water, WFI, RO, Albumin and Hemofil production lines. Plant successfully commissioned and producing product under FDA approval."
good,"The new CEO has brought in a certain level of optimism and energy into the company. There is a major HR initiative to bring work life balance and flex work options. But restructuring, cost cutting and constant lay-off keeps morale down, tension high and pressure on the employees."
good,"It's ok but I needed to get off 3rd shift. The attendance system, which uses a point system is unfair and needs to be changed."
good,"It was nice working with Baxter, the employees were taken care off in terms of Benefits. Co-workers are fun to work with even in times of a stressful day."
good,"fill IV bags, print Iv bags, orient the bags down a belt"
good,"j'ai beaucoup appris de mon travail, capacité à être technitien mais pas d'évolution possible car la valeur négligés par rapport aux diplomes."
good,This company will give you the opportunity to harp your skills and put your knowledge of science and lab practices to work
good,"Kind of learning & training is amazing and very help full to be a better & effective salesperson."
good,"Great leadership, fair trade for both union and non union people."
good,"I think that I produced some of my best work at Baxter, thanks to a Senior Manager who was detailed and specific and knew how to get results from his staff."
good,"•Directly managed a multi-state territory.  Responsibilities included Customer Relations, Budget Development, Expense Management and maintaining FDA Compliance."
good,"A typical day at work is based on communicating with direct reports on daily activities, attending meetings for process improvements and project implementation, and working against timelines to ensure target goals are met effectively.  We are also a very 6S focused company that strives to constantly elimnate waste and improve our processes."
good,Poor training. Poor accountability. Nice coworkers. Management style was reactive instead of innovative. Poor IT support.
good,"Baxter es una de las empresas de giro farmacutico muy interesante, debido a que te permite conocer todo su proceso y adquirir mucho conocimiento."
good,"Baxter was a great company as a starting point. I gained a lot of manufacturing experience, but would not plan to work for Baxter as a long term career."
good,Ambiente del trabajo bueno
good,Everyday challenges enhance educational opportunities. It is never a boring place! I love that I get to use new skills on a daily basis to improve processes. The hardest challenge is dealing with a constant state of change and turnover which makes it difficult defining job roles and responsibilities.
good,Good pay but a lot of extra hours and people taking advantage of other people often. A lot of people want a paycheck but not to do the work and that means more work dumped on others. It does offer good paying positions is a positive.
good,Pay is great. Days off are great but they go fast due to the 12 hour working schedule. And not very fair. A LOT of favoritism. But if you are good at ignoring conflicts and ignoring these kind of unequal favoritism that goes on then perfect job.
good,It was good experience made a lot of friends learned a lot great pay great benefits lots of vacation time time off if u work 12hr shift training is available
good,"Cons-- no music allowed, job culture sucks, too many yahoos working there , contracts too long ,  "
good,"Salaries très sympathiques bon esprit d equipe"
good,I liked my job their. The people was normally nice and the jobs not that difficult. You have to take your time and make sure u do the task correctly the 1st time.
good,"Bra förmåner, bonus"
good,It was an ok place to work. I had to leave due to my mother in law having to have surgery. She was my babysitter for my kids. Overall it was a good place to work.
good,"This job has good benefits and 401k but thought are the only good things about working for this company. Most employees' don't have enough training or was not trained properly. They claim safe is number one priority but they plant in Marion , NC  can't even make it one month without having someone get hurt. Baxter pushes production with no thought of employee safe in mind."
good,When I moved up here from London I needed a job so took anything this was a job in a factory on a line not my cup of tea. This was a long time ago The company was not even named Baxters at the time
good,"Hardest part of the job was quickly changing process, and most enjoyable part of the job was flexibility to work from home in certain roles. Enjoyed being close to home."
good,"4days regular working days and 2days restday,"
good,Set hours with some flexibility. Good working environment with a good team for the most part. Some emotional blackmail due to type of work involved (manufacturing chemotherapy drugs for same day usage).
good,"I worked at Baxter for 18 years and thought I would retire from there. I think the mentality is not what you know but who you know. Management did not support  employees to further their careers. "
good,"Should have a Union  to facility. Steady Job and income. Very repetitive. Overall I enjoyed working with others, besides the typical workplace drama, which is easy to avoid."
good,In biotech you are regulated by the FDA. Sometimes it is encouraged to cover up OSHA and FDA violations. If you bring this to someone's attention you will receive trouble.
good,"Had to run a film line which makes plastic sheeting that gets turned into drain bags.  I had to do paper work keep up with hourly production. The people that worked their was great, management was not as great."
good,"Trabalho dinâmico, pouco rotineiro. Empresa de grande porte com oportunidades de crescimento."
good,"Built my working skill and learnt a lot about Sales."
good,Baxter is a good company to work for but could increase in pay for employee who deserve to move up in the company. Great hours and offers overtime when needed. Easy job to do if you do what you are told.
good,"Management of Environmental monitoring validations"
good,Baxter is an ok Place to work. They expect to know everything and the pace like that. Its just not that simple. But overall it's and ok place to work.
good,"friendly co-workers"
good,"•	Perform and administer Quality System related activities for the Technical Service Hub (TSC)"
good,"--> Forecast und Actuals Analysen. Bilanz hinsichtlich Forecast und"
good,I worked in the tax department here at Baxter. The best part about this place was the high level of professionalism everyone exhibited. 
good,Micro managed
good,"This was a good job for where I lived. Not many jobs in Mountain Home and if you are going to live in Mountain Home I recommend working here. "
good,Great pay. Management could be a little better but besides that it's a good place to work at. The job behind the work is one of the reasons I loved it there. They make pharmaceuticals to help save & sustain lives. Baxter is a good company. Highly recommend.
good,Good benefits. The corporate culture is like any other Fortune 500 company.  The mission of saving and sustaining lives is great.  Sometimes the work is poorly planned.
good,"Baxter is a great place to work for the area, the only bad thing i can really say after working there for a few years is that even if they tell you that you'll get a position you applied for i wouldn't hold your breath. They skip over their employees like its the thing to do, but other then that its a GREAT place."
good,It is a ok place to work but a lot of the management has there favorable and if u are not n that group ur a outsider. Overall the Baxter healthcare is a ok place and a lot of room to advance
good,"The only negative is that I took a cut in pay but they had an attitude that I should be grateful for the money I was making.....I would not go back"
good,"Fast paced, fun people to work with. Highly regulated by FDA. Always something to do, but you're on your feet a lot."
good,It's a very busy place but you get to be exposed on a lot of learning opportunities.
good,Very challenging and required the best of all employees.  Nothing less was expected.
good,"Deploying the Applications,"
good,I would enjoy working in a fast paced environment that involves multitasking. I have learned to work with various types of people and to adjust to the environment around me. I have managed teams of teachers and I have learned to embrace an open door policy that allows each team player to work to his or her full potential. The hardest part of my current job is the lack of year round stability and he most enjoyable part of my job is the lack of predicatabilty throughout the day.
good,"This site was well-established; my job duties were clear, my compensation was always on-time and correct and there were advancement opportunities to pursue."
good,starting quickly with a formal meeting daily upon the beginning of shift to outline goals and expectations for the shift. hands on training as well as assistance by leads and supervisors.
good,"For an  experienced scientist , its hard to be a contractor at Baxter, not much opportunity to manage projects independently. All of the study directors are the full time employees. Contractors assisted the full time employee on the projects."
good,"This job was fast-paced. It allowed me to learn more about the health industry and the manufacturing industry at the same time. If you want to gain knowledge about OSHA, FDA and compliance this is the place to work. It will grow your social and professional skills."
good,"From summer to winter is mandatory overtime, you work 12 days on and off 2. Its hard to have family time. I don't mind overtime at all, but when you have your weekends taken for that long its hard,"
good,Le personnelle sont sympathiques mais le travaille est dure physiquement.
good,You have to be willing to work weekends as well as a 2nd or 3rd shift position. the production side of baxter is the easiest to get hired into but will make you work 12 hour shifts daily.
good,"Baxter made iv bags for our local hospitals, we were responsible for filling the bags with saline solution and making sure the bags where clean and filled."
good,"Fast paced Pharamceutical business, great cultured and plenty of growth opportunities."
good,"great place to work. "
good,Baxter’s had a competitive work environment from day 1. Training was simple and hard work came later. The pay rather definitely matched the typical days work. I would recommend.
good,"Company has good policy and people, But it has to many layer of communication and there is no direct instruction and decision keep changing. Lot of information get lost in transmission. Need to improve in agility and delivery quality."
good,"running the production line to customers specifications, managing the work force, recording quality records stock checks and rotation,decision making and corrective actions. Computer skills , forklift driving, health and safety awareness. Management change over the last eighteen months."
good,J'ai appris à structurer le magasin avec rapidité et efficacité et ce dans un contexte plutôt amusant.
good,Baxter is a behemoth corporation with thousands of employees. This is as corporate is it gets. 9 to 5 with an inflated corporate structure and bureaucracy. Promotions are scarce and work is dull. Management inefficiencies are everywhere and are being overlooked.
good,"Baxter is a good company with a good culture, it provides good opportunities."
good,"Very good job but no management support ,there are no Hr support for employees everything is a 800 number to call and the employee have to figure out what they are suppose to do."
good,"Baxter folks used to hoard information, and sometimes lie about what they knew or what information they had.  In a company supposedly driven by science and the advancement of human healthcare, this can be detrimental.  Folks were afraid for their jobs in an economically bloated and stayed firm whose core science was developed more than 80 years ago. Rather than loosen up and collaborate, the unfortunate result of the fearful posture folks assumed was eventual buy-out.  Many then lost their jobs anyway."
good,Low salary ...and push workers to do it ot... But sometimes we have fun going. Out with ol employees..production environment everything normal ...every wed we have meeting with our supervisor
good,no one know what's going on ever. hardest part was the 3rd shift. I liked the employees
good,learned how to package and palletize medicine. l like the people but no one in management seemed to know what was going on. there was different rules everyday
good,Baxter is a strong and reputable company. Typical day consists of meetings and work on projects. Flexibility is the good part of the job. Baxter's slow pace and lack of advancement opportunities as well as very slow management are drawbacks. Over all a comfortable place to work and learn but growth is not to be expected for an individual's career.
good,"It's a good pay job and good benefits. Lot's of politics and favoritism going on. You will find good co-workers and bad ones. It's better to keep to yourself and not make friends at all. Easy job to perform, hard to move up if you don't know anyone of higher position; unless you are lucky to have a ""real professional"" supervisor who appreciates and acknowledges your work performance. If other wise, you will have it hard."
good,"The workload is pretty heavy, but the people you work with are wonderful."
good,My supervisor had no interest in our well being it was all about work! We worked most week and weekend but got paid good. Had a few issues with supervisor approving time. As long as you do your work and stay to yourself no othe problems.
good,"Every day is different sometimes they will put in your different departments to work there for the week or a day, you will be learning a lot of different experiences"
good,Great benefits but terrible people in management. I enjoyed working here but between my boss lacking common sense & the drama making you feel like you're in high school again was hard to tolerate.
good,"A typical off shift day of work includes meeting and accomplishing batches of production.  Through the mix, fill, and finishing stages, great attention to detail is needed in order to ensure patients' lives can be advanced.  Many relatives/friends of employees have at some point in their lives been on a Baxter medication - and the shifts do everything within their control to ensure that medicine is above standard.  The staff stays their shift - to a maximum of 12 hrs as needed to complete a batch.  Supervisors stay most times longer to complete reports, exceptions, attend meetings, etc."
good,"So many awesome technicians that are the heartbeat of the facility, but it is the management that brought the facility down.  Not much room for advancement."
good,In comparison to some of my past jobs Baxter would run an 8 in the over all scale. What brought the score down was some of the problems that occurred with management. They also have a very high turn over with employees.
good,I worked through a temp agency and I haven't been hired on yet. So far the work is interesting and the pay is great. The hours are hard for a working mother and they change suddenly sometimes. But all in all I love working for Baxter.
good,"Aucun C.D.I après cinq années de travail dans l'entreprise"
good,Pues me parecio bien el trabajo ya que contaba con algunos recursos economicos que me beneficiaban en mi trascurrir vivir aunque el salario era bajo
good,"En arbetsplats som genomgår stora förändringar."
good,"Hard to advance from being a contractor. Therefor there is no job security or benefits. As a nurse, if you don't want to lose your skill then you shouldn't stay."
good,"Ambiance de travail correct en équipe de nuit, difficulté pour évoluer"
good,"Great company."
good,"A typical day at work included assembling medical devices, packaging medical devices, and shipping medical devices. I learned that team work is very important in accomplishing your goals. My coworkers were hard workers and very good at what they did. The hardest part of the job was trying to work the night shift while attending college during the days. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting my co workers who were very nice and easy to work with."
good,"Falta un poco de integracion entre áreas ya que son mundos distintos, más organización en cuanto a documentos se refiere."
good,Baxter doesn't conform to ADA rules and regulations. Supervisors don't care about personal problems that would affect your job.No chances at advancement not unless you are friends with the hiring supervisor or have family there
good,"Productive and fair workplace because of management but co-workers sometimes misleading, the one example is:"
good,"Free flexiblility, no money for growth.  Sends me online company training and you tube videos instead of going to off site training.  Management takes user trips for t heir own."
good,"Through my experience at Baxter, I have had multiple opportunities for growth.  If you take the initiative, you will succeed.  There are some managers, however, that are not capable of leading employees or motivating them to succeed."
good,Better than most places around but like most factories thay lack the understanding of family values. Great benefits. Takes to long to earn vacation time. Thay also treat there temp workers like thay dont matter. Seen people work and never miss a day. Supervisors tell them that there getting hired on and then thay fire them for no reason. Attendance policy is terrible due to lack of Human Resources keeping track of points and FMLA paper work.
good,"Baxter is a ok place to work if you can deal with the amount of hours you have to work each week, no days off is hard on anybody, they take your PTO hours from you if you take a day off and also give you a point if you don't give them a 24 hour notice, I don't agree with that"
good,I did not stay at Baxter for more than a year.The work I did was mainly focussed on bovine jugular veins and its biochemistry.The work was a very slow process of fixation of bovine valves in glutaraldehyde and then it was given to histology lab for embedding and cutting the tissue at 3-4 microns.Although the work was very challenging but I had to leave as I got a better offer at PSJMC.
good,"Great place to work, fast paced testing. Great group of people to work with. The people working there were very helpfully with both the testing and daily issues."
good,"This is a basic delivery job, nothing special. Standard hours and reasonable pay. Good food however poor hygiene and unfriendly staff. Okay as a second job."
good,Baxter is currently going through a lot of restructuring as a reason there is a lot of instability. Otherwise it is a good organization to start with. Organization is flexible and has good work life balance.
good,"Het is een leuke afwisselende baan, het contact met patiënten kan alle kanten uitgaan, van gezellig tot minder gezellige gesprekken tot een luisterend oor bieden."
good,Great opportunity to grow and diversify talents in different areas because of the portfolio of products; travel requirements and relocation can be hindering in the sales area because of smaller sales force and limited opportunity

good,There are many pros and cons to working for Baxter. The greatest pro is that you know a persons life is in your hand with every product that you touch and inspect.

good,The money is good and the place is so clean. The days are Monday through Friday and every other Saturday. The cafeteria has free coffee on third shift only and affordable prices on food during first shift. They give a $100.00 voucher for new steel toe shoes at their store of choice and offer scrubs mandatory to wear during shift.

Production work, clean work environment, Pay is weekly for production work, good variety of jobs. 12 hour shift if 7am to 7 pm for first shift and 7 pm to 7 am night shift. fast paced work environment.

I had learned how to operate a syringe and vial lines. I learned how to formulate some medicines. I learned the aseptic formulation. I crossed trained in formulation, capping, and packaging.

In my daily routine I am constantly interacting with customers to make sure that their needs are met.  It's my goal to exceed the customers expectations and be one step ahead.  "
good,"Baxter is a great place to learn the high end of the manufacturing and repair process of healthcare equipment.  Depending on which department and supervisor you are under, your stay can be very opportune.  The people are great and the company does a lot of neat things for its employees.  At times, i feel management is taking on more than necessary and dates/deadlines are often pushed back to more realistic dates and times; but the most enjoyable part of my job is the gratification of knowing that i am helping to save lives.  I enjoy the responsibility on me to ensure quality for these heart pumps that preserve life.  The hardest part of the job is definitely the pay rate and raise schedule for my department in Quality Assurance."

Salaried lab employees can get comp time or straight pay for overtime after 4 free days, but there is constant need to work 6 day weeks."
good,"Conducive work environment"
good,"I was trained to perform all aspects of the day to day procedures in the clinic. I could not only set up appointments for the donors as well as check them in when they arrived to the center to perform their vital signs and initiate their donation for the day.

I was trained on the standard operating procedures for the entire donation process from aseptic sterilization of the donors site, the venipuncture, the set up and take down of the donation machines for each donor, the monitoring of the donor during procedure, handling of biohazard materials, blood sample collections, management of donors adverse affects, collection of plasma, intake of plasma for processing for shipment and shipment of plasma to Baxters main location.

good,Baxter Healthcare is an okay place to work. You'll get your full 40 and sometimes they will offer over time depending on production needs. It is a temperature-controlled environment.
good,It's an ok place to work but once you top out in pay there's no room for advancement or to make more money unless you work overtime. They offer a cross training program but once you cross train on another job they don't want to pay you for knowing how to run two jobs.
good,"As long as you follow given rules, regulations, keep good attendance and attitude you will have no problems! The starting pay, benefits offered and opportunities available are excellent as well."

good,"Baxter is growing in their market-share.  But there is a temptation to outsource design work to Southeast Asia.  This has been attempted in the past and hasn't ended well.  Within 2 years, I believe they will try it again.  I have no doubt it will end poorly again."
good,Was a laid back job. You weren’t on your feet at all. During the slow season it made for very long days and very hard to stay awake when you have to sit in your assigned area. They are pretty strict about getting up and walking around.
good,"Baxter is in the midst of a turnaround, focusing on innovation and speed. This makes things fun from the perspective of being involved in driving change. However, in the last 12-18 months I've seen very little promotion from within up into the Director and above ranks. Folks at these levels have been almost exclusively hired externally. Great prospects from an external candidate's view, but discouraging for internal talent."
good,"Baxter was a great pleace to work and hone your procurement skills.  I would work there again, should the opportunity arise - flexible hours and generous PTO."
good,"Baxter, is an American diversified managed health care company based in California.

good,"The company is constantly changing policies, rules, and other areas.  The benefits are great, but the advancement process is difficult because of a lot of favoritism.  The 12 hour back to back shifts are difficult, but it is great to know that I am saving lives."
good,Advancement is almost impossible and morale is extremely low.  The people and direct management make the job enjoyable.
good,-I was in a shifting schedule. It was not a big deal to me because I could accommodate it by myself. it has a good way of managing the people and can compete world-wide.

good,Strong company.  Long term plan for this location hasn't been communicated well.  The workforce has dropped creating extra stress on other to pick up the slack.
good,Baxter was a great place to work. Their office building is great with lot of parking and greenery. Management is easy going with accountability as a key. Staff is cooperative and fosters learning environment. Hardest part was commute to north. The most enjoyable part is no micro management.

good,"Quality oversight of manufacturing , management communication needs to be better and more support needs to be supplied. Most enjoyable part of job is knowing that what I do helps save lives."

good,"A typical day at work will be delivering refreshments to an internal or external costumer meeting room, The things i have learnt working there is how to keep my workstation clean and in order, which will be wiping down counts, shelves and to make sure we don't run out of stock. The management has its good and bad days but overall it's great. My co-workers are amazing to work with, even thou most are from different countries. They are very supportive and friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult clients or when a co-worker doesn't show up for work. The best part about work has to be the events that are held and collecting the deliveries, it's enoyable but it can be hard work too."
good,Every changing workplace with its challenges with healthcare reform and medical devices.  A good company to work for....large scale.

good,I worked in quality and had a great supervisor who really cared about her employees and the patients we helped. But the attendance policy is ridiculous when it come to it's own employees getting sick. Just as long as you stay healthy it's a great place to work.

good,"Not much of a complainer when it comes to work. There's always something wrong about one job or another. I've worked in allot worse places than this. With that being said, it's a constant controlled and cooled environment. They have great benefits, perks, and best money to be made where I come from. Although I feel like I'm being held back at this point. I've tried advancing to further my career, placement, and experience. Work and machine efficiency has always excelled. Yet they'll hire someone off the streets with less on the job experience in the plant and of the machines instead of within the plant first. Even after I've obtained my associate degree in Mechatronics they put me through school for. That has been my biggest problem with them"

good,"Small place in Hayward, ca but a great place to work with a lot of benefit with stock option and competitive rate. Diverse culture. Limited parking space."
good,"I found Baxter to be a decent place to work, their business/mission is a good one. They have undergone a lot of change since I was there so not sure how management is any more."
good,This company treated me well but lacked vision and new products.  My whole Anesthesia Division was laid off because they didn't acquire new products or technologies.

good,"Pros: Great company and you get a laptop on your first day so that you can work from home."
good,"The people are always the best. Management makes the work day stressful, not understanding what it takes to get the job done so over promising on deadlines and expectations and then hounding you because it's taking too long. Many of us put in the extra hours to get the job done but it's under appreciated. Baxter as a whole is a great company with great benefits and many perks.

good,"It was a contracting job that got me into the medical device industry. As one project ended, there was no guarantee for permanent employment. I learned about CAPA and complaint handling."
good,"I have been working at Baxter full-time (More than 5 months)"
good,"I worked in a few different departments as a quality technician, training coordinator and a recall coordinator,  I also helped out the receptionist for her breaks."
good,I work in the toolroom. Dealing with machines and tools. I am supporting the plastic molding department. We are producing healthcare products for the kidney patients.
good,Good company to work for.  Progressive positive work environment..  Global opportunities.  Diverse work environment. Limited opportunities for advancement.
good,Fast pace professional work environment.  Great palace to work for.  They provide training to help with advancement.  I work with hard working and dedicated people.
good,"Fantastic work force with a dynamic vision."
good,This company has allowed to raise my children in town that is perfect for families. I have worked for this company for 15 years and really enjoy the people that I encounter in my line of work.
good,"Nice place to work. The company really focuses on profitability and all advancement opportunities lead to Deerfield, Ill."
good,"A workplace that is team oriented, has effective training and a decent amount of opportunities to move positions in the plant. It is currently on a mandatory six day work-week until production numbers are caught up. The long work-weeks take its toll at first but you get used to it; the pay is good. I liked learning the different positions in different areas of the plant."
good,"Baxter is really a great place to work, but since it went corporate, management is less transparent, perks are being stripped away, and job security is always in question. Higher-ups are often hired from outside. Pay rate is not realistic, but not terrible."
good,Flexible work environment. Too many organizational changes. Four in four years with ultimate destructive workforce reduction. Lacking products in pipleline.  Casual work environment. Great innovative people work here.  Not many processes in place.  Unstable environment especially since new CEO joined.
good,"Baxter is a pretty good place to work. I enjoy the people  I work with,.. Management is management sometimes it doesn't seem like they care about the jobs we all do. There are very hard workers there and it seem like the same handful are always noticed and the rest are not."
good,Fast paced but fun environment.  This was my first full-time job out of school was lucky enough to work with very knowledgeable co-workers.
good,"Great benefits,collaborative culture with good work life balance.  Currently going through a transition given the spinoff of Baxalta."
good,"I had a good career at Baxter, working in multiple areas including pharmaceuticals, devices and manufacturing. Company is known for product development and innovation."
good,I would inspect IV bags some days and other day I would run the machine that packs IV bags and loved working in the freezer to get prduct pack and in shipping boxes to be sent out.
good,"The official work time is 8am-4.30pm but usually the employees will stay back up till 5 or 6pm, The plant management needs to follow US corporate's directions in terms human resource, quality, EHS etc, so there is limited local autonomy. The bulk of employees are multi-nationals, with majority comes from nearby Malaysia states. The job at the company are routine, mainly for support of manufacturing operations but all employees are expected to join committees which will take up more time besides their standard works. The location of the plant is quite scenic, on top of a small hill, so employees can enjoy the view of Johor Strait during their meals at the canteen."
good,"Take an assignment daily of complaints of Baxter products. Determine portability to the FDA and complete necessary tasks/investigation for closure of complaint. I loved working for this company but after its split into two companies, job security is now an issue."
good,"I have worked at Baxter for about 5 years and had a great experience so far. They have offered me a great career growth and I have been surrounded by smart people. It is a conservative culture though, so you are fairly limited in terms of innovations and thinking things differently. You will find a few people in top management interested on minds that think differently but not everybody."
good,"I really enjoyed working here.  My day started with a short meeting with my supervisor to go over what I had planned for the day."
good,"I loved working for Baxter, unfortunately there was a decision to Let go one of the departments. "
good,"Chez Baxters, c'est la planification de la production, planification de la main d'œuvre, voir à ce que le Kanban, 5S soient respectés. Amélioration continue est de rigueur. Bonne collaboration entre gestionnaires."
good,"Chemists who perform well are put on a path to grow up the corporate ladder. You work hard, for long hours.  Most coworkers are very easy to get along with.  Management staff can seem very selfish at times, but if your ideas are good they will help a little bit.  Hardest part of the job is trying to make improvements while carrying a heavy work load."
good,"A typical day at work would include making the the CNC program using the Delcam software. Then setting up the machine and the work piece and make the parts according to requirement. I have learnt a lot of things like how to make the best program which saves time as well as gives the best possible finish to the part, using various precision instruments, understanding complicated drawings and the types of materials and feeds and speeds suitable for them. My co-workers treated me very well and helped me to adapt the new environment. There was a great professionalism at the workplace which would make you love your work."
good,"Very rewarding place to work. Does offer room for advancement, may require some relocation but overall not bad. Coworkers are fun and enjoy their job. For management, it does not offer much work/life balance. Scheduling can range from a 5 am to 2,3,4,5 pm shift and may be there as late at midnight or later when equipment is being repaired. But, the pay is not awful and benefits help out."
good,"Lors de chaque journée de travail, lors de chaque déplacement, lors de chaque manipulation, il y avait toujours quelqu'un prêt de l'équipe afin de surveiller que tout se passe bien afin d'éviter tout risque éventuel"
good,"Baxter Corporate talks about how employees are allowed to own their development. When I've tried to talk with my manager about opportunities I think can help me develop into the engineer I want to be, they get shot down without any attempt at a counter proposal to help me get to the same point. I enjoy the people I work with and the see a lot of manufacturing processes I can learn through work experiences, but there are more things I want to do to improve them that those opportunites are not supported. Being only exposed to one plant within Baxter may not reflect the managment style of Baxter as a whole."
good,In my last role in the company I was able to have direct contact with customer which allowed me to understand patient's care on a personal level. The actual work environment was great because you develop relationships with your co workers who are usually within the same age range making it fun to come to work daily. The toughest challenge I've encountered was being able to keep up with incoming complaints as well as keeping up a work flow that might reach 200+ complaints.
good,It was a great stable job with great benefits and it was definitely a blessing to be able to be working in that kind of company. I was able to learn about a lot of different cultures due to interacting with my coworkers. The high amount of overturn in the management made for a lot of difficult transitions in responsibilities and expectations. I thought my experience there would translate into other healthcare careers but it hasn't proven true yet. It was too bad that it took so long to get a management team that actually seemed to care about the employees. It was a good experience overall.
good,People are great to work with. the weekend end shift is the best.
good,Work on keeping equipment running in a manufacturing invernment.
good,"Make it to work around 7 am and begin processing customer complaint on medical devices that were manufactured by Baxter Healthcare. I learned about 7different types of medical infusion devices. Management was fairly ok, I like that they did not micro manage. One of the hardest parts of the job was the outrageous workload. The most enjoyable part was the compensation and the dealing with different complaints."
good,"The bottom line with Baxter is that it is very committed to it's product, customers and employees. Baxter is a top healthcare company globally."
good,"potential of a great work environment, growing wages with the chance of moving up in the company, had a great time working there even if some things are left to unfair chances"
good,"The job consists of circuit board design, documentation, component selection, algorithm work, troubleshooting and systems work."
good,"Good place to work for the Cleveland, MS office."
good,It was a great 32 year experience to work on making  products that save and sustain lives. I was fortunate to have retired from Baxter and to have worked with some very intelligent people.
good,"Baxter Healthcare is a good place with even better benefits. As with any company, there will be issues regarding management and unmotivated people and drama but if you go in with a positive mindset, do your job and do it to the best of your ability, you will enjoy working here. There is room for advancement and the place is kept to a high standard as far as cleanliness due to the company producing dialysis and iv bags, etc..."
good,"All the works are assigned with the stringent time boundaries and the sometimes, they are unrealistic."
good,"After you learn the work, it’s a breeze. Very easy work environment. Not exactly relaxed, because it is a fast-paced/speed-based job (on the lines, at least), but definitely easy. You can almost do it with your eyes closed. Would NOT recommend third-shift, it’s hard to find a good work/life balance with those hours, but first would be ideal."
good,"• To manage the processing of customer orders for home patients "
good,"I worked there for 32 years in all depts. I  met some wonderful people . I got fired because I missed a check on a pack line . The sad part is 32 years experience didn't matter I also had no write ups . I was a good employee and had good attendance . now they cant keep people anymore , the turnover is ridiculous/"
good,Okay place. Great people to work for. Could be stressful at time. I enjoyed coming into work. The atmosphere is great. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the co-workers.
good,"Excellent salary and benefits, provided education and training. Culture was positive within the department. A fair amount of stress with some projects."
good,"Fast paced job. After being here for a year you're able to bid on other areas/departments. Baxter is the lowest paying pharmaceutical company, but higher wage for this area."
good,Azienda molto interessante e storicamente nel settore pharma emoderivati e dialisi.
good,"Times have changed.  No real review needed.  Was a very long time ago and was very limited to my skillset, but a nice place to gain some experience.  Not interested in reviewing this job which was over 30 years ago"
good,"When we first come to work, we have pre- meeting on number of orders for day, we pick orders, pack orders, put information into computer and ship orders out by federal express"
good,The company is undergoing a multi year business transformation journey. The company's IT organization is undergoing a major transformation as well and embracing a Cloud First strategy
good,Facility cleaned house and dismissed of valuable managers and employees that had years of experience to hire new younger and cheaper help.
good,You have job security if you work hard and follow the rules. The company was changing too much. Hours and benefits were cut. No retirement for ones hired in the last few years.
good,"It was a fine job if you were looking to move up in a company and had plenty of opportunities to build friendships with coworkers. The work could get a little tedious, but the rotations helped keep things moving."
good,"- Früh bewerben"
good,"Our team was very productive and had a very close bond. This allowed the team to flourish and develop very quickly. "
good,Own routes and times but the constant lifting and stairs takes a toll.  Goto different cities and places so hard to judge a daily time.  4 day week with over time nice option.
good,"Baxter is a great company and place to work."
good,Great place. Great company. Good pay. Very strict when it comes to safety. I've witnessed a few people lose jobs over simple mistakes. Just follow the SOPs and you will be fine.
good,"I worked at Baxter around the time of the Baxalta split (2015). Lots of people were being laid-off from Baxter Healthcare or voluntarily moving to Baxalta. Since then, things may have settled down. My manager was great, but way too many jobs were being filled by temporary contractors from overseas. Knowing that we were working for a company that looked at jobs as shoes to fill rather than an investment in the company's future had a significant negative impact on morale."
good,It's a good place to work but many changes have increased employee stress levels. Very good and competitive pay. Good place to work for balance in work/family life.
good,A day at Baxter means a day of productivity and enrichment. You get to communicate with individuals who are suffering on a daily basis and play a key role in helping their day get better.
good,"No matter which manufacturing plant you work at, there will always be downsides. You can't speak for everyone, and with how big the North Cove plant is...how everyone feels here about their job varies greatly."
good,"My work experience with Baxter was very relaxed and non stressful. "
good,"Good place to work, good management. Good culture.Facing now a lot of change across all functions that led to unknown, not clear strategy at the moment."
good,"Esta empresa es una de las mejores en las que he laborado, es una empresa que te permite laborar en oficinas o si es necesario hacer Home Office, lo que te permite tener una estabilidad laboral-Familiar muy alta."
good,"I worked as a filling operator and then became a qualified trainer. I absolutely loved the job and the benefits that came along with it, but my body and mental health could no longer handle working 6 days a week on third shift for 6+ months. If I'm allowed the opportunity to return to Baxter, I would wish for a position that isn't on 6-7 days/week."
good,"If you do not have a degree there is limited options for you there. Baxter is a really nice place to work for one reason the pay is good. The only thing stressful on the job is that you have to learn many things about the Galaxy machines so you can correctly operate them. Even if you are confident on operating them you still need to make sure you are following procedures correctly or you will get in trouble, including safety precautions too. This was really stressful and demanding but overall I asked for the challenges so it was my fault for the hardships I faced. The PA position is one of the easiest but most time consuming positions there is. I would recommend this job for someone who needs a job and is not going to school or has a family."
good,"Lugar con un ambiente laboral exelente, lugar en donde siempre hay algo que hacer"
good,"They are a very old-school company that has recently started making big changes over the past couple years. They made a lot of changes at the executive level and are trying to update the culture of the organization, as well as become more efficient in how they do business. A few hold overs slow this down, but that's standard office politics for you."
good,"Abwechlungsreich, nette Kollegen, neue Erfahrungen"
good,The Department Manager feel satisfied with our personal lives and more satisfied with our careers and perform. “Work-Life Freedom = Work-Life Balance”.
good,"Opportunités de développement difficile"
good,Baxter was not a bad work place but the management could have defiantly improved. Many times the workers would complain about something and the management wouldn't do anything about it.
good,The organization continues to evolve as a new corporate structure and updated Quality Management System takes shape.  Supporting Baxter's mission to save and sustain lives is rewarding.  It's products are used globally so there is opportunity to partner with team members from around the world.
good,Baxter is an organization always striving for growth. The company is expanding and has a growing number of product franchises that offer opportunities for career advancement.
good,"I enjoyed all of my job tasks, same tasks, but totally different from day to day. "
good,hacer recorrido por las áreas para ver que productos les faltaban para surtir. manejo de montacargas a ser descargas con pistola de radio frecuencia y en la computadora .                                       buen ambiente laboral .
good,"Company’s top management more concerned about their shareholders, than Baxter employees. Nobody can feel secured working in Baxter."
good,"Being an international company BAXTER Healthcare provided a substantial pay rate and strict safety and internal conduit rules. Due to some reasons which I have to keep confidential some of my colleagues and I had to be made reduntant. Overall, a good company to work at."
good,Great people who really care about what they are doing. Management seems a bit rudderless at times and will take too long to kill a project. New CEO appears to be changing that.
good,This was one of the best places I have worked so far. Learned a lot..enjoyed a lot. Managers and directors are awesome to work with. They have good sense of responsibilities and understands the employees' issue very well.
good,A very outgoing fun place to work plus meeting deadlines was very fun.  Meeting new people was outstanding.  I got along with everyone.
good,"Baxter is a wonderful job, but due to how short contracts are and the fact they only hire 5 to 10 people when they do hire (once every 3 months), you never feel secure in the job."
good,A typical work day at a factory job. You have to deal with the same co-workers day in and day out and some of them like to cause issues but most are decent. There is little to no advancement throughout the company unless you personally know someone in any of the HR departments or have a family member higher up in the chain of authority.
good,"I enjoyed working here. The people were nice, I learned a lot."
good,great staff and management . all employees/ staff were like family and were all supportive and helpful on a daily basis .
good,ses une entreprise qui fonctionne très bien le point négatif  ses qui offre pas de cdi
good,It was a fun work place and the management was also very keen to get their employees learn new skills. it was indeed a learning platform.
good,Je recommande cette entreprise qui favorise l'intégration des individus.
good,Providing me a future of  possibilities to expand and broaden my enviroment. I have learned the importance of being audit ready from being regulated by the FDA. It is alot of responsibilities and paperwork that correlate with the requirements and demand of the job.

good,I go to work every day knowing that what I do makes a difference. The job is not hard. It is rewarding. My co-workers are pleasant to be around.
good,"1. Everyday Learning."
good,"Baxter is a great place to grow in both personally and professionally. The culture is hard to break into as many employees have been in the same position for many many years. Several people are related to each other which makes it difficult to feel that you are getting treated fairly. But overall Baxter really cares about the products they sell and the people who use their products, as it should be."
good,"Baxter Healthcare is a fantastic company to work for and offers numerous paths of travel in terms of career advancement. The work culture is strong and there are many life-long Baxter employees. Unfortunately, as most large corporations go - Baxter values growth and seems apprehensive when selecting individuals for hire/advancement."
good,"very busy and productive days and evenings, staff all nice and friendly and helpful. all levels of the jobs were equal no part was harder than the other. enjoy working at the fast pace."
good,"A typical work week  consist of reviewing purchase requests, contracts, proposal, accounting discrepancies, trouble shooting, end-user training and making critical decisions and executing it.  The hardest and yet the most rewarding part of the job is making the decisions on a project because stake holders are depending on your role to achieve savings, adhere to quality and regulatory standards,  meet deadlines while keeping the business running without interruptions. "

good,Very good place to work. A lot of advantage in traing new technlogy. Good people.
good,"Baxter as a company is very stable and financially well off. The company will be around a very long time. For a company which preaches ""Lean"" and focuses on improving processes, the equipment is old and run down and there are so many redundancies that the ""Lean"" only applies to very few processes."
good,"My experience at Baxter was overall great, I enjoyed the people and I also enjoyed the work, Baxter was a good company to work for and had great benefits as well. The only problem that I found was with the new management that I personally encountered"
good,"Baxter was an excellent place to work, personal development over the years lead to promotions/new job roles that fit in with the time of my life that I was at"
good,"Baxter has a good working atmosphere and allows their employees to grow not only professionally but also personally."
good,I liked my coworkers and the job was not extremely challenging. The review process and compensation was fair. It's a good company to work for. My boss and I just did not se eye to eye on a lot of things and we both decided it would be better for me to move on. Being an assistant requires a deeper personal connection than other positions so it's difficult if you don't really like or respect each other.
good,"I believe everyone thinks the other person knows what they’re suppose to do and not many cats ask questions. COMMUNICATION IS KEY IN ANY SITUATION!🥴 As far as your hours go, only the machines know what time you’re getting out every night. If you’re on 2nd shift that is. You could be told your line is ending at 11:30pm-12am but if that fill machine goes down it could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to fix it. Suddenly that 12 o’clock departure turns into 3:30-4am(the max time). Yes there’s a lot of OT hours and that’s where all the money is made, but it can be very mentally draining at times while you wait for your machine to be fixed. This is something the employment agency wasn’t to clear about when I first started at Baxter. Now I see why they’ve got 2 employment agencies working for them and such a high turnover rate. We’re not robots, but everyday is a unique day there. You never know what is going to happen next. Just got to be open minded and remember to breathe deep at times."
good,"12hr rotating shift, 24/7 operations all holidays are worked.Technicians walk 10-12 miles a day on the floor putting out fires.  Very fast pace a place for a person who cannot handle being on there feet 12 hrs. a day with a lot of walking bending."
good,"The main reason I didn't stay was location. It's a great company to work for. The benefits package is very comprehensive, pay is competitive, and the maintenance team worked well together. Sometimes maintenance was tasked with mandatory overtime, but it wasn't terrible."
good,"When I started to work at Baxter it was very easy to get used to the job, because the colleges were very open and helpful."
good,"I work in Baxter Healthcare for 8 years. Although it was challenging, i enjoyed it because Baxter Healthcare was rewarding his staff with a competitive salary, bonuses and pay increase. I think it is an excellent place to work in if we are willing to work in a busy environment,"
good,Not much opportunity for rapid career advancement.  Site has three factories under one roof.  it is located in small town and key positions in management are taken by folks who live and stay in the area.  Great place to learn about Medical Devices and IV solutions.
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Baxter Healthcare. I thought that I was paid very well compared to other jobs that I had before Baxter Healthcare "
good,"Dealing with Government setups was a tough tasks, meeting them making them understand about therapy, organising education Seminars for government set ups. Encouraging workplace, Team building, hardest part was funding in Govt Set ups"
good,"It's a great place with great benefits. The pay is great. It is a bit of a drive, but I don't mind it. Most the people there stay to themselves, but there are a few that are just mean/hateful. If you can just ignore them and think only of the money, then it's a great place!"
good,"Most Baxter employees are engaged in working together and working collaboratively. Baxter encourages this and management is supportive.  "
good,"I loved working here, until the department got reshuffled by a new director. "
good,I received  pump and then unbox and sort them. Then we would clean them and put them in GSP. next we would dump the history log.The i learn how to measure the tubs. We did a lot of training. the work place was friendly and clean. The bosses come around and talk with you.
good,"liked my job very much, great working conditions. Only problem was, that they shut down my dept. and moved out of state. could not move to manufacturing."
good,Enjoyed working with others. Some days Stressful more then others. Management was good to work for and helped you out when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a difference and knowing you are saving lives.
good,"The workflow at Baxter is very streamlined, the training for the job is easy, and you are coached by an experienced operator. The hardest part of the job is constantly having to refer to standard operating procedures to make sure you're working within the rules, some of which change without notice."
good,"The pay is pretty good in my department, we get 17 paid days off per year, plus paid holidays, but for the last year we have worked 12 days on 2 days off. They keep saying we’ll switch to every third weekend but we’ll see. Management in my building is horrible. The supervisor and group leader are in a relationship and no one says anything. It’s ridiculous. And we have to suffer because of their dysfunctional relationship."
good,"Baxter is a large company with many of the inefficiencies that most large companies share (knowledge silos, lots of meetings, too many managers) but in general was supportive of it's employees. "
good,Good place to work.  Fast paced.  Good people.  Great job diversity.  Learned many new skills.  High level of Responsibility and accountability.  Training could be improved upon

good,good place to work. people are very friendly and respectful. there is room for carrier advancement. it is pretty mush like one big dysfunctional family
good,Fast paced and competitive environment.  Innovation is key to success.  Be prepared to defend new ideas and rationalize new recommendations.  Must be persistent and able to advocate for changes .
good,"Can be a great company to work for. Also, great teams depending on what products/services you are part of."
good,Overall it was a good place to work they had friendly people the job is reall far away and I was sometimes working 7 days a week for multiple weeks at a time
good,Working in this company is very enjoyable and always gives an opportunity of innovation at your workplace and encourages employees with more benefits. work life balance is very much maintained.
good,Baxter was a good company to worked with a lots of challenges and cross training very amazing people from cross country. but management treat employee poorly.
good,"El ambiente laboral en general es satisfactorio y agradable."
good,"Positives outweighed the negatives overall. No place and no one is perfect and Baxter was like many places......you get out of it whatever it is that you put into it. Like Forrest says ""Life is like a box of chocolates........"""
good,"Uma ótima empresa para o desenvolvimento profissional, porém com algumas situações desfavoráveis  como preferência por alguns funcionários para exercerem atividades."
good,I had a wonderful time at Baxter and enjoyed every second. I learned a lot of skills. I made wonderful friends and had a great time. I loved working there.
good,"Baxter is an amazing company.  A lot opportunities to improve my career,  and my experience, I had the opportunity to contribute directly with the results and progress of the company.  In another hand  the company is losing focus in its vision and mission since a big transformation to improve financial results."
good,"I  learned  the hardest part was work environment , the  management  and the  stress of working in  solution  on hands. The workplace  culture was  very  cutthraot and  the  area whereI work was not  team oriented."
good,"Good experience and great learning with amazing technical management ."
good,I felt Baxter was a great starting company in order to help build my resume after graduation. I'm simply looking for more advancement opportunities and stability.
good,"Jai bien aimé mon expérience ,il nous traite bien ont est payé 30 minutes par jour pour faire de l'exercice et ainsi nous aider a garder la forme."
good,"Baxter Healthcare were a gold star top class healthcare company where I learned the 5 star gold standard in customer service and professional business practice. During my time here I learned multiple work systems, trained people, received a lot of training,  worked as a team member, team manager, and as part of an over operational management structure , and supported sales and marketing. This company provided me the opportunity to travel and work with colleagues in the UK, and Europe."
good,"Management not organized, miscommunication. A few years Management told all employees that Baxter Healthcare does not Lay off employees, management said we are a customer team the promise was not true."
good,"Being over the road is difficult, but this is a great place to work otherwise.  Good pay, and Baxter pays for food, hotels, provides long weekends and a lot of vacation time."
good,My work at Baxter Healthcare is fast-paced and most of the time enjoyable. I take pride in knowing that the products we make there are saving peoples lives all over the world.
good,Good company that is going through significant transformation under a new CEO.   Products are excellent.  Employees are diligent and highly committed.  Highly stressful environment as competition to receive high bonuses is in full play.
good,So happy we have new CEO. He is making the positive changes the company needs for sustainability. He is bringing new seasoned professionals from other companies and I find this a welcome change
good,Very clean facilities. Plenty of on the job training. Overall not a bad employer if you like working in the medical field. They tend to hire a lot through temp services.
good,Our schedule changes frequently.  It's difficult to change your life around when you have other obligations at home. I love my job but I really dislike my schedule.
good,"Nice place to work and learn new things, company is very aggressive and while working for them you will also become aggressive and you will be encouraged to try new things."

I didn't though um im not sure if factory work is where I belong. but I like it there it was different surroundings and I had just moved Marion also
good,"Baxter Healthcare is a great place to work. The benefits are awesome along with the people you work with. It is difficult to work an off shift job though when you have a family at home and are working on your education also. I get paid exceptionally well and really enjoy my work, but I would trade it to be able to work a 1st shift job and be home with my family every night."
good,"A typical day is pre-screening donors for the eligibility of donating plasma to make life saving therapeutic medications. It can be high stress, but a different stress, as it is not life or death. You gain rapport with donors and it's rewarding to see people saving lives. Management is great, very helpful and easy to approach with any concerns or questions. Coworkers are amazing, although the turnover can be high at times. It's by far the best place I've ever been employed."

good,"Baxter was a great company to work for and valued what it did and those that worked for it.  It was a fast-paced environment with multiple responsibilities and involved working with all aspects of the company.  Our department was lean and covered many aspects of market access and patient support, so often times we did not have the bandwidth to accomplish everything.  I worked with a wonderful team of individuals and had great direction and support from management.  "
good,It was a challengeing fast pace work place but was a overall fun place to work. My co workers and I become great friends and tend to even meet up outside of the work area. We would challenge each other to who could fill the most bags by the end of the night. I got a job award and was awarded a handler job which left me to run the line on most nights. It had its ups and downs but overall great job!
good,When I first started at Baxter it was VERY overwhelming. Going into a high production yielding company can be that way however. the trainers and supervision do give you the time you need to catch up to speed and learn your job very well before they leave you to it by yourself.

I always did what was necessary to complete my job in the correct way. Co workers did not specifically love my ambitious spirit, but that wasn't a matter that was relevant. My aim was always to conquer whatever task that was given. The hardest part of my job was taking breaks when needing to do so. I always have the desire to complete a task in a timely manner, but also carefully doing so. The most enjoyable part of my job was the four promotions within one year of working with this company.
