bad,"Your typical 9-5 cubicle grind where everyone isn't really happy or talking to each other. Very little to learn and the work itself was boring. The people there weren't as motivated as you would hope coming into work. "
bad,"Poor work environment due to poor management. Does not reward employees for going above and beyond on jobs performed. Health insurance is not best either. Union is not the best either. Otherwise the pay isn't bad for the area, but I would look elsewhere first."
bad,The management is all about themselves at one point in time they were all for the people   That isn’t the case anymore sad to say kdi was a good place to work
bad,People are thrown into management with no knowledge of what the people they manage do. The rules are often manipulated to favor the people in charge and employees are often asked to do things that are borderline unethical.
bad,"This company like many others dealing with EDS contracts are a slave to the prime.  Unrealistic goals, metrics and management with no backbone to stand up for you.  Really this career needs to be union,  prime could use a good strike to deal with.  But the morons that run the prime are the same morons nobody could stand when they worked for OEM’s.  Glad I got out of this shock and awe/reactive only career"
bad,Things were great until the merger.  Stay away from this place as all of the senior managers have been laid off.  Do not apply to any jobs here as HR is dishonest and does not have your back.
bad,"Challenging Environment"
bad,It would be a good place to work but she got a play their game if they don't like you they get rid of you trust me I was out on work with his calm for surgery on the foot came back 4 months later they lay me all that's not a good place to work for
bad,"One of the worst places you can work for. If you don't mind swimming in ink, drowning in water and having a screaming roar from the machines the entire time. Managers absolutely disrespects employees/temps with obscenities or throwing things if perfection is not achieved immediately. High turnover rate."
bad,"It’s shift against shift. "
bad,Management could careless about employees there is no work life balance and your job is always being threatened. There are few willing to do a good job
bad,"Trust no one ever! Poor management and HR is just as bad! I never worked for such a horrible company! Stay away. Very hard to get hired, it doesn't happen."
bad,Supervisor showed favoritism   If she didn’t like you were not       going to move up.  She promised position to me and give to someone who didn’t not preform.
bad,"BAD BAD! Management, to much favoritism and politics its just bad. Manager in the weld shop already has his little birds, he only give work to whoever he likes. QA thinks she know everything and brags that she’s does everything, but she’s nothing, because she’s always calling someone for answer or googling it.. If you want to succeed there , you better be the best behind  kisser there! Union sucks , well the unions reps are in favor of the managers there. So my point here is good pay and benefits but ITS A MUST THAT YOU NEED TO BE PART OF THE CLAN THEY GOT."
bad,"The managers are terrible. I am a Senior Engineer and they treat me like a kid. Terrible leadership and structure. They could not ever replace myself with the pay they are paying. I have to show the managers what to do all the time. Management could use some training."
bad,"Do not work here no matter how desperate you are. Management is extremely rude and has little regard for its employees, same goes for group leaders etc. There is no respect , and no matter how hard you work it doesnt matter because they dont acknowledge it. Extremely toxic work environment...dont care about employees."
bad,"Harris Corp targets experienced employees with policies that are meant to discriminate.  They prefer new hires to save $$$."
bad,Company placed member in an environment without support and no clear expectations of work. Left company after only 4 months of work due to lack of management involvement. Company more worried about getting that contract versus taking care of its people.
bad,Horrible management everyone is liars and deceitful with the exception of a few people who were put down for not being a liar and deceitful it was an overall horrible experience working there
bad,"Leadership from United Technologies (UTC)  was a mistake to bring on. Fighting amongst leadership destroyed morale."
bad,My work there was steady and long. The management heads were special people. I would suggest working the 4/10 schedule for those who would want to work it
bad,"While it is important to hire and support our military families, it is also imperative to offer employment to the local workforce, instead of bringing people from around the country to fill the vacancies. Most of the jobs (not specialized) can be learned by anyone with a high school diploma. Harris does not care about putting the local community to work - they are willing to pay moving expense among other perks just to keep the same people they already have, but yet make it look like they are doing a lot of hiring with these targeted job adverts. I went to a job fair a couple years ago and did not have a star (no veteran pref/clearance) on my name badge, thereby was determined undesirable and no one talked to me at any of the 8 or so tables. Was truly embarrassing."
bad,"Atm in patchouge NY is a horrible place to work. Machine shop is run by a absolute lunatic.every other manager is horrible and not qualified for their position. They pay garbage with horrible advancement. "
bad,No development and very low pay.  Benefits sucked.  What else is there to say.  I did not enjoy working for this company.  They do not care about employees
bad,"Work depends on the contract that you are assigned, can be good or bad. Sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you do not, it is what it is. Some groups of people can be fun!"
bad,"Great company and staff to work for, Mission focused and supportive of both the client and employee. Would work with this company again. Was a great experience."
bad,"Harris has a poor training program, they throw you into the fire and watch you sink or swim if your able to tread water they dump more work on you until they drown you."
bad,Horrible company bad management treated employees always bad a hostile work enviroment. Management was not there to help not any career advancement. It was poorly organized overall
bad,"Kept me busy."
bad,This company has the most hateful HR group I've ever encountered in my life they aggressively hut ways to beat employees down to try to terminate them they do not try to help in anyway shape or form and the yak like you're a nuisance more than anything.  If I had a choice and I'm not just speaking for myself but many of us really hate this company with a passion because of what they stand for and they do not practice what they preach whatsoever they do retaliation against employees and aggressively try to find things you do wrong
bad,Great benefits but the company overall does not treat their engineers that well. The mindset on keeping engineers has been unfortunate. They want to work their team to the bone and not compensate them for their efforts
bad,Terrible culture with ignorant people allowed to take control. People form an opinion of people and if don't like you actively try to sabotage you and seek your dismissal
bad,"This company has no regard for families. They will force you to work 12 hrs a day 7 days a week. They think they can run an aircraft maintenance operation like a factory, totally disregarding safety."
bad,Did not have a positive experience when employed there. Found several employees argumentative and they would go out of their way to make on-boarding more difficult.
bad,"In a typical day you were tasked to complete work that had been sitting around in someone's desk for over two years which was now due within a day.  Training for the tasks assigned were non-existent.  The benefits are at a bare minimum.  The emergent environment and lack of training created an unnecessarily stressful work environment.  Most employees have short tempers because they are not happy.  Huge turn-around in staff due to a combination of unnecessary emergencies and lack of recognition for handling the constant stressors. Reactive environment vs proactive, even when situations presented to be handled as proactive."
bad,"The people in Management are very racist, and showcase their racism without thinking twice about it. Some people are very nice and some people are extremely rude."
bad,"Not comfortable commenting. The hours are extreme, the culture is evolving from a strict military style to a everyday business environment. Lower level management is not valued"
bad,"The first year was great, but it went downhill fast from there. Every year there was at least one lay off.  Growth opportunity was non-existent with the company and yearly raises did not even keep up with the cost of living.  In fact, I began to make less every year due to rising insurance premiums and inflation."
bad,"warehouse management is the worse, lack experience and education the management is bias and only look out for themselves. Leadership needs better training"
bad,"This place has the angriest, most bitter employees I have ever witnessed in my thirty year career. Everyone is perpetually nasty and complaining about their jobs. It translates blatantly into the quality of their work and customers notice entirely. We are rapidly losing contracts to competitors and widespread layoffs are inevitable. I cannot stand another day here and advise everyone reading this to stay as far away as possible to save your sanity and careers."
bad,"Programs are always delayed, underfunded and fraught with errors. There are zero continuing education or process improvement initiatives, and employees are perpetually unmotivated. People here are enamored with status quo; they love to float by and will viciously destroy the career of anyone with drive and work ethic. Save yourself the headache of a lifetime and stay as far away from this woeful ""company"" as possible."
bad,Promised all kinds of money. Wast satisfied with way this place is ran. No structure what so ever.                        Should have stayed at my last employer.
bad,"L-3 Aviation Recorders in Sarasota, Florida has the most Ethics complaints filed by employees of ALL of the Divisions.  "
bad,I would not go back to that work place unless management is replace. Human resources was also not freindly and did not care about their hourly employees
bad,Used to be a decent place to work.  What they lacked in pay scale they made up for in benefits.  Since they switched insurance companies they no long can justify the poor pay scale.
bad,Keep your head down and don't voice an opinion. Do as your told and you'll be ok. Don't cross the good ol' boy club. Keep doing the same process for 20's years ago.
bad,"They are the better paying companies in the area, but short lived when they downsize.  They treat managment with high regards and do not respect the lower paying employees."
bad,Stay away from this company. Management is very confrontational. They monitor employees on CCTV through out the facility. Can't Trust management.
bad,"This was my first job on the East Coast of the US (which I took a big pay-cut for, but was told it was worth it)... I nearly moved right back out West. I stayed for 8 or 9 months, tried to give it the ""benefit of the doubt"", but management was entirely incompetent. Having been in this field for over ten years, I have picked up a few tips and tricks... Made some suggestions to management that would help the whole of Harris, resolving issues before people even called in, and I was SCOLDED for this. Their reasoning was that ""we need those phone calls""... that's right-- they are more interested in job security than they are resolving issues."
bad,"Management is a nightmare, work is scattered and not organized.  You never knew on any given day if you were to be fired.Took an $8K paycut just to leave company."
bad,"every day ones integrity was challenged with most co-workers failing.  Work life balance did not exist, moral was bad and no team."
bad,"Not enough personnel to sufficiently support 23,000 people. No work/life balance. Expectation is the job before family, health, and continuing education. Company benefits are comparable to other large organizations.  No advancement recommended or encouragement to gain education/certifications.  Manager is uneducated, rude, and threatens employees. Culture is the buddy system and not weighed on hard work and dedication."
bad,"This is not a very pleasant group to work with."
bad,A typical day at work/week is 12/7 management care nothing for workers.
bad,"My Customers are unlike any other.   I 'll bet   you soon find it  the most enjoyable job  you ever had. You will find it hard not to  express your feelings daily."
bad,I went to work and reported at 6:00 am and worked 8 hours and clocked out.
bad,"I worked too many hours, with next to no benefits for the hours I put in."
bad,"I worked with many employees who were very intelligent - PhD's, scientists, etc., which was very educational."
bad,"Lots of work, repetitive job, no raises, promotion, or growth."
bad,Is just a matter of time before Management places you under the wheels of the bus. L-3 STRATIS would much rather bring on more people at less money. No respect for experience.
bad,"I was sexually harassed BY MY BOSS and then bullied by his boss.    The people that work there hate it, my employees loved me, miss me, still call me, Out of 25 employees each one has expressed their appreciation of my management style and genuine interest in the improvement of their quality of work which leads to a work team that will do anything that is asked, its not that hard, people!  Show respect!"
bad,"The ethics at this company is non-existant to say the least.  Work by word of mouth and not engineering.  I was a contractor in crestview, brought in to help get them back on track.  Was laid off due to lack of work after i exposed critical errors in processes and procedures while investigating a customer return on flight safety parts.  I wouldnt recommend this company to my worst enemy."
bad,"This is a bad company to work for.. They lay off people without any notice, send people home without pay."
bad,"This is by far the WORST company to ever work for if you are contacted. ..and their KCMO office is just that. If you like being stressed about making numbers that are beyond your control of making, a supervisor that is always so high on prescription pills she can't function, or a company that will tell you they will fix problems after having group meetings just to keep you quiet and NEVER DO ANYTHING about the issues, or working your behind off and not receiving a raise nor advancement. ..THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!!!!!"
bad,"They do not benefit for the employee at all. There is no room for advancement, Buddy system within management, pay rate change without notification or review. Only good part of working for this company was I was there for the support of our troops"
bad,"Unidyne is a poor place to work for. It does not respect its veterans and the management is still very close minded. The job is different which makes it interesting, but there is very little room for advancement. This is a job that should be paid at PV wages and is paid at just above minimum wage."
bad,"Not competitive compensation, they will low-ball you."
bad,There is no longer a work life balance. Management expectation is that employees work extra time for no compensation. Culture is hostile toward employees. Pay is currently running 10-20% behind industry average without including the mandatory extra time w/o compensation.
bad,"I was fired because my production level was not to their satisfaction. I was only written up once on paper for not signing timesheet at 7 am instead after the morning meeting. Which I corrected! I was verbally counsoled on being 5 minutes late from break once and back from lunch once by 8 minutes. One PIP which was later invalid because the supervisor at the time was fired, Another PIP was written up on me but I never completed it! So i have nothing good to say about them. well other then they did hire me. Which I am very thankful for. Oh PIP means personal improvement plan.If you don't know what nitpicky is you'll find out!"
bad,I would rather not review this company.
bad,"l-3 does not take care of there employees,they work you to death,and when you get hurt at work they do not give you compensation,then they ask you if you want fired or retirement,either way they dont help"
bad,L-3 has a good repuation so I thought? But after working for L-3 for only 3 months and being wrongfully terminated I would not recommend anyone I know to work for L-3 Vertex Aerospace.
bad,Horrible Project Manager equals very poor support system.  There is zero support for the employees.  Zero quality of life.  Zero open communication.  Everyone that works there is miserable
bad,Decent pay if you can get connected with management. The company is very political.  Middle management is very self-serving. Lot's of layoffs and volatility.  You can probably find a better company.
bad,"Severe lack of continuity within a poorly structured management system. Continuous hostel aggressive actions against employees."
bad,Struggled everyday as the rules changed from day to day.  No management in place to make decisions.  Must be very flexible to work there.  I handled whatever came my way no matter how many times the rules changed.
bad,I am a former employee and left due to the toxic culture. Sexual harassment is the norm there along with nepotism and overall laziness by management. Mandatory overtime always with zero appreciation for the few people that actually work there.
bad,"L3 is managed by incompetent people. They are notorious for doing the same thing over and over and expect different outcomes. Their expectations of their employees usually leads to people getting hurt. They don't provide safety gear, no MSDS data sheets, they don't comply w/ OSHA regulations. They label tasks as 2 man jobs and expect one person to accomplish the task. You will be on call and be expected to work 20 hours. They don't care about your safety, health, or welfare."
bad,L3harris is a terrible place to work.   Unless your a diversity candidate don’t bother applying.   I’ve worked here my entire career and the culture is changing from a world class treating the employees right to short term financial gain politically correct train wreck.
bad,"There was a lot of great culture, overtime it went down hill fast. There were some stand up people there, all universally over worked. Just stay away, the drama is not worth it."
bad,I was there 18 years and it was sad how people were treated.Management. didnt really know there people  woek knowledge or experience  and which led to a hostile work environment  especially with the leads. Who could break all the rules yet enforcing them on the assemblets
bad,Poor management.  No real focuse on the future products. Bad decisions on what products should be developed and which ones are not.  Very high turn over in employees.  Most people know it is not a good place to work so it is very hard for them to hire talented personal.
bad,"Management is passive agressive and the company discriminates against those with Disabilities, Veterans, Over 40, and will do everything to get rid of employees making higher salaries.  I was fired even though I was a Disabled Veteran and on FMLA.  I also happen to be an employee 49 years at the time."
bad,"Different name now but still Honeywell treatment and mentality."
bad,Management could not be trusted they would go out of there way to make things bad. I was told not to talk to anybody and no body that worked there really talked to each other and you had to really watch your back side.
bad,"This company has terrible management. I started having issues as soon as I became permanent. Drama filled department, favoritism, no respect, and poor HR."
bad,"What was once a great company with a superior reputation is now a shell of it's former self, focused solely on profit and dividends for the stock holders.  The atmosphere is caustic.  Employees are treated as commodities, no different than the components used in the manufacture of its products.  Raises are minimal, and are often postponed.  Perks are non-existent, and benefits are being reduced year by rear.  Morale is quite low, as a few people do the majority of the work for all, and management holds no one to a standard or any level of responsibility."
bad,Not much to do there very boring if you have no work they make you sit in the caf I did not like it I like fast pace work I would not recommend to work there if you are lazy that place is good for you
bad,Lots of  change the majority of the people are very nice and friendly but that is about as good as it gets. Lots of pressure to get things done even if it has nothing to do with your department
bad,There is no way to move up or become permanent unless you are an aerospace engineer. Also the work is based on government budgets so you will show up and do nothing all day and then get in trouble because you showed up and had nothing to do. Too much corporate/military bureaucracy and nothing ever gets done.
bad,"I would like to seriously warn anyone thinking of coming to this company, especially if someone is calling you to join the Ops Academy. Run for you life, away from anything this company tries to offer you, because a large portion of those promises will be lies. If you are crazy enough to work in the field, they WILL overwork you, they WILL NOT train you, and they WILL expect the impossible out of you, EVERY day. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I was put in absolutely dangerous situations. Doing major installs without ever having worked with electricity, one wrong move and I could have killed myself especially with the amount of amps and volts we work around. My director is easily the biggest schemer and the  scummiest little guy I have ever met. I have never had a job with as much admin work as this, and I was once an administrative assistant. I will say that I have learned more here than any other company, but it was at the cost of my personal life, my health, and honestly my soul. Please heed the warning and go to a company that will appreciate your work. Level 3 might have been decent at one time, but they have gotten so large that everyone is just a title, a metric. Find a company that will treat you like a human."
bad,"I use to love coming to work everyday until I refused to become the friend of my Manager. Ever since then personal feelings come into discussions at work and completely get in the way. The environment for certain Managers is very toxic. Our Senior Manager talks about other Managers to their employees, she tries to force herself into her lower level managers personal lives and when told that they should maintain a professional relationship, the Manager gets angry and sends out threatening emails. Complaints to HR go unanswered so you get no help there. Horrible place to work for!!!!"
bad,"Corporate culture is pathetic.  What you know isn't as important as who you align yourself with. Be sure to pick the right manager to schmooze or your career will go nowhere. Never offer an opinion, especially if it is in any way unfavorable about the current process. Most of the managers I interacted with were incapable of adequately performing their jobs but were very good at passing the buck. I saw excellent people let go because of sequestration while sub-par people were kept. Pay is low, no training provided, no job security.  My department may not be indicative of the whole company but it was very poorly managed and I cannot recommend it to anyone."
bad,"The moto is ""Assured Communications"" and communication is absolutely non-existent!! Was interviewed for a permanent position and was hired as a temp. Vastly overqualified for the position and instead of finding a better fit was let go with the statement ""I think you're just too smart for this job."""
bad,"No advancement, no training other than mandatory company covering itself, not open to new ideas. Claims that people are important, but continually shows that employees are just drones, and should not be given opportunities."
bad,"Management is a joke.  The facilities department is ran by a group of idiots that have kissed and sucked their way to  manager row.  Unskilled people get the promotions.  If you are a mormon that will help your advancement.  They will lie to your face.  Get what they can from you and cut you loose to save their own jobs.  You will be held accountable for your bosses decision of it is wrong.  If he happens to be right, you will receive no credit or praise.  Bonuses are dangled in front of you but never given to anyone that isn't management. "
bad,I worked ther a long time ago. I am unsure how it is to work there now. At that time we were constantly moved from one project to another. move was based on need not engineers skills.
bad,"If you like doing favors for your supervisor only for them to take credit for it this place is for you.  If you do everything possible to be the best in your area only for your supervisor to tell you that you’ll never be promoted this place is definitely the place to be. If you like no quality of life and preferential treatment, working  for others to get promoted, having a supervisor who will use their employees to rise in the ranks, I highly recommend it.  Unethical and enables unethical conducts from management and HR.  If you like it so far you will also enjoy the benefits which was probably the only thing I thought was 5 stars."
bad,"Management is all new, grossly overpaid, and know everything.   Workers with decades of experience don't know anything.  Management is running the company into the ground.   The company is extremely top heavy and would stab grandma in the back to move up a rung on the ladder.  All the knowledgeable people have left, been forced out, or retired."
bad,"Very fast passed and a lot of OT. Benefits are great, Plenty of work. Heavy customer demands. They offer 401K, dental, vision, STD and LTD and plenty of vacation and sick time"
bad,A very hostel environment . not enough pay for the amount of work you do. Supervisor will address issues that need to be addressed. Employees are rude its not a plesent environment to work in at all !!!!
bad,"I have been here for close to 3 years. Have great coworkers that help out a lot. Problem about the place is the upper management and how they want things to be done. There is no training and you are thrown in to a situation to sink or swim. If you work too fast you may end up getting sent home early. If you work too slow the higher ups will get on you. If your not a staff at the company, they won’t trust you to do your work properly. Not everyone is bad at the company, but there’s just a lot of things they can improve. They like to stick to their old ways even if the method is really out dated. Only way to be hire on here is if your willing to be there for 7 years or when they think your ready."
bad,"Terrible company. Don't even think for a second about working for L-3. Managers are supper aggressive towards employees. Layoffs every 3 months, and twice and many people quit."
bad,"horrible company to work for,  management continues to pile on report after report with no regard to workload.  there is minimal team work. many of the managers seem like they are there just to promote themselves. and HR sides with management when you bring up concerns about work/life balance and fair treatment"
bad,"If you want a place you can count on, keep looking. They do lay-offs every few years and it doesn't matter how hard you work. If you kiss butt, then you can stay (buying managers gold watches...)"
bad,Terrible Management ... Excessive overtime that is expected with Manager leaving early in the day !  No job security here ... My best advise would be to keep looking and find a company that appreciates its employees and knows how to communicate in a professional manner !!!
bad,"People are treated unfairly and management sucks in all areas! Would not recommend to anyone I know to work for this company. If  you have any problems HR will not come to your defense nor will the union because they both work against the employee, it depends on who you know and race matters."
bad,"The work was OK, nothing too hard but the people are horrible. Management does nothing, and the people under them are all after each other all the time. Its like a gossip mill for people out of high school. Everyone tries to get anyone new fired if they don't fit the stereotype. Manager knows and still does nothing, just goes through employees one after another."
bad,"this company in Mirabel Quebec does not consider suppliers as partners they consider them as the competition. Very poor respect with supplier, buyers are arrogant and not honest. Same can be said about quality that does not respect suppliers"
bad,Departments are not adequately staffed and sufficient training is not provided.  Poor work/life balance.  Employees are expected to work while on vacation or taking time off.  Management makes poor decisions and no effort is made to retain good employees.  The HR department is weak and does not support employees in a fair manner.  Definitely not the same Harris company it was 5 or 6 years ago.
bad,"I was a career Exelis employee and the company was great! Harris bought Exelis and many have lost their jobs to make room for incompetent Harris people and policies."
bad,"Stiff, overbearing corporate management.  The Harris way is the only way of doing things.  Harris acquired our company and has basically mismanaged a program that was strong and profitable."
bad,"Unless you are best ""buddies"" with or related to one of the main cliques, you can forget any advancement, decent raise, recognition or even winning something at a Christmas party, lol.  Yes, it's THAT BAD.  Barely 5% of engineers/managers even have a degree of any kind, are promoted from the floor into higher level positions such as engineering or management, and they wonder why the company is being run in the ground."
bad,"Poor communication, Poorly managed, Large staff turnover, Retaliates against employees who express valid concerns, Management staff that do not have college degrees and do not treat employees with dignity or respect, Discrimination against people that have not served in the military. Mostly under 40 people work at this location, only concerned with earning a profit at the expense of their employees. You do not want to work at the Nashville location."
bad,"Had an awful time working for this company, specially after the new VP of quality joined and 75% of the staff quit because of her attitudes and the QA manager behaviors. No respect to anyone. Everyone reported her to HR and nothing changed. Stay away from this division!!!!!"
bad,"not very productive in time management,management seems to have a power struggle going on,the breaktimes are usually good but there is not much time for lunch considerring the long walk"
bad,"Management is unprofessional at best. They talk poorly of the employees to other employees. No confidentiality whatsoever. "
bad,"This was the worst expierence of my life."
bad,"take a lower paying job, it will be worth it in the long run, L-3 CSW does not have clue what they are doing."
bad,"Management creates a hostile work environment where retaliation is the norm, even though it is supposedly against the law."
bad,Flexible with schedules but not with personal life. Management is uncertain at times. Pay is terrible. I was laid off for going on a mission trip that was planned a year in advance.
bad,"Unethical management. Work environment is hostile. Rewarded based on being a member of the ""good ole' boys club"" and not on merit."
bad,"I would not want to work for this company again. L-3 wrongfully terminated me for refusing to perform maintenance tasks due to not having the required ground support equiptment and maintenance stands, and fly away gear readily available. The work ethics and the harassment on nthe jobs occurs daily and the upper mainagement could carec less."
bad,"Very un-organized, no job advancement, They don't know how to treat people. Not honest."
bad,Very little job security - age discrimination prevalent - 50 year old and above need not apply
bad,"Like many corporations today, this company suffers from poor leadership from the top down. They solely focus on shareholders’ value and achieving short term revenue goals. It doesn't take long after you start working to realize the flexible work hours really means come in early and leave late, unlimited sick time isn't meant to be used by the lower level employees, and briefings about how much the management team cares for their employees is just for show. The employees are not seen as people and there is no empathy exercised by managers. The pay is competitive but this is only done out of necessity to counter the high turn-over rate. I worked there years ago and still see the same positions advertised over and over, every 6 months to a year. You would think they would learn that it doesn't matter how much money they offer, the work environment is just to toxic to survive working in for any considerable amount of time. The company has such great potential but will surely fail due to their short sightedness and lack of empathy for their employees. On a good note, they do have nice modern day facilities and technology."
bad,"Management clickish, always take off dont say where they are going daily, liars, will make up stuff to get you fired. Keep things from you so you can't complete an order, offer correct way of labeling to show whats in boxes to help your productivity and customers, goes in one ear and out the other."
bad,"If someone goes to HR about you, make sure you go crying to them as well. Because, if you don't , they'll. Never ask your side of the story , and not even give you a reason for termination.    Very poor biast HR"
bad,Was constantly harassed by a few nasty people.and it’s funny when you’ve finally had enough and complained about it you were the one laid off ! But losing that job was the best thing that ever happened to me !
bad,"Management constantly lied to us, did safety meetings just to cover their butts not that they cared for the workers.If you showed up for work on time and was always there,it didn’t matter because they treated you the same as the ones who were always late or just didn’t show up at all!!! One of the worst companies I’ve ever had the misfortune of working for."
bad,Management is horrible. Training is for relatives and white employees. Train one or two blacks so you will not call racism. Management will not get off its butt to secure contracts. Most of there day is spent smoking and gossiping about other employees. Used to be better until some undeserving people were put in higher positions. Pay is not competitive unless you are liked(white or a relative).
bad,Employees are working near the radiation lab that could cause serious health problem.  Most of the people are working their from ages and they don't like any new ideas.   Human Resources also take management sides.
bad,L3 CSE has been in business a long time. That being said they seem to be ineffective at adapting to a more modern business model. Senior management has struggled to adapt to changing customer preferences.
bad,"Your typical day is frantic between fighting fires and working several projects in parallel. Staffing is too small for all of the programs so little headway can be made on each program. The new business model is making this problem worse. Frustrations run high with most of the staff. "
bad,I had to make grammar and spelling corrections on my managers reviews of my performance.  She seemed to have about a 6th grade education.  Manager was racist and seemed to have a personal grudge on me.
bad,"This is a classic example of a bad manager destroys a department.  The company, in an effort to begin consolidation of divisions appointed a non-manager type into the IT manager role.  This was a push to primarily allow corporate to have a direct connect to a hardware infrastructure person without having to go through a department manager for scheduling of tasks, etc.  As such a large gap in management of personnel within the department occurred.  Within 2 years, relocation of facilities began as will as non-announcement lay offs.  This appears, per google, to be a basic construct of L-3 in the treatment of employees.  The first group to go where on averse in their mid-50's with younger personnel being asked if they would like to relocate."
bad,"If you're looking for inovation and fresh ideas this isn't the place. They are stuck in the mud hole of the past, tools and process I was using 25 years ago are the norm. Mangers are in their on boat and don't want anyone to rock it."
bad,"Worst Company I have ever worked for. HR incompetent. Management weak and uninspired. Backstabbing between Engineering, Operations, and Program Management. Incompetence at all levels. The Company is so cheap that they got rid of free drinks one day a week."
bad,They laid off half the employees within three months of buying the place. They overpaid for the company and tried to salvage their investment by reducing the workforce. Their policy is to hire and fire based on current needs. Not a good choice for a long term career
bad,"Available advancement with in the work place,training towards job performance,given on the job  training given,very safe working environment.very good supervision."
bad,"If you hate your family, don't like to sleep, don't mind people who aren't even half-trained working on aircraft, or will do anything for a buck, this is your place. 12-hour days M-F; ""volunteer"" for Saturday, and 8-10 hours on Sunday is a normal week. And that's not to do the job you're hired for, it's to do any job (on any airframe, qualified or not) on the contract. Launch, recover, change tires, LOX, inspect (but please don't actually find anything on an inspection), tow, wash, jack, lube, ""trouble-shoot"" (whether qualified, experienced, certified..... or not), repair, replace, rig (again, experience or training doesn't matter, just do it. Now), back-shop parts, forms work, computer work (just show hours for this, not actual ""time accounting""), cannibalize (actually, cannibalization requires paperwork and documentation, so just walk over there and take it off that jet, but don't write it up), and don't forget about the depot-level work being done at the intermediate level two hangars over. "
bad,I would never want work for this company ever again. There is so much back stabbing that goes on in that company that you never know who you can trust.
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone! management would threaten your job. the work load was miss managed. No one could keep up with the work load in a 50 hour week. my co-worker were in tears many times.
bad,Don't work for this company. Good old boy environment. Has many old retired military men in their seventies. Little or no minorities in exec management level. Only certain chosen white males are promoted and receive big bonuses.
bad,"If I didn't have to give L3 a star for management I wouldn't! It's that simple, they have a lack of communication skills if your not there favorite. (The Greenville Location)"
bad,"Absolutely the worst job I've had with L-3. I've worked for L-3 before at other locations, and it's been great. However, the ""aircraft mechanic"" position with T-1 COMBS on Randolph AFB was the worst job experience Ive had with the company. First of all once your hired you'll quickly find out that there aren't any aircraft to work on. The position is basically a supply job and very little of what I did was aircraft related. On top of that, the pay the very low, in fact it's the lowest pay I've received as an experienced A&P mechanic and there is absolutely no overtime, I once got counseled for clocking in early. There also a lot of gossip there. After about a week working there I noticed that QA and the manager would often trash talk about the other employees there, very unprofessional for a manager to do that. On my very first day the COMBS manager told me that my supervisor was incompetent and ""weird"" and that i should try to avoid him. I personally don't like to talk about people behind their back and I chose to avoid getting into conversations with the QA and manager unless it pertained to work. As a result they made me feel unwelcome and uncomfortable at work. I began looking for another job the same week I started. Thank goodness I was able to find something else."
bad,"It was 5-1/2 weeks before I got a computer and a cubicle to work from.  I was promised I would be busy all day long, but the work never came.  It was the most boring place I have ever worked.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"Run...don't walk...run away."
bad,"There are a lot of problems with Harris.  To start, expect to sit in an office ignored for the first 6 months of working there.  Second, managers pick the employees they want working for them.  Any manager worth their weight will have engineers lining up to work for them.  Bad managers will not be able to find anyone to work for them and will be forced to make a request for workers from HR.  HR will then assign a new hire.  "
bad,"Management has no values, integrity or ethics. Worst management team I have ever worked with. Extremely high turnover. A churn and burn environment."
bad,"no work, managers suck, hardest part of job was not being board. "
bad,"this company has a continuously running add for EA's and most other posisitions. they dont value their employees, telecom is a dime a dozen, lots of competition and people are very cut throat due to being under so much pressure... If you get a job, you will most likely get laid off too... so dont waste your time"
bad,Hostile work environment. Needs trained leaders running the company.
bad,"If you're ok with being a long-tern temp, this employer may work for you. However, they are not what I would ever consider a stable gig. They will not reward your loyalty and high performance with stability, you're just a number here, so always have a backup gig if you take one of there positions."
bad,"When I started at L3T it was the best job and everyone worked as a team.  Then top management changed and out with the old and in with the new. Then the merger of equals...more like Harris bought L3 and more management changes, not for the good.   That team spirit in the office is no more."
bad,"L3Harris is the worst place I have ever worked. This is the first time in my over 30 years of employment where it is accepted and encouraged for employees to harass their coworkers. Even after going to human resource, nothing was done and retaliation started occurring even from the HR department."
bad,"Because mgmt is lacking in knowledge of tasks they offer very little support in the daily workload. They're response to everything is ""just get it done"" without knowing how or what it takes to get the job done. Mgmt doesn't stand behind their employees."
bad,"after 4 years with this company working my butt off on 2 shifts being the only tech. i broke my ankle and my manager tried to hire out my position and when i was cleared medically after 4 months. i returned for 1 week and was put on immediate unpaid suspension while they did some investigation that they would not even tell me about. i was on unpaid suspension for a total of 3 months with no pay trying to force me to quit and get a new job, which did not work by the way. they started paying me just to catch me up to the first 2 week of the suspension and then terminated me once they did, not a good company"
bad,"Harris turned on a new ERP system in July that does not conform to our operations at the Clifton facility.  Everyone is complaining, people leaving our department for jobs either in other areas of the company or outside of the company.  Worst experience in my 25+ years career in Planning."
bad,"Working at L3 was exhausting. Forced to work overtime all the time and every shift was full of drama and stress due to poor management. Far more waste than what is reasonable for a defense contractor. Burnout was high as the company capitalized on overtime to increase profits on government projects. If you can get PTSD from a job, this is the place where that is most likely to happen. Toxic!"
bad,This job was not for me. The only reason i am filling this out is to move on to the next step of this bloody application.
bad,Organization is cut throat and incompetent.  Great place to work if you like to hide and not take responsibility.  Management clueless and expects you to provide them with your ideas so they can take credit for them.  Terrible work/life balance.  Expected to work 60+ hours and weekends without reward or recognition.
bad,Upper management has run the company into the ground. The other divisions under performance caused the Ga location to shut down. No way to advance even when obtaining higher education.
bad,"Toxic work environment"
bad,"I have been involved in Harris Corp (once known as Exelis and ITT Gilfillan). This was once a ""family"" environment; we all worked hard, but also played together. Harris Corp bought us out in June 2015 and the moral and stress level has become unbearable."
bad,"Bad management in my group but other groups may be ok.  Leadership never around, disorganized, tasks never defined, complete chaos.  Major reorganization. People are leaving left and right   Enjoyable part of the job are the talented employees."
bad,"The ethics program was used as an incentive for employees to ""rat out"" other employees. An accusation was as good as a conviction."
bad,Contract written to bind site growth and production. Takes forever to get supplies to keep production on time. Way to many middle men in any decision lane. Micro-managed. Employees are driven but expendable to management.
bad,"Great work life balance and vacation and 401k, but a very low pay and bad middle and upper management cancel that out. You're just a cog in the chain at Harris. Promotions take too long, and raises don't keep up with inflation."
bad,One of the worst companies I've ever worked for! Management is very unprofessional and unethical. The people in manufacturing are the most hateful and spiteful people I've ever had the misfortune to work with. HR is useless and will not help to resolve any problems. Stay clear of this place!
bad,"Pros"
bad,"People are treated differently, very high employee turnover ratio, used very old technologies, hesitant to make change...etc...No diversity at all."
bad,Treat people like children.  Micromanage every minute of your day.  One of the worst working environments of my life. Can't recommend them to anyone.
bad,managers nearly functionally illiterate.  Micromanagement of everything you do every second of the day.  Felt like I was back in grade school where I had to raise my hand and show one or two fingers to go to the bathroom.  Management has absolutely NO respect for employees.
bad,Production supervisors only concern with dress code and attendance.  Coworkers are expected to train you.  People are of every age and will tattle on you if you sneeze to loud.  They want statements for everymove you make.  The union that recently got in place is no help at all. Good luck and may god bless.
bad,Management encourages a combative work environment. Human Resources selectively enforces ethics rules and other company policies. Too much favoritism.
bad,No real direction. Either you are in the crowd or you're not. Lots of backstabbing.
bad,"The culture at Harris is that of a typical DoD business.  There is so much margin the product and as long as they have orders everything is good and the good old boys are happy.  However, due to the sequestration and an over all cut in military spending there has been a major fall out in staff.  Trying to get into the commercial market is a real eye opener as to how inefficient they really are. The reason being is that they are finding out the good old boys don't know what they are doing.  Most directors and managers are on a Key incentive program / bonus.  Thats not a bad thing unless you abandoned all good business practices and engineering principles just so you can say the project is done and get your bonus!  Not cool.  Most of the hard work gets done behind the scenes by new hires who never get the credit!"
bad,It use to be a good company.  It's not anymore.  Co-workers were good.  They just had a couple rounds of layoffs.  Several more are leaving on their own.  The work environment has been terrible during all of 2013.
bad,"I have been there for over 11 years. This company has flexible hours but almost impossible to advance your career. Most of the employees here are over the age of 50 and have been here for more than 15 years. There are a few smart ones that the company cannot function without, but most of them rely on union to protect their job when it comes to layoffs. More importantly, most of the engineers have no clue on what they are doing and just bidding their time to retire."
bad,I basically had to train myself. The current employees were unhelpful to say the least.
bad,"I worked for a call center that was owned by L-3 Communications. The environment there was decent, but the contract I worked on (Synapse) was a complete and total joke. You handle inbound customer calls where your objective is to convince the persons calling to stick with there magazine subscriptions even though the whole purpose of them calling is to cancel. You attempt to do this by offering various lousy (at best) incentives that will hopefully convince the poor person to keep the magazine subscription that they probably did not even legitimatelly sign up for. SYNAPSE IS A TOTAL JOKE. GOOGLE SYNAPSE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!!!"
bad,"L-3 Communications is a defense contractor with various operations in Tulsa, OK. Level 3 Communications Is a tier one fiber optics telecommunication transport provider, corporate base in Broomfield, CO with major operations in Tulsa, OK. Level 3 prohibits their employees from referring to their company by the name ""L-3""."
bad,"No work life balance, job best suited for someone that does not need to go home.  95% travel so it is hard to make appointments and such. Military base culture with poor management."
bad,"Bad place to work ...not a secure place to work...Too many layoffs."
bad,Lack of knowledge by most workers on proper procedures for maintaining the AH-64D/E Apache helicopter. Most hourly employees purposely work slow so they can be put on overtime to get paid more money. Having worked on Apache Helicopter in the Army for 30 years I have never seen a more disorganized and knowledgeable organization. Main reason they lost the contract at Fort Rucker
bad,Get rid of the kid playing vp
bad,"First of all to the defense of my coworkers and my lead, they were awesome. We worked very well together. Management on the other hand gave conflicting instructions, changed course daily and in general displayed unprofessional, incompetent behavior. I took the leadership role and the project came in on time even though was started several months behind schedule. I also discovered that as a company there is a lot of backbiting and competition between the Project Management staff due to so many mergers and people trying to keep their jobs. Seems like only the strong (people that are politically connected) survive. As a corporation, I suggest they should take a closer look at their leadership."
bad,"Good old boy network, you have to be one to fit in.  Work ethics are one sided."
bad,They hired me to backfill a position in Afghanistan then notified me that the position was being eliminated a week after I arrived at my site.
bad,"It seems that management has given the mandatory HR training sessions higher priority than customer deliverables. Perhaps that works for government contracting, but in the commercial market - that's a great way to lose customers. Harris now wants to apply their government contracting successes to their commercial markets. I wonder how long it will take them to realize that ""time and materials"" billing doesn't work for fixed priced contracts. I learned more about what a business should NOT do at Harris than anywhere else I have worked. The Dilbert cartoon could easily take place at Harris. I think the military term for this type of operation is a ""Charlie Foxtrot""."
bad,"Director of contracts is terrible to work for, and has no concept of how to treat his staff.  Company uses an MRP system that is overly complex and very difficult to process orders efficiently.  Level of staffing is very low, lacking the number of employees needed to accomplish the tasks at hand.  Turn over is very high, and most of the staff is unhappy and looking for other opportunities."
bad,"I worked for Harris for 5 yrs, I had as many managers, not one of them really knew what I did all day, great for me until performance reviews came around cause then it was 2.5% for everyone!! Harris has grown faster than management can handle so now it’s just a huge ship floating in space looking for a direction. HR is pushing to hire fresh young minds right out of high school an college."
bad,"Just stay away."
bad,The area I was in was ok. Nothing to write home about. I've heard it is a lot different now. It has been so long since I was there I couldn't really give you that much insight.
bad,"Years and years go by and employees are not trained, career development and talent growth seem to be a luxury few or none are provided. Many of the promoted strive in the highest level of incompetence."
bad,management likes leadership skills from top down.  No appreciation for family.  Terrible at assessing skills of workforce.  Lack of focus on diversity in leadership roles.
bad,The company likes to push the over time so they can get the task completed before the deadline and then lay everyone off for a couple of weeks.  This cycle repeats over and over again until everyone gets tired of it and quit.
bad,Very disorganized. There are more managers than employees under them.  Example:  I have 4 managers and I am the only one working....
bad,"A typical day at work was to reinvent the wheel, meetings all day long, action items from meetings, reports, metrics, answer same questions over and over across multiple departments. But not ever really doing work."
bad,I work on several projects.  I've learned a lot since I've been here.  The hardest part of this job is the hours are long.  The best part of the job is I enjoy what I'm doing.  It's not stressful for me.
bad,"Travail très ennuyeux et répétitif du a des gestionnaires incompétents qui préfèrent être en meeting plutôt que sur le plancher de l'usine."
bad,People talk about each other very hostile facilities definitely needs better management. Place is full of Spanish speaking individuals makes it sometimes hard  to concentrate and focus on your work. Other than that overtime is great
bad,"Team Meeting, work assigned, get drawings and parts, put together or take apart aircraft or components, Clean up, do paperwork, go home. Management cares more about time and budgets over employees. This is even at the cost of improper equipment used to the detriment of safety."
bad,"The managers at L-3 are very knowledgeable and easy to work for.  Most of the employees are also very good.  The problem is within HR and the Program Management Office.  Every time L-3 would lose a contract or partnership, they would not pay the agreed upon severance to employees.  They would simply hold a meeting and say we're not giving you a penny."
bad,"Was a great place to work, knowing you are making night vison for the US Military, but like most big companies the politics take over and people lose their jobs"
bad,"MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE, they are disingenuous all across the board. Do not trust anyone there! Run the opposite direction to another Defense Contractor."
bad,"The CEO loved to party and threw lavish offsite ""strategy"" meetings for his favorites where the expense reports were, shall we say, not quite consistent with corporate policy."
bad,"Environnement de travail de bureau qui date des années '80, et le style de la direction qui cadre avec cet environnement.  Étant donné le vase clos de cet environnement de travail, les méthodes de travail sont désuétes et les directeurs(trices) passent leur temps à vérifier les feuilles de temps et les registres de poinconnage des cartes d'employés pour les heures d'entrées/sorties des employés, même si le travail est bien fait, livré à temps et à la satisfaction des clients.  Interactions avec collègues de travail adéquat, même si tout le monde se sent observés et minutés.  Très peu de possibilité de télé-travail.  Il faut faire preuve de 'présentéisme' dans cette entreprise.  Rémunération adéquate, bons avantages sociaux.  Une belle 'prison dorée', quoi, en attendant la date de la retraite."
bad,"Not a great place to work, Long hours and poor leadership, only three department meetings in a year and a half. Overall moral at L3 is poor most engineers were waiting for the layoff of firing to happen"
bad,"Employer did not communicate very well expectations, only stated what they wanted after several requests for communications"
bad,L-3 was new to the contracting position. Was a day to day learning experience for them. However didn't listen or support employees.
bad,"life is good at l3 if you ""know people"", whatever that means. that was the message i was getting from mechanics to supervisors. despite what all my supervisors said, which was that i was one of the hardest workers, i never really got far. it got so bad that i told my MANAGER that i was literally bored, i was so proficient in my duties that it was like clapping. They wouldnt let me turn in extra time either, so what was i gonna do but sit on my chair and wait it out, per supervisors intstructions. This was a career job for me, so while the amount i was being paid was excellent, it just had no substance, i was ready to move up but the wouldnt let me. I left because i coulnt switch supervisors, my supervisor got away with calling someone ""Brown Boy"" confirmed by more than one person. That was the last straw"
bad,Good people to work with but management does not have the know how to manage a billion dollar company.Work is available but poorly managed. The workers knows more than management.A college degree does not make you a genius so why doesn't the company give workers with experience a opportunity to advance into management. Experience counts. That's the reason companies don't survive !
bad,"-Conducted security vetting interviews (screenings) of Locally-Employed Persons (Afghans) and Third Country Nationals (TCNs) seeking access to Kandahar Airfield; recommended access levels (badges) and privileges based on the results of interviews. Also conducted Exit Interviews and “walk-ins”."
bad,Management needs to be completely overhauled. I was told I couldnt weld because I had to be Army certified instead of Naval certified and they couldnt come with a plan as to how to pay for it so I sat in the shop for 9 months til we were certified and then was laid off 3 months later with no warning what so ever.
bad,Worked as an intern. Had great pay but no guidance from my team members.
bad,"I have worked with Harris for a few years and seen a sharp decline in work quality and environment. Overall I feel that I have very little chance to be creative in my daily work. Mistakes by early inexperienced engineers have lead to a extremely cumbersome process that does little to improve the customer product. The work area stresses reusability but spends absolutely no internal money to develop products, so the same mistakes are forced on multiple programs. Promotions and awards are generally given to same group of people who are in the right 'click' but do little but point fingers, condescend, and make the people around them miserable. The company constantly is taking away employee perks like earned vacation and cutting health care benefits while on the other hand insulting the employees by giving them surveys asking them can how to help them improve company morale."
bad,Unfortunately this facility is an amazing place to work other than everything that fills it. Good ol boy system prevents achievements on all levels.
bad,"lots of work, and understaffed, if you like working a lot of hours, join the team, good for coming out of school and getting experience."
bad,Just a poorly ran company with no leadership what so ever...the turnaround rating is very high. Leaders lack knowledge of the skills needed to run the operation.
bad,"Geralmente não tinha muito o que fazer, quando tinha era bom, pois eu recebia por trabalho feito e não salário fixo."
bad,A typical day at work is 7:30-4. I'm learning a new sysytem. Management is ok and my co-workers are ok as well. The hardest part of  my job is the heat but I make do with it. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with my customers.
bad,"I am speaking about the site I worked at in Texas, the rest of the company may be ok, i dont know. The management has no clue on how to work its people and dont seem to really care about its blue collar employees. The pay is poor, they dont rate people on their performance only the ones the like, those people get promoted ahead of others and and take no action when confronted with safety concerns. The mission there is an important one and does save lives on the battle front ,which to me is a fulfilling experience for me. They do not believe in training or passing on experience,only meeting deadlines. My co-workers are there just to get thru the day, because in the area there are no other jobs that pay as high as L-3 does, but is still far lower than other companys pay to do the same job which draws lower expreienced people to do the job the is really below standards than other companys have. The hardest part of the job is working for supervisors and managers that dont know there jobs and expect you to know yours and cant answer for their mistakes and pass the blame to you, thats tuff to deal with! The work is not hard, its the atmosphere you work in that causes poor morale. the benefits are poor and keep getting poorer and hardly no retirement plan. If you work for the company 10 yrs and quit or get fired, if you come back you time bacisally starts all over. The site i worked at has good people but no leadership to lead the workers. The company could do alot better if it didnt have a wall between its workers and magement, they just dont listen."
bad,"Contract jobs are the more insecure ever. Lots of laid offs all the time. Company does not care about employees. Management does not give you the support needed. Overall experience ""really bad"""
bad,"Excessive top management changes, in 11-1/2 years we had eight (8) different presidents. If you are not part of the good old boys click then your chances for advancement were nill. Women were not treated equally like men. Training consisted of viewing slides or videos during your lunch time."
bad,The lower level employees do most work and get the least pay new employee come in and make more than the employee that have worked there for many years. There's a lot of micro managing. HR department no help either. Benefits are not good at all just a stressful place to work if you are a lower level employee. If you are an engineer you got it made.
bad,"Constant corporate mergers produced duplicate applications/system that have not been integrated ."
bad,L-3 is not an employee company. they constantly show they are in it only for l-3. im looking for a place that I look forward to go every morning.
bad,"lack of support , parts  and maanagement support made each day difficult and stressful at times. There was a lack of inovation and sharpness from senior managers leading to firefiiting issues most of the time"
bad,"Thought the job was ok at first.  But when I wanted to move up in the ranks with the experience I had. I had no disciplinary actions against me, was always on time. Stayed late. Worked ot.  Went above and beyond.  I was denied. My supervisor started acting funny because I applied to another department.  "
bad,"Pay is good but people need to suck up to get ahead . You cant say ""NO"" to anything because the supervisor would find a way to get rid of you. Also you can be  dependable, polite, hard working  and still end up on the chopping block SERIOUSLY I'M NOT JOKING! I'm not telling you not to apply but to be careful. PS Work as much overtime because your supervisor is more likely to hire you. Don't  ask to change shift because my supervisor hated me for that. Good luck and thanks for protecting our country!"
bad,"Was a stressful place, management sucked and did not care about its employees.  Moral is terrible.  I would not recommend Harris to anybody unless they want to get beaten down a lot."
bad,This is a company that promises you the world and does not live up to it. My belief is that most of these other reviews are employees that have been at Harris a long time. Most company managers are pretty good then there are. Some that show all types of favoritism and give certain people a long rope and others a very short rope. I dont care what level of you career you are at stay away this is a company that takes takes takes and give nothing in return those who screw up go up in this company. So be fooled heavy turnover due to poor management and terrible raises.
bad,They don't care about the employees. Various upper management very biased against certain people. Do not treat employees with respect and dignity. Come to work with little if any work to do and they would still call people in from other shifts to work so they could have there over time for the week. Needs Lean Manufacturing.
bad,"Unrealistic demands on deadlines and quotas, micro managing to the point of driving employees to distraction,  little to no training, constant finger pointing when faults are found, employees with little or no management experience put in charge of teams of 4 to 10 people, constant turn over of employees, pointless endless meetings that accomplish little, badly run finances causing more work from other departments to make up the slack... I could go on and on."
bad,"Great group of co-workers but bad management.  Upper management has a ""my way or high way"" attitude.  Pay is good but not worth the stress from management."
bad,"A strict Government driven shop, stuck in the 1960's.  Drops are restrictive and monotonous, repetitive, without any improvements or modifications made."
bad,"A typical day at work in this particular department consists of a constant change of schedule and demand from other departments. There is an extreme lack of communication between departments and the supervisors; therefore, schedules are difficult to finish in a manner which is not stressful on everyone. The management in the department which I am reviewing is terrible. The lead and supervisor simply will not take responsibilities for any mistakes or misunderstanding between departments and the easy outlet is their subordinates. The lead handles any discipline in a very poor manner. The hardest part of the job in reality is dealing with anyone in management. They seem to have no clue as to the true issues that are brought up by the people performing the processes. The job I perform is enjoyable itself. I also enjoyed working with my coworkers. They are great team players and focus on getting the days job done."
bad,you never new one minute to the next if the contract was going to be kept or downsized and cut out.  when it comes to being deployed their is no fairness in the selection of personnel being deployed.  Then they bring in a person who came from another section within L-3 who had already had at least 4 unsatisfactory write-ups and this was there way of moving him around in the company. Then the direct boss over logistics was supposedly great at finance and computers but had never worked in a warehouse or even new what one looked like.  In order to get anything done within the command you had to go and ask mother may I (home office).  Then you spend all this time setting up a new supply  function and then it gets shut down because I said so.
bad,"Harris has changed drastically from my hiring there, more than 20 years ago.  Old-School management, people who knew you and knew your job, have been replaced by re-treads from United Technologies that the new CEO has brought along with him.  They've brought with them all of that company's short-sighted views and ""what's going to help me next quarter"" mindset. Essentially, they've kept the worst of the ""good 'ol boy"" management and then added in the worst parts of more modern management styles."
bad,"No job security. Pay is decent, Bene's are ok, used to be better. Stressful environment, no family/work balance, management expects more and more, doesn't matter if you have a family at home. Worked until 8 or later at night. No job security, I've seen people come in on a hiring spree and let go in a few months."
bad,"This company puts revenue first, above customers, employees, and quality.  Raises have been very small, and the company delays giving out raises so that you only get a portion of a year, not a full year of the salary increase.  Employees are ranked, often by managers that they have never met and that know nothing about them, and each department is given a set dollar amount to distribute across their employee base for raises.  "
bad,"Because jobs were not coordinated, a lot of labor was spent installing and installing the same materials.  Job was running over budget before I arrived, the plane was delivered Two years late.  Coordination between management and employees was poor.  Drawings were substandard.  Basically the commercial division was a disaster."
bad,"The IT team and their business IT standards are way outdated, there is not an CIO or CTO. Best IT practices are not used or implemented, there are no remote IT tools or even inventory assets information. IT staff is against any change or new technologies"
bad,"Typical day consists of opportunities to learn, advance and go to school whilst being employed. I've learned much about electronic circuits, RF components and systems, networking and different aspects of the computer. Management provides with the opportunity to take your own lead, and grow at your own pace, which helps during those learning stages. With flexible hours, and scheduling to meet your rigorous schooling demands, it is a great company to work for."
bad,"Its ok, if you want advancement that is not lateral changes stay away... They are cheap, disorganized and its not as good as people might think...I am actually trying to get out now..."
bad,dcma runs company. ececisions come from the governmnment.  company will not back it workers who put in the effort for the company. they will sacrifice employees at a whisp.
bad,Management is replacing all long term knowledgeable employee's with people who really don't understand what their doing.
bad,Management does not know what they are doing half of the time. I have had bad experiences there because they tend to favorite people over others even if your knowledge is much higher then some.
bad,"Basically with new CEO bottom line is the return. Little if any community activities anymore, much less any raises. The company hired a consulting firm to see why so many folks were leaving the company, supposedly folks at new company are leaving in droves. Management is just a puppet on some strings for the upper management cutting cost. Worked there for years but left when the bottom line was the only requirement. Be aware as it starts out fine then the headaches begin with not doing enough, pay raises stop, and life becomes hard, so be careful. Harris is not the Harris it was before, when talking to associates I use to work with they are very unhappy and seeking other jobs."
bad,My position as a Test Technician was overall challenging for the duration of my employment.
bad,"management does not know how to manage a production line.They will not listen to an employee when something is clearly wrong with a machine, instead they keep using the machine and blame the operator for things failing."
bad,"worked for the worst boss, over bearing, mean, untruthful."
bad,Very insecure working enviorment. Incompetent management team.
bad,"troubleshoot pilot discrepancies and ops check avionics systems."
bad,"Highly micromanaged with a mostly unfriendly hallway environment with a Military mindset."
bad,"Easy work have to redo a lot cause of last minute changes or poor workmanship.Learned keep your mouth quite stay within the group and follow,Management part of good ol boy network.Some people are nice and good but will play sheep in a second.Job was not hard and its a weak Union more of a social gathering.Never go to HR unless you part of the group."
bad,Culture is varied throughout the various divisions. The values stated are not exhibited especially at the higher level of the company. A lot of passive aggressive behavior throughout the ranks.
bad,Well short on technical Manufacturing capabilities. Capital investments far beyond technical requirements. No existing technology road maps ensuring capabilities meet Customer requirements.
bad,"The bottom line is just that they only care about their profits not the employees. Not a great culture, constant changes and layoffs. Different managers and departments no stability. Also union shop so don’t expect to advance quickly even if you are the best fastest in the room. Co workers are very protective of their jobs specially older work force. I would not recommend and sometimes money isn’t everything"
bad,Culture is suffering. Good potential to turn around performance and customer satisfaction but exec leadership needs to be much stronger. Matrix organization which is always changing.
bad,Constant management changes at all levels have led to mass confusion as to what need to be done and who is responsible for it. No contracts coming from business development caused yet more layoffs.
bad,"This use to be a amazing company! Management has brought the place down. I’ve sat in many meetings where the plant Supervisor was on Facebook or shopping on Amazon. Company preaches Ethics, but when things are brought to their attention they do nothing. Sad that there are so many people dedicated to the company and yet the company is no longer  dedicated to the employees. Clean up Management!"
bad,"Employees forced to work overtime to make corporate milestones so management can make their bonus, none of which is distributed to employees. Year end bonus for employees was a donation to charity, i suppose to offset the taxes of managements bonus."
bad,"Work two levels above current job description only to be passed over for promotion.  Miniscule or no pay raises.  Set up for failure, never had everything needed to complete tasking.  No support from management."
bad,Working here can be detrimental to your career. Not a great place to work. One day your are the Lion and the next day you are the prey. Very old south type of atmosphere.
bad,Do yourself a favor and keep looking somewhere else. L3 has a lot of great people but the corporation is just worried about making the numbers look good instead of actually making greats products.
bad,"I worked at L-3 for almost four years, and in that time they had almost as many lay-offs. Constantly being threatened with our jobs, moral went down the tubes and we went from being the top maintenance facility to one of the worst.  From what I have read on the company website, L-3 is fantastic to it's employees and they love it but from what I experienced they could not care less for their contractors."
bad,"Over three years of working there I watched 18 people leave the finance department. Several lasted less than 1 year after being hired. In a few weeks our department went from 5 down to 3, so my workload increased by about 40% but I was given no pay incentives, never even told thank you directly. They just expect you to pick up the slack without any acknowledgement. When annual raises came around 9 months later the 3 of us were given raises between 2-3% for nearly doubling our work loads. Very political work environment. Due to being forced to use vacation during the plant shut down between christmas an new years you actually only get 1 week of PTO instead of the 2 weeks they tell you they give."
bad,Would not recommend other people to work here. Way too much work for the salary you receive. I just did not enjoy working here.
bad,The management team is using a super old management style and are stuck in the past and unable to move forward. They are experiencing a brain drain and a retirement problem that they are in no way addressing.
bad,Stressful work environment. The quality of an employees experience will depend upon their group and functional management.
bad,There are reasons that a company over pays than the national average at the Air Force site. Too numerous of sins to mention hear. Learn what you can and get out with your sanity.
bad,"if I had to characterize the workplace, I would have to say it is similar to walking into a 'Dilbert Live' segment. The business is extremely top-heavy with management. Working long hours is rewarded. Getting a job done on-time and under budget while working only modest 'casual overtime' is not rewarded. "
bad,They don't care about the employees.  Various upper management very biased against certain people.  Do not treat employees with respect and dignity.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of me being in my office servicing high ranking officers of the military which I dont mind. I learned alot when it comes to IT and help desk. Management is horrible, my supervisor makes the exact amount as me because he's really not a supervisor. Co-workers are ok, we are all trying to survive under this weak contract. Hardest part of the job is them trying to stretch you out all over the place because they want to save money by not hiring people to replace all the people that quit everyday. Its also a terrible commute for me going from Laurel, Md to Virginia daily for $12.98/hour. It's like im working for gas money and a happy meal. Most enjoyable part is I have my own office."
bad,"Even before the layoffs, L-3 CSW was not a nice place to work.  The company ignores common engineering tools Six Sigma, Lean, PMP, Agile, Scrum, DOORS, DFT, DFM, DMAIC, DFSS, ... and reinvents the wheel day after day, year after year.  I would advise anybody looking for a job to keep looking."
bad,Management seems unable or unwilling to identify the talent working underneath them and reward or discourage appropriately.
bad,"Overall not a real bad company to work for. Because this company has many contracts I can only speak for the program I am familiar with. Due to the particular contact language I was associated with the local management is very weak in employee support. The customer seems to direct and influence the management decisions, so the employee really has no support system unless you are well connected to company management or the customer. The pay is dictated by area wage determination, so no chance for advancement. Benefits are adequate, but expensive. Minimal retirement plan (401K) that is largely dependent on employee participation, no matching contributions. Again all of this is driven by the current language of the contract. Inconsistent disciplinary policies are in place. Some employees receive a “pass” for mistakes, others do not. Extremely high stress environment- not so much the work itself, but the on-site politics between the company management groups and the customer have an effect on the workers. Inadequate number of employees to accomplish the goals. These combined issues have deteriorated employee morale. The best way to describe the working environment is unrealistic and changing expectations with inferior tools. This particular contract has the potential to be great but fails at the basic level to deliver lasting results, adequate tools for sustained performance and unbiased employee satisfaction due to uncertainty in company support."
bad,"If you make it over 5 years you might have a job, always looking over your shoulder to see if you were laid off next.."
bad,A company with potential but not a fun place to work. Management is only concerned with numbers and never considers employees quality of life. When employees leave management never back fills the position and leans on the remaining employees until they reach the breaking point and move on.
bad,"The origin of this engineering group started under the management of Eclipse Pioneer, then the Bendix corporation, then Allied Signal Aerospace and finally L-3. I was part of the UAW that was in place to support said engineering group completing the team. Together we worked on many different projects i.e. guidance and control platforms for the solid rocket boosters on the Space Shuttle, the Hubble Space Telescope,The Cassini Satilite, the Contol Momentum Gyros on the International Space Station and other guidance systems for military use. Needless to say each day was a learning experience, from machining parts, to the parts stockroom to shipping and recieving. Management was somtimes less than impressive. So profit oriented that R&D suffered. My co-workers were for the most part an enjoyable group to work with and very knowlegeable. The hardest part of the job was somtimes having to deal with stress and heavey lifting. Certainly there were many enjoyable moments,such as seeing a part or system being built and knowing the care and time that went into creating it. Another thing that was also,to me very hummbling, was getting to meet and listen to some of NASA's Astronauts when the would visit the facility."
bad,"After working at other major companies, this one was not of the level of corporate professionalism that was expected. They have yet to create a team atmosphere due to personality conflicts. Hours are terrible and inconsistant due to the shortage of personnel. Harris just went through and wiped out (laid off) many people from all areas and there could be more to come. Harris could have done a better job of doing this."
bad,"Working here is typically a thankless  unless you are a system engineer or upper manager. Very political atmosphere. Upsetting the wrong person usually ment you were let go. Promotions were given not to the hardest worker, but to who the boss liked. Work culture was more of a survival mentality. Benefits are lower average for the industry."
bad,"Decent job, but do not go on as contract employee. It's not worth the hassle and has an almost minuscule chance of actually making it on as a full time hire."
bad,Contract employees are treated differently - told not to be too personal  give employees the minimum no extra mile treatment felt I wasn’t able to provide the employees with more
bad,They need to change out Human Resources employees who have no idea how to investigate issues or follow up and truely make the right decision instead of being afraid of a lawsuit and letting wrong individuals go in the process
bad,"Managers are not held accountable for making crude statements about women and creating a work environment that is threatening.  Senior leaders prefer to deal with these issues ""off the record"" to protect the offender.  Any attempt to bring light to the violations with HR or Ethics resulted in hostility.  Pay is also substandard; several persons perform the same work but the pay is vastly different (some more than $50K more per year for the same responsibilities and equal quality of work).  "
bad,"FORCED overtime on your days off"
bad,"Once your current job is completed, up to individual to start looking for another job or else might be stuck doing job that nobody else wants or cares for!  No one really looking out for individual advancement."
bad,"travail routinier et malgré que l'entreprise dit valoriser la conciliation travail/ vie personnelle, c'est faux , car quand tu as un rendez-vous médical ou autre tu sens que ça dérange beaucoup même si tu as fait toutes tes heures."
bad,"In what was supposed to be a 40 hour a week job, as the Lead Pilot with pilots working world-wide, I worked at least 75 hours a week. The DEA flight manager was excellent."
bad,"The Admin Team are a bunch of snakes! They talk about one in particular because of who she supports, and she thinks she is the boss! Lynchburg is a joke"
bad,"Was once a great place to work. They use to do all sorts of employee moral boosters & perks, great company parties and treated the employees respectfully."
bad,"Don't trust anyone, they tell you good things that are not true and management is poor.  There is a lot of micro-managing there and well as the playing of favorites.  I would not suggest Harris to any friends or family.  Very bad experience.  Promises that never happen, people stabbing each other in back to get ahead,  Very fake environment-nice to someone in person and then hear them talking against the same person behind their back. No job security for future."
bad,"Poor MANAGEMENT, too many managers, and lack of communication. They lied about moving our jobs out of state. They moved cause they didn't like union shops. So we loss our jobs."
bad,"L3 has become an unstable place to work. There have been several layoffs in the past two years. No one knows if their jobs are safe. There is no loyalty towards employees, does not matter how long you worked there and how loyal you are."
bad,"84 hours a week for months at a time without days off and constantly having your job dangled in front of you if you make a mistake and like most places no matter how good or how hard you work , your just one mistake away from being fired ,"
bad,"Most of the senior employees all have their own backstabbing clicks that aim to get you fired if you don't kiss-up to them. It's a lot of hiring family members that not qualified for the job, lack of training, and will sabotage your work and lie behind your back. Their very cutthroat out their so watch your back."
bad,"It is as simple as that.  The executives and upper management only have one thing on their mind;  $$$.   It seems they could care less about the people working for them as long as they make their bonuses.  It is not uncommon to have multiple safety incidents with injury every single day for several days in a row.  Need to cut costs at the end of a year; just lay off 300 workers then rehire new associates in a few months at lower wages and do it all over again next year.  But to stay compliant the new workers will have the same jobs and duties, but will have a different job title."
bad,"Managers have let the company slide further and further down, mismanagement, unethical dealings with customers, and driving employees to breaking points, A rush rush and complete at all costs, then when something happens, it is not their fault."
bad,"Be prepared to grow gray hair working here. Revolving door of good, smart people leaving after 20 yrs of service because they were fortunate enough to see the writing on the walls or being forced out after being accused of something anonymously by anyone in the plant, with no proof. If someone with 8th grade education doesn't like you, be prepared to spend the next 3 months defending yourself and your actions in the HR dept because you'll never know who complained about you or what you did. Basically, you'll be facing the firing squad......"
bad,"This company is run by engineers. They ignore L3 corporate culture. Do not want any feedback and are not interested in changing there ways. Old school lazy paycheck collecting attitudes. Think of the people you see working at the DMV, or any other gov. run entity and that's what you see at Warrior Systems. Get the picture?  I have a better attitude than my supervisor!"
bad,"Org has no new business coming in due to lack of competitive edges, therefore layoffs were eminent.  Very poorly managed with the good ol boy clicks.  You are either in the circle or out, whether you produced or drained the company."
bad,"Harris used to be a ""family"" company with a wonderful culture of philanthropy and community. The work done is still mission critical. However, Harris is methodically forcing out workers over 50, some with over 25 years experience there. If you are not a millennial, don't apply. The outcome of this is inexperienced management, many of whom have been put into positions long before they are ready."
bad,"Good place to start a career. Aerospace manufacturing from the ground up, in all sorts of different areas. They make detail and assemblies, also complete ship sets."
bad,"Management drives hard. OT is required. No Work/Life balance. Decent wages, but you work hard for it. Everyone in department was overworked, departments are understaffed, and that's where the OT kicks in. You'll never catch up. Even for how hard they drive staff, there is no job security. No communication between management and staff."
bad,"Harris has not given a 1% raise to any of its employees in the San Diego division of Information Technology. People working with the UUV and USV program at Harris Corporation have to spend 6 months or more in Bahrain. Hours are adjust, but the promised hours are never reached. Per Diem is slowly diminishing and there is no vacation when deployed. Management is terrible at communication and don't expect planning in advance, Management will ask you to leave for 6 months with a few weeks notice at best."
bad,Terrible company. L3 became SOLELY about saving and earning money and no regards to welfare of employees. They ended numerous careers without any notice or compensation to employees. I worked for them for seven years and was called on day before Thanksgiving to not come in because my security clearance had suddenly and mistakenly been revoked. I should had at least been offered to work on overhead while my clearance was rectified.
bad,"Overall a ok a place to work.  Shift was 6 am - 4:30pm.  Assembled, quality checked, and put finished product in proper area.  Unqualified management, favoritism, and distance from home is why I left the company."
bad,"Badly mis-managed division within L3 with very poor on-boarding of new employees, little infrastructure like MRP, no trainig, no advancement, no common practices, product life cycle engineering discipline or engineering tools. Hostile environment where managers blame staff for their project / business failures.  Very stingy vacation time off policies (3wks for advanced engineering including sick time)."
bad,the company used to focus on people and making the customers happy.   happy customers = revenue.   now we get stuck in our own way.  being told family is important and then yelled at cause you're not working weekends is insane.  I have been told it's not like this elsewhere.
bad,"Harris is a stepping stone on  your resume. Get some training, get some new skills, then get a new job. It's not a good place to stay too long."
bad,"This can be a hostile work environment.  A project lead becomes hostile (raising voice, so as to broadcast his comment ""you don't know what you are talking about"") when hearing his idea of how magnetic materials behaves is incorrect: he asks for material that has no permeability at low frequency but then has permeability at high frequency!  The company's magnetics 'guru' refuses several requests to correct his transformer model before its inclusion into a technical proposal to customer: his model has galvanic connection between primary and secondary circuit, and fails to include an ideal transformer that is standard for such models; after several weeks and many requests, his associate manages to provide a proper model!  A consultant provides in an analysis an incorrect description of how magnetic fields are created within magnetic material, and project lead refuses to acknowledge this is so when hearing about it: he later discloses that he enjoys doing his role of predicting transformer behavior because it gives him an opportunity to learn about magnetics!  Management does not respond appropriately to correct these structural defects in their organization."
bad,"This is a company with great opportunity to grow, but some of the divisions just need a little bit more help in the management arena. The executive staff has a tendency to make decisions based on discussions with other executives and on numerous occasions make mistakes on their decisions due to a lack of having all the details."
bad,"I used to work at the location in Northampton, MA. When I started working there, I loved it. It was the type of job I had always wanted at a company that I ""thought"" was a good place to work. I was told by HR that it was a good place to move up and that if you worked hard it was easy to do within a few years. Long story short, after a year I applied for a job that I was already doing the work for(the girl had left and I was given all of her duties), never got interviewed and was turned down(I was the only person that had applied for the job inside the company). The job was given to another person outside of the company with less experience than I had. The ONLY enjoyable part of that job was I had some co-workers that I became friends with. The HR dept is useless, they don't help you at all. If you ask them for help 90% of the time you are given an 800# to call and they don't offer to help with anything. People never go to them for help or to report anything like harrassment because they know nothing will be done. Favortism is also extremely common. Also they took away yearly bonuses, so now the only way you get a bonus is if another person ""nominates"" you for doing a good job. If you want to actually enjoy your job and where you work, DON'T WORK HERE."
bad,Management was very disrespectful and was not willing to work with my VA appointments.
bad,Job security was always an issue as it seemed there were always layoffs so you were always worried if you were going to end up on the chopping block. Hostile work environment as individual employees felt as though they had to fiercely compete to maintain employment. Also management was very hostile and seemed encouraged to find fault with all the employees as a means to encourage fear of job security and boost productivity. Provisions to accomplish tasks was not always provided and were at times very difficult to come by.
bad,"Not a real good company to work for, just ok. Can't much more than that."
bad,So many options within the company.  The culture depends on where you are. 
bad,"Research company guidelines and blueprints, assemble assigned work"
bad,I would not recommend this company as a potential employer. The management style and overall knowledge of the business is lacking. There is a tendency to make up for that by employing an archaic and sometimes abusive management style.
bad,I can't believe I wasted 5 years of my life working here. I got pushed out the door because of the management. All managers our related in some way and have no clue how to run things. Have no values and ethics policy here is a joke. If you work in a area and they are running behind they will move you to that area and keep you there when you don't want to be there. Waste a lot of money and isn't LEAN. Managers blame everything on their employees to cover their butts. Layoffs every month are not uncommon so you never know when your time is up and they will never lay off their buddys just the people who aren't in the click. Just a small company that L-3 bought that is ran by managers with GED's of no education at all. The good ole boys club
bad,Great co-workers. They talk a lot about opportunities within the company but make it impossible to advance your career. The management is disconnected from the work force and only concerned with their numbers. If you are ex-military this might be the place for you.
bad,"My experience with L-3 Communications in the St. Petersburg, Florida was not a positive one & to tell you the truth I really never understood why they even hired me for just 90 days. Just fair warning don't expect much & don't be surprised either. I the time they let me go, I kind of felt sorry for the people who had to work there. As far as management was concerned there really wasn't any. Very little direction either. That goes for communication as well. It's possible it has changed, since I worked there, but just want to warn people of what could happen. They could just as easily keep you or drop you at the drop of a hat without reason or cause. Just be warned."
bad,The NOC is understaffed and people are very overworked. The company is heavily based on metrics and micromanaging as well. Benefits are sub par and the pay is slightly below average. Turnover rate is extremely high.
bad,Work for them for 15 years and they will dump you and send your jib to India
bad,Most employees knowledgable in position they are placed in. Well paid but not supported sufficiently when deployed to war zones. Difficult to converse with home office and human resources. Deny employees earned benefits upon contract completion.
bad,"Worked for l-3 for 3 years and advanced only to a processor level 2 and made a total of 1.40 raise for working there 3 years! Easy to get lost in company, multiple manager changing in the time i was working so new more about process then managment!"
bad,"I learned a lot during my time a L3Harris (then L-3 Communications). The biggest problem that I ran into repeatedly was a severe lack of work/life balance. Entire teams would be forced onto overtime workloads starting at 60 hours a week. Some team leaders worked 80hr overtime per week. This overtime would last upwards of 8 months. Two separate team leads from other groups had heart attacks, literally. "
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of daily turn over and preparing for the shift where there 2 shifts of 12 hour days with no days off. Having worked in both the tool room and Logistics was sometimes stressful since Maint. Manager often criticized work done on earlier shift and expected you to correct deficiencies without knowing true facts. While deployed overseas, no one has your best interest at heart unless you are in their ""click, yes that does exist up to this day."
bad,"The day to day tasks are just fine, the work is good and challenging.  However, the corporate drive for revenue and personal greed of management to show off how well the company has performed under them in their brief tenure promotes a back-breaking culture of moving internal due dates forward without consulting production, engineering, or other projects that are already in process.  This, combined with distaste for overtime, results in a stressful work environment where multiple projects can be due in the same timeframe, and a couple unlucky people stuck in the middle trying to work miracles."
bad,"L3 prefers to do things they way they ""always"" have even though it has not worked well for a decade.  Unfortunately,  they periodically bring in new people to make changes but you never actually get to MAKE the changes as it was only lip service to begin with.  Since you are new, and not one of the GOB network, you are also only lip service.  They know all along that you won't last...worst 2 years of my career!"
bad,Big company with alot of leadership issues. Maitenance supervisor has ego issues and runs around like he's the ceo of the company and sabotages other less fortunate employees chances to succeed. Avoid that department.
bad,Typical publicly traded defense contractor; over-diversified several years ago and then spend a substantial amount of time untangling the various businesses it bought / started.
bad,a typical day was 10 hours. it was definitely fast paced. It was typically well managed however the most difficult part of the job was trying to put priorities on the various job assignments. jobs were not really well defined.
bad,L3 is a good place to work if you are content with your starting salary and happy with a 3% default raise per year. There is extremely limited room for advancement and nonexistent management. My personal manager was not even in the room during raise time. Some people will go well over a year without meeting with him face to face. He shuffled all the dirty work to his supervisors. L3 does not have anywhere near competitive pay. After 8 years working there and a 4 year engineering degree. I am 40% underpaid for a position that requires a 2 year degree.
bad,"I worked there ( in Roanoke, va) for 2 years and decided to quit. It harded to move up if you have no connections.  HR was a joke, there was no help when you asking, job was not heavy, but very stressful.  Vacation must be approved up to manager befor deciding off. "
bad,"Almost everyone there is nearing retirement and the company is run just for them. Harris is doing business the same way they did it in 1970: no work-life balance, antiquated performance review system, moderately attractive benefits. They do their best to stay away from the newest technologies and practices. I've never seen a company more fearful of progress."
bad,"There is minimal career development, managers do not cultivate staff, culture is very unsettled and people are leaving at a fast rate."
bad,"I was hired to replace a brilliant engineer and just could not do all that he did."
bad,It is all about the work ethic here.  Work/life balance is heavily weighted to the work side.  It can be a very contentious environment.  Many employees are rewarded for causing another employee to justify their actions or be counseled/disciplined by their management.
bad,"when I arrived they were hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and 3 years late in delivery. I was told Id be there for a couple of years, but almost immediately they started letting people go for really ridiculous reasons. My manager was distant, sarcastic and provided no help to get the job done. If anyone asked him for assistance or asked him a question, they were made to feel stupid or that they were on the list for lay-off. In short, L3 WACO needs a severe transformation in management and a good culling of the herd, so to speak. I loved the area and I liked working there except for the very top heavy supervision. The Good Ol Boy network is very strong there and many of the supervisors have been in power through numerous ownership changes."
bad,Will not describe work place in a positive or negative manner. True there are pros and cons but my experience may not be someone else's. So shining a light on the company isn't something I have interest in doing
bad,"Cons: Problems with management and supervisors. Lack of experience and knowledge. Health insurance prices have gone up and coverage has gone down. "
bad,"We had good leaders until corporate and Greenville were pushed into running things at Waco.  These guys are all worried about their jobs and are destroying L3 Waco by their poor leadership.  You can tell how lacking they are in leadership development.  Just disgusting, and there isn't one bit of competent oversight.  These clowns just do as they want.  No updating of the staff at Waco on current conditions or potential work coming in.  No work right now is predicted to come in for the remainder of 2018.  If it does, it will be small.  We continue to lose bids for contracts and stuff people one on top of the other in other programs.  Again,..lack of competent leadership."
bad,Management never honest and tell you great things are happening. Management can not secure contracts and don`t know how to bid on jobs! And has not been able to for 10yrs. All While government spending has increased.
bad,Life at work used to be fun and people looked forward to coming to work. Today benefits have been cut and morale is low. More and more people are looking for other positions.
bad,Co-workers helpful and friendly. Management culture evolving from small-company style to larger company style. Mutual respect of all within my department.
bad,The company needs to pay according in order to retain employees. Benefits are ok. Managers need to be more receptive of employees needs. L3 bids for government contracts in a wide range of fields. The company is mercenary and its employees are mercenaries. There is virtually no loyalty either direction top down or bottom up. You know your job can and will be terminated without notice going in.   Management could not be trusted they would go out of there way to make things bad. I was told not to talk to anybody and no body that worked there really talked to each other and you had to really watch your back side.
bad,"It's an ok place to start out for young engineers.  Problem is they all hire on, get experience and bail out as soon as they find a better opportunity.  Advancement is seemingly only based on who you know and who's ego you stroke relentlessly.  They have defined processes, but don't really follow them.  They have one huge sole source contract that keeps the Greenville division afloat.  If they lose that, the entire plant may as well shut down as other business is not profitable enough to keep them afloat.  Management is selected through the good old boy network and none of them have any idea how to be competitive for new business.  The lost nearly every major proposal last year."
bad,"It was very clear that if you're not ""friends"" with Management your handled differently. There was no professionalism and a lack of respect for others and their cultures who were not apart of the clique."
bad,"bad management , bad workplace culture , layoffs every year for pass 5 years  chronic mismanagement by upper management. to much responsibilities the most enjoyable part was going home"
bad,"The company has been traditionally a good company to work for.  However in recent times, benefits have been cut, the work environment is hostile, and extremely stressful."
bad,"First job out of college, intended to stay till retirment. Many opportunities to go into different areas, learn different programs, customers, equipment. Had the opportunity to travel extensively. Got cross-ways with a manager who made sure I lost my job."
bad,"The technology, learning and growth opportunities are pretty good, if you want to work an average of 60/hrs week and are okay with a Militant Management style. "
bad,"A typical day was filled with meetings, conference calls and reports. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the reports and meetings both internal and external, which often required overtime just to maintain account documentation as required, but never get ahead of the curve. This environment made if very difficult to take a proactive approach to managing accounts. The work was enjoyable and challenging.  When things went south as often happens when working with cutting edge technology, the job was extremely difficult."
bad,Very disorganized organization. Most people are unhappy and want to leave. Please don't relocate to work at Harris. Management is totally clueless. Lots of old boy network thinking here.
bad,HR at L3 has wages and advancement opportunity locked down. When management identifies a hard working knowledgeable employee that they want to reward and retain any attempt at doing so is blocked by HR. They have the entire purpose of the human relations movement backwards.
bad,The company was very profitable but lost its major contracts and began to downsize. At the time (Litton) was bloated with too many middle men and managers. Could not adapt to a higher Canadian dollar.
bad,The work is challenging but the management is terrible.  The do not support the employees.  Long hours are expected and not recognized.  Compensation is not commensurate with performance.
bad,Moral is extremely low.  Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. 10 hour days. The days can be very slow and boring and other days very hectic. Managers are Snooty and unapproachable.
bad,"Poor managements, unethically lies that what they good at. No leader skills and style, all they good at buddy systems. For someone works hard and trying to does the best jobs out of it then it got blame for work yourself out of work."
bad,"Change and transparency are needed within this silo-type organization. An employee of 10+ years opinion: ""Changes are promised, but never come to fruition..."" The culture is political in nature, where management does not support and empower the lowly employee. L3 fails to nurture and train current employees to grow within the organization. Instead, a pattern exists where management would rather 'let go' of human capital it deems as 'too pricey' and then a few months later, replenish with new employees (most are temps). A pattern of several years of fire/hire..."
bad,"Very hectic, you are in a cubicle all day. If you are not past military this is not the environment for you. I had a very controlling assistant supervisor who would hawk my every move. It made work very stressful, even though the job itself was very easy."
bad,They felt that if they decided on Friday thirty minutes before quitting time that gee we are working Saturday you had to do it. It was terrible when you are already made plans with your family
bad,"Mismanagement and a culture of the ""good ol boy"" system is prevalent. Living life daily waiting to see if layoffs are imminent is really no way to live."
bad,"Perhaps an average defense contractor company. Inefficient, abundant incompetence at the Dir - VP level, and gloomy cube farm. With that being said a lot of good people there at the manager and below level."
bad,"nothing much to say about this place,"
bad,"Hire employees before the government contracts are committed to."
bad,"Harris acts very similar to Exelis, which is a large company they recently acquired. Programs, budget, and schedule matter. Employees do not matter and are losing morale fast. "
bad,"This is a good company for some, but not for a lot of people who are there. The morale is extremely down and it is no longer a good fit for me,"
bad,"The Tulsa office is well known for having the worst management. Bullies! They don't want anyone to have a personal  life. They're every other Friday off is a joke,  so is having a full weekend off.  Unless they rid this division of all upper management I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Employee moral is non-existent."
bad,"Poor upper management. Too much of a good ole boy company."
bad,"Thrown into a room, asked to code, with no guidance, structure or information, other than ""you will figure it out""."
bad,"•	Prepared Hardware drawings for configuration release"
bad,Minimal constructive feedback or support from supervisors and engineers. Workers blamed for everything. Worked overtime for months
bad,This job is for you if you enjoy traveling for work. There will be times where you will work 60+ hours per week. Especially during crunch deadline times.
bad,"Reduced Benefits."
bad,Very nice coworkers. Very quiet environment. Flexible hours.
bad,There have been two rounds of layoffs in two years. Attrition is higher than ever before. People have either been overworked or underutilized. The president is cutting costs to make the stock price go up. Compensation is not anywhere near average. Not worth applying. I will say The job is easy and you can pretty much sleep at work. You will become complacent and lose engineering skills. This has been a major step backwards in my career. Any reviews over a year old do not apply anymore. We have cut too much to be effective. I dread going to work everyday.
bad,"At Harris Corp in my time at the company it has been nothing but a constant headache and downhill battle to get any where in the company.  A company very much built on the  ""good old boy"" system.  As a military member working in parallel, Harris prides themselves as being the 42nd best military friendly workplace, that is a joke.  If you are going to pride yourself on being military friendly then set some higher standards/goals like Top 10.  Harris's compensation and competitiveness is not competitive to the current job market. The going practice for this company to advance is to leave the Company for a short time and then come back, kind of the unwritten rule for getting compensated"
bad,Currently the Morale is at an all-time low.  The company had the best benefits and atmosphere when I first hired on back in 2005.  over the last 5 years things have steadily declined.  Upper management has grossly over-hired and overlooked a waning DOD budget.  The company is now face to face with downsizing and realigning priorities as well as people. It is sad that they lacked the foresight to plan for the congressional and political blunders of this era.
bad,"L-3 was a great place to get into government contracting. Unfortunately, they do not take care of their people or offer them much in the way of career advancement. "
bad,Really excited to work for this company but there is no growth. it is very stagnant and no opportunity and career development. Benifits are expensive. Get lots of vacation that you end up working through becasue this place will not hire or cannot hire due to low wages.
bad,"It's been too long since I worked there. But, the only thing I can remember was, no one was equal to anyone else. It depended on who you were. To see where you went and your salary going forward in your career."
bad,"Overall working environment is better than most. However, there is a severe lack in direct leadership."
bad,"no commentto, every day is a new rule or objective. Do not see any point no one can make a decision except to blame others."
bad,"The company I contract for appreciates me and is trying to hire me directly, but after almost 2 years of working for L-3 I still haven't heard a nice word from my supervisor. No raises for anyone on our team either."
bad,"Upon my hiring I was happy, single guy who deployed and did not mind it. As soon as I got a family and requested a different position they said they would accomodate but never did. Management yelled at me when I put in my two weeks, and made me leave the same day. Terrible experience...I hope all of L-3 is not so unaccommodating."
bad,This company bought older companies that I used to work for.
bad,Management cares not about the well being of it's subordinates. Most managers are not knowledgeable in their field and have no management training whatsoever.
bad,"Tough culture, not fun place to work "
bad,"They are going through growing pains with no end in sight. Took them 9 months to properly place me on a project. Constantly switched me from manager to manager, so I didn't have anyone to advocate for my work performance or skills properly. Friends all ended up quitting to work for competitors, so that's pretty indicative of the work culture there."
bad,Don't bother with L3Harris if you are over 40 or have ethics.  They are driving out anyone who is not part of the new Youth Culture at L3Harris.  Ethics is a buzz word at L3Harris not a business practice.
bad,"They use their employees for the time they need them. Then  they discard them like garbage. I worked there for 18 months with the promise of retiring from this job when all of a sudden they laid off 90 % of all manufacturing jobs. I had been working nearly 43 yrs as a machinist and "
bad,"It was a big culture shock for me working at Harris.  Harris bought out my company that I had been with for 15 years.  Harris was much more concerned with schedule and budget than my prior company.  My prior company (ITT) was concerned about engineering excellence.  If there was a deficiency in the design or documentation, I felt empowered to fix it, even if there was an impact to the schedule or budget.  At Harris, I was directed several times to ignore deficiencies in specification documents if fixing them would exceed the schedule or budget.  I did as directed, but I was unhappy about the directive."
bad,"Once the Director of my department retired, They fired me the very next week. She protected me because of my LGBT status. They claim to be an LGBT friendly company. But from 2014 I had a target on my back. Mainly because the manager of the department hated me. This was made perfectly clear that he was out to get me. Once his superior retired, he had 4 people make false statements against me to get me fired."
bad,"Management are ok "" depending on whom one has a manager  standing and sitting are depending upon work task assigned"
bad,"Management is based on the good ole boy system. Everyone is very cliquey and if you don't fit in, they will make your life miserable. Friends will cover for each other whether its right or wrong. I do not recommend working here."
bad,Everyday is rushed by trying to be at five places at once and trying to figure out how to get paid daily. The managers only care about their own image and no care of politeness.
bad,There are good leaders and typical management. Tasking too many items outside ones responsibilities due to downsizing of company. The most enjoyable part of the job producing quality product to support the military.
bad,The Job work Life Balance was not good at all.  People sold more of their PTO.  There was no system or job trainer for the department I worked in. The company was growing with more work but not enough employee's.
bad,"Day starts with non-value added floor meetings  for 45 minutes.  Then 25 minutes later more meetings upstairs.  Run to even more meetings until lunch.  Afternoons are hit or misses with meetings.  Feel like you're firefighting to start each day.  Management is all new and bringing their ideas.  They are from other industries and not used to the low mix/low volume manufacturing of a defense contractor, let alone the requirements that differ from making tractors or toasters.."
bad,Your experience with L-3 will vary widely base on which site you work with.  Some divisions are toxic while others are very healthy.  I would avoid anything in the aerospace division.
bad,Management can be a bit hands off. Which is nice when doing your job. The atmosphere in the company is okay there are a lot of changes people don't like. Not very competitive in pay.
bad,"Difficult and stressful working conditions, if you are not able to meet projected numbers you receive a lot of scrutiny. You are expected to work 50+ hours per week, and never feel appreciated."
bad,Too bad they are relocating Sarasota and Alpharetta locations after 50 years--seems all they care about is profits--even though we have been profitable for years here--upper management wants more
bad,L3 Technologies PPI operates on response to current events and do not plan ahead.  Management always feel like their job is ion the line and often nervous and make hasty decisions.
bad,"The work is slow shifts around 10 hrs just steady.I learned a lot about sheet metal.Most days full of clean as you go,which i understand.Lots of aircraft to work on. The Problem is not the work,work is work.The problem that i see is their Management.Zero and i say again Zero people skills.Especially when there Management staff stand at the lunch room door looking at their watches,then your face as you enter and leave ,and that,s literally daily.While two Managers stand inside the lunch room while you eat looking at their watches.Their not the easiest company to work for."
bad,"Work is fast paced, unpredictable and unorganized. Harris PSPC management is vicious and vindictive. There is no recognition for hard work nor is it an environment to foster skills. The management do not push training courses nor do they encourage they're engineers to take courses but expect them to work long hours into the night."
bad,"L3 has many perks.  The pay is decent, and you get every other Friday off.  But the lack of leadership is embarrassing.  Some of the people that work there are so unprofessional, in any other work environment their behavior would never be tolerated.  They are going through a lot of layoffs right now so everyone is on edge.  But if they would either coach the existing people up or help them find a better fit, maybe they wouldn't have to lay off some of the good ones.  There is no training at L3 either.  The company is just throwing money away because they work in reactive mode all of the time and no one wants to take the time and train anyone because no one really knows what they are doing anyway."
bad,"The division of L3 that I work for has reduced the total headcount several times while still expecting the same amount of work to be done, and I am not speaking about the assemblers as we have hard data that tells us what can be accomplished each day for a given number of people.  I am talking about the mid-level managers having their normal workload doubled (or more) with zero additional compensation and zero reduction in the expectations from their superiors."
bad,Got laid off with around 50 people due to the fact they said they didn't make enough profit.  Only made 25 million instead of 30.  Then they turned around and reposted jobs of the people laid off.  Reapplied and never even got a call.
bad,Many opportunities available. High tech company with multiple opportunities to advance. Tech based organization with a strong foundation in engineering.
bad,The job is physically demanding  the worst part is the management will run their employees into the ground for months without a day off. The benefits are good and pay is decent. Would be a good job if the painters weren't forced to work every single day while the rest of the field gets days off. The union can't do anything and HR could care less and allows it. If you dont have a family or any hobbies or any kind of life of anytime this is the job for you.
bad,"In a nutshell, that's it - good pay, great people (the best) but absolutely no loyalty or job security. The hiring swells followed by hiring freezes and layoffs, followed by more swells, it's all pretty unnerving and disruptive. It's nice to know my team appreciates the hard work and overtime, if only upper management could do the same - their decisions to outsource key pieces of our product make it sometimes impossible to deliver quality."
bad,"The Atlanta Aviation facility of L-3 Communications hires very talented personnel. However, the turn-over rate is high due to product development and sales. Management can be vindictive if they don't feel that the work effort was done to their satisfaction. The current work process is ""get it done fast, get it right later."" Below management, the people are great to work with. The company benefits are very good."
bad,Benefits for the job wasn't very good. Work was good and steady I have worked in almost every section in the warehouse and if your a fast learner the job is very easy.
bad,"Poor management. If you ask for help you will just be ignored and told to figure it out."
bad,"Just a Service company serving the Government Task order to provide butts in the seats to support the DoD job tasking.  It was not a good task, cheap pay, for the work history accomplished from prior pay history."
bad,Harris recently bought Exelis corporation. The jury is still out whether or not this is a good thing or not. The transition is being poorly handled and decision making is sporadic and slow.
bad,"Could be better or worse. Theres been a lot of layoffs. Not many chances for growth unless you know ""higher ups""."
bad,"If you are a female, I would not apply here.  They definitely favor the men over the women.  I was required to work as many or more hours as my colleagues even if I had already completed my work in a shorter amount of time.  I'm sure part of this was a ploy to bill the Customer (US Government) more billable hours, but this is only speculation.  The compensation and the benefits were really great.  Right after I was laid off, 4 other female Project Managers were also laid off.  We were all given compensation (to my knowledge) if we signed paperwork saying we would not sue.  Pretty shady."
bad,If you like busy this place is for you.  All in all it was a fun place to work.
bad,"Customer is on site.  What ever the customer wants he gets at the expense of the health of L3 employees.  Usually right before a delivery of software, the customer ""requests"" more capability.  These ""requests"" become new requirements which the software engineers must complete under a very tight schedule and under much pressure."
bad,"its  ok working at L-3 Unidyne, you will learn a lot about LCAC at ACU-4"
bad,"Controls access to client facility through the admittance process; assists"
bad,"When I was brought on board at Harris after 9/11, the atmosphere was super optimistic among engineers, managers, and even factory workers.  The company was growing quickly and people felt very appreciated and part of a team.  Everyone felt empowered to pitch in at any capacity necessary to get a sell, make a customer happy, and create outstanding products.  Contributions were evaluated on the basis of merit and many times great ideas were proposed and implemented through the efforts of factory workers and even janitorial staff.  At the same time, engineers and other professionals did not hesitate to empty trash cans, clean lab space, etc., if needed for a customer visit.  Employees regularly worked significantly more than 40 hours per week and were extremely excited about doing so.  Harris was largely a vertically integrated company where skills were put to use at the most effect place.  The atmosphere was electrifying."
bad,"After a year of employment Level 3 proved to be an ever changing confused mess of order fall outs and poor product roll outs that Sales had no control over. This has to be the most frustrating job ever. If it wasn't for the good people in the sales positions, I would have left long ago."
bad,"Local management is very good, but corporate level culture is indifferent at best. Archaic intranet, impossible to get help with anything but the most trivial or routine HR issues.  Corporation has an industry worst reputation for HR, D&I, and dealing with hostile environment claims. Flexible hours, 40-42 hour week standard."
bad,"hard work, with 2 - 15 min breaks"
bad,"A fairly good place to work but with little job security, but then where is there any these days."
bad,"Very poor management, lots of favoritism and nepotism, all cut backs   directly effect low level employees only. Tons of mismanagement in almost all catagories"
bad,On a typical day I pulled parts to be installed on board ship. Only had one co-worker that I worked with on a daily basis.
bad,"Management not qualified to lead. Manager not selected with normal qualifications for a job. Seems to be a lot good 'ol girls going on. Nepotism, low values, waste, overcharging of FAA client."
bad,Company morale was poor due to recent merge with Harris. Okay place to work at if all you seek is a standard day in day out job.
bad,My current responsibilities do not give me ANY growth professionally and I desire to work in a more stable environment.
bad,"Not a lot of joy in the halls, Maybe it was just who I worked with but there was quite a bit of backstabbing. Technical challenges were interesting and rewarding."
bad,"If you are expecting a job with room for growth, go else where. The annual raises are around the 2.0% mark. There are virtually no way to negotiate your salary once you've been hired and applying for other jobs across will only yield a horizontal move in pay. There is also no annual bonuses and the promotion timeline is long and unachievable. Good job for 2-3 years, but not worth it for the long run. You will be underpaid since new hires will make more than you in 1-2 years of your hiring. Only way to get any raises in a timely manner is to either move out to move up or have them match your salary with a new offer letter from another company.. ot Other than that, there are a lot of senior personnel retiring and lots of new hires that are inexperience.  They say that knowledge transfer is important, however it doesn't happen and we lose expertise every day."
bad,"Laid off 8 employees and then mandated overtime for a month on all other employees upward of 60-70 hours of overtime per week in order to bully the union into pay cuts."
bad,This organization has a lot of upside if it would let go of the past and embrace change.  This requires strong leadership which is not currently available.
bad,"L-3 Harris Greenville is good if you are starting your career (ex. aviaton maintenance, engineering, etc).  Once you gain enough experience, you will notice the management is generally out of touch with the production employees.  You will also notice the compensation and benefits are not very competitive, but you will be told you are getting something great."
bad,"This company is highly involved with goverment-type contracts. It appears the main method of company growth is acquiring other smaller companies in niche areas. After being acquired, the companies often become their own ""division"". Thus, the company may seem large, but it does not bring the benefits of cross-division cooperation and collaboration."
bad,"Due to the lack of good planning and using a robust planning system and couple that with lack of holding people accountable to follow procedures, production and ordering were always behind."
bad,"when I started there, there were ~650 employees, used to be much more; I was there about three years and we were down to about ~350 when I left. Always seemed to be in a scramble to make money and stay open - it is still there today but I hear nothing much has changed."
bad,"Prior to working for Harris, I read reviews about the benefits and people raved about them. Unless they worked in a sweat shop or if Harris is the only place they ever worked, I don’t know how they could possibly say that. Heath insurance is absolutely bottom of the barrel. Only SLIGHTLY better than getting your own insurance and maybe not even that if you do some research. Tuition reimbursement - sure but you need to know if your taking classes before March, otherwise you will not get it until the following year. Bonus plan - nope. They have one but it’s public knowledge among all the employees that you aren’t getting one. Every other Friday off - over rated. Most times they’ll ask you to work. Holidays -they say 10, unless all holidays fall on a weekday you really get more like 8. 401K, they match but after a year and then you’re not vested for another 2 years. Oh, and the manufacturing facilities are a dump. Old, out dated and inefficient equipment which they have no intention of updating because they bill the customer based on hours doing the job. The slower the better. You wonder why the govt budget is so out of whack and taxes are so high? Companies like Harris, that’s why."
bad,"Good Company - not the best timing for me, not the right cultural fit for me.  I was part of an entire team that basically resigned at the same time all independent of one another."
bad,"The biggest problem with this place is they are stuck on their successes from 20 years ago and the government just lets them ride it out. They do the same thing the same way without taking into account how technology has changed. You'll always have a job, but you'll stay in that job forever. I've gotten plenty of performance awards during my time there, and not so much as a single promotion. Pay raises are small if existent at all and benefits get worse and cost more by the year."
bad,Company is experience a high rate of growth. Demanding and stressful job that requires 40 to 60 hrs to get job done. L3 is having difficulties hire and maintaining staff in this highly competitive job market.
bad,"I gain a lot of experience working for L-3, we were a fast paced company, everything was need like yesterday and this is where I learned how to remain calm under pressure and paid meticulous attention to detail of my work."
bad,"There are few good supervisors at the Greenville Plant with a very stressful work environment. They ride their solid employees cause they know if the job is going to get done their ones that are going to do it. The Company training for people with low experience to none is very poor with high expectations for them to perform. Job Planning is poor as well which is why they push Visual Progress. Causing jobs to be done out of sequence. Making it harder to do the job on top of having to undo a lot of work that is already been done. (Take 1 Step Forward, then 3 Steps Back)."
bad,"Rudderless ship full of micromanaging, fearful management who don't address problems at all. You have to have a family member or be a VP favorite to have any shot at advancing. Forced layoffs, people leaving for less money...the writing is on the wall, but nothing changes."
bad,"*Fast paced multi-taking required.  "
bad,"Attended classes for training that had nothing to do with my job.  I was tested with challenging test in which I had no interest.  I passed 2 of 5 tests, failed the 3rd, then was fired."
bad,"Management is for management. Very few will stand up for their employees. You're not rated by what you know...but by who you know. The good old boy system is very apparent. If you're a woman...plan on getting fewer raises and less salary over all. Management is afraid of laying off minority employees. They will keep those who have little to no experience over those who can work many areas of the company, and those who have more knowledge and are willing to cross train. Rumors run rampant because upper management won't tell the employees the truth about what's going on in the company. They outright lie and employees are blindsided when they lose their jobs. Stay away from this company!"
bad,"We worked as contract maintenance on 6 US Army Reserve Helicopters doing all there daily maintenance."
bad,"I spend the day managing projects, team and initiatives. The team is under staffed and there are production issues. I have learned that cutting corners in development creates more production issues down the road."
bad,Harris is terrible at micro managing their employees. Many young people keep on leaving because managers treat their teams as if they are children. This environment is not productive and frustrates many employees.
bad,"Resourceful, innovative professional with over 20 years Strategic Marketing and Business Development managerial support within both domestic and international arenas.  Held P&L responsibilities.  Expertise in initiating projects and programs that boost efficiency and productivity while identifying new avenues of business for the company.  A true Hands-on Manager with proven skills in organization, development conceptualization, coordination, strategic planning, authoring and improvement of operations through policies that promote a team-based work atmosphere, creative thinking, process enhancement and a positive result for the corporate bottom line."
bad,"This is a contractor for government facilities. The company itself is fantastic, however, local management is inconsistant, except in the area of petty requirements. Felt more like kindergarten at times rather than grown professionals working."
bad,"In order to advance at L-3 you must know someone. If you work hard, you will be rewarded ONLY to the point where management decides it's time to bring in their buddies and you'll be ousted without question. No job security, spineless management that takes orders from the customer, extremely poor business decision making and, of course, bureaucracy."
bad,Pay was not very good for the position in question. It was a good stepping stone for me career. Management had no backbone. Job Security was nil. No culture to speak of.
bad,"H.R. is useless, Corporate is great though. Stay away from certain managers (procurement)."
bad,"No regard for employees. Very demanding and stressful. Favortism. "
bad,"Advancement is terrible. There are annual cost of living raises. Job security is good, however there have been large layoffs. Layoffs continue to be a risk. Expect to perform more complex work then you are compensated for. I’ve been here for 5 years and am the most experienced person here on the equipment I run, yet never been promoted. Even my manager admits I’m unfairly compensated for my work.  But the corporate system doesn’t care."
bad,Used to be a good place to work but really went down hill in the last 3 years they appear to be grabbing at what they can get for middle management and not considering the time and experience others have in the Co.
bad,Had to Fight for promotion from operator to technician even though I have a degree and was training technicians. I had heard a similar story from others.
bad,"Company very small which meant I was able to do many tasks and not be one-dimensional.  However, only worked there a year and company lost expected contracts and got laid off."
bad,Working at Harris can be stressful at times. It can also be fun depending on what you do. The pay rate isn't so good compared to other electronic manufacturers.
bad,L3 Waco is like walking around the morgue.  Moral has been down for several years but managers will lie and say oh we are doing great and then a layoff happens the next day
bad,"Direct managers and coworkers are very nice and knowledgeable. Beyond that, no one seems to know what they’re doing. Everything is controlled by meaningless metrics or driving revenue above all else. While some work is interesting a large part is just tediously telling people things they should know."
bad,"This company its all bout the stock value.  The stock has gone from 20 dollars to 160 dollars per share over the last 5 years.  This was accomplished at the cost of lowering employee benefit coverage and increasing employee premiums (get less for more); by stopping PRP (Profit sharing) bonuses to employees due to ""yearly poor company performance'' (regardless of record profit and stock value increase) and by making employees work double when personnel left the company.  Pay is sub par company wide compared to averages in the country.  If you come here expect to get payed 20% less than you would at a similar company for the same exact job (except for new college graduates).  Company loves to push what they call HBX (Harris Business Excellence) which allows the company to cut cost by not spending in things like chairs that were built this century and cancelling Christmas parties. They love to brag that they spend a lot of money on training, but what they do not say is that this is company/federal mandated compliance training.   The company does not help you pay for career training or certifications.  They do have tuition assistance, something like 2000 dollars a year."
bad,"it was a good place to work, Management needs improvement, but the people were very nice. the most enjoyable part of my  job is the job that i performed I ready liked, working with people and helping all."
bad,"L-3 is like a black hole. You get lured in, and before you know it, your lost for life. The overwhelming attitude of employees is one of discontentment. They pay you just enough to keep you from quitting."
bad,"National Security Solutions, has since been purchased by another defense contracting organization and is no longer a part of L-3.  Thus, it is impossible to provide a subjective review of how that organization is now functioning."
bad,"On a daily basis I would scan parts in and out of the shop, create spreadsheets for production supervisors, answer the phones and locate parts needed into work. I would create tags and send for transportation using the logistics system LMP, SAP, ESPS. I would enter time into the system and ensure the employees were using proper codes when entering their time to ensure they were paid on time and the correct amount. I coordinated with the production supervisors to get orders they needed done by a deadline. I transferred parts to another shop by foot or forklift/roll lift and scooter. I would wrap and preserve parts and store them in pallets and label them by helicopter Serial number. If parts came in with incorrect serial numbers or codes I would walk them over to quality and have them corrected or tagged."
bad,"hard to advance"
bad,Well it starts at six and I start evalate the problems that come in and if none go along with regular duties . Making sure instructor and students are in place and day goes smooth.If problems arrieve I take care of them.
bad,Working the P-3's was truly a challenge and a rewarding experience. Will not want to work for them at this location again.
bad,"Great benefits there. 3 weeks accrued vacation, week of PT and full health benefits day 1. Management can be iffy. The work atmosphere isn't terrible, but level of work you do is not reflected in the pay."
bad,"Worked here for 8 years and got a new manager or director every 7 months."
bad,"L-3 has been known for being a great employer. Lately, the atmosphere is unhealthy. After a couple rounds of layoffs, people are concerned for their future. "
bad,"This a good workplace for securing steady income, however; there is little options for advancement within this position and location."
bad,"Co-workers are important. The team spirit is essencial. Management left a lot to be desired. Favoritism played an overwhelming factor. Hardest part is having supervisors who have never been in your shoes. Same with some fellow employess, ""well it pays good,"" or a ""couple more years and I can stop working and collect social security."" I have heard these quotes and other diragetory comments all throught my civilian experience as a military contractor."
bad,Can NOT recommend this company.
bad,"They developed a position for a driver. I filled that position, but they couldn't Supply the freight for me to haul. Then they complain because I had nothing to do. Then they closed my position with no warning. My supervisor never liked me because I officially done my job."
bad,"L3 Technologies has some great people and management staff working for them, however, their lack of understanding leadership and work/life balance makes L3 hard to work for and will ultimately lead to many talented individuals leaving."
bad,"The company's high employees gave the impression of favoritism.  "
bad,The employees are always in fear of getting laid off. The company hires and lays off at the same time. Employees don't trust each other. You put in extra hours to get the job done and still do not get any acknowledge for it.
bad,"The company has gone thru different changes (Simmonds Precisions,BFGoodrich Aerospace)  until L-3 decided it was time to close down in summer 2017.  "
bad,Site turned out to be a great environment. Project manager and human resources don't seem to care about the contract took months to fill 2 vacancies never filled the remaining spots which eventually led to the contract being lost.
bad,This company lacks resources and interest in its IT Department
bad,"4 day work weeks are about the only real positive here. Very boring work environment. Raises, layoff, hiring is all contingent on what the Federal Government is going to do so be prepared for whom ever is president to decide your future at L-3"
bad,"I began as a contract worker, eventually being assimilated into the company as a permanent employee. "
bad,"Always paranoid about any mistake, small or otherwise. Every hole is a career hole. I have learned many bad habits, in my opinion. My sheetmetal skills have grown considerably. MGMT easy to arouse, quick to fire. Overly judgemental. Never let simple things go. Very negative people. Hardest part of the job is staying out of trouble. Looking busy when there is no work. Not having parts and materials or work orders and still being expected to do the job. Most enjoyable part of the job is having a clean work order and building parts. Going home!"
bad,Contracting in FT Hood with L-3 for a few years before it change name to URS. Not a bad place to work at.
bad,"I loved working with many of the people at this company. They could make you feel right at home. Though, I don't think that this is a forever job/career. There was lots of restructuring during the time I worked here. I didn't always agree with the management at the upper level and they made some decisions that I felt hurt portions of the company's chance of survival. At the lower level, I felt management was often fair to the employees and more personal and understanding."
bad,"This is a government contractor and as such has very strict regulations that need to be followed. Management was dishonest and didn't care about their employees. Work schedule, benefits and time off were the only pros of working there."
bad,Paid well but the management appreciates bean counting more than quality work.  No sense of security - one day you are the king and next day zero.  Mid management is vindictive
bad,They rarely have opportunities to advance and when they did it was only the managements favorites that got picked. Raises were horrible the last few years and insurance benefits were very expensive
bad,"Top heavy--""too many chiefs, not enough Indians""."
bad,"L-3 was a completely demoralizing place to work that treats its employees solely as production assets and not as human beings.  From a technical standpoint the work was very interesting, though."
bad,"Management won't get off its butt to secure contracts. A ""Skin and Kin"" organization. Pay is not competitive. Training and advancement is only available to white employees or relatives."
bad,defense contractor so they do a lot of hiring and then lay offs.  The pay was very good and the benifits were good.  The work was not real challenging though.
bad,"This company the managers bullied their employees, showed favoritism & was very unfair in evaluations.  They practiced micromanaging to intimidate employees."
bad,Layoffs are occurring for the first time in many years. One division is in serious trouble and is bringing down the others. Rumors are flying regarding sale to another company and how many people are going to loose their jobs.
bad,"The work started challenging and interesting, however due to a lot of management and government handlings, the workload became extreme with less personal to cover the shifts."
bad,"Typical day was very stressful in the position I was in. "
bad,"The good part was the people I worked with. everyone got along really well. The working hours are good, the holiday schedule was good too. the pay is good."
bad,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with, and the type of work I was able to perform. I was not impressed with the management there, this was partly the reason that I had left L-3 in search of a better job, and also because of current lay offs."
bad,"The company doesn't allow flexible working hours, many employees are overworked and demand to perform is very high.  The atmosphere is very stressful.  It is not a happy place to work."
bad,Bad work environment.   A good amount of bad fruit co-workers.  Interesting job with technical aspects.  Bad supervision.
bad,"Workday were super busy"
bad,"Company policies are more stringent and non flexible with respect to other companies. The number of annual leaves are less and office timings are strictly followed."
bad,no training. You are on  your own and it is too segregated. Management is not engaged.
bad,Perform duties according to government standards. Work with Highly Qualified personnel who enjoy doing what they do.  Good team work great team leader.
bad,I returned from vacation to find out my whole department had been replaced with lower salary workers. No respect to us workers.
bad,"I interned there and while individuals seemed to really want to help and give you things to work on, upper management really didn't care and I was left with long periods of nothing to do. Even when I asked for work no one had anything substantial for me to work on."
bad,"•	Performed stock record and warehouse functions, including stock receipt, storage, distribution and issue."
bad,Very expensive health care too many individuals micro managing from off site.
bad,"The job was not well-defined when I started, so I built it. When the management changed, so did the job description. It was hard to keep up with the changing job descriptions of the company and the management."
bad,order entry was my daily task. the company was buying so many small business they did not bother learning the order entry systems and it was very hard to enter orders with out training.
bad,"i loved one place, and absolutely hated the other. it all depends on how well you can cope with having no personal space."
bad,"There were some opportunities for job progression, but once you get good in a position, management doesn't want you to move on.  I get that.  Also, I enjoyed working with some very talented people."
bad,"Took this job because I have worked with L3 during the majority if my career in the Marine Corps.  I have several friends the have been with L3 for 8 years plus.   I have never herd anything bad about the company so when offered the Journeyman Supervisor job, I took it without hesitation.   This contract treats te Journeyman Supervisor as a mechanic, not a supervisor.  HR controls the company and will not address any concerns and does not have a true open door policy.  Please be careful if deciding to take this contract.  By far worse decision in my post military career making."
bad,"The work was challenging, interesting and rewarding but the required documentation was demeaning and It destroyed my self motivation. I felt  like the clerical function of the job was more important than my skills as a highly trained and competent technician.The pay and benefits were good and the local management people were competent,skilled and fair but suffered from the same roadblocks as the personnel under their supervision."
bad,"I loved working at L3 and then they lost their contracts and everyone will be out of a job by December 31, 2017.  If they had continued to operat, then I would continue to be happy there."
good,A good company to work for.  Worked with a diverse group of people.
good,We we're called l-3 communications then l-3 Harris bought this company everything that they were doing making necessary changes or not for the good of the employee only for the good of l-3 Harris
good,"Senior executive were arrogant and entitled.  CSG VP was a bully and totally disengaged from his department.  Lacking in vision and leadership.  He depended on his sycophantic ""twins"" to provide guidance while ignoring the rest of his leadership team."
good,Everything is worried about going up. You can its all about stock prices and everything else is not that important to them.  They don't know how to pay. One higher up said that people on salary are expected to work 60+ hours /week and that they should be grateful they have a job.
good,"-	Inspection on cathodes to detect flaws and determine pass/fail while ensuring compliance. "
good,We are constantly being micro managed to complete daily tasks even though our processes are changing regularly. The scheduling is a mess and coverage in this 24/7 NOC is not managed properly. This company needs a make over.
good,Too much Bosnians dramas and  at work....Layoffs...Too much stress for nothing...Watchers everywhere....Low paid..No communication with manager and group leaders. They loosing contracts...can't find right people to do this serious jobs.Some people nice....Some dramas makers and brown bosses..SAD.
good,"The environment was great,enjoyed working there. Would loved to go back,although all the older employees are gone. Looking for employment at this time.Just a great place to work."
good,"decent place to work, hard to say as the company is merging and a new company and culture will be developing and emerging."
good,"The company that I work for (Exelis Inc.) was brought out by Harris Inc. two years ago.  Since then 80% of the employees who were working at Exelis, at the time of the sale, have left the company,  Morale is extremely low at the company and the work environment is poor."
good,"Link, Simulation, and Training is behind the power curve regarding a multitude of issues including pay, communication between managers and subordinates, and on the job training (OJT). "
good,"a very fast paced - demand driven position.  Requires working with project management, engineers, and many other internal customers."
good,"The job for the day is to stay with in the operations objectives and keep under costs.  The people you work with are over all good in general.  The management needs work, but the job is always in turmoil. Do to the company does not talk to the government, to keep jobs available on site.  Better management, better communication, better money management, can make a big difference.  Company is all about how it can make money off the cost of the contracted employees, instead of the contract.  Key, never under bid yourself, unless you do not plan to make money.  Plan your objective and stay on contract."
good,No regard for a mature workforce. Management does not care about a work/life balance nor it's more seasoned workforce. Loyalty is expected but not given
good,The Harris corporate culture is often tense with a feeling of being under the gun at all times. The people are great but unappreciated. Because the FAA operates under strict financial constraints the hardware/software is very dated.
good,"It’s a great way to get feet in door, however like any big corporate company you’re just a number. Management prefers if your the shut up nd color kind of employee vs the ask questions when something isn’t right"
good,Management has their favorites and place people in lead roles without proper experience. I experienced a hostile work environment. I would not recommend working here.
good,"A typical day at work consists of:"
good,"Rat infested building, rat traps are at most people's desk, no air conditioning which contributes to mold, and water is unsafe to drink"
good,"Needs ethical transformation, upper management needs ethical transformation."
good,"A typical day is 13 to 14 hours, 7 days a week for five to six months at a time. It is fast paced experience and co-workers have have a full range of experience to extremely minimal to very skilled. The living conditions were crowded tents and porta-potties, shower stalls that were all shared. Living with your co-workers and working long hours with them creates an interesting family bond between everyone."
good,The company was ever changing and there was no job security.
good,"Interesting work, but large disparity between compensation for upper management and workforce.  Corporate management more focused on short term profits than building company for long term success.  Many ""for employee"" initiatives are poorly planned and rarely funded.  Extremely inefficient internal processes remain from days when company was much smaller likely will affect future success as company has grown."
good,It was a constant of being threatened with our jobs and lay offs. When the lay off came i was happy to leave. The management were all employees of the company while everyone on the floor were  government contractors.  As contractors the company made sure we had the bare minimum of what the government required for anything and nothing more.
good,"I worked there for 2 years as a paint supervisor. I was constantly being micro-managed and harassed due to my disability. The harassment showed in my performance reviews and eventfully led to me being terminated. "
good,"Although I was very happy to join the Harris Team on modernization for the FAA ASTI program, I did not receive the security I had anticipated.  I was a direct contributor to the success of their contract, and was very effective as a test and implementation telecommunications engineer"
good,Terrible executive management (especially Sales and Engineering) that just ride the wave of being grandfathered into executive roles. Engineers are not forward thinking and use antiquated or mimic competitor technologies. Product managers haven't developed a single working product or met a single deadline in 7 years.
good,This place is not what you would think of when you read about how well the company is doing.  They bid jobs against each other and no really orginization amoung upper management.
good,"The site manager was a bully.  He managed through intimidation and then he would disappear for days at a time when I would have to do both jobs.  Management knew this and did nothing about it.  Corporate would not promote me or move me , as no one else would work with this manager and there needed to be some one there who could run everything, including meeting corporate and on Base requirements.  I was also the liaison between the Active Duty Air Force Base and our site for all corporate matters."
good,"Always managed by fear, not by compliments. Wants to run your life. Family always comes second to job. On the job training is adequate and in a lot of cases required per government regulations."
good,"That's all that can be said: this was a job. I was severely underpaid and worked very long hours. The management was learning along the way, too. I enjoyed some of my co-workers but I was always happy to leave and go home at the end of the day, even if I had to be reachable 24/7. I really hated the drive into work each morning because I knew it meant spending another 10-12 hours with people that also just saw their work as a mere job."
good,"They offer overtime and play game with overtime paying you the proper amount of pay due. They say time and a half, and then they reduce the final amount paid."
good,"problems I noticed have not been addressed in the year and a half I have been there (these are easy fixes)."
good,The loaction at which I have served is in need of a major cultural change. There is little to no vertical mobility for personnel regardless of merit. The overall job satifaction rate is poor and people feel negativly about the managment staff as a whole. The company would be great is a few key high level managers would move on and allow the culture to return to normal.
good,"If you choose to accept a position, get all you can from the experience.  They pay well but always answers their financial issues with workforce reductions.  It is primarily management's fault the company is where it is...yet they are the one making poor decisions.  At its current state, it is a cycle that has no end."
good,Worked 10 hour days 7 days a week. You get laid off when you are done with an aircraft until another aircraft comes in. Not my idea of a real job.  Money was low to fair it is the long hours that made it seem like a higher paying job.
good,Overall good employer to work for but needs to be under New Management. Benefits & pay rates finally got distributed the right way because of the union stepping in finally. No job security whatsoever all contract work all based on seniority and bumping rights.
good,"A typical day would include preparing reports and providing support to internal and external customers.  Set up and participated in teleconferences and well as face-to-face conferences.  I learned a lot about using the Microsoft Suite to support all departments as it relates to the program.  My coworkers for the most part were easy to work with but everyone would be doing something different.  Instead of someone coming up with a solution and sharing for all to use, many times each person would come up with their own solution and provide results that were not always uniform.  The hardest part of the job was setting priorities with multiple high pressure deadlines and may people having fires in need of water while continuing to do the everyday contracts administrator work such as reviewing contracts, working on financials and other everyday tasks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing the customer and seeing real progress happening with the project/program."
good,"MTI was one of my first eye opening  jobs that taught me the hard way life and work dont always match.Management consist of my Aunt who held nothing back, family was not family at work.The hard part was expectation, the best part was meeting it."
good,"I enjoyed my work very much however my skills were not being utilized. My experience as a Designer was never used as management never recognized how I could of multi task for the company. My work ethic as well as my attendance were very high and I was always a professional. I was representing L-3 while being stationed at VAFB."
good,"This used to be a great place to work - it felt like family.  Many highly trained and intelligent people had been there for well over 30 years.  With new management came poor decisions, a less friendly environment and, eventually, an extremely toxic workplace."
good,"Little room for advancement .only certain whites are promoted and receive big bonus."
good,Great experience but low pay compared to average in field.  Very little chance for advancement without a degree.
good,"close tickets, help customers. basic IT troubleshooting and customer support service. co-workers work diligently. customers scheduling a ticket and not being able to contact them for several days. Fixing a customers issue totally by myself."
good,"lack of communication good people on the work force,but management never consults about problems with the problem solvers the actual workers on procedures.safety was a big problem people getting hurt but no changes being made"
good,"ensure work packages are complete, systems are complete and ready for operation"
good,Management did not care about employees. Hired from outside many times and left good employees sitting in the low ranks.
good,"I worked at the L-3 CS West facility in Salt Lake City. No safety posters anywhere in the facility. The safety staff was admittedly unmotivated if not incompetently managed. The site had known safety issues and had been dinged three years in a row by corporate auditors but the safety department sat on their thumbs. Meanwhile, the site had on-going OSHA violations and no one was smart enough or motivated enough to fix the problem. I was told by two senior managers that even the site director apparently didn’t give a hoot about safety. A number of good-old-boys just ran their departments their way – with little care or attention to safety. Confronted, they basically said they didn’t care. The myriad employees went on with their work either not knowing, not caring about job safety, or perhaps perplexed by the utter lack of visible support for job safety. I experienced an entrenched, backward culture. Management seemingly rewarded for toeing the line – a quasi military culture that rewards good soldiers and squashes innovation and certainly inquiry. There was a palpable lack of creativity, initiative and professional knowledge in an environmental, health and safety department crippled by inept, and ineffective management."
good,"Located in Atlanta, Ga....there is no opportunity to advance, work is corporate telemarketing which is micro managed by less than qualified staff."
good,"Need to pay closer attention to what is going on with employee and management,  Job title means nothing they will place you in a data entry position even if you are senior engineer."
good,Good place to work a lots of experience to learn. I have been with this company more than seven years it’s a lot experience I got I will suggest to anyone to god this chance and learn.
good,"Managers would send out emails to everybody about something that was done wrong or not done.  The people at fault would always think the email was directed at someone else not them.  We are adults, tell the person so they can fix it or remove them."
good,Senior Management is all over the place and overloaded our team to the point of burn out - over and over again. It was humiliating as a manager to try to explain to my team how I expected them to complete an impossible workload year after year.
good,I only worked in the accounting department for several months but it was a snake pit.  I never encountered such toxic environment.  I ended up quitting.
good,"L3  technologies  provides maintenance for aircraft structures sub assembillies   full tear down of aircraft and complete overhaul of militarty type aircraft "
good,"L3 is generally a great company -- if you don't work in the aircraft segments.  They provide great benefits and incentives and hire quality people.  Unfortunately, L3 of the past 10-15 years is acutely focused on building products and systems for the military only.   As a result, they attempt to manage the aircraft mod and integration units just as they do the product-oriented segments.  Design and integration of an interior, a communications, self defense or weapons system is much more a SERVICE than a product.  At best, it's a one-off, developmental product for each and every new contract/aircraft type -- unless the contract is for fleet installations.  Until L3 recognizes this and manages those units appropriately, the units and the people who work in them will suffer."
good,"I would not recommend working here. Not a great working environment, way to much micro managing. They also only value people with degrees and not experience,"
good,"The work is boring and often repetitive, the compensation (including benefits) do not compete with similar positions at similar companies, and promotions (in grade or grade to grade) are few and far between. However, historically an L3 job is very stable and the cost of living in TX is low enough that you can more than get by on an engineer's salary."
good,I loved working for the company and they have wonderful benefits. I feel Management failed to move the Facility in a direction that would be an asset for the company. New Management felt we were too seasoned and not worth the time. Several good hard working people lost their jobs as a result.
good,"A typical day would start by walking into your desk and opening your email to find a torrent of emails with emergency fires that needed to be put out.  Management did little to help snuff them out and simply turned into a funnel to direct all the nonsense down to the employees.  Managers did not hold umbrellas to help shield their underlings, but rather funnels to send it all right to the bottom."
good,"i thought i had the career job i was looking for.  i was hired and trained, but they did that even though the work had slowed down, we were not given a fair chance to grow and learn."
good,"Could be better, they have a lot of turmoil as they change systems and people and merge locations. Enjoying the challenges and working with the people."
good,"No permanent offered, some line leads and quality associate are very rude and hateful. They dont work Well with temporary placement employed from staffing"
good,"Great Technology,  high turnover and lack of advancement.  Incompetent folks running the show.  The mission is to coach you out.  #runanddontlookback!"
good,"I loved working at L-3 up until August of 2016. The person that shared the duties with me quit and I never got any help but was told I would get some. I did all I could do with the hope that I would get some kind of help. I ended up working until I got blisters all over my feet and hands only to be told ""Be Patient"". 8 months of no help took its toll on me and I finally decided that my health was more important. I hated to leave the company that I loved so much. I have enough money in the bank to do just that."
good,"A very stressful job, and they are not very considerate towards their employees. They expect you to give up your weekends just to get their job done (most of it is extra and does not fall under job description). You basically have no life there."
good,"I was constantly on the road.  there were layoffs every year. Bonuses and pay increases were low about 2% per year.  Benefits were ok 401k, medical dental and vision."
good,Focus is on education and not on experience.  Only the chosen ones are given opportunities for promotion (pre-selected by management).  Environment is cold and distant.  There is a lack of focus on a team culture.  Job security is non-existent.  Management continues to reduce employee benefits and increase individuals personal expenses for healthcare and other benefits.
good,"great work life balance.  Management and politics are the worst part. no advancement on merit what so ever. boys club for sure. "
good,"I am currently managing 7 project in the US, but do not have the resources to work them. So I spend a lot of time managing and working some of my own projects. Due to me working my own project I work 20+ hour of over time weekly play all three rolls. "
good,All management cares about are the numbers. We are undermanned and management cuts corners on reporting stuff to make the numbers look better. they also try to get the employees to cut corners also. DO NOT RECOMEND IF THE MANAGEMENT HAS NOT CHANGED.
good,"As a Stock Clerk, my day begins by doing a inventory count on parts  in the stock room and just picking kits and orders all day and pack shipments in the end of the day.My co-workers are great to work with. They help you and and work great as a team. Management looks at us like second rate citizens."
good,"At work we perform technical duties that require the use of many electronic instruments including Spetrum Analysers, meters, signal generators, counters, oscilloscopes. I have learned many details of satellites which are used for international communications. The job is very enjoyable. The most enjoyable part is knowing that the lives of men and women depend on what we do daily. "
good,"Went through 4 layoffs in 4 years. Always had to watch your back. Management was forced into their positions, which makes for poor managers."
good,Mechanical Engineers beware! Structural Engineering or stress analysis is the best route for your resume but the hours are ridiculous. Design Engineering and Production guys move up but your engineering experience will suffer if you're not careful. Management positions are chosen not earned. Make sure you hire in to the right group and they respect your achievements. Just because you get an offer doesn't mean management has big plans for you. Ignorant redneck lifers still around and will use their buddy systems to cover there hack jobs and scape goat the young engineering grads/undergrads.
good,"...Malheureusement ce n'est pas l'opinion des dirigeants et l'entreprise va bientôt changer de mains."
good,This was a great place to work at until they reorganized the location and a new management team took over.
good,This is a good company to work for. But It is time for me to move on to something better.
good,Military style operations and leadership. Great pay and benefits.
good,"Good Pay and Benefits with vacation but management is horrible and opportunities for advancement are there but only if you are part of a ""click"". People that are not involved with ""certain"" people will not get any chance of advancement nor any descent raises."
good,There is never a dull day and you never know what tomorrow holds. Whats good for today is not always good for tomorrow.
good,Took on many different responsibilities. title never changed. I learned a lot of different things at this job.
good,"ZERO work/life balance. Unrealistic sales quotas, Zero sales support. Systems nightmare. Getting the smallest thing done takes days, sometimes weeks. unorganized on back end systems/processes."
good,Good place to work if given the chance for improvment. Benefits better than other companies.
good,Poor management drives poor employee retention and high stress environment. The company is more about the bottom line instead of it's work force. They do not properly develop their employees.
good,"Very high expectations of performance, but equally high ability to climb the ladder.  Do not apply if you're over 50.  Good place for new grads or mid-career."
good,Pay was average or a little below.  Not much of an area to store equipment or tools.  A lot of peer pressure and not much help.  Got to travel sometimes too much and others not enough.
good,"very strict on policies. job was very dirty. handled a lot of helicopter parts. the money was good but it was not easy. worked in cleaning shop, and many other areas. Made a lot of friends there. Learned a lot about how a army base runs and the importance that our job was to the running of the area. hardest part were the hours. Management could have been better."
good,"Short-sighted decisions are all about this quarter."
good,"constant changes from upper management not necessarily more  efficient. Management does not involve employee's opinions."
good,"L3 is great to work with, but not for."
good,"Too much turn over, especially with management resulting chaos every other year. New employees are rarely trained sufficiently resulting in the need for numerous reports rather than using the ERP system correctly."
good,"L3 is a collection of divisions, so this review doesn't apply uniformly to all divisions. My particular division only loosely followed the company mission statement and values. "
good,"No room for advancement too many micro managers.  Would be a better work experience if management listened to recommendations from all employees.  Great job, great people to work with. Awesome benefits."
good,"work culture left a lot to be desired"
good,"The work environment at L3 was mundane and repetitious.  The work was not difficult and did not seem challenging.  Although, I may have been biased due to not having an interest in the type of work that was completed at this location.  I did have great relationships with my coworkers, both contractors and civil service members."
good,"This use to be a fantastic company to work for but it went through a 8 year rough patch which either unfairly drove employees away or unjustifiably fired people for the incompetence of their supervisors/directors.  Instead of letting senior officers of the company go when they couldn't perform, they just move them to different positions.  A band aide at best and the harassment of good working subordinates continued.  Through retirements and new opportunities outside the company most of the incompetent management has left with the exception of a few.  This company does provide fair pay for both men and women and promotes in the same way."
good,Advanced Technologies but can't trust management . I enjoyed my daily Job requirements but the in-house H.R. is cutthroat and upper management is as well. It would be a great place to work if it  were not for all of the unnecessary supervisors and five managers to one employee ratio.
good,"10 years ago Harris was a great place to work.  The pay was decent and benefits were great. Over the years it has gone downhill, they are no longer winning projects to support the loyal employees."
good,"I was only there for a short time so I do not have much to say. I was just getting trained on the system when I was laid off."
good,"Harris is an OK place to work. Doesn't seem to ever be slow. I feel like there could be more a more even distribution of work, as people at higher levels than me have less work/fewer programs than me. Management would do well to pay attention to morale and employees' happiness. Lots of turnover recently, likely due to the benefits changing. Not everyone is held to the same standards which makes it difficult to know how your performance review will go."
good,"Upper Management usually fail to listen, and take heed to what they're told about certain decisions, and wind up costing the company more in the long run, which of course comes out of employee profit shares. Oh wait! We no longer share in profits!"
good,Management does a poor job of providing the necessary tools and direction for implementing goals you are expected to meet. Too often management is more concerned about their agenda and looking good to executives vs. ensuring subordinates are successful. Compensation is decent however not fair between high performers and low performers.
good,"I liked working at L-3.  However, I am not a person who wants to work a lot of required overtime.  Working in the operations side, there was always required overtime every week.  This made a work/life balance difficult.  It is also difficult to get promoted if you are not able to work even more overtime than was already required."
good,"In My Opinion - the Chief/CEO got fired due to lack of management skills. They bought over BTG/Titan which was a good company to work for. As usual when a cooperate that big, they usually say ""anyone ins replicable"". An engineer may not be valuable to a big corporation but they should value their employee."
good,Good place to work. we became Harris employee;s after being sold. While I was there it was a good place to work. the people I worked with where great engineers and workers. I designed the basic test network and equipment.
good,poor mgmt ruined a great company.  people with  little understanding  of the customer base held the positions of power.  Customer service became an afterthought.
good,"I would say in fairness to Harris that they do pay well. However, as a company, they have little, if not zero loyalty to their employees. Management consists of some of the best and brightest, but are still governed by the overall corporate message, ""Your paycheck is your reward!"" In my 10 years with Harris, I have seen more than my share of what I would call unfair treatment toward employees. Perhaps that is how it is anywhere these days. I myself was treated well, but still, I feel that Harris does not provide a stable and secure feeling when it comes to keeping your job."
good,"While an overall okay place to work, the company fails to act on situations where processes need to change.  Company was formed 60+ years ago and still holds on to ideals from initial time period."
good,"Harris has some of the best technology going. Great for engineers."
good,"On a typical day I would cover up to two departments. "
good,Sat around for the longest time waiting for work or a lay off. It got to the point where you didn't know who you could trust anymore.
good,"The current division I work for has a management issue. We are currently way overworked, and our customer is starting to take notice. Currently I am play Engineer, Project Manager and Technician at a salary rate, when our techs are currently salary. I just believe they are getting over and they know it."
good,"Company was run on fear. Fear of layoffs, being fired and being written up. Sub par equipment, no hard ware or drill bits half the time.Facility was dirty and unimpressive."
good,Management is killing the company other then that good workplace. good area and nice people to work with. building were cool in the summer and warm in the winter
good,"If you like working for defense contractors, this is the place for you.  Depending on project, there is typically good work/life balance and enough challenges throughout the day to keep you engaged.  For some there is the opportunity to travel.  Sometimes management may not seem to ""get it.""  However, that can be said at many other companies."
good,"My coworkers are great, but it can be difficult to get the job done accurately when the management is not always consistent in what and how exactly they want things to be handled. Often times, frustration builds up and that is always bad when it comes to an environment where teamwork is required."
good,L3 Communications - Ilex Systems provides a quality employment opportunity. Advancement may be challenging and with any large Defense Company job security can be uncertain. Generally coworkers were easy to work with. Overall it was a great work experience for a budding career.
good,"I did enjoy the fact that I was learning a new airframe, but I had a lot more experience and education than most did there. Was sent to do different job than what I was hired for and got more help from the mechanics in scheduled and unscheduled departments."
good,"Each day is preplanned as the Munitions Area supports another company that maintains training aircraft for new pilot training. Monday, pull munitions assets for issue, inspect munitions assets to support Munitions School. Tuesday, deliver munitions issues and pickup munitions turn-ins, then begin returned munitions inspections. Wednesday, continue returned munitions inspections. Thursday, finish inspections, conduct periodic inspections, support and escort Munitions School Range Crew. Process munitions residue returned from Range Crew. Friday, finish up anything not completed during week. Also, receive munitions deliveries by unloading truck, process and inspect received munitions assets, warehouse and store assets"
good,Typical day may include be surrounded by coworkers and completed the task at hand. I've learned so much working hand in hand with governemnt employees. Co-workers are easy to work with. Hardest part of the job is getting here in the morning. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with. As for Management don't really see them on a daily basis.
good,A decent place to work. I normally work with like 2 other people
good,"Very top heavy and only take care of those at the top, anyone else should not feel secure in their job"
good,"great PTO, poor management and growth opportunites"
good,"As the #2 provider in the LMR industry, Harris is consistently fighting against a formidable competitor. People work hard to find ways to win business despite the feeling they are outnumbered and out financed. When we win, it is a tremendous feeling."
good,"Everything it takes to repair helicopters from technical data, parts management to testing."
good,"Probably the worst company I have ever worked for. They don't care about their employees, and have little respect for their customer. They are the definition of lowest bidder."
good,Hostile work environment. GFR is too hard on the employees.
good,A very interesting place to work in the Houston office. Sales management is in charge of all aspects of job functions.
good,I have been at L-3 for 8 months and I have expierenced 2 layoffs with more to come. Management and co-workers were good people. The hardest part of the job was sitting around with no work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at L3 because of peers. Made many friends over the years, Had nice supervisors but office work tied me to a desk with little ability to get exercise."
good,"Inspecting allm kind of work of the trade, welding, learning mechanical procedures too, with a good self-management.great team work. The hardest part of work was that the company move too far away couse the job was acomplished, and enjoyable thing was complete the job task at the end of the day, and solving a job problem."
good,"I really enjoyed working with my co-workers, designers engineers and production supervisors. Management seemed not to care about improvements in production or quality."
good,"All, for those of you have a good review about actually working for L3 communications good for you. However this a sub-company of L3 communications and is not the greatest work environment. The current GM of AFS (Army Fleet Support) does not care for his employees and is mainly concerned with making himself look good and making money. This establishment doesn't promote a good environment for it's managers and regards them as expendable and works them to the bone at any and all opportunities. As soon as I can find other employment I am leaving this company"
good,"Inspect incoming aircraft and make needed repairs per FAA and military guidelines. I learned to become a valuable team member and to put others before my self. Working on military aircraft gave me a total sense of pride and patriotism. The hardest part of the job at times was meeting the unrealistic time tables laid out by managers, however i never faltered and always made it. My coworkers considered me a go to guy and I was always willing to help or train anyone at anytime. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing a plane take off after I had repaired it. What a great sense of accomplishment."
good,Being a new company the business had struggles with management and keeping staff. I learned a business must hire more carefully to insure good staff. I enjoyed helping the business launch but it was hard to watch it fail because i was one of the inital employees.
good,had trouble managing to fill the contracts that were bid at a low labor rate.
good,There is an internal spy network that listens and reports everything to management with little regard for the truth. Everyone is guilty without due process with firings on a regular basis.
good,"L3Harris is a good place to work, and in some areas the management is really great. It just depends on your manager like any big company. Many of their managers have been with the company a long time and have not kept up with the industry and leadership practices."
good,L3 is made up of several small organizations and the basis of culture and leadership is dependent on where one works.   It could range from euphoria to toxic.  Senior Management is out of touch and they are self serving.   Don’t expect more than a paycheck.  There is no inspiration and a lack of standards.  If you’re a rising star then I recommend looking elsewhere.   Job performance isn’t recognized nor is it rewarded.
good,I worked here and I must tell you the management is poor. The line leads are poor they do major lay off every year when it’s slow and turn around and go on a hiring frenzy and then lay off again don’t expect a call back once u laid off.. not a stable place to work at all..
good,Company has a great benefits plan and compensation. Jobs are skilled set and sometimes don't give room for advancement. Overall is an excellent place to retire.
good,"I have been a long time employee at Harris and have seen my share of transitions. The common denominator is that if you are not in the ""club"" then your career will be stymied. I have worked hard for Harris and I have also worked even harder to find advancement and growth opportunities. I have been somewhat successful but only by taking risks. Like many workplaces, Harris has factions of individual that have risen to power by making ethically questionable deals. When questioned, it is the questioner that suffers retribution cleverly disguised as career growth. It is not growth at all, it is a dead end position with limited possibilities. Savvy political maneuvering has never been my strong suit. If you can manage to avoid the politics, Harris has some wonderful technologies in the company portfolio and you can find pockets of individuals that are some of the best and brightest people to work with. I have made a couple life long friends here. The work is righteous, the missions we support with our technology makes me feel like I am doing my part to support our military. Overall, it is not a bad company to work for as long as you don't expect any extras (meaning, work materials and compensation are on the lean side)"
good,"Laid back place to work as long as your daily duties are met. "
good,spent over 15 years very good benefit and PTO schedule. Great holiday shut down time. Reasonable ESPP allowances and 401K match. nice hangers and facility.
good,"Management has stressful tactics to pressure you into performing tasks within unrealistic time frames, and then offers no recognition for a job well done."
good,"I have worked at this job site several times in the past. My last assignment, though, was by far the longest. I enjoyed the work and got along quite well with my coworkers and managers. Senior management has gone through several changes over the years, but little has been done recently to increase revenues and provide job security. Many of the company's best workers have been lost to layoffs and/or forced retirement."
good,Lack of advancement for qualified individuals.  Not what you know but who you know workplace culture. Could do a better job fostering and supporting current employees.
good,"I contracted at Harris because they offered me a higher pay rate than what I was making at the time, but they only gave me a week notice when my contract ended after 5 months. I was originally promised that they had 18 months worth of work."
good,"Large Company "
good,work life balance is rough. department was to small demanding an unreasonable amount of work from those within it. I gained good experience but was put through alot of stress.
good,"Great place to start your career as an engineer or working in Industrial Security. They do have flexible hours for employees, but not so much for management. I learned a lot about my profession and great workplace culture."
good,The company lays off employees only to increase profit margins. The rich get richer. They shouldn't hire more employees after having layoffs. Wouldn't trust the company for anything.
good,"Work at L-3, like any job has good things about it, but it also comes with things that cause frustrations and annoyances.  Job security mostly is good, but sometimes concerns come up where the job doesn't feel so secure.  It is nice to have medical and dental benefits.  Some times though management is ""knee jerk"" reactive in efforts to address problems that arise instead of taking a step back and try to keep rational thinking in the process of making decisions."
good,"Overall view of L3 is that it is a nice place to work however, to move up in the company it is very hard to do. L3 likes to hire people in at a low rate and it will take a individual a longer time to advance in their annual income as to other places."
good,"Left up to you to take care of yourself, no support by management as the culture fosters a ""mine"" and threatening environment - very little support as people are scared of losing their job and take credit for anything positive for themselves.  Lots of people not working their ""fair share"" so it's the same people that seem to get the most work done with a lot of hot air in the room by noisy people who don't really take any action themselves."
good,"The job is great, but salary for non union workers are very low for what they ask.  Management needs to improve since employees receive retaliation, too much stress and work harrasment."
good,"Processes are slow and not up to date, but they appear to be working on them.  I was not under a good manager which was my reason for leaving.  There is a need for on the job training ."
good,"Military Aviation is always a quick-paced, stressfull woking environment. The same as working in the military service, also goes on deployment for a short period of time to provide aircrew and pilots get training and mission goals."
good,This company did not have enough technicians and had the engineers doing technician work.  Plus the VIC technology I was working with was extremely proprietary and has no marketable value to it.  They are also working too much with Windows and not enough Linux
good,"A typical day at work included maintenance. Management was ok. The culture was great, everyone got along, and all had a focus on our common goals. The hardest part of the job was waiting for the layoff."
good,Waco site in complete turmoil for two plus years. Numerous layoffs since 2014. Workforce reduced from 2000 plus down to less than 1000. Fear site will close.
good,Management and their expectations are fickle. layoffs are common and attrition is even more prevalent. Rife with destructive internal politics that provide security for low performing (approaching criminally negligent) upper management at the expense of mechanics.
good,Many changes taking place are not being flowed down to the employees. The company is constantly restructuring and merging with small companies making it hard to obtain synergy.
good,"The technology is amazing, extraordinary products built by great engineers and operators."
good,"As an employee, it is quite stressful.  In addition to the workload, there is a constant fear of being fired.  When work on a project dies down, they tend to be creative in how to get rid of people; as firing is cheaper than laying off.  To make matters worse, the management above most direct supervisors have a lot of pressure on them to meet impossible deadlines.  Naturally, this rolls downhill.  And then you get pressure from the other end:  the union.  They pressure you into joining the union because they are funded by union dues (from each member).  They do provide the employee protection, but only if they are on the higher end of the pay scale (again, the interest is in the employees financial contribution to the union).  Historically, the union also doesnt do very well in negotiating agreements with the company in terms of benefits.  If you arent in the union, you still get the fruits of these agreements though."
good,"The main responsibility is to meet of export and import regulatory compliance. Have the ability to analyze, organize, coordinate and complete each shipment in accordance to the company procedures and Customs compliance. The responsibility to maintain professional and sustainable partnership with the providers."
good,It was fun but the hours kept me away from my family and the coworkers were rude towards any one that was new. the management was unforgiving to anyone that was late.
good,Non-value-add administrative work is killing the ability to get work done. We have too many support offices that are bloated with people and process. The new unlimited vacation time is a decent perk.
good,"There was no schedule, they just assume you will live in the office or on the road and that you will like it.  The run the techs in the ground and then send them to the shredder.  Lines of new techs are waiting for you to burn out."
good,"Get a new Manager in Charge at Luke AFB."
good,Co-Oped with L3 for 2 years straight and they did not offer me a full time position at the end of the Co-Op rotation despite my best efforts. Had glowing reviews from management on my work however that did not equate to a full time offer.
good,"kept busy all day"
good,"Although Link UK had a clear business plan, Link US strategy for moving into the Civil market with some of item products was poor and lacked product/market knowledge."
good,This is a great place to work if you can get a job right after you get out of the military. But it's no more than something to pay the bills while you go to school and look for something better.
good,"It depends on who you management is.  When I first started it was Titan Corporation (most of the same people were in the management that mattered to me).  It was then that I was in the most cooperative group of my government contracting career.  It was not all Titan then L-3 employees (it was a couple different companies and civilians), but L-3 was the Prime."
good,"As for the work that we did was spot on and the company choose not to follow FAA standards with the work that was overseen. The aircraft that were delivered from the manufacture had pancake thin rivets installed in the outer sheet metal and needed to be replaced, but upper management choose not to do it to mess with it due to the government bonuses for early delivery. not willing to loose my license or my brothers lives for that money."
good,"This company has a rich legacy. With a change in the CEO, the ties to that legacy and culture were severed. Focus is now on bottom line and not on supporting employees. Morale is very low and people are concerned about losing their jobs even if they are performing well."
good,Vastly improved culture from 5 years ago.  Cooperate is slowly getting around to making aspect of each business unit uniform. My particular unit has not managed training program or definable goals for career advancement.  If you do not leave the company your chances of becoming a manager are unlikely because the business unit is so small you will never get supervisory experience.  The work is exciting.  The team members are highly experienced excellent individuals to work with.
good,"Newly appointed executive staff operates under the belief they know more than anyone else, and openly reject business recommendations and input from personnel with vastly more experience in company matters, products, and manufacturing operations."
good,"Travelling wave tube amplifiers fill a mission-critical role in communication satellites."
good,"Interesting work with good low- and mid-level management. Top tier of management is making aggressive changes to benefits and company culture, arguably for the worse. Benefits costs have sky-rocketed in last 3 years, compensation has hardly budged by comparison."
good,"The company provides pretty decent benefits, such as a 401K, vision and health care. The work environment can be stressful at times, and there is not much job security, which is typical for contract work. Advancement is difficult."
good,"My experience with L-3 is when wanting to hire you they will promise far more than they will deliver. i.e., you are told you will have paid moves if you transfer to another location, the reality is most jobs do not qualify for the paid move, you must be permanently assigned to a work location which they didn't make clear to me, as I was applying for a job which moves every few years, either in accord to their desires, or contract changes, supporting UAV aircraft. I was told I would deploy for a minimum of 3 to 4 months every 18 months for OCONUS work which would double my pay, nope, didn't happen, their mistake, sorry!"
good,Jarden is an ok company but I wouldn't encourage anyone to work for this company. there's not much room for advancement and the benefits are not fair to the employees.
good,"Very Busy work days "
good,"The people are great but the management SUCKS, They are using a new computer System but it sucks and they cant get product out of the door."
good,"10-12 hrs daily."
good,"Extremely busy daily; not enough time in a day to complete task due to being pulled in all directions.  I learned how to complete expense reports, balance accounting reports for the finance department and book travel for employees traveling for the program.  The hardest of my job was not having any structure directions."
good,"Program control responsibilities in areas of program planning, budgeting, scheduling, and estimates at completion to meet contractual/project requirements.  Responsible for the analysis and creation of program work breakdown structures (WBS) and job cost segregation consistent with contract and internal reporting requirements.  Developed and allocated program budgets by task and subtask.  Monitored programs for accurate cost accumulation and moved incorrect charges to the appropriate area.  Participated in weekly/monthly schedule status meetings and provided analysis to ensure accurate status reporting.  Responsible for coordination and revision of program estimate-to-complete inputs with the Program Manager and/or Engineering team to evaluate the estimate-at-completion and cost and schedule risk.  Prepared, analyzed, and presented cost and schedule data at monthly program review.  Provided weekly/monthly reports for customers, both internal and external."
good,"Ethics not a priority, you can get away with anything so if that's your speed...this is your company. Reward for mediocre performance. Potential to make a good salary."
good,"If you are associated with a forward looking division, great.  Otherwise you will be in a short sighted numbers driven enviornment."
good,"The benefits and Pay are excellent."
good,"This used to be THE place to work but since new management has arrived many things have changed, especially the culture. Outsourcing is the new norm and the buzz words are do more with less."
good,"I do not have a complete review at this time, however L3 is a good company.  There just does not seem to be alot of funding for salary in my specific department.  There is also no room for growth at this level, and I am looking to further my career."
good,Work load was easily manageable as long as supervisor didn't decide she wanted a gopher for the day to run around and get her print outs while she sat in her office. I learned a lot about how to deal with difficult co-workers.
good,Overtime was available.  Decent working team of people.  Management lacked and supervisors unhappy and rude at times.  Given meager jobs because could not work on the government computers and given the excuse that a background check needed to be done. .  Approached with tasks to do wanting to do the task correctly I asked supervisor about references and resources and instead blows up in my face and takes the task away. 6 to 7 months later I was told I need to do a SF-86 form done for a security clearance.  My security clearance interim was denied and further investigation needed to be done.  Government was going through a furlough which caused the company to start laying people off and terminated.
good,"The company is in severe need of modernizing its systems, which is partially due to prior acquisitions, but it is handicapping the staff's ability to work efficiently.  Some departments are using tools that are at least 10 or more years behind.  Management is focused on cost cutting which doesn't easily permit implementing modern tools."
good,Communicated with embedded and in house techs about broken equipment. Arranged repair or purchase of new items. Tested failed items for further diagnosis. Maintained inventory stock levels for repair decisions.
good,"Constant changes in management has made it difficult to function.  Always a new boss with a new plan means more meetings, more reports and not enough time on the street with prospects."
good,"Company has many fingers in different pots."
good,Arrive at work at 4:30 am and proceed to review the nightly progress of the systems that had been worked. Look at the daily dispatch to see what jobs are available to be inspected. pull the first job on the dispatch and review the documentation and the blueprints to insure that the system has been built to the proper specifications set forth by the customer. my co-workers are easy to get along with and we work well as a team
good,"Good pay, decent benefits, co-workers can be hit and miss.  A bit top heavy in management and the there can definitely be negative vibe in the workplace."
good,"A Temporary position - extended from 3 months to 6 months."
good,"Pleasant enviroment, friendly people. Good place to work."
good,"Much is expected, internal customer is always right, therefore, management provided very little support and direction. Working with the loyal and dependable suppliers was most enjoyable part of job. "
good,"The work is challenging, yet interesting and exciting. The people are fantastic. However, STRATIS has mass layoffs every year, along with frequent pay freezes and re-organizations. At the end of the day, no matter how much hard work you've done for the company and no matter how long you've been there, they'll lay you off in a blink of an eye without thinking twice and will have no remorse."
good,"I can not really say anything good about the company at the time, it was right after a merger, and I was stuck working out of what was an old storage closet with antiquated equipment."
good,"Use to be a great place to work when it was privately owned. Once it went public, it went downhill with poor management decisions. Stock continued to drop."
good,"I worked at this plant for 7 years and was unseated by the incoming ES&H manager because I didn't agree with any and all ideologies (that this 'tree hugging: bicycle to work and preach to others because they didn't, prefer to spend time in the woods camping with boys in his scout troop (even though his son is long since out of the scouts) embraced."
good,"Level 3 Communications is in the forefront of highspeed comunications. The training available was excellent, the company provided many resources for employees. My coworkers were like family for the 12+ years I worked with Level 3."
good,"in the recent past they have poor management, and only promote themselves from within or their friends"
good,"Great people but very understaffed. I loved my job because each day was different so it was challenging and never boring. The hardest part of the job was the non-stop pace and the most enjoyable aspect was the incredible team and the relationships with the clients. It is a public company so raises only occur if your division makes their numbers, which is difficult when you work so hard. In my opinion, there are too many managers and not enough workers in this company. Also, there is no room for advancement at all and no work life/personal life balance if you accept to be responsible at this job."
good,L-3 Crestview Aerospace was a very interesting place to work with excellent benefits and challenges dailey.
good,"Though the economy has put every company in tight slots, I feel that L-3 is not taking into consideration the ""worker bee"" sector of their business. Every day you wonder what more can they take away from you. It's a scary environment to work in. With that said, I do enjoy the co-worker environement at this office. We have a very strong team that pulls together even in these hard times. They are wonderful to work with!"
good,"A typical day at work consist of answering phone calls,emails and web tickets for assistance with government computer systems. Trouble shooting and offering first level assistance for solutions. Escalating cases to the next level for assistance if necessary and logging all information into databases. I've learned a lot about computer systems and how the government uses them to manage all types of operations. Management supports the team but it is difficult sometimes to get resolutions due to the fact that we are contractors and everything has to be approved by our company and the government. My co workers are very freindly and we all work well together. The hardest part about my job is working 12 am to 8am shift and working a lot of weekends but the best thing is the hours that I work is the time frame that we get the most calls from Afghanistan and other areas overseas due to the time difference. I feel like I'm giving back in some way to the people that fight for us when I can assist them with a problem they are having."
good,Co-workers are very friendly as well as management. L-3 has strong work and family values.
good,After contract loss it appears that the management on the east coast has given up on seeking contracts for the mid-west.
good,"Was bus to bus collections, governmnet accts, lating america airlines banking make sure everything was impute correctly, I just did my job which is what I was responsible for."
good,I learned many new things i had got promoted rarely quickly went from shipping and packing boxes to computer processor great work environment friendly work place
good,This review is for the Greenville Texas plant only.  The management team has a strong emphasis on mission accomplishment without regard to its affect on the employee.  60 to 80 hours a week for employees is not uncommon.  This schedule tends to burn out the employee within a relatively short period of time.
good,We have become much more a number to the company.  Bigger company with the merger yet benefits reduced and cost increased.  Lack of communication fuels rumors.  Corporate is a PR machine.
good,The staff are friendly and the hours are flexible which is good. the culture and management could be improved to create a better more productive workforce
good,The amount of turnover that occurred when new management came in was horrible. Most of our senior employees were leaving to our competitors and we had a few people that came in and worked for a few weeks and left.
good,"You either love Harris or hate it. After 3 years, I couldn't stand long periods of times with nothing to do. They baited a switched me, and was doing assembly work instead of a Test Engineering job which I thought I would be doing. They bring in Interns right out of College that have no practical experience doing Testing for which I had to tell them how to do. Management is Clueless and not Qualified. My Manager had no Electronic background and was unfit for the position he had. Benefits were very good. If your good at the position your doing, they pigeon hole you and not able for Advancement."
good,"Great place to work, great people to work with. Learned a lot, wish I still worked there. Management was a little lax, could of done a better job of taking care of the people who busted their hump getting the job done."
good,"L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) is an agile global aerospace and defense technology innovator, delivering end-to-end solutions that meet customers’ mission-critical needs providing advanced defense and"
good,"Decent place but new merger is pushing improvement at the expense of employee home life and sanity. Company has an 'interruption at your desk' culture, which can be good for quick problem solving but awful for trying to get work done."
good,"Pay was ok, it is a large company with little opportunity to advance in the field i was in.  The manager was good but the team kinda got lost in the big company."
good,Super stressful. Culture is getting a little better but still tense. Technology is old so skills get stagnant easily. It is difficult to get new libraries and plugins approved for use.
good,"Before the big changes were made with the merging of new companies, they played a lot of favoritism, such as managers will hire their family members, friends, and neighbors with no work experience. The company pays very well and I enjoyed the work but as for the ongoing harassment from hateful, mean, and racist co-workers that tamper with your work to get you fired. The company itself was a great place to work if you remove all the drama, favoritism, and racism from the workplace."
good,"Very interesting and important work.  Pigeon holed and stove piped workers have difficult times moving within the company.  Employee stacking determines raises.  Some engineers are more interested in making themselves look good than being team players.  Some Engineers are never wrong, even if you prove otherwise.  There are some very descent and intelligent people at Harris but you are lucky if you work with these people."
good,"Enjoyed the work. Typical day was to review workload with the Supervisor in the morning and then go to a ship. The hardest part of the job was after going to the ships, more times than not, they were not able to accommodate you and so testing could not be completed. The ships have too much going on. The worst part of the job is no recognition and very very small pay raises experienced by all. Pay definitely doesn't match what other companies pay."
good,"My experience at L3 started off very well. It was fun and exciting. The work was challenging and fun. After about a year and a half, management exported our product to be built at other facilities. Management was restructured and our job security felt very low. Combined with the very low amount of work, it made for very very low morale. After 3 years I went from loving my job to absolutly dredding being there, so I quit."
good,"Unfortunately if one does not have the experienced personnel to build these TWTs', yields are low and difficult to keep up with customer order deliveries."
good,"This company went from us feeling a part of something, to your only a head and I will fire you on a dime.  Management is a bunch of 30 years olds now, and don't even think of putting an application in if you are 40 they don't hire older or keep them, pay them, and they are treated with no respect, even the one's who have been there for decades. "
good,Titan L-3 used to be DBA Systems. DBA was a failing company when Titan bough them. They had difficulty adjusting to the Titan culture and a professional management structure so they lost contracts. Then L-3 bought that piece of the company. I had already left when that happened
good,"The atmosphere was ok out there in Greenville, TX. There was not a lot of chances to advance and the location was pretty far away from home for me. I like the site, but it was just too far away from home."
good,"Not the job you want but the job you take. Management was threatening, always trying to set and meet unrealistic goals so they could get bonuses for job completion ahead of schedule. Some co-workers were retirement aged that did this job after their military retirement and liked to egg on the younger employees. There was no job advancement available."
good,"Routine work of configuring and setting up racks with systems, management needs improvement, co-workers are friendly and ready to help and interact with each other."
good,"Good job, lousy advancement in some departments.  Its an electrically driven company but they need some mechanicals to pull it all together.  You can earn a good wage, typically only put in 40 hours and have decent benefits but check your aspirations for progression at the door."
good,"Everything is always needed immediately.  If you like fire drills, you will love working for Harris.  Corporate oversight of all activity is present throughout every day tasks."
good,"Harris is a good company, very solid and tons of interesting work.. I was on a terrible project with 58% turnover in 3 years time .. the project suffered from bad management and that was part of reason I resigned"
good,"Good work environment  and productive. Since the job was contract work, you had to wonder how long would the job would last. Fair supervisory support. Got along with other co-workers."
good,"I worked on a contract, so time between contracts were excruciatingly boring. The job itself was fun and engaging when there was approved work to do. However management was very inappropriate and were not great mentors."
good,"Old planes, old management style. Customer is aggressive to maintenance personal. Customer guaranteed job with company when they retire. Livinthedream"
good,"The culture although good it could be cut-throat at times and was glad to see they were acquired.  Additionally, they were poorly led by the CFO because as quickly as they hired they also laid off.  Unfortunately I did not have enough tenure to survive any down-sizing."
good,"The work culture is based off of a director image in that trust is not given to the process or people to do what's best for the company. Agenda;s typically stood in the way of progress and you were always having to look out to who is going to plunge the knife in your back, to include your boss.  Although it was not always this way but for the latter part of my career this was the case.  I did learn a lot about other processes while working there.  For me I am intuitive and want to learn other processes and in other cases I had to to ensure a good product was produced.  The most enjoyable part of the job was co-workers, they were great to work with and were dealing with the same issues I was experiencing."
good,A typical days work at my level was solving problems for my staff. I learned a lot about the aerospace industry. Management could be better. Workplace culture has a military flavor.
good,"Management always try to meet unrealistic production schedules and expects everyone to work harder to meet these schedules."
good,"typical 8 hours work day"
good,"If you are not part of the crowd, your not going to make it.  By not being part of the crowd I mean your not some ones buddy. This was actually a good job and could of had a lot of potential.  Its not what you know or even how you do your job, its who you know and what you can do for them."
good,Learned a lot working with this fast paced dynamic employer.  Started as a Site Administrator in a branch office and moved into a Financial Reporting Role in the main office.
good,The company has competitive pay and average job responsibilities. The work load varies from day to day and also by location. Management is not ideal from the perspective one my might expect from a well known company such as this. The older employees are great at giving instructions and guiding newer employees in the field.
good,"handled entering helicopter engine part numbers into the SAP system for tracking purposes, timekeeping for 18 employees, trained new employees, part of a team for the SAP system to develop the most beneficial way for entering part numbers."
good,"The work environment is very structured and the goals for the day, week and month are well explained. Management keeps you well aware of any upcoming changes. A great perk was having ALL government holidays off."
good,"Constant shift of work. Duties and processes not clearly defined.  Good environment, very close helpful groups. Often free lunches and gatherings in review of accomplishments."
good,"L3 Communications pays their employees well. However, their is no career reliability in the field I work in as an Aviation electrician and mechanic. Always scared to go to work and find out I have been laid off."
good,"As an Operations Program manager I was responsible for the overall day to day operations of the Polish Air force C-130 PDM Heavy Maintenance program.  A typical day at work was very challenging.  It was difficult to get support from upper management.  What I learned was how to think outside the box, be creative with my workforce to accomplish day to day maintenance schedules.  The workplace culture was a stovepipe type environment where internal business units were self supporting.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the culture and trying to get support from my peers.  The enjoyable part was making new business partners and achieving a positive budget where prior to my employment the budget was in the red."
good,Left there to take a management position.  Corporate culture with much bureaucracy.  I was put in leadership position after short time with the company.  I was recommended for management position with sister office.
good,Was a great place to work. I had an elite job. Manufacturing and Quality depended upon me. People's lives depended on me. It ended sadly after we went on strike. Even after I crossed the line. Everyone wanted my job. I was injured by another employee who then remained working there after I was forced out.
good,"I loved my time here as a temporary employee. I was here for a year and a half. I has hired on permanently, but left shortly after because of low pay."
good,"Currently, there is more emphasis placed on youth than experience. There is a lack of understanding of quality. There is a lack of communication between programs which causes redundancy."
good,"The first year was fine. After that, it had been cut after cut to benefits."
good,I am going to withhold any commentary due to the terms of my Reduction In Force agreement as to not impact my severance package.  I can say that I was well compensated and that the work was interesting.
good,"The money is really hard to beat. However, the management is lacking at best. They make just any FSR the site lead, regardless if they have any management skills at all. In the end it was not worth the money for me."
good,"worked with some good people, but we never knew if more work was becoming available. Job security was uncertain and people laid off if contracts didn't come in."
good,"Reaching the required numbers is the goal, but the management tries to provide all required help.  Small office means you get to know all your co-workers."
good,"Ok company to work for as long as you are under 50 years old.  I have seen time and time again when someone turns 50, Harris will start pushing that person out the door.  "
good,Good working environment poor management  allot of politics no room for advancement unless you know someone full of discrimination.
good,"Great place for a new grad or newer engineer to be involved with lots of different technologies, specially since the company has the capital to work on large programs with lots of resources.  As you get higher up then the expectation is that you are less technical, but also have to deal with a lot of the mistakes management makes, which results in lots of unnecessary headaches and stress."
good,Harris has a lot to offer fulltime employees but much for contract employees. Benefits for employees and quality of home and work life is always under fire.  But if you are laid off from Harris they do try to bring you back into the fold.
good,"The industry has been hurting for a few years so its time to look elsewhere."
good,Worked here off and on for many years. They are going through some issues currently that don't appear to be ending anytime soon.
good,A place where your ideas are heard and you can explore new technologies. With new diverse work force and some of the smartest people in the business.
good,"While working for L-3 Communications I was charged with transporting currency in and around Baghdad during Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was difficult, dangerous, and exciting."
good,"Long hours with very few days off, but the benefits are good. Good insurance package, four to five weeks of paid time off on top of holidays and two weeks paid Christmas. Poorly managed."
good,Nice place to work. Some areas push hard while other areas are very laid back.
good,"Professionally diverse work environment with opportunities to interact and learn from multiple job functions."
good,"Not sure about future of this company.  It used to be the rock of the local DOD manufacturing, but have had some troubles.  But who doesn't.  Mesh organization, but there are personal networks that need to be cautious of.   There are silo management approaches that cannot be broken down without a great deal of effort.  I had a good long run there. But, I think those days are numbered when someone can get 40+ years of tenure.  In a lot of ways that's a good thing.  Did I get my 40 words?"
good,"Program control responsibilities in areas of program planning, budgeting, and estimates at completion to meet contractual/project requirements.  Responsible for the analysis and creation of program work breakdown structures (WBS) and job cost segregation consistent with contract and internal reporting requirements.  Developed and allocated program budgets by task and subtask.  Monitored programs for accurate cost accumulation and moved incorrect charges to the appropriate area.  Participated in weekly/monthly schedule status meetings and provided analysis to ensure accurate status reporting.  Responsible for coordination and revision of program estimate-to-complete inputs with the Program Manager and/or Engineering team to evaluate the estimate-at-completion and cost and schedule risk.  Prepared, analyzed, and presented cost and schedule data at monthly program review.  Provided weekly/monthly reports for customers, both internal and external"
good,It was a good learning experience and is a good stable job that will put food on the table. Nothing Spectacular.
good,"As a defense contractor, this company requires very strict tracking of time.  It seems that every project you work on is very time/budget constrained, so you are always being asked to charge as few hours as possible.  Which leaves you where?  Stressed out, and with no accounts to charge."
good,"Harris was a great company to work for. However beginning in 2012 major changes including the untimely exit of a CEO and the arrival of the new CEO meant drastic changes within the company."
good,"I worked in two different companies which were subsidiaries of L3, one of which no longer exists, and the other has changed its name. A typical day here consists of me ensuring functionality of weapons systems and ensuring those I managed were able to do whatever mission was necessary. I planned many missions according to the intelligence at hand and ensured all those involved had whatever information was available for the mission. Many times I went on these missions as the convoy commander to ensure mission was complete with no issues. This was while in Iraq. The other company, was fairly normal and easily done. I did many things here to include heavy equipment rigging and crane operations, confined space evaluations and hazard safety, and mechanics."
good,"Harris has lost several bids to Motorola due to two reasons:"
good,Good starter job. No longer offers as much on the job training and career development.
good,"Company allows you to work from home when needed, plenty of company activities, and a bonus structure that is fair.  My co-workers were wonderful, my management team was outstanding."
good,"When I first got to L3 in Waco Texas back in 2012, business was booming.  There was so much work to get done and there was always overtime if needed.  At the beginning of 2014, they had a major layoff, and people are continuing to quit L3 now.  The morale is low, the pay is not very good, the yearly raises are between 8-40 cents, and most of the management needs to be fired."
good,"An average day here at Harris Healthcare would include scheduling meetings, booking travel, reimbursing expenses and other for a team of 2 directors and one VP. I am also the HR Assistant for the division, as well as the Finance Assistance."
good,We work twelve hour days doing a job that is rewarding. I've learned a lot about of in depth knowledge about my job. The company offers classes to further us as employees which is helpful.
good,"Army Fleet Support- a great place to work!"
good,Basically no support to contracted employees that work outside of the Corporate HQ area.
good,"worked 8  hours a day in a great facility"
good,"I came in did my job, went home. I was a janitor, I cleaned: swept and mopped the floors, stripped, waxed, buffed and polished the tile floors. I cleaned the bathrooms daily, I washed the windows, vacuumed and shampooed carpet as needed, Cleaned the stairs, sanitized the door knobs, took out the trash nightly. restocked the bathrooms with supplies (toilet paper, paper towels and hand soap). I also broke down boxes, and replaced light bulbs, removed cobwebs and high dust as well as low dust."
good,"9 - 5 working environment"
good,A lot of information chasing.  Orders are always incorrect/missing information.
good,Management seemed disorganized.  Control was from headquarters out of state and little input from local management about decisions affecting local employees.
good,good job if you like to travel and pay for it out of pocket was laid off on short notice not happy with supervisors conflicts between management that makes employees suffer.
good,"⋆ 12 hrs shift working with documents translation or interpretation with one hour lunch break. Working independently at assigned assignments as part of bigger group."
good,"Receive proposals list assigned to me and start working with the highest priority proposals first. Adjust priorities as needed."
good,I enjoyed my time with L-3 working for DoD at the Pentagon. It gave me the chance to network with people of all types of IT backgrounds. I gained some cyber security experience while working there. 
good,"Because they were in Florida, they felt like they could pay less at the time (2005).  The teams are shuffled for each projects, so you are constantly with new people"
good,"Premier arrivé sur mon lieu de travail, après l'inspection des lieux, le "
good,Enjoyed the work.  Much the same as Northrop Grumman (same contract).
good,"My days are never typical.  I usually have several projects going on at once.  People always coming to me asking me to help with something. I can be booking travel for our President, Executives or regular employees while at the same time be creating reports, tracking training records, answering questions, etc. I enjoy multi-tasking. I am looking for a job where I can continue to learn new things.  "
good,"Typical day-building walk through "
good,Commercial DOD business model can be challenging and fast paced.
good,"The structure in management within HR makes absolutely no sense.  The hardest part about the job was working with the Compensation manager.   She is by far the most unfriendly, egotistical and saddest woman I have ever met.  Whatever you do, stay away from this woman as she will make your work life as stressful and as miserable as hers.  "
good,Good people and interesting work environment. Always something to do never a boring day able to wear many hats; low pay but good benefits.
good,Test and configure computer systems. Provided training for new technicians and help complete production for flight simulators.
good,"Supported the customer in a combat environment. Great pay, no benefits."
good,not a bad company has a lot of potential but still have a lot thing that could make the process flow much better.
good,day at work - intense
good,Great company solid benefits. Long hours and no overtime. Salary only.
good,"Learned much about soldering, Company will provide trainning and tools to work with."
good,"I work for a wonderful company called CTL. Unfortunately we were purchased by L-3 Corporation. Since being bought by L-3 we have not received any profitsharing, incentives, and have had our 401K matching percentage reduced."
good,alot of people brought the moral down and did not want to work
good,"Harris is a great technology company with a large variance of products and opportunities. In the manufacturing sector, there is too much emphasis on appearances and to many inexperienced middle managers who will climb your back and throw you under the bus to get to the top of the food chain. This is probably true of many other companies though. If you are middle aged with tons of experience expect to be working for a recent college grad with no practical experience and who will treat you like your an idiot. In 2009 Harris laid of hundreds of people in a workforce reduction plan. Many talented, dedicated, long term employees got the ax. If their hiring now, I wonder why they don't bring some of those people back instead of advertising for new people. Answer: so they can fill those positions with new grads."
good,Very unstable company. Rumor of lay-offs all the time. Waay too much over-time.
good,The job was very challenging. Travel was part of the agenda.
good,"Reviewing Engineering Change Orders, chair Change Control Board, release ECO's, drawings, BOM's and software. Work closely with Engineering. I have learned new part configurations, new ERP system, customer documentation. Great co-workers - very supportive and willing to help. The hardest part of the job is researching part configurations. The most enjoyable part of the job is releasing documents and working with Engineering."
good,I have obtained superb skills from this company. The benefits and the employees are great. Unfortunately they do a lot of laying off that causes unexpected financial hardships for employees.
good,The vacation time is nice but the employee compensation and ability to move up is lacking. Culture has not changed from before the merger. The positions are stable and would be a good job starter job but not a place to stay long term.
good,"Overall, I had a good experience working with L3. L3 recently went through a merger with Harris. That involved quite a few new changes in all levels of management and process. I would recommend for you to be familiar with the defense and military culture to become a stronger candidate."
good,"This place has improved significantly since I have been there.  The culture was very combative when I was there around 2013, but the entire management team changed so it is a bit more collaborative.  Also, there were no new projects coming in when I was there, but the company is starting to get new projects under the Harris Corporation."
good,"- The company does does not have a culture of empowerment."
good,"I was contract there, when I started I was assigned a mentor who interacted with me from day 1. I was placed in a Geometric dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) class within the first couple weeks of starting there. Every one was willing to help as I learned there system and how they did things. Great company involvement they had something going on at least once a month to encourage employee moral. Down side is they brought in a ton of contractors knowing they were going through this merger. Once finance got tight  and some bids on expected jobs fell through, contractors got cut.  which is a risk but Harris should have been a little more forthcoming with that information because I relocated from Ohio to Florida with the idea that I had a contract for a 12 month duration which last 5 months."
good,"They only think about the shareholders"
good,"If you want to stay a mechanic forever they can accommodate.  If you want to move up, it will take a while.  Management is disconnected from the workers and what it takes to do your job."
good,"We have really good intentions here, and some really amazing people; smart, talented, and fun, but of those, few are involved in the direction of where things need to go. Instead, the talent is squandered for petty and sometimes comical reasons (DoD contracting is like that sometimes.) "
good,"As a mid career professional employed at Harris, I was shocked at the amount of micromanagement recently introduced and the and the lack of employee empowerment and creative space required for smart people to do great things.  So many templates, charts, reports, and status meetings, there is very little time for innovation, creative thinking, problem solving, and collaboration - the things that historically set Harris apart from the competition.  The management style has shifted to elementary school type oversight (so much so that you can't actually get work done!) which is less than inspiring for those high performers desiring career advancement and personal job satisfaction."
good,"Experts in the fields of piezo ceramic, upper assembly and acoustic engineering.  Company and local site lack documented and functional process systems.  Supervisors and management spend way too much time in meetings, should spend more time on the floor with the operators.  Staffing is insufficient to meet customer needs."
good,"Ive been a contractor at Harris corp in Rochester NY"
good,"Fast paced defense contractor"
good,"It was a job in an MRO environment. If you play the game you can move up quick. Raises were frequent. "
good,Management would make all the decisions instead of the workers.We as maintainers should have been allowed to make more judgement calls because of our expertise.
good,"Harris is still wrestling with the Exelis acquisition and integration that began in 2015.  Weekly data requests from corporate headquarters create distraction from ongoing program execution.  Current hiring policy creates a challenge to ongoing programs.  Hiring special skills to support ongoing programs is a challenge due to limited candidate population, yet Human Resource policy creates barriers.  Company is not focused on retaining baby boomers for their experience."
good,My area the manager is great involved but busy. He is approachable and easy to talk to. Upper management from directors up have no clue what the bottom line wants and are fourcing change that is hurting or pushing quality people out the door. In order to be competitive in the market  Utah they are going to have to make some change for the good quickly
good,"L3 Technologies is a place that has high values. There seems to be longevity with a lot of people that work there. I enjoy working with my program teams and the programs they support. Unfortunately, I do not live close and the drive is becoming tiresome and expensive. I recommend L3 to anyone that likes to work in a great program environment."
good,"I really liked working here, its a tuff business and can be very up and down. You need to be willing to move as required. The workforce is well trained and the goals are defined."
good,"It was a good experience to work for L3 and fun, lacking some improvement and communication, the contract is shaky at times. Good benefits and overall good company culture"
good,I've worked there previously. The pros of the job is the learning experience. I learn many things that wasn't required of me in the airlines. The cons was the management and not being appreciated
good,"Benefits are adequate, but a bit pricey for insurance.  Management team has unfortunately lost touch with the work force and executes poorly.  Work vs. Life balance is unbalanced."
good,L-3 was a nice place to work. I received a great deal of experience in many areas of finance. I worked with the pricing area to help develop accurate bid proposals.
good,coworkers were good bunch of guys to work with. I didn't work with L3 coworkers I worked with FAA employees and other contractors. The management was good.
good,"The management team was built up with a group of young engineers who had little experience in how to management a dynamic environment.There had been a norm for the engineering projects to be in panic mode deal to bad management, which caused the engineering teams a lot of stress to rework/re-plan the schedule."
good,"I think in that business it is still a mans world depending on the company you work for.  L-3 is more of a manufacturing company and did not understand the Defense Contracting Security business.  And for me without a degree when the government contracts starting requiring them, they did not fight for me.  Over the years I had worked for them I had some very good managers, but the last couple were not employee advocates.  I moved on..."
good,"The division never really aligned with L3's focus. As a result, it experienced numerous and confused changes. It is now up for sale and will likely benefit from new ownership."
good,"If the company kept its promise or word to us as employees , especially the pay raise and guaranteed our term in the contract, I would have return but I have a family and being unemployeed for 3 months was a heavy burdenon my family"
good,I mainly worked in the stockroom and count inventory. I then would sometimes pay out pieces and then adjust parts in and or out of the inventory system.
good,"Excessive hours required employees are good natured and willing to work as a team, The direction the company was heading was too shaky and i felt it was a good time to move on."
good,The work environment with L-3 communications was a little laid back and enjoyable.  All the staff had jobs to complete and once they were completed we would spend time talking about future events
good,A typical day in this office was stressful.  With serving all the cable sites that we had a day could be very hectic.  The culture of the workplace was very poor.
good,"As an hourly employee, one of the things I ran into was that so many people were busy trying NOT to work. "
good,"Work / Life Balance"
good,"I write a list of action items I need to accomplish that day.  However, as soon as I get to my desk a crisis is looming and I spend most of the day putting out fires."
good,"Former ITT/Exelis employee, Harris is a different culture with more emphasis on metrics. Good management fun people in Herndon care about safety and quality of our service to the FAA, Which in turn saves peoples lifes."
good,Got along excellently with my fellow engineers.  All engineers are willing to share their expertise to assist problems you may have.  Programs are interesting but can challenging getting all required work done in the schedule that managers set forth.
good,Company has out sourced many jobs to India which I feel is morally wrong.  The people in India did not understand the job and made alot of mistakes.  Many people were laid off.
good,"A typical day is full of stress and meeting. "
good,I only worked at L-3 for 10 months. The environment was not very welcoming but as an employee I did my work and kept everything on a professional level.
good,"In general, the company is not very family friendly.  As a company they are empathetic to the family needs.  On the flip side, there are many interesting and challenging opportunities."
good,"Good company with some great people working there. Management team is pretty arrogant and has fostered a culture of fear and uncertainty. If you are not part of the inner circle forget it. Always espousing latest management fads and goals while having complete inability to solve their fundamental problems.  Nobody takes any risks for fear of repercussions so company stays stuck in past while competition leaves them behind.  People who have been there for years are laid off and unceremoniously walked out the door with zero warning, no chance prepare or  say goodbye, which is a great morale killer for those who remain."
good,Overall a wonderful defense company. I am very grateful for all the opportunity for growth. Recent focus on profits has made compensation less enticing.
good,"Level 3 needs to focus on the challenges they have today.  They add more issues than they do resolve.  Their employee focus varies by the month, and does not fully motivate their teams to success."
good,A typical day at work was sitting in a cubicle. Management was OK. Pretty OK workplace culture. Hardest part of job was dealing with all the governmental regulations. Most enjoyable part was working with co-workers.
good,"a lot of different types of technologies being developed.  lots of opportunities to move between business sectors.  very little understanding of long term goals.   frustration builds the longer you stay there.  I have heard of worse companies, and better so i would rate them as so-so."
good,"* Day in the life at Harris - Busy. "
good,"Great place to work lots of perks, free coffee, fruit, bagels, on site gym, good work/life balance, some departments have much less opportunity for overtime than others."
good,Lock of management principles do to the fact that supervisory positions are filled based on friendship to upper level managers rather than the qualification of applicants
good,"Good place to work for an engineer.  Good for electrical, RF and mechanical engineers.  A stable, large employer in the Salt Lake Valley."
good,Very changeable work atmosphere. L-3 strives to be tactical to meet customer needs and this requires the workplace to be very adept at rapid change. Not a place for those expecting long-term tenure in one location.
good,My 1st tier management was amazing but after that it was horrid. Balance was mostly work and less about family. I know other divisions are much better though
good,enough said. Was bored during my time here. not challenged enough and work was repetitive through the entire shop. copy paste from other shop review..
good,"I left to start a new business for someone."
good,If you would like to discuss my opinions regarding the companies I have worked for or with I will gladly do so during an interview.
good,"Enjoyed my time- felt like there was definitely good work/life balance. Management was good, but always felt out of the loop. Constantly worried about job security."
good,"Over the past 6 years I have had the opportunity to work in a nice environment with great people. Working my responsibilities and learning, different, challenging ones, everyday would bring something new. Very family oriented place of business."
good,Enjoyed working there. They had nice people. It is a great company to work for. I learned how to work independently and how to work in a team environment. I enjoyed having a flexible schedule and location was excellent.
good,Needs new blood to much of the good ole boy network.  The rest of the problems at the company or the same ones that any big company has.  No matter where you work you will encounter the same issues.
good,A typical day at work is to try to get to that day's work.  I have learned allot about what i make and the company it's self.  All new management changes 4 times in the past 2 years.  Co-workers are very good people and love working with them.  Hardest part of the job is that we are so understaffed we just can't keep up.  The best part of the job is being with people you enjoy working with as a team and accomplishing what we need to get done.
good,Hardest part of the job is very limited opportunity for the advancement due to the fact that new company strategy relies on the sustainability rather than new progress and development.
good,"Productive and educational."
good,The job is great. I manage the day to day operations of the Calibration Laboratory un-assisted from upper management. Fellow employees are great.
good,"When I started at L3 GCS it was a seemingly friendly place to work where the individual could include his family / life requirements in his work. Unfortunately after some management changes it became a repressive place to work, after 6 years we separated."
good,"if you learn to play the corporate game, you'll survive for a while."
good,"Work load is either slow or busy, never steady.  Management never seems to know what's going on or is always ""looking into it.""  People are good people, just lack the skills and training to be in managment.  Co workers are nice and down to earth people.  Hardest part of the job is keeping busy.  The benefits are excellent"
good,"Work at least 12 hour day, 7 days a week on overseas assignment in hostile environment.  Must be dedicated to supporting the war fighter.  Management support is currently best experienced.  Most difficult part of job is long hours and being away from family.  Rewarding part of job is knowing you are helping the warfighter and doing yoru part to keep them safe."
good,Very competative environment working with government and international customers.Funding an issue at times with imposed limits on contract. I worked with a highly professional and creative group of people. Cross functional communication at times not up to date with changes to schedule. Difficult to get a decision from multi layer management. The ability to have flexibilty in activities daily was a boon.
good,"enjoyed the 4/10 work days.  learned a lot and liked the general atmosphere of the facility.  too bad HR chose to start letting go of the older experienced folks, which definitely changed the workforce.  and hiring 30 something managers who could not even spell the acronyms we used was a real bummer. no chance for advancement at that point in the game."
good,"Ok place to work, company lost the government bid so the company left and we were all hired with the new company."
good,I was a PM with Harris Corporation and was a key contributor working on complex proposals and implementations.
good,The company is large and the interns get lost in the crowd. A lot of busy word and document control.
good,"Hired on expecting there would be room for advancement and I would be eligible for security clearance based on fully disclosed situation.  Found out soon security clearance would not happen on my project, was let go at the first opportunity."
good,"Don't be surprised if you know more then your supervisor most of them came from doing one thing for a long period of time.  if you do anything very well you will be doing it until you are fired or if your lucky you will be promoted as well.  L-3 doesn't do lay offs so when they need 150 more mechanics to get a contract they hire them quick, then when they don't get the contract 150 people have to go and its not going to be the 150 they just hired its going to be anyone who makes a mistake.  Its not going to matter if you been there one day or 30 years, you are always one step away from being fired.  There have been many people that have came back and sued the company and won."
good,"LOVED:"
good,Enter time for CCAD and go through their shops to see if any one is missing time. Then I email anyone who is missing time for that day and cc their supervisor so I make are they put in their time. I create a spread sheet in excel and put all the missing time on it and send it off to supervisors to let them know who is not putting in their time daily. If I have any issue's with their time I email them or call them to notify them so they can make changes as quick as possible.
good,"Rank and file employees have poor salaries, fair benefits that match qualifications and requirements."
good,"Overall, Harris is a very safe place to work, but they have been lacking incentives and tend to focus more on schedule then they do delivering quality products/services."
good,"Aircraft maintenance. "
good,"Very bad balance, on everything you can think of. and the supervisors team leaders are lacking of professionalism."
good,It is a good job for the most part. Come in and go home. At times the communication and leadership could be much better.
good,Friendly laid back atmosphere. You get to listen to music on an mp3 player. They allow many breaks so you dont get restless.
good,"They mix really talented, hardworking individuals with folks that have no business being in the IT industry.  This a great small company that became a big company but wonders why it gets the criticism of being a big company.  Management concentrates placing you in fixed positions instead of cultivating your technical and professional growth."
good,"9 hour days in a 9/80 work schedule. Learned system level testing. A very clique-ish social environment. Poorly over-managed. Enjoyable work for a good purpose, nothing too terribly hard about it."
good,You will experience world class specialized knowledge; get a glimpse of the future in vacuum electronics.  The work environment could use some modernization.  Can see handcrafted high performance amplifiers made on a daily basis.  Most difficult part of the job is the stressful environment.
good,"you have a lot of good people that work there, the company changed when excelis took over"
good,Long working hours and management that does not feel accountable.
good,"Busy, fast paced company with lots of work.  Inspected from sub assembly level all the way up to system level.  Was team mentor so I learned a lot about working with others.  Great people to work with.  Right now, job security is questionable.  I was laid off along with 191 others just recently and they are now going through HR records to let others go.  I think what I liked most about this job was the people I worked with, the benefits and pay were pretty good and they let your pick your work week hour preference."
good,Express is a staffing office.  They are good placing you with the company
good,"Level 3 is a great place to  to work for me because of the great people I work with and the wonderful location in Broomfield, CO.  In a nutshell, my team (MyLevel3 Portal Support) is a trouble shooting team.  We communicate with our customers, via several different methods, research the issues presented to us, and resolve them.  Our greatest responsibility is to make certain the customer knows that we will handle their problem and not simply had them off to another person.  In the event that we cannot assist (for example, if a customer has an issue with their contract, which has to be resolved by their account team) we will make it very clear that we will be contacting their account team and once the account team is brought up to speed hand the customer off to the proper people.  Also, we will make it clear to the customer that if they do not receive the resolution they need, to come back to us and we will continue to research the issue."

good,good group of coworkers
good,"This experience includes the performance of Aircraft ground runs, operational checks, pre-flight, post flight inspections, maintenance test flights, component repair or replace, electrical checks, hydraulic checks, scheduled, unscheduled maintenance, and aircraft phase maintenance."
good,"Typical work day is filled with to tasks while some co-workers have nothing to do. The workload was not spread evenly due to the lack of cross training so everyone was only specialized in their current responsibilities. The job is challenging which is great and most co-workers are very supportive. However, my supervisor was tedious with small details such as wordings of emails instead of focusing on the big picture and encourage motive the team to grow."
good,Pros: Good benefits and a good place for career advancement.
good,Change is the only constant. The shrinking defense industry makes it hard to be loyal to the employer.
good,"I operated a complex high vacuum chamber.I was responsible for loading, unloading,and regular maintenance of the vacuum chamber. I was also required to maintain daily records of the process."
good,Worked with an amazing team on amazing projects both in the continental United States (CONUS) and outside the continental United States (OCONUS).
good,As my position was eliminated I am not sure what direction this company is going in.
good,"Advancement is difficult with this company. Too much of the daily duties relies on tribal knowledge and if you are a ""favorite"" of the management. There is no engineering support and operations changes their policies and procedures to suit the moment."
good,I was the supervisor over the Goggle area. I enjoyed the job. Had great employees.
good,Family friendly environment with a ton of fun-loving folks to work with.
good,"Working as a Senior-level RPG/AS400 Programmer Analyst the last 3 years was not as satisfying.  I was only performing Application Support/Maintenance and Integration/Migration work.  Very important work, but not as satisfying."
good,The flexibility in normal working hours has improved over the last few years. Management is typically helpful when they are available. The salaried positions are not true salary positions but they are in a tough spot with that since most of the work being performed is on government contracts.
good,Management is not user friendly and walks all over the employees.  Management does not provide support to the different sites.  Bad management at the program level.
good,Life is to short to be unhappy. My personal choice to leave and see what else I can do. Overall a good company and even greater co-workers. Flexible schedule if needed. Benefits are ok and pretty standard comparatively.
good,"The people here seemed to be very negative about their lives like they were stuck and unless you move around, you'll deal with that negativity where it could possibly sink into your life. The management was decent, but the director level and up was just ridiculous. I would say that the benefits here are good and the job security, but it seems like an unhappy place to work with the everyday monotony that occurs."
good,You can't know when you will be laid off. They give no time to move on and find something when they are between contracts. They just lay off everyone. Giving no real notice.
good,"Like working there due to the pay and benefits but not worth it when you’re treated poorly by management because you’re sick, or any other reason it may be."
good,good employer enjoyed my time with the company and all the training I received. very productive and fast passed with the program I was a part of. always fair and compensated well for my hard work
good,Many challenges and great to see processes and be involved with integration and development work.  Have been around many talented and dedicated workers.
good,"Good Job nothing to complain, sometimes a couple issues but is a good work for people like to do overtime and make money good benefits and good coworkers"
good,It was a good place to work during the time I was employed there. My supervisor's were well educated and were very helpful. My Coworkers were very easy to get along with.
good,The company was very professional and cared for their employees. The pay was great and management knew how to step back and not micromanage. This company is one of the great ones
good,"Good place to work if you have the time, management is helpful and will try to do their best to help you out but as a contractor you’re hard pressed for some of the attention actual employees get"
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy stability. That being said, long hours and stressful days are often required with no notable employee recognition or perks. Can be stingy with promotions and salary unless you are an engineer."
good,My time was short there so I can't give a balance review but it seem like a very low stress workplace. nice and friendly people to work with. little pressure from management to complete the project
good,"I had multiple issues at Harris. Even when I contacted management to assist, I never felt that I never was placed on any priority. Situations festered."
good,Technical content of job challenging and satisfying.  Coordinates closely with customers.  Facility is isolated geographically and professionally.  Culture is focused inward and preoccupied on organizations on historical accomplishments.  Deprecates outside knowledge and capabilities.  Management style authoritarian.  Getting information and advocating for own solutions is very difficult.
good,"Great stepping stone, Lots of opportunities. I just was not advancing as fast as I had hoped and was not paid fairly. Advancement was promised, but never delivered."
good,L3 is a good company to work for. They truly care for the well being of thier employees. I have been with L3 for 21 years. The provide manu benefits for improvement.
good,No good for me. not enough hours no overtime bad management.under pay people and over pay people that dont know anything. Wasn't the place for me to work
good,"There is a underlying continual battle between corporate management and divisional management.  It made my job very difficult based on my project which I was hired for.  "
good,"worked on all ground support equipment, servicing, repairing and troubleshooting, ensuring equipment paperwork was  up to day."
good,Typical day at work and fun workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was launching and recovery aircraft. I was promoted to an Aircraft Worker to and Aircraft Mech I
good,I enjoyed my time at Harris Corp .The company had good benefits and the pay was decent. I found the work interesting as I was able to put my Telco Knowledge to goos use
good,"Coworkers are all friendly and knowledgeable. Harris promotes a strong work/life balance, which is excellent. Management does not communicate any corporate decisions or information on new products. Buildings are run down and neglected. Water leaks, bad plumbing, dirty bathrooms. No training or ways for engineers to continue educations. Higher than average employee turnover. Very low morale."
good,good place to work very innovative and on the cutting edge of technology.  I liked it a lot and was challenged quite a bit.  had a good time working there
good,Team of L3 Acquisition professionals working with Government to establish acquisition processes and procedures.  Excellent Teamwork and collaboration in providing contract support
good,"Good place to work"
good,"good place to work"
good,"As is typical with government contracts, company lost re-compete with the Department of Defense. Moved to SAIC, and was luckily pleased with the compensation and opportunities."
good,"Good company lots of jobs, and even more options for movements around the country. They have good benefits and good employee pricing on their products."
good,"As a Data Survey Interviewer, I spent time confirming company information; posting company packets to businesses; analyzing company data; inputting data into system; answering in-coming customer service calls."
good,Harris Corporation provided me the opportunity to step outside of traditional finance and explore an operational role as Chief of Staff for a segment CEO.
good,"Generally an enjoyable work environment and great people to work with. But when work loads are low there is a lot of boredom, and people will hoard tasks to maintain their hours."
good,"Excellant benefits for new technicians, looking to start IT career. Many fields to expand IT knowledge for a large contracting government adgency. Positions can be found all over the world."
good,"L-3 being a large company does not really afford much room to work with schedules that suit your needs. Due to the nature of being a deployed technician you have very little say on what your schedule will be. While individual people are willing to work with you getting everyone on board to get something approved is next to impossible. In addition, you are not treated like a member of the team more like a number that is replaceable. The pay is more than fair for the position, and some of the benefits are great. The work/life balance can be fair if you can get people to work with you on it. For example, I extended to help them out whenever they needed me to last year, but when it came time to get new schedules I got the worst schedule I could possibly receive. In response to my request to move the schedule 3 weeks to the right so as not to miss Christmas by 6 weeks every year only 1 person was willing to work with me."
good,Great place to work. A bit rough neck type of place but good people. Not much of a place to move up the ladder but very laid back with a good group made the time fly by
good,It's buddy system. Either they like you or they don't. Self preservation happens a lot. You always need to watch your back. They don't encourage inter-department movement.
good,Preformed aircraft maintenance.  Given the opportunity to travel.  Enjoyed working with on site management.  The work culture was very professional.  We always had any tool to get our job done in an efficient way.
good,"L-3 was once a great company to work for, but from about 2008 onward, the culture changed as people got laid off and resigned.  Work was spread to others without suitable replacements being hired, and progressively more was asked of the engineers and sales."
good,The company was very good when it came to ensuring that the customer always came first. Customers were the most important ingredient to the success at Harris.
good,"Pretty standard technical intern work. Some workers seemed to be working at a faster pace, however I didn't get the full work experience as I was just an intern."
good,"material handling, stock room, pull material for orders/packages, process and move on to the next. can be monotonous but exciting at times, working 9/80 work week with every other Friday off helped with relaxing on weekends"
good,"The Remote Neural Monitoring Division Concerned Me, they ruin lives by creating technology that manipulates peoples ability to manage their own lives.."
good,Knowledge is the key factor on how you could tackle the tasks to be performed in the timely manner. Quality is always at the utmost this is the key elements that I've learn which help me on my career.
good,this was a fun place to work until certain management decided that they would rather turn a blind eye to certain situations that were not good for the job site.
good,Good company but going through a lot of changes.  I would recommend it.   Management is good.  Co-workers are nice.  Only left due to contract change.
good,"Harris was a nice place to work. Harris offered a competitive salary, flexible hours, and decent benefits. Even though my time there was short, I learned quite a bit in that short amount of time"
good,"Good, established programs, but company needs to do more to encourage new business and platforms. Too many of L3's members are old-school types, and many of their programs are ""legacy"" ones."
good,"For some reason Indeed believes that I worked at L3.  I did not.  I worked at Level 3.  I have heard good things about their product and technology architecture, but have no first-hand knowledge."
good,Very slow paced and the work got tedious after a while I'm filling this to reach the limit because I don't feel like writing more than what I have already said
good,"Ordering Aircraft parts., inventory management, storing aircraft parts."
good,The job in the beginning was very challenging. Things have changed due to loss of government contracts. Work is very slow and there is constant talk of layoffs. Not sure what is going to happen.
good,Since working at L-3 the rules for time flexing have changed dramatically. It seems that the upper management cares more about have a face available and less about allowing employees to work their own schedule as long as work is getting done.
good,Overall coworkers are great. Management is great. Pay could be better   Some days I had nothing to do. Could have planned out the work better. I tried to make it last but it last but I can’t stretch it out all the time.
good,Loved working with my co workers meet all different kinds of people learned a lot about dock work my supervisor was a good teacher learned a lot from him
good,Average place to work. Lack of Diversity. Medical Benefits cost more and decline in quality each year. Management at the corporate level was recently upgraded.
good,"Quick and competitive learning environment that rewarded hard work."
good,L3 Technologies is a good place to work although there has been some changes in Upper Management recently that has impacted the overall morale at the floor level. The health benefits where a lot better in recent years compared to now.
good,"Worked there for over 20 years. Held several positions from assembler, technician to supervisor. Would consider this place a good place to work and learn."
good,"A happy place to work with a positive culture. Sadly, however, there is very little room for career advancement. The salary and benefits compare favourably with other companies."
good,The job was less than expected but I remained employed untill I obtained another position and then provided notice as they did provide me an opportunity .
good,"Learned a lot working at L-3.  Stressful environment.  Workload was for two people, but given to one.  High turnover in the accounting department due to management."
good,They were under a bid war and lost. It was no fault of the people I worked with the company that took over was not good at all. They did not care about the workers.
good,"I worked there 90 days as a temp. I have good feeling about work place .The  workers were very helpful, and excellent to get along with. I enjoyed working there."
good,Fast pace environment and constantly busy throughout the day. Multi-task required to become a more valuable employee. Target product output required on a daily basis.
good,Nice place to work. Everyone is willing to help each other succeed. Great paying job in the Crestview area. As long as you keep busy and do your job you will have no problems.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my employment at L3 Communications.  Our project was very collaborative with little office politics and competitive back stabling.  My direct manager hired good leads and let them get the job done."
good,"Government contracts drove the business environment of the 1980's and how many contracts that were won definitely set the financial atmosphere."
good,"The people became an extended family. The workplace culture was interactive and collaborative. Each day was very busy, but overall enjoyable. If the site had not closed down, I would still be working there."
good,This company brought the one I worked at years and years ago. I have no clue what this place is now. Cant give it a review. It was stressful and constant fighting and bickering.
good,L3 san carlos was a good place to work.  The company decided moving to Torrance Calif.  80% of the staff did not want to move there. People were good to work with.  I liked developing new software with my colleges.
good,Enjoyed my time there and would recommend this to someone wishing to work in the aviation industry.  Wished for quicker project approval.  Great coworkers.
good,"Big corporation with large number of employees. Working condition is good. Lunch is fair, but expensive.Tests for promotion. Not bad place to work except firing during probation is quick and easy."
good,I was disappointed that I left a Full time permanent job for an opportunity at L3- where they told me a Ninety-day temp to hire was mandatory and when my Ninety days where up my Boss was told due to cut backs and consolidations my position was not being filled.
good,One of the largest government contractors in Central Florida.  Has many government contracts in a variety of fields.  Provides the area with a large proportion of the middle class income in the area.
good,l3 was the first job i had after the army i can apperciate everything i learned there i havent been there in may years so i have no clue what its like now
good,"A great place to work if you don't ask too many questions and are near the end of your career. Sloppy and antiquated, with outmoded technology from the 2000's."
good,"Great people to work with , and great benifits, enjoyed work enviroment, great leadership, great opportunity for learning new methods and  procedures."
good,The contract job world is always up and down coinciding with the changing landscape of the government so the work environment is almost always adjusting and that can be difficult to create a consistent work/life balance.
good,"Most days involved collaboration of individuals to assign tasks for the day  "
good,"I was one of the early employees.  My job basically ended when there was no more right of way to get.  They made it extremely hard on me to stay at Level 3, treated more as a secretary than a Network Developer."
good,"Good people to work with. Pay is below average and product is low to medium tech. Not too exciting but decent place to work overall. Benefits are OK, you get 3 weeks PTO, no sick leave."
good,"16 hangers. Mostly empty right now. Nice people for the most part. Several HAAS of various size. One VR11 and one EC400.  Several gantry routers. Two trunnions. Three hydroform machines. Two nice CMMs. Had seven programmers. Went through six managers in two years, latest one is the best so far and I would work with him again. Very military friendly employer. The whole pan handle is military oriented."
good,I have nothing particularly good or bad to say about this company. I worked at the client site and had limited interaction with management and human resources.
good,It is a fine place to start off at but it is constantly changing. It has a lot of contract work so contracts change which changes management. You never know what is going to happen from year to year. Also they had restrictions on advancement that were not based on work performance which was frustrating for all.
good,Adjusting to the Harris way is tough for legacy Exelis employees. We are treated somewhat like stepchildren  by corporate leadership. I would stay away from any site that has been acquired by Harris Corp.
good,There are a variety of cultures working at Harris. Ages and nationalities are all different. I enjoy working with the team I belong to in the calibration department.
good,"9/80 work schedule is nice and the benefits are great."
good,"Good company to work for.  Nice people, good teamwork, strong support system, challenging work.  The bad is the same at any big corporation that when it comes time to cut the budget anyone can get laid off."
good,Not enough resources and to much quotas to do the job provided. The people were great but there were a lot of hurdles to over come. It was good for a chapter in life.
good,"1.  a typical work day starts early and ends late."
good,I did a contract job in jalabad afghanistan. As far as afghanistan goes this is not a bad location. Rocket and mortar attacks were frequent and the gate was attacked by a car bomb.
good,"Very easy going, other the the empoloyees that I personally encountered there is nothing bad I would have to say about the L3 company as a whole. I enjoyed my work at L3"
good,World class carrier full of extremely intelligent people.  There's always an opportunity to work on projects of scale and directly affect the course of business.
good,"i worked on several interesting and challenging projects, but the problem in many cases was that the company constantly changed directions and would abandon ongoing work continuously and go in other directions, so it was difficult to see final results."
good,I worked for the federal services side and L3 was actually pretty good. The federal contract sites go largely unwatched so your site lead really determines how the site works so you can either have a great experience or a terrible one depending on who is in charge and how they operate.
good,"Experiences there were ok and sometimes not so ok. The people there were fantastic to work with, however in my experience there some things could have been done differently to ensure there were no layoffs and employees stayed employed"
good,"Good place to work till Government Services sold off, my Division is no longer there.  My supervisors aren't there. My colleagues aren't there.  etcetera"
good,Lack of timely communication between employee and company is not the greatest attribute of this company. Issues that have to be worked out on the human resources side is a bit to be desired as well.
good,"Exelis was sold to Harris about 1 year ago. The entity I worked for within Exelis and now Harris is the Deep Space Network (DSN) contracted through JPL/NASA."
good,Was good place to network and build friendships. The company 401K was good and benefits. I was really enjoying working with employees. The selling of divisions wasn't so good.
good,"Management was clear on its directions, I did not stay long enough because this was a contract Job and the project ran out of funds."
good,"Overall, good company. Profit sharing, advancement opportunities, school reimbursement, double time on your seventh day of work have all dwindled in the past decade."
good,Nice place to work. Great people to work with. Nice facility. Worked hard to produce a product second to none within that Industries standard. I had a great boss.
good,It was a 6 month assignment.  To be fair I wasn't there long enough to get a fair and reasonable understanding their work environment.  It was a small engineering effort but the people there were competent.
good,it was a great place to work but the prosecpt of day to day of keeping or having a job made it rough to come to work each. the company was not bad but just not knowing wether you had a job there each day. also the fact they moved people around because they knew them and not based on their work.
good,"My co-op/internship experience at L-3 was beneficial. I was given meaningful work which suited my level of experience. The workplace culture was somewhat stiff and corporate, although it fit my expectations."
good,A little behind the times with financial processes. The people are very nice. There is no free coffee though so bring a coffee machine.
good,I enjoy my job and have a great chemistry with most of my coworkers and enjoy working with them very much...I also loved the work I am doing and believe in the products I assembled
good,i enjoy working there installing cable and electrical equipment. it has great health benefits. we have 15 min breaks in the morning and afternoon.
good,"Government Support, supporting the Program Office with required regulatory and statutory documentation during the acquisition process material in support of the warfighter."
good,"Lots of changes over the years but overall good company to work for."
good,The volume of aircraft maintained on a daily basis is very impressive.  Management is all about work no time for engaging in company conversations about personal life or getting to know fellow workers.
good,Like any company it has it's pros and cons. Good people but reorganizing happens on a regular basis. Not a big focus on marketing at L-3. Internal security constraints made performing some job requirements difficult.
good,"Typical day changed based on President's directive. Executive leadership is non-cooperative when dealing with each other so every organization is silo-ed. Business struggles to move forward, they only succeed because they have a monopoly on the product, which is quickly changing. Co-workers were great."
good,"I loved working for this company.  The benefits could have been better but not bad.  Great retirement plan and great guys to work with and around.  The only thing is, and this is with any government contractor, is that you have no idea whether your gonna have a job from week to week."
good,good place to work. always keep you up to date on things that are happening. Always are checking on you tot see if everything is going ok.
good,Company has great foundations and guidelines to follow. They have great people that work there. Unfortunately this location is closing soon.
good,A typical day at work included non stop harrassment which led to poor morale and work performance. I learned very little at L3. The management was profit driven w/ no concern for personal circumstances. My co workers seemed afraid of management. Hardest part was dealing w/ the general attitude that I was dispensible and had no true knowledge of my job. I enjoyed very little during my time.
good,"Overall good place to work. Medical is expensive however, other benefits are reasonable. Co-workers are fantastic. The sky is the limit on what you can experience and learn."
good,"Must be flexible.  Timelines ever changing and demanding."
good,I like working with the people there but management needs to communicate more. When there is work it can be very rewarding.
good,"Great industry to be in.  From ground processing systems to launch vehicle avionics to communication systems on Mars, it doesn't get much cooler than that."
good,"I can't speak to the culture as I worked there temporarily.  It's a strange place to work with strange union rules.  A lot of the management seems to commute in to work.  There are a lot of great people who work there, but many of them seem unhappy and trapped."
good,I've met a lot of really smart and kind people here. Definitely a good starting place and I have learned a lot. Every other Friday off is a great perk.
good,I believe that our company represents a model of efficiency unparalleled in the industry.  The coffee is Ok.  My colleagues are friendly.
good,"Not a bad place to work as long as you know your place and keep your trust in other employees to a minimum."
good,"A typical day at work includes designing and programming new Automated Test Equipment (ATE) systems or trouble shooting other people's existing ATE systems, as well as modifying operating instructions and training people to use ATE systems."
good,A decent place to work with many areas to pursue as a new graduate. A lot of politics at this company but otherwise a good place to work
good,"Harris is a mixed bag; on balance it is a good place to work.  Benefits are good, but waning.  Work/life balance varies greatly depending on the program assignment.  Base salaries and advancement opportunities are poor.  Management works hard to assign people to the programs of their choice."
good,"Help Desk Support, assisting the govt workers as well as contractors with issues of it support.   That meant resetting  passwords and informing the users of problems that were upcoming and that were going on within the work place."
good,The experience working with this company was alright at the begining and was able to learn from some knowldgeable people but a conflict within the team showed the broken internal system managment had to deal with the problem.
good,"Like any very big company - acceptable and yet competitive benefits.  Worked for different business units and different manager types ranging from micro-managers, to hands-off, to moderately engaged.  Like most, I didn't leave the company, I left the managers for a better opportunity."
good,Empresa me ofereceu a primeira oportunidade para expandir meus conhecimentos.
good,"Typical large corporation. Benefits are being reduced each year as cost of benefits increase. Annual salary increases do not always cover increased costs of benefits, let alone inflation. The pain of working for a large corporation is offset by the pleasure of working on a strong program team, so day-to-day work life is good."
good,"Like any of the big companies out there, you're more a number from corporates perspective. In fact, my first pay check was mis-deposited into someone else's account. Luckily HR and Payroll were able to deposit the amount into my account without delay once the problem was found without holding me up. They took care of recovery of the incorrect deposit on their own time."
good,"Work at L-3 MAS is interesting and very challenging, as it requires hard work and discipline to be successful at fulfilling your duties."
good,"Excellent benefits package, flexible work hours, 10 paid holiday a year.  Co-workers who are knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to help each other out."
good,"Over the last four years, L-3 provided very competitive wages for their employee's.  Multiple changes in management resulted in loss of production and employee moral.  The majority of the time, employees had good work relationships with other employees.  I enjoyed coming to work, and performing my daily tasks.  Job security was lacking.  On many occasions employees did not know if they would have a job the next week."
good,I have been with this company through many changes. It definitely changed as it was bought out by bigger companies but the most enjoyable part of the job is the people I interacted with everyday. The company used to be more people oriented but lately it seems to be more about the numbers. Not a lot of room for advancement in many positions.
good,"I love my job. I love shops that I worked in and the people."
good,"Management is ok, very smart and capable engineering staff. Healthcare benefits have been cut, salaries not keeping up with industry. Recent acquisition may provide benefit."
good,Great place to work and learn how to deploy systems.   Talented engineers and project managers.  Hardest part is work/life balance but you get to enjoy the challenge that comes with working on new/existing projects at the same time.
good,"Production operator, packaged parts for shipment and storage."
good,"It is a small Munitions Storage Area so you do a little bit of everything.  We order, receive, issue out, inspect, ship egress assets.  We pick-up and deliver munitions weekly from Egress.  We pick-up and deliver munitions when required for  Life Support and Time Change for the C130's used for training.  We support all munitions requirements on base to include the school houses along with Security Forces and Honor Guard.  In the past year new management has made the job much harder and more unpleasant than it should be.  The hardest part of the job is working with little to no communication.  It is rewarding work, it's a challenge each week to get everything done that needs to get done.  It is a very busy place to work.  No idle time."
good,"Majority of the work is government contract related."
good,"If you are looking for a challenge then this is it.  We regularly dream of the impossible, create systems that seem entirely too complicated and then make it work in some of the most innocent looking platforms.  You will work with many different disciplines such as engineers from varying fields to numerous supporting activities, to various artisans.  It takes a large team of dedicated professionals to do what we do."
good,"A typical day could range from an easy day cleaning to covered in oil or under the deck in 115 degree heat. The best part about this job was the fact it taught me so many different things and the overall experience of the job. The management was my least favorite part of the job. They were constantly hounding you for your 10 min breaks and were never willing to give any raises, i.e I was there for 2 1/2 years without any raise despite the good / great reviews I received."
good,It was a great place to work . I was glad to go there everyday . in town or out in Triana . Good facillities and a great crew . We were capible of dealing with anything put infront of us.
good,"co-workers are great, management not so much."
good,CAD use all day at work. Get to perform liaison duties on designs. Not a good path set or advertised for career advancement. Good location to gain some good design experience. Work environment is decent. Many people work parts of the weekends. Typical 8-4:30 work day unless mandated overtime exists. Learned many practical design concepts and how to work with different disciplines. Expanded knowledge of manufacturing concepts with sheet metal and machined parts.
good,L-3 had numerous contracts and I learned quite a lot.  I filled many positions while there and broadened my work experience
good,"Good company to work for, with good benefits. Government contractor, with changing contract requirements. Can be over whelming at times."
good,"Hardest part of this job for most people is commuting to such a remote location, not easily accessible unless you live near I-35 or Baylor area..."
good,I learned how to work and operate heavy machinery. Keeping production high and making sure everything is done correctly.  I learned how to work with chemicals and how to dispose of chemicals correctly.
good,Interesting place to work at . Lots of personnel issues but overall a nice place. The division was collapsed as there were too many in the DC area.
good,"	Identified and recruiter primary and secondary instructors to meet the Performance Work Statement for the Center for Domestic Preparedness. "
good,"At the local level in servicing contract awards, the contracted teams assigned to Department of Defense (DOD) agencies do a great job in servicing the customers and contracts. They usually gain the contract renewals. Most all members sitting with the customers are federal security cleared, hold formal degrees and certifications and easily align with their customers' culture and working environment."
good,"Material expeditor,suppling parts from shop to shop. Production control was the main function of my job. worked 3rd shift"
good,Loved my co workers and loved what I did working on aircraft just had a better opportunity with another company. Typical work day was from 6:30 to 5 and overtime was optional on the weekend.
good,The work environment varies from contract to contract. No to sites will be the same as the need to support different missions.
good,Overall a good job with good challenges and fast pace of work.  Day to day is typical of a call center.  Enjoyed working with customers and help to resolve their issues.

good,"overall it was an adventure working with them, so we had to double contact them to fix things that went bad with us. we had to wait for a response from different contractor, who they were sub to them, to get our questions answered."
good,"Greeting customers, assisting broadband with calls, phones. Management changed right before my resignation. Each department has its own manager. Coworkers were friendly and very different in their own ways."

good,"First job as a sheetmetal mechanic ,so this was some good experience. I learned a lot about heavy structures on P3."
good,"Seemed more and more like a number than a person.  Other than the people you work directly with, it was not a company I would wish to work for again."
good,Enjoyed working with them at Fort Benning.  Good company to work for.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Level3, I was told it would take anywhere from 1-3 years to ""catch on"" to things though. Once I started working independently, there were training needs that were never met. I was told I'd bet set up with access to systems, but received no training. "
good,There are many programs to work on giving an RF Engineer a wide array of experience.
good,My would have preferred to continue working at L-3 but now I am excited about exploring other opportunities.
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,production of optical products in a safety monitored location.
good,"Global Crossing was a good place to work for.  Good people, Good culture.  I miss the place.  The merger has turned everything up side down."
good,I assembled and tested weapon sights.  I loved the hands on aspect of the weapon sights and getting to work side by side with some of the developers.
good,"L-3 typically promotes from within. If someone is diligent in advancing their career, this is the place to look."
good,"L-3 was a great place to work.  Fell on very hard times.  Perhaps not well prepared for this.  Overall reduction in force of over 25% in one year.  Lots of good people looking for work."
good,Was a foot in the door to the shipyard industry. I welded foundations for navy ships.
good,Not great either. Salary and benefits have fallen way behind the curve.
good,location was close to the house. Flexible working hours. Enjoyable team atmosphere.
good,I was one of hundreds of employees recently laid off due to budget constraints.
good,"A prime contractor in aerospace systems and national security solutions, as well as a leading provider of a broad range of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms."
good,Missed the most is the friends  learned not to climb the ladder too fast or you will be pushed off sooner than later
good,"Not a proponent to changes. "
good,This job is demanding and it is either a job you enjoy or don't. I enjoy it but Im looking for something more.

good,"If you like defense work, and don't mind the location, it can be a great place to work, especially for seasoned professionals and especially those with past military or defense experience."
good,Good company and good benefits. With a company this large you are mainly a number to them. Nothing personal but that is the fact.
good,"Great company with room to grow, great people, gained incredible amount of knowledge in telecommunications as well as an enjoyable environment."
good,"Learned a lot at this company.  Learned how to do things, and how NOT to do things.  Feel they lose sight of their customer, a lot."
good,"L-3 is a great place to work if you enjoy technology. I was able to learn about the US Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance system and participate in advancing our nations capabilities. The most difficult aspect of the business is attempt continuous improvement with the matrix departments that focus on process which focuses on routine rather than improvement. It's like fighting city hall. They claim they are for improving, but fiercely resist change. Also, the politics of a decreasing defense budget is bringing out the worst in peoples behavior, especial among the executive staff."
good,I corrected errors that came in via SOI files from Intrado and researched them for resolution. I learned new systems while there. Our management changed several times in the year I was there. My co-workers were all friendly and had been there for many years. The hardest part of the job was watching a fellow co-worker let go when the company downsized. The most enjoyable part was that the department that I was in was very laid back.
good,"Test, align and troubleshoot various electronics equipment. Complete paperwork."
good,All entries in ths section are as in previous section.  L-3 / Vertex was a very stressing environment due to the company changing ownership and different management.
good,"hanger is cold during winter"

good,"great place to work, management issues but for the most part, great environment."
good,Good company to work for. Exceptional customer service and employee benefits.
good,"My experiences at L3 Wescam were very good overall.  I had a very busy job and worked long hours to meet monthly deadlines.  The majority of my co-workers were awesome people.  However, one person was petty, jealous, and prevented me from gaining experience in certain aspects of my job. And made untrue allegations to Management about me.  Most of my Managers that I had were fair, approachable and honest.  As well as genuinely concerned with mentoring me and assisting me in acquiring new skills and giving me new opportunities.  However, one Manager was not interested in helping me pursue a different career path in any other department, and was influenced by misinformation given by one long term, dishonest employee.  I miss several of my co-workers, as I built close relationships with many of them throughout several departments in the company."
good,"Worked there for almost 25 years so the job security was good, I would recommend it."
good,"Contributions are recognized, team work is encouraged.Great facilities and people."
good,Had a good experience. Was a deployment and learned a lot. The company could have done better with employee support.
good,"Good place to start a career, learned the basics of business."
good,"Level 3 was a good company to work for.  The compensation and benefits were great along with the work/life balance and the people I worked with however, job security and advancement was very poor at the Rochester location since they chose not to have Rochester be one of their core locations, which then led to lay offs."
good,"Be ready to work long hours on any shift, no set work schedules. 90 percent travel to include international travel at last minute notice. Pros, you get to keep all travel benefits, ex: hotel, flight, and rental points and you get paid per diem for travel. Work can be in hazard constructions site in airports, hot, cold, dusty, and physical."
good,"A typical day at work includes work pass downs that require immediate attention to detail. "
good,manager was not very knowlageable and had to learn the job from the team but changed to his liking becaues he did not understand.
good,"Interfacing with different IPT members from different functional organizations."
good,"A good place to work if you take pride in the job you do, some areas are difficult to work in very limited space. They didn't take repair and maintenance into consideration when designing the facility. The people are nice and helpful and the facility is clean. Overall it's one of the better working environments."
good,"The first few years at this job were great but after several large programs failed, I began searching for more of a reward from my career.  That's what led me to develop my own engineering company."
good,"Great opportunity to support president of the healthcare division and to assist in building the healthcare business.  Busy environment implementing processes, protocols and learning the key players and helping put the pieces together as this business grows.  Very cutting edge products will be available soon that will transform healthcare.  Plenty of interaction with all levels of management and staff."

good,"The workforce as a whole was unprepared for the major changes that SAP implementation entails after ""Go-Live"" and a number of ""Best Practices"" have been ignored as well as repeating a number of mistakes that companies have made in the past when going ""Live."""
good,I didn't have any this  like about job. I enjoy what I did and the people I work for
good,"They have a good work-life balance (meaning you get to choose whether you want to live to work or work to live). 4-10 schedule or 9-80 available with lots of vacation to start and quick 401k vesting- 5% match. However their benefits are pretty expensive, no bonuses, small yearly raises, OK pay. Other engineers in the department are more than willing to mentor you. I love my department, but Corporate is forcing layoffs right now. The first round they treated people really badly, not giving any warning and escorting them off property without even letting them return to their desks to say goodbye or get any of their stuff. No way to treat professionals. For the current round they are giving warning and letting people go voluntarily if they want. Who knows in the future."
good,Typically busy with an emphasis on providing customer satisfaction.
good,"Pretty much what the summary said. I think the pay was great and the managers had a lot of fun and got a lot accomplished without coersion or headache, but you always had the threat of a layoff hanging over you. And that happened right after i left."
good,"Review/Revise System Security Plans draft Information Systems Guidelines /Policies. Prepare/Submit Base line Exception Requests for approval to install customer requested software on Information Systems. Review/report Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert compliance. Conduct active accounts database monitoring.to ensure only active accounts are being maintained and utilized properly."
good,"In my current role I learned a lot about Environmental, Health and Safety and the importance it plays in any corporation. I was also the assistant for our Real Estate group which gave me insight into corporation leases and working with the landlords."
good,"In short, I'm not getting proper value for my time (in other words they don't pay what they should be for the job content, and they know it).  They've eluded to job progression but it's hard to believe since I haven't been informed of what it takes to be promoted.  The listing for the job I applied for turned out to be a far cry from the job it led on to be.  I'm in a remote location and am not being compensated at all for the inconvenience.  "
good,"This is a very steady workplace, no layoffs or ""slow downs"". This company is slow and steady. No dramatic changes, moderate pay with small raises, but overall they care about their people."
good,Cant say much about this company since I was there for only a few months before the big layoff of 2010.
good,Overall I like my job and most of the people I work with. It remind me of the military atmosphere.
good,Good company in a down cycle. Good location in Alington. Why am i required to post a review on a former employer?
good,"Design, fabricate and test multi channel A/D modules for telemetry system."
good,Migrate accounts and provision new customers. Creating and deleting accounts is where most of my duties came from.
good,"• Manage and oversee the new concepts, ideas, branding, and developing of internal and external web pages and portal on classified networks with minimal supervision."
good,"Started out as Northrup Grumman then, our division was bought out by L-3 which is a financial company. That's when slowly but surely the benefits were tapered down. The people were nice along with the on site managers."
good,-Linkabit Division:
good,"Harris IT Services is a IT Contract company that places employees into a situation as a sub-contractor to a prime. Upward mobility is impossible unless you are able to fined it on your own. Training is unavailable, raises are low. Trypical psotiions are filled with low wage unexperiance people. Management is hands off."
good,"As a software configuration management lead, I welcomed challenges, and challenges I got! I did, however, run into the problem of role ambiguity and scope creep that ultimately led to my demise. A lot of this was my fault simply by not asking questions every week to make sure my own work goals were on track with those of the PM and my functional manager"
good,Learned alot from fellow co-workers. Company could have provided more special tools.
good,"it's a decent place to work, there are many chances to learn and grow, lots of change"
good,"Amazing working 500 feets underground and learned lot theory in RF signal propogation, management is nice attitude adding with professional co-workers. The hardest job was going under ground with dust and mush cover up body and I really enjoyed."
good,It has good benefit but there is no job security. The job is very easy. The hardest part of the job is deployment.
good,"I worked three jobs at the same time due to losing employees,I was the programer of our program BCS3 as well as the recivier of our products and I shipped them. I was in charge of keeping inventory of my wearhouse and maintaing all the"
good,"maintenance repair...such as light electrical, light HVAC, plumbing, locks, dry wall, painting, shipping & receivinG"
good,Enjoyed the job...would like to still be there. This industry is moving so fast that even Management has hard time to keep up. Enjoyed the training and the experience I received that I can take with me the rest of my working career.
good,",Extres"
good,"I set up work sites for welders which included setting up tools, performed safety checks for tools. Responsibilities included mounting panel boards, transformers and conduits onto walls, overheads and into flooring. I learned to adapt to the challenges associated with being in a different country, ranging from language barriers to navigating through an unfamiliar area. Management encouraged us to take advantage of all training available. I have always been able to work with all types of people from all types of backgrounds and ethnic origin. We all gain knowledge from our differences. The most difficult part of the job sometimes was being in a foreign country and the language spoke was not English. I enjoyed traveling to other places for work. I enjoyed meeting the challenges associated when working in different environments and a completely different country."
good,This was a good company to work for. It is one of the larger DoD contract companies. So its like a large chain retail store type of enviroment.
good,"Typical day 8 hours. You can work overtime while I was there work was plentiful on Submarine contract. Good place to learn and perfect trade or learn new one after being displaced. I learned fiber optics there very interesting craft. Opportunities to do once in a lifteime jobs. While I was there they ""removed"" a reactor core NOT my job or even related but saw interesting stuff. I saw the ""nose cone"" or most forward cone shaped piece being reinstalled on the sub, atop the sonar dome took two very large capacity gantry cranes"
good,People very friendly. Busy department. Contracted to assist with accounts payable processing. Worked independently.
good,Good news: it's pretty hard (as an engineer) to get fired from Harris.
good,Working at Harris is very similiar to working at most other DC contractor companies. It all varies on which contract you're on how your experience with Harris is. For the most part Harris is slighty more progressive then other companies (allows yout to work from home. 980 schedule meaning you get every other Friday off) but if you have a tough client expect to be asked to work late and on almost every weekend.
good,Getting things done on time
good,Worked with the company on a Federal Government contract. Company was terrible at communicating effectively with both the Government and the employees. Was likely what led to their loss of the contract as the prime contractor.
good,"As a systems engineer, there is no typical day. The group handles many aspects, including assisting sales with customer visits, presenting in front of customers, designing the systems in response to RFPs, describing the features the systems offer, providing pricing, creating demo systems, working through negotiations with customers, finalizing the conceptual design, ordering all of the necessary components, staging the system, implementing the system in the field, passing acceptance tests, and ensuring the systems meet customer expectations."
good,"In the past this was a great place to work, however following the acquit ion of other companies that has changed. Many projects have been moved to other facilities resulting in a RIF."
good,Mission focused not necessarily concerned about the people that do the job.
good,• Armed security guard patrol of aircraft and personal protection. Entry guard of various compounds. Maintenance of weapons.
good,Presently it is a tense environment due to contracts closing and people being laid off. Overall each division is different. The Logistics environment is family oriented and a tight nit group. The admin division does not feel the same.
good,"Responsibilities include the installation, testing and troubleshooting of new and existing services; performing and managing all infrastructure projects; managing and maintaining a large number of company owned facilities and critical infrastructure assets; shipping and receiving functions; office management functions; customer relations at customer locations and maintaining data integrity across multiple company databases throughout the Level 3 Communications network in the Raleigh-Durham market."
good,Challenging work and good co-workers
good,They could have treated the people that has worked for them along time better than they did.
good,"L-3 probably has some of the best health insurance and benefits around, unfortunately the stress you can be put under requires those benefits. Pay is generally above average but it can be hard to advance unless you're friends with the right people."
good,"The company has survived many ownerships over the past 20 years, however the focus is always the same. Get the best product to the men and women in the field and make them safe."
good,"Not at this time. Maybe later. Truly not a good time. Great company that is changing a lot for a lot of people. "
good,"The hours are great and having every other Friday off is excellent.  However, the direction is aimless and management gives little to no direction.  Accountability, career development and daily support is non-existent.  Everyone in management is too focused on their own self-promotion to actually support their teams.  Multiple levels of management that serve little, to no value.  Raises are very weak and much lower than industry average.  Tenure is strong, however, as even the weakest performers can stay there indefinitely.  Bean-counting culture is strong with this one."
good,It's a good place to work. It is fairly stressful. Every year or two there is a rift. They are really good about scheduling. As long as you get your 40 hours.
good,"Given the option to work 4 days 10 hours along with flex time has allowed me the opportunity to be able to take care of my personal and professional life. Also, unlimited vacation days has been super worth it."
good,It was a well paid job. But we had faulty equipment to use. No ac and not big enough buses to the students to their apartments all at once. The management at the time had favorite drivers and gave them special favors
good,"Engineering at L3 Technologies is focused on technology that will benefit the war fighter. Historically they have focused on communications equipment, but are now branching into adjacent markets."
good,The workplace culture is team driven. The most enjoyable part of the job is brain storming with other team member for the purpose of enhancing project
good,"Great place to work. I really enjoyed my time there but things changed. "
good,I loved my time at L-3 till I made management.  I then seen how the other half worked.  It's all about taking care of your buddies and seeing how much they themselves could get away with.  Management isn't for me unless I was given the power to fix the real problem  . The problems of the few hurt the people who actually made the company money.  Not somebodies nephew or somebodies buddy they hand molding to do there bidding.  Such as I have heard since I left is still going on.
good,"It was a contract position,I worked on the flex line. It was repetitive We would run the line and place parts on the flex cables with a coder iron, and have to make sure they were compliant with the work order"
good,"I didn't necessarily not enjoy my time here, but that was because of the specific people I worked with. Management seemed uninterested in the employee's futures at times, and sacrificed the employees' needs when it came to delivering on projects."
good,When new management took over stress became the new morm not concerned with employees thoughts. At one time employees thoughts were encouraged but not any more its do as I say.
good,"Harris Corporation is a good Company. It has good job work/Life Balance. Some big efforts needs to be done in the area of Compensation though. Benefits are OK. Health insurance is expensive due to global increase in Health insurance overall. They have 9/80 schedule, which is really good. People like it. They also have good Job security Plan."
good,"Having worked in the Facilities department for 13 + years we were told production  was moving to Grand Rapids, MI and the V.P's ect were moving north of the Skyway bridge and that the Facilities department was going to be outsourced. We were expected to empty out the old building and then set up the new V.P's building then we would be let go. The stress level has gone up ten fold and I for one am not going to hope I find a job while living off a severance package. So I  have begun the search now and wish them the best of luck going forward."
good,"People are hardworking in this company;"
good,I enjoy the team that I work with. I have a had very nice career with Harris. Harris is a very complex company that has a large impact on first response communication world. There technology and efforts to help those to respond to emergency situations has become imperative in today's ever changing world. I take great pride in working for Harris corporation.
good,The job is great. The employees are great. I do believe management needs improvement.  It seens to be a focus on sales more than anything and less about the efficiency of work in achieving sales.
good,"-Job had long hours that rotated a lot between nights and days"
good,"Shop is somewhat un-organized and poorly laid out. Work assignments were developed as the day went on. Employees pretty much kept to themselves, not easy getting answers regarding details on work assignments."
good,"Each department was very cooperative with each other, yet poor management resulted in multiple issues such as low moral, high stress, poor workload distribution, and incorrect monetary compensation."
good,"Not bad, benefits getting scarce. Health insurance too high. Work life balance depends on what contract is being pursued. Some days work is slow, the next week you will be expected to max overtime caps."
good,It wasn't the best structured place when I worked there. Lots of scatter brains.  I did enjoy my time there however and would recommend it since it's a good company.
good,"Company was down sizing for lack of business, Waco is a good area with low cost of living. benefits were the best in the business. Heavy hours. Head of State aircraft to Military Aircraft of all sizes."
good,"Poor planning results in constant hustle to meet constant contract deadlines. Overnight shipping is a daily norm, costing the company excess amounts. Started as a small company and merged with large corporation. There is still the small job shop mentality to how things are done."
good,"Working at L-3 was just like most government contractors, heavy work when the contracts came in and low morale and waste when they didn't. Mid-management needs to go, all they do is jump down the throat of first line management and lie to senior leadership causing the place to eventually implode. One key element that would greatly improve production would be an outsourcing manager that will take charge and find the suppliers that can produce parts and supplies on schedule and without certification issues. A lot of great production companies in Dallas were not even considered. Enough of the problems. The work force they had was some of the most talented in the industry and great people to work with. The benefits and pay were top notch and for the most part it was enjoyable going to work."
good,"The pay and benefits are great.  The culture is stuffy and mundane. Engineers are gods, everyone else is disposable. Engineers are the most important asset to the company."
good,"Harris was a gret place to work. high-tech but the negative was that they rely on defence contracts which takes away job security. I worked with the FL state police and the US Marshals as customers for over a year there. It was interesting, inspiring and very pleasant. I travelled to Tallahassee, FL to meet with my customers on multiple occasions for Harris."
good,"Used to be a very good company to work for. Currently things are difficult due to lack of work. Hopefully, they will win some bids soon to be able to rehire the people that were let go recently."
good,Most of the time it was slow paced but there were times when we had a heavy work load but it made it easy when people were easy going and fun to be around. Some of the jobs were merely impossible with the time given but they were done at the best of our ability.
good,Work reports and call on suppliers to expedite parts to meet production schedules.Check inventory levels and receive parts into stock. Work with the receiving department to fix errors with supplier paperwork so they can receive parts to stock.
good,"I enjoyed the people and the pay/benefits were great.  Working 10 hr days gave us every other Friday off.  The downsides were the numerous meetings that occurred throughout the day, every day.  It left little time to actually work.  Management are engineers that delve into every detail, no matter how big or small or whether or not it was important.  They question EVERYTHING.  It is annoying.  Since they are not trained to be a manager, they are clueless and demanding.  They do not understand, nor care about your job.  They expect you to do your job and occasionally do other's jobs as well."
good,"Work itself is good and the pay is very well for the jobs you do here, but some of the management team have no organization at all and if your good at your job they will do what it take to keep you there and not let you have any opportunities for advancement."
good,"Challenging Place to Work - Good for building experience and skillset. Sink or Swim culture - minimal training, need to be go getter and eager to learn on your own."
good,Do not want to sway any potential employees.  I've only been here for a short amount of time and the position I'm in is nice.  People are nice.  But I do not have enough info to write a full review.
good,"You will have the ability to work on the full product cycle of a design from concept to manufacture."
good,L3 has been a stable company to work for. They usually have a slow pace of work due to being a defense contractor. I was able to survive multiple recessions in that company. I left because the opportunities to develop in my career seemed to be up to chance and I was missing those chances. Your direct manager had little say over what opportunities you could take. It all depended on what projects were starting when your current project ended.
good,Management gives very little regaurd for what workers think about work. Input or suggestions are not taken into consideration when making decisions. They are smart and you can just work.
good,"A good place to work, has a good work life balance, a good amount of days off. for the most part a pretty calm relaxed place. Can get pretty busy at times"
good,I worked at a site other than the headquarters.  Supervisor was great but pay and benefits we below standard.  The organization offers unlimited vacation.  The interview process was online and it was very intense.
good,The company needs to pay according in order to retain employees. Benefits are good 401k/dental. Managers need to be more receptive of employees needs.
good,Onsite...same manager/management we had with Titan before L-3 bought Titan.  Onsite managers were great...corporate seem ambivalent...didn't seem to care about contractor support services side of the Titan company they purchased.
good,"Worked on a network with multiple switches and endpoints."
good,My comments are rather unwelcomed. My unwillingness to comment is based on how tired I am of re-experiencing the events. I say work there at your own risk.
good,"repair air conditioning systems, repair other pieces of machinery as required. no job security for employees from year to year. friendly work environment."
good,"Great place to work. But only hiring temporarily for a couple of months is the downfall. Took months to go through the required background check, only to be let go in two months due to getting things done ahead of schedule."
good,Attempting to grow.  Hiring young engineers.  Had the opportunity to work in a new business area but had no real discriminators to drive success.  Centrally managed.
good,Learned government work which involved secret clearance to complete tasks.  Worked with 6+ different CAD packages to fix drawing for document control.
good,Opportunities to learn and grow within the company.  Exposure to many different types of programs with a wide variety of experience.
good,"L-3 has been a great place to work for many years,  Co-workers are amazing and have shared invaluable knowledge."
good,"Harris had potential to be a great company to work for but always seemed to be tripping over its own feet when planning work routines. They offered comparable pay for the area and a 9/80 work schedule which is great, when you weren't slammed with overtime demands as was typical during my time there. Generally if you were a good routine worker and frequently put in some OT hours they made certain to actually help keep you busy and help advance your position."
good,"Overall, it is a nice place to be but they are still trying to get things together.  But the benefits are great and the pay is also pretty good."
good,"There are better companies - and L3 is having $ problems with the division"
good,"Good work environment, good people, the satisfaction of seeing what was once a pile of parts and an empty shell take to the skies once again"
good,A difficult enviroment to work in.  Not very good pay scale advancement at all.  The 'customer' takes advantage of your work ability and does not display a fair work place.  Rules and regulations are not followed and employees that are not government are treated unfairly.
good,"Good hours, heads up when overtime was needed. Good benefits. Aerospace company with government contracts. Overall good working relations with other co-workers and most management."
good,"Although I had Engaging Program Management Officers, there was still the issue of not receiving an annual increase with the company. This was a bit discouraging."
good,"Had four presidents. Last one was extreme. Was demoted from a sister division. Sent to our division, ran it into the ground...morale was bad....turned a happy place into a fearful/dreadful place."
good,"As a two time employee of L-3, the second time around was definitely better than the first time. The management was a lot better, and more communuicative with employees, fostering a better understanding, and cohesive environment."
good,loved the work it was very rewarding and challenging but i was deployed and came back to find that the company was no longer there and had no job
good,"The previous company was strong while it was a small business.  Once it was acquired by L-3, fewer opportunities were available.  As part of a larger company, it was proven time and time again, that the employee was not as important as the company's bottom line."
good,"I am system support for Supply Chain and Operations, in which I work with end users and developers to identify, resolve, and implement system improvements.  I work with end users to answer their questions, understand their concerns, and resolve system related issues.  I participate in long term system development/enhancement projects to improve operational efficiencies.  I execute change management and train end users on system enhancements."
good,"As of January 1, 2015 L-3 has decided not to provide any severance for those employees that are about to be laid off on VAFB. Only for employees and not the higher ups mind you. What a big pile of dog poo. Many people have come from around the country to work here, most using their own money to do so, to provide excellent service on this contract. They let us know that they could care less about that, they are looking at their bottom line and don't care about those of us who came here, worked tirelessly, some of us over a decade here. We the workers got a 100% award fee for OUR WORK, OUR PROFESSIONALISM this past year, employees will see maybe $250 increase for that... and no severance to say - Job well done guys/gals! I thought L-3 was different, they always acted like we were a family, guess not"
good,Pretty good experience working there.  Co-workers were great.  Training was availability.
good,"Good benefits that covered the family well."
good,"L-3 Crestview Aerospace is a productive and fun place to work.  There is a strong sense of pride in the work  force and the employees treat each other like family, pulling together to support areas and personnel in need."
good,"There is set time for every employee to show up, and leave work. Unless you turn in special schedule form. If you desire to work overtime, there is a form to fill out and get approval from the supervisor a level beyond the immediate leader. There are people who go around and audit your time card which is all digital. If there is a timecard correction you are required to get manager's signature about the explanation. Rumors of layoffs can get annoying however,  the cafeteria down the hall is nice, and you can even take an ice cream break with your work buddies once in awhile."
good,Need more work on developing a career development program for employees who wish to grow and advance
good,"A typical day would start at 6:00 am, and would end at 3:00 pm."
good,"I worked at Harris Corporation Advertising Solutions Group for over 10 years. I loved the work because each day was different. My co-workers were very talented and hard working. The bad part is there is no room for advancement at all, no matter how good you are at what you do. The best part of the job is working with clients to make them happy and using my previous experience to excel in the job. There is overtime for those who care enough but there were some hard workers and some that did not put in the same effort and dedication. Reviews also do not reflect extra effort, which is not good."
good,Harris is a good place to work and has very good job security.
good,Loved working with all the people that I got to. Learned a lot about computer systems.
good,"Days go by fast, I learned a lot. Management is not the best. Like most of co-workers. Hardest part of my job is adjusting to working with less people. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing my job and getting recognized for it."
good,"L3 Communications has a welcoming working environment.  Workers are friendly and willing to show you the ropes.  Floor supervisors have excellent management skills and keep everyone on schedule without being overbearing.  Above this level however many problems and lack of communication hamstring many processes."
good,"Good job, requires a lot of technical background. Co-workers are very helpful. Gossip and Politics. I liked my time there."
good,"Came in to work, saw what was my assignment(s) were for the day. checked out tools as needed, went to the line and completed task as ordered. Prepare aircraft for launch or recovery."
good,"I really like my direct manager, but overall the company keeps you on your toes, and not in a good way. Large lay offs, and constantly changing dynamics within the company are often difficult to ""survive""."
good,"Fun place to work, the people are great.  Would have like to see a more process oriented organization."
good,"The most enjoyable aspect of the position was the chance to learn, in great detail, many subsystems of the overall launch capability at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station."
good,"L-3 CSW is typical of most large defense contractors in terms of systems, culture and processes. There is a heavy reliance on how things have been done in the past, partially due to government regulation and partially due to corporate culture."
good,"As a member of the Quality Engineering (QE) team, primary responsibility to support software product development teams in accordance to company policy and program plans."
good,"Tell us about:"
good,"Upgraded an enterprise environment from Windows Server 2003 to Server 2008 for the US Department of Defense, virtualizing 83% of environment using VMware version 4.1.; achieved 34% in operational savings"
good,"the ability to flex your weekly hours is a huge bonus, however the lack of sick time seperate from vacationtime is a big negative. management is very supportive and allows employees the ability to develope programs without being micromanaged. "
good,"Immediate management was exceptional; hardworking, supportive co-workers"
good,Provide linguistic and cultural support to U.S. Military in the battlefield.
good,"Comfortable environment among very smart people. Easy going and informal. If you're looking for a small company without lots of pressure this division of L-3 suits to a tee. Coworkers are mostly engineers. As at many companies, communication can be improved."
good,"The majority of the workers are from local (east Texas) and lack the competency and skill to work on military aircraft. As a prior vet, I would not continue to work for this company which produced poor quality work knowing someones life depended on it."
good,Things I've learned working at L-3
good,"L3 Academy is a brand new charter school that opened its doors in Fall 2012. I am learning several State/Federal reporting systems in order to secure academy funding and compliance. I have designed the office's management system from scratch. Interaction with students, staff and parents/gaurdians is a plus. The school is spear-headed by well-reputed community leaders and it is a great opportunity to learn from experts. My colleagues, many of them first year teachers, are well-rounded, persevering individuals. The hardest part of my job are the mounting priorities to ensure compliance and the continuance of the academy. The most enjoyable part of my job is my relationship to students and faculty."
good,Typical day filled with multiple responsibilities with cross functional personnel that rely on me to be efficient and effective.
good,The pay was very good due the the hazard and per diem benefits. We had many great technicians on staff and we worked around the clock in support of the U.S. Army helicopters in Afghanistan.
good,Demanding time schedules in a outdated building brought low morale. No job security remains. Management provided little communication to the support personnal. The co-workers cared about others which lead to my best part of working there.
good,"I felt like a robot on an assembly line. I was trained to specialize in a specific task, and hardly had the opportunity to explore different tasks."
good,"A typical day at work consists of 14 system area walk-throughs, audit log reviews, and ad-hoc system user consultations. I learned to effectively communicate with end-users and program management. My coworkers provide an active collaboration forum that inspires learning. The most challenging part of my job would entail having to produce program processing solutions for new systems under short time constraints. The most enjoyable part of my job entails the 9-80 work schedule, which allows for every Friday off."
good,First job out of college. Lot's of policies and procedures. I think this is typical of a DOD.
good,"Work hard, and work within the rules. This company does not lay off employees in down times; it fires them."
good,"This location is very productive and staffed by intelligent people, they are very driven on delivering a product to their customers but can sometimes make questionable decisions."
good,The company is great to work for the only thing is is that they have a lot of layoffs. It was a very family-friendly atmosphere that if you can make it through the layoffs your set their the benefits were excellent.8
good,Growth of electrical engineer is not very deep. As an electrical engineer you will be drafting or checking drawing pretty much the whole time. Salary and benefits are not very standard like other companies. Location is another downside of L3.
good,"I was able to gain a great deal of experience in leadership, both technically and functionally.  The teams are very close knit, but are limited in their openness to change.  This is a growing company with many growing pains to overcome before it will be able to compete with the other major primes.  Operates its businesses as multiple independent entities, not sharing technical information, having restrictive policies, not understanding DoD Contracting Principles (DAG), and consistently being deficient on contract requirements, but is not reprimanded by its customers because they are unaware, or indifferent to the indiscretions."
good,Serving our US Military and Aviation Industry is the best part of the job. Harris has some of the brightest people in the business.  Company is very focused on just  few customers and this may create a risk to sustained growth if US Govt.   ever limits Harris L3 ability to sell products to Foreign  Military  / Governments.
good,"Meetings and reviews of documentations.  Assignment for day due to changing priorities.  Good people, but after a while they became crusty cut-throat or paranoid cover my lower torsoe type of people.  Products generally were good, but they struggled getting out of the prototype phase due to government funding of 1st article and going into manufacturing."
good,Worked their for several years.  It is a good place to grow and develop your career.  I think the selling point is some of the top quality people that I worked with.
good,Pay is good but management needs better collaboration. There is a lack of communication and a lot of redundant task that could be handled with the use of technology.
good,"Poor management, but Job security pay kind like low, benefits overall was good, good secondary job but not main income for living, overall you need find another job to security income for living around main city like nyc, boston, CA"
good,"I had to inspect safety equipment plus emer. generator, exhaust fans, air compressor, and fire extinguishers. These inspections were done daily, weekly, and monthly."
good,"Great culture (Exelis- ITT).  After acquired by HARRIS, program started to deteriorate, increased G&A led us to be non-competitive. Too many layers of approvals causing difficulty to respond to emergent requirements on time and effectively."
good,-Most enjoyable is knowing I'm serving my country as a civilian contractor
good,It was a union shop. Work environment became more stressful as lack of work increased and work hours decreased (32 hrs week).  Benefit package was good.
good,Work environment is fairly laid back with good work/life balance. Not much challenging assignments for new grads. Management could be better. Location is convenient for most Southern California communities.
good,I had a good boss (perhaps the exception based on everywhere else I have been). That made all the difference in the world! So they could have overwhelmed us with work and it would not have mattered.
good,"L3 did a nice job of providing extras to employees, like on-site family days and offsite employee appreciation days.  It's easy to be motivated when working aircraft for our military."
good,Good pay and benefits available.  I worked on government contract work so there is no guarantee to future employment. I would reccommend this job but just be aware of the possibility of change in contract.
good,L3 is a decent place to work.  There has been a significant change in management which has caused a lot of difficulties.  The difficulties include a lean environment where 1 person is expected to do the work of 5.  Unfortunately not all colleagues put in the same effort and it puts more stress on the hard working few.
good,Fast pace type work on the Navy base helicopter sheet metal mechanic lots work different work condition when rain was difficult and get wet and very cold or very hot
good,"Great products, lack proper sales support for products and processes. Somewhat difficult to navigate internal processes and deliver on time products and services."
good,"Harris was a good experience in terms of internship. At least for me, I got an idea of how the engineering industry runs in the USA. The most enjoyable part for me was how I was able to travel for showcases."
good,company benefits are worth putting up with management. management can have some unrealistic goals or push some people harder than others. good people to work with.
good,Typical day at work starts early but ends early.  Casual work environment and requires compliance to standards for working with electronic products and standards in place.  Made some life long friends and a pleasure to work with positive people.
good,"Great co-workers.  Large company, Fast paced.  On-site cafeteria.  Great benefits.  Many perks.A nice mixed culture.  Many long term employees as well as a mix of new hires."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but in order to test the software, you MUST know the equipment. This is not a web-base testing position."
good,"Enjoyable place to work, continuous process improvement and support for outside the box ideas.  Very supportive in change management to better the program."
good,Great company to work for if you are on the salary side. Advancement from hourly to salaried employee is rare. Overall this company pays well and has very competitive benefits. The work is always challenging and will keep you on your toes.
good,"Well, I fell into L-3 NSS when they won the contract from GDIT when it went up for re-bid.  I wasn't to thrilled with the way they handled the interviews, offered, transitions, pay, and other aspects.  Coworkers were nice, but most were from GDIT.  Just the way they conducted business at the corporate level was inferior to the way GDIT ran things.  Other than not, not a terrible company, i would consider working for them again."
good,L-3 offers a very good salary and benefits package and it is a good place to work. I like the 9/80 work week and how they treat their emplyees.
good,The company is outstanding and I have had the opportunity to meet some great people.  I enjoy working in the shipyard and learning the different jobs that will be needed at any shipyard job I obtain.  I worked hard and I learned a lot.  There was no job to hard because I was given the opportunity to learn everything that was needed to make my job easy.
good,"A typical day was keeping busy scanning parts, putting parts into work and keeping daily logs.  I learned various duties from working in several different shops.  I never really saw management out on the floor.  I worked with a lot of people.  We worked together and helped each other out even though we all worked in different shops.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to lift heavy parts.  The most enjoyable part of my job was keeping busy.  The busier the day, the faster it went by."
good,"A very straight forward place to work in, with a mix of cultures, and management. Somewhat stressful environment, because of working side by side with the customer. Pay is considerably good."
good,"Successfully led a BD team in exploiting strategic opportunities to gain market share from international competition.  "
good,Challenging and interesting working with the aircrafts. Great benefits and insurance for employees. Management encourages employees to continue to pursue promotion opportunities to advance in the company.
good,Management has been changing very frequently at this particular location so the stability of the overall operation is unknown.
good,The mid management is thegreat weakness of this company the Regionals( Managers and Supevisors)
good,"Days spent testing night vision optics for military applications. "
good,"Good work, good people, challenging times. Flex hours. Rhapsody. UML. Plenty of management. Co-workers are devoted to the job. Morale can be rough due to layoffs. Creativity encouraged, but schedule and budget are priority one."
good,Good company to work for but scheduling became too agressive.
good,"This is not a hard job at all, I ve learned a lot from being on this project.  I've been on this project for 6 years, I've seen management come and go.  It's a good place to work if you can get around the nagging, gossiping, and complaining."
good,"Working for L-3 was much like being back in the military minus the camaraderie. the intense divide between hourly workers and salary is always evident. however the pay compensation was good and the benefits were excellent. this was a good, strong company for employment."
good,"Overall good company, site rules vary depending on locations though"
good,"A typical day at work can vary depending on the job. I have learned many new techniques and how to use certain tools based on the job at hand. The management is very supportive, helpful, and always helping when necessary. The work environment is friendly and upbeat, but the hardest part is getting used to to being at work at 6 am. Every part of this job was enjoyable for me. I love being a mechanic."
good,I wish I could have the chance to learn more assembly processes.
good,"A company that has been in the Aircraft business for 60 years keeping our Air Force equipped with the latest in aircraft technology."
good,Wish the company had continuous employment after positions was eliminated from government services.
good,12 hour work day
good,Upon arrival you are hitting the ground running. Begin calling over 400 companies to collect the current month nation job count. You are constantly working in a production environment. Your are required to meet all metrics.
good,"Conduct contractor escort duties, when not busy with renovation projects"
good,Friendly environment
good,Straightforward no nonsense employer.Good experiences with everyone and with the supervisors.
good,"It's a typical job. Go to work on time, work a solid 8 hours a day and get paid. Decently drama free. My only complaint is that there is really no chance for advancement."
good,"Excellent high tech communications environment. This company has a very old culture, and difficult to break into some group."
good,Provides opportunities for professional development and advancement. Good management and culture.
good,"Working 8hrs. per day, learned some small technices, managment was not aware of all my expertises.Co workers was very good,the hardest thing onb the job was to see others not performing to their max.Helping the Solders on the ranges."
good,"a typical day was to get parts that you were going to make giving to you by your lead. I learned to be very patienct on most parts because they can't be finished in 5 minutes and the management was terrible because it is comprised of the buddy system, but I really enjoy my co-workers because of the great attitude and willingness to help when I didn't know how to do a part. The hardest part of my job was when I get a part that I have never done, neither have my co-workers and I would have to try and figure out how to make it flat and get the correct angle. I loved the working atmosphere because those younger guys always keep something going that was either funnny or just stupid and being able to take a vacation at the last minute if needed"
good,Typical day:
good,I enjoyed my work but my supervision staff was not open to the female's ideas.
good,"Informal working environment in a team setting. Management encouraged creative, simple solutions. Multi-tasking, results oriented and meeting deadlines a must. No micro-managing as long as your did your job."
good,"Where I worked, I had a very nice manager, and my team was actively recruiting youth and females (of which they had none). The company was attempting to reconnect with employees (many fun events had been stopped a few years before I came on). "
good,"We were offered program overviews by every manager in the branch, along with optional lunch and learns. There was a safety week where they had an ice cream truck and a chili contest."
good,I enjoyed my time with L-3. I had wanted it to be my last stop in employment but things came up with my Grandson that changed my direction and my priorities.
good,"the job pays decent, but the company sucks. they hire and fire in cycles. they will get rid of faithful employees who have been there for 15 years just so they wont have to pay out retirement to them. they tried to force employees to work 60 hours a week, work them into the ground so they have no personal time for family or friends or other obligations."
good,"Work included travel and no real ""typical"" day.  Some hold over from DoD regarding culture.  There was a very flexible schedule.  Products are generally strong."
good,"Harris is a good company with brilliant engineers.  "
good,Great place to start your career. Exceptional training programs available and plenty of opportunities for advancement. Multiple locations around the world.
good,"• A typical day includes monthly and ad hoc reporting preparation."
good,"Its a government contractor, can be good, can be painful."
good,"when I was first hired it was during rapid deployment, we worked alot of overtime and spirits were great among employees. We had 3 shifts so it was difficult to adjust to. Once we adjusted work was great."
good,"Lots of recon tech you get to work with. Somewhat flexible work schedule. Culture is very much big company, heavy on process slow to success. Mix of great people and not so great people."
good,"The company in general is nothing to complain about.  The work was always plentiful for the first year after their purchase of Crestview Aerospace, but after time the work started hemorrhaging and going elsewhere."
good,I think Harris is a good company for most part. There is a lot of interesting work at the company. Most days at work are challenging and allow freedom to manage your own pace. I have learned a lot from my time and I think the job is really what you make of it.
good,The goal is to create a clean and orderly environment for our guests that will become a critical factor in maintaining and strengthening our reputation.
good,"Overall, L3 is not a bad place to work.  The people are friendly, my boss was very professional and courteous to my needs.  The only issue I have with L3 is they do not have enough work for contractors."
good,"Pros.. Benefits, hours"
good,The company is in a really bad place right now and everyone is under a lot of stress. I have had a great time working here and have met a lot of great people.
good,"I had to privilege of leading a great team of task order business development specialists.  Even in that last half year that the sale was imminent, we still blew out our targets."
good,"The work and assignments were very good and located in at least 20 states and more that 40 T1 and T3 and some smaller circuits; great customer and clients, and also, a very job manager"
good,"You operate industrial washers, utilize steam pressure, degreaser solution, and required solvents to remove dirt, grease, corrosion and paint from a variety of aircraft, aircraft/ engine parts, assure nicks, burrs, and rust pits are removed. Determine proper sequence of cleaning processes and time exposure of parts required to avoid possible damage to parts and meet required degree of cleanliness and overall acceptability. Mix chemicals and cleaners in solutions and charges pressure pots."
good,"Manage employees."
good,Level 3 offers it's employee a great benefit package and provides you all the tools you need to do your job well.
good,"Great work environment, very intelligent valued team members."
good,The organization is a great place to work and allows for people to plan for work and life balance.
good,"Work was consistent and filled your day, therefore, time went by fast and a lot was accomplished."
good,"enjoyed working there due to the people that was working there, inspected circuit cards, learned other computer programs"
good,Had excellent benefits and pulled me into aspects of my job previously unexplored.
good,Been a perfect job for finishing my schooling.  Great benefits.  I question the overall direction of the company and it's priorities.  Overall: great for right now.
good,My experience with the company has been pleasant. Team work is important and co-workers are professional. Customer satisfaction is ranked highly. Long hours maybe endured as typical in the industry. 24/7
good,A typical day at work was pushing to get the product out by tight schedules. In the cleanroom it was a rush envirorment but also playfull. I did learn alot about what I could do and have learned a few things off the engieers about how each sytem worked. We have several managers each with there own ideal on what needed to be done and the hardest part of the job was trying to ensure the final product was up to date before it goes to QC. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challege of a new system and learning how it works.
good,The integration role allows for an overall understating of the product line. This position is challenging in the sense of understanding the product technically while still applying leadership skills to get work done.
good,"L-3 is a good company overall. While I was there the company had some challenges that required them to look at the company from the top down, and make adjustments. My personal experience with my management was not a good one, but given the task that they had to work through I believe their hands were tied in terms of what they could really do for me."
good,"The typical work day is busy and passes quickly.  There are not too many meetings and no unreasonable deadlines for projects."
good,"Interesting work environment. The work involved producing work instructions, troubleshooting various equipment, logging in remotely to other platforms to diagnose problems and recommend solutions."
good,"Always waiting for that next big program that never seems to come... Keep you busy doing clean up work, always wondering when layoffs are coming... The people are great and it could be a great place to work if they could get some steady work again.  Hopefully one day!!"
good,good company. competitive pay. human resource department is sub par. Overall I was happy with my time at L-3 communications. they just need to condense their human resource department in to one entity.
good,A good place to work to provide assistance to military personnel needs and services. The ability to advance was limited.
good,I enjoyed working for L-3 but I did not enjoy the location of the job which was Afghanistan.
good,"L-3 provided me with a better understanding of 2 and 3-way matching, and how to use the Deltek Time and Expense system. The work environment is pleasant and the personnel are friendly and supportive."
good,"enjoyed working with my co-workers, had plenty of work to do"
good,"The job it self was interesting, I enjoyed being a Electrician 1st class, Wiring the Hovercraft was a good learning process for me. I had co-workers who were willing to help me when I came across situations which two were needed for the job. Overall the people I worked with were pleasant to work with."
good,L3 is a good place to work. They were just to far away from my home for me to continue working there. They offer great benefits and compensation was ok.
good,"I enjoyed working for Harris for the time that I did, but I was unfortunately laid off due to a contract being cancelled on the government side. Therefore everyone who was working on that project was let go. This was also during the recession so I feel that contributed to it. I would still work there again if I got the chance, they are very good."
good,"This job is easy but the benefits aren't that great. I would recommend  this job for a college student,"
good,"Supported the USMC Branch chief in support of efficient office operations.  "
good,The work is interesting.  Managment is understanding and they take care of the employees. 
good,Long hours worked with many successful missions that allow the days to move quickly.
good,Great people. This is where it all started for me...I learned alot.
good,人性化管理，团队工作，上下班不打开，时间灵活，都靠自觉，几乎没有加班。研究分两个大组，一个是软件组，一个是嵌入式组，软件组基本上就是C++和C#，还有jQurey HTML5之类的。
good,If you are looking for a small town in which everyone works or knows someone that works at one of the campuses. Discounts at most every store in the area. Slow family atmosphere with nice weather majority of the year.
good,"great and exciting work environment, people are very professional as well as proficient ....."
good,"Management in my division PSPC was incompetent at the middle to upper levels. My coworkers worked very hard and were driven to succeed. Sadly, the mid to upper level weren’t. They claim to be ethical yet their management philosophy was anything but. Attempts to make change are not welcome. I miss working there but had to move on because my principals are more important to me than the money."
good,terrible miss-management with the Good Ole' Boy system alive and well.  Low pay raises unless in the 'system' and hush hush bonuses for those that are.  Personnel in supervisory and management positions that do not have experience.
good,"This is a decent company, they however do not promote based on merit.  It comes if you are friends with the upper management."
good,"While the people who I worked with were good people to work with, the management, as well as compensation and career advancement opportunities made the overall environment an extremely stressful one. As well, the fact that it was a contract job, with the fact that L3 had underbid the contract made it more stressful, wondering if the contract would be renewed the next year and if you would have a job if it was not."
good,"It’s a decent place. The people are great. "
good,"They could improve on management, the work is always there, decent pay, they are also union. They do not have lay-offs, however they do fire people for any reason."
good,This is a relatively good company with short-term contracts that keep the longevity of positions short.
good,get to work
good,"Over all a good place to work with room for growth."
good,Worked as a temp employee for 4 years. Never knew weather or not I would have a job the next day. Felt like I was just there to fix and repair issues from the past and back up to where it should be than let go.
good,Great company to work for great 401k benefits. decent work atmosphere with good a vacation benefits
good,The company is average. I would recommend this company to others however I do not see myself staying here for the long haul.
good,No overtime pay for work.  80+ hours per pay period is expected without overtime pay.  Lacks work life balance because of department being short staffed and some people working extra hours.
good,Harris is a good place to get exposure to a wide range of engineering principles. There is plenty to learn. Finding a mentor is critical to success at Harris.
good,"L-3 provides a wide range for growing knowledge with the aerospace and defense field.  I enjoyed my job and job duties while I was with L-3, but there is a huge lack of security with the job.  It is all contract driven and you just never know."
good,"The work environment was what you made it. You must be engaging in order to be productive. Often the office politics slowed change and or innovation."
good,Depending on contract placement and program manager you could have a great adventure or a bad experience.  I was blessed with a great adventure for several years.
good,Really enjoyed this period as it was a growth period for me and I learned many new devices and technologies.
good,"Typical work day equaled. Long hours.  No loyality to employees. "
good,I was only a temp. I found it difficult to connect with the full time employees. I would like to stay away from temporary employment in the future and really grow with a strong company here in Jackson Mississippi.
good,While L3 is a conglomeration the local division is run like a small family company.  Too many senior managers have their position due to longevity - not skills or experience.
good,"Being a unionized company, there is always work to be done. When contracts run thin, they have you push a broom so that you can make your 40 hours for the week. A surprising amount supervisors and managers either don't have a clue what is going on or they don't care. Sometimes that is a good thing but usually not."
good,"challenging and stressful but rewarding if you work hard, their way.  Workplace culture is ok, most people are nice but really don't interact beyond work.  The most stressful part is being in the dark about what needs to be done and how to pay for it."
good,"We were told since the summer of 2018, that the company was going through a merger with Harris Corporation.  The new company was to be named: L3-Harris Corporation."
good,"busy work days, learned shipping, receiving, stocking. management was fair at times. multi-culture workplace. not knowing the full details from management at times."
good,Company relocate from Rochester to Henrietta in the same city without any interruption movement was well planned by upper management without missing any shipments.
good,"Some of the best engineers in the country gathered there, so job information was readily available. Great place to work on contract. Job ended when 1 project was cancelled and two large projects were delayed."
good,"L-3 is a good company to work for.  Pay is below the national average. People are nice, management is ok and they do have true company/team building activities."
good,"I arrive for work 20 minutes early (5:40 am ), and get set up for the day ahead.  Management shows up about 5:55 to check if I'm there. My coworkers usually arrive in between me and management. The hardest part of the job is finding enough work for the day . The most enjoyable part of the day is when I've acquired enough work to keep busy all day."
good,I liked working for L3. I' ve worked many years as an in house guard. It's to bad they had to restructure and go with outsource guard force.
good,"L3 is a well rounded employer, but a very high rate of layoffs and a culture of unreasonable workloads versus employee growth and improvement."
good,"Since they are the only ones in the area, they write the pay scale. Most of the management is based on the Good Ole Boy system even though they say it's not there. The job itself is enjoyable, lots of up and downs for work though. If management doesnt like you, they will find a way to get rid of you. Good thing Maria in HR is gone though, she was the mother of them all, complain about a supervisor and all the supervisors would hear about it, and start gunnin for you, I have first hand experience for that, twice."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexible work schedule and the people.
good,Learned the good old bow system thrives here. The management is lacking.The workers were ok but some were intolerable
good,gd workplace was contract work to many pay cuts had to leave cause pay wasnt there ended up going to afghanistan
good,lots of politics-hire like crazy then lay off when times get hard instead of having the personnal they have take on more
good,"T&A, safety meetings, supervising aircraft maintenance and inspections."
good,Work is busy and always learning. I enjoy working in with different types of aircraft.
good,"Work was very busy from the time you walked in to the time you left.  I learned how to run the machines, as well as how to lead a group of people to achieve day to day goals.  The management team were personable, but demanded too much out of a minimal crew with machines that were breaking down everyday due to using them for shorter runs than what they were designed for.  Some of the co-workers were friendly, but others were there to just cause drama.  The hardest part of the job was when the machines would go down for an entire shift to be repaired and we would not make the daily requirements we needed to make and then have to run harder to make up for our loss.  The most enjoyable was that the work never stopped.  You were always busy and had little standing around time."
good,Link continually pushes forward in a fast paced and innovative environment.  Link's high standard for producing cost effective training solutions is second to none.  Producing state of the art simulators designed to train pilots and save lives is both morally rewarding as well as technologically challenging.
good,"Good overall company.  Lots of moving around to different sites, usually without very much notice and without financial help."
good,"Good company but non competitive pay with other contract companies. medium benefits, low pay for area and not enough accural of time off."
good,"Responding to emails, process return/re-buy P.O.'s on rejected material. Look at jobs to ensure all product would be in before required date. If there was a date that the product would not come in on time, contact the vendor to find out options, discuss with management and production floor manager if there was a way to build up to a certain point where the specific product was needed. The majority of the co-workers were very helpful and there if you needed input. The department was very well blended."
good,"This is a good place to start but moving around or up is not really an option. Especially with so much of the company's income coming from the ""economically challenged"" Federal Government."
good,Would love to work there again if given an opportunity. Management and HR doors always open and available if you need to speak to them with any issues or ideas.
good,"A top heavy organization with poor, isolated and politicized leadership. Good compensation package covers the short-comings. Some excellent engineers carrying lots of deadwood in the PMI office and upper management."
good,"Great small unit teams, however, mentoring and leadership is faulting in career advancement and training. Management expects employees to know what they haven't taught or shown processes. Seen too many people ""passing the buck"" and employees criticized for speaking up."
good,Employees worked together to complete  a task. Projects were monitored and milestones adjusted as necessary. Sufficient training as new technologies were adaped.
good,"It was a pleasant and productive environment that I enjoyed from the beginning and to the end of employment.  Lastly, working at Harris Corp was an excellent experience, especially learning about the ships and the technology that was offered to the ships' person"
good,"I've been employed here at Harris for almost 11 years. I learned to use a lot of tools here. Coworkers are friendly and easy to work with. Management is decent, you have some good bosses and some bad bosses. I enjoy the satisfaction of completing a daily or weekly quota and pushing out quality products for our costumers. The hardest part of my job is not the jobs itself but  the disappointments of not being promoted or recognized for my hard work."
good,"Good company with strong customer focus.  Smart management in corporate, even if the business units deal with excessive cost cutting pressure at times."
good,Hires kids and puts them in management positions too early and over employees working years and years in growing their careers there.  Older professionals who are dedicated to company are overlooked and underpaid
good,"Good pay and benefits, too many lay offs.  Some mid level management seemed unneeded and sometimes were not able to preform the jobs they supervised.  Good shifts"
good,Company is quick to promote your title but not so quick to promote you compensation wise. Good for starting out your career but compensation does not keep up with industry standards.
good,"For this was a great place to work. The pay was great, the coworkers made this job fun, and the wide range of work made it interesting.  The only downside was the management made little to no attempt to get worker input on how work was being handled. Major changes took place without any form of proper training or detailed information. It made it hard for a majority of the people to adjust properly to new changes. "
good,"L-3 has very good benefits,  But management is not great. Needs more effective leaders. Management and supervisors need more training with their employees,"
good,I feel like I'm not getting compensated for the work I do and can not move. I've had many years of experience and work with all new employees to bring them up to Harris Standards including Engineering and can not move forward without a Degree.
good,"Safety oriented company except when profits were more important.  "
good,I loved my job. It was sometimes difficult to function there because of the lack of communication. I did get the opportunity to work with and advance on a SAP System which rounded out my working knowledge.
good,"Working at a major defense contractor, such as L-3 Communications, affords the ability to move around Divisions/Business Units to become proficient in various operational and management processes for both Service and Product offerings."
good,"Although the days are long, there is plenty of work to keep you engaged.The ""Management"" isn't trained to deal with people, so you have to ""play the game"" with tolerance."
good,A typical government contractor where very few employees work at the main office. Most employees work on the Air Force base. Management is fair and responsive.
good,Worked at various jobs using various types of equipment giving experience in many areas.  Enjoyed the team work and the ever changing environment.
good,"L-3 communications is a great company to work for, but has some areas that need to be improved. "
good,"Fast paced non stop work environment. Can be fun at times, mostly stressful. Management changing, used to be family first, new management changing mentality towards business first, family next. Not happy lately."
good,advancement opportunities are very limited with little management interaction. the lack of opportunity to advance ones career made it difficult to remain motivated.
good,Need to work to get the equipment built right the first time to reduce travel to sites which has a direct effect on the work life balance.
good,"Always hurry up and wait. Management looks out for their own, high turnover rate. 4-10's was a plus. Not enough vacation hours."
good,"Different ever Day sometimes some mgight be on a job for 3to 6 weeks deoending on the size of the job.I learned All that I know from working at L-3 Comunnications. And on the job Training and just real good common Sense.They Didnt have a clue on how to treat a good employee all they was some body that would kiss thier a__ _ . Co- workers were Great some of the best people you could want to work with.Just Showing up and after having to get up at 4 oclock ever morning for 3 to 7 maybe  even 9 months. The reward of doing a great job and the confiendiece in your work, and looking back and seeing what you just accomplished."
good,loved the job until recently because of the constant negative management style that has taken over this division. too many mid-level people having an influence on field operations. People with no field experience or skill calling the shots and it causes them to mismanage the group
good,Great Experience.  Learned lots of new things and met some wonderful people.
good,"Company does not stay up with the times in investing in machinery and high Tech tooling, must grow to stay competitive in this Global market place"
good,"A focused, hard working but rewarding place to work.  Met and worked with some extremely high quality folks. Competeative salaries.  Most education focused place I have ever worked. In many departments the lack of a degree means you will never advance above a lower level.  Many groups are becoming very focused on willing and maintaining the favor of senior management."
good,"I have been working for this company for over 6 years and I bust my butt everyday looking and searching for the job I would like to be in, with my Criminal Justice Degree. I would like to stay around there Cincinnati/Florence where I am located at as well."
good,being a contract worker I was laid off from work so many times
good,Overall a nice place to work. A bit top heavy in some areas. Well educated and experienced co-workers. In my job I am usually very busy. Travel on short notice can be difficult. I enjoy the 4 day work week.
good,Great products and environment initially. Politics in upper management brought this division to it's knees and enabled many competitors.
good,Training was great and learned alot to use in the current position Im in now.
good,"get the work load completed and the job done asap  and then it was smooth sailing the rest of the shift ; all 24 hrs"
good,"Making sure all the test equipment is working."
good,"Enjoyed growth for the first year and a half, then company lost contracts from department of defense, for the manufacturing of night vision and infrared products. Company merged with Insight Corp from New Hampshire, 95% of local employees were laid off."
good,This company grew too fast and changed management around every 3 months.  
good,"Great work environment & great co-workers.  Great leaders and management. Most enjoyable part of the job was working in the field of IR/NV electronics.  Unfortunately it all went downhill when the ""rightsizing"" (lay-offs) began, can't tell you what it's like now since I was one of the unlucky ones.   "
good,Not a bad place to work but there is no way to advance in your field.
good,Every day was a different project. It was a great place to learn and actually get work done.
good,"Harris Corporation provides a stable work environment, but the work is often less than exciting. I feel secure in my position, but also feel trapped in that position. It is not easy to get ahead based solely on hard work, you must also be good at office politics and know the right people. It is difficult to move between divisions, but not impossible. You are more likely to be assigned to whatever the next position in the list is rather than the position three down the list that is a 100% fit for your background, training, and interests. Pay is average. There are no cost of living adjustments. Raises are minimal and usually less than the inflation rate for the previous year. It is easy to get lost in the organization and become just another brick in the wall, but in this economy stability is an attractive attribute."
good,I worked 7 days 12 hours a day.Upon arrival I was one of three females with about 35 males.I found out that I was doing the same job that was held by all men and that they were getting paid more an hour then what I was.Other then that it was a wonderful experience one that will last a life time working overseas in Iraq.
good,Interesting place to work. Learned a lot about rocket launches and safety issues. The hardest part of the job is waiting for documentation to come. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on documentation.
good,"I work on gyroscopic parts and various other parts of boing and seaking halecopter, landing light ,emergency light , pilot stick, grip stick ,shut off valve etc .I leard a lot here , management is good , co-workers are coperrative,the hardest part of the job,is time period,because parts are not available on time, the most enjoyable part of the job is vecation time."
good,"started as a contractor with possibility for full time. It appears that it is not meant to be, I wish I was able to become full time. "
good,"Get in clean, line my work up, proceed with what I have to do. I've learned a lot about assembling night vision products for the military. Management was wonderful. Work place nice and clean. Get every other Friday off."
good,"This is predominately a male field, at least at the location I was at.  The daily routine involved receiving shipped parts and preparing other parts to be shipped out.  Inventory was kept track of on a daily basis using a log to remove stock from the system.  Also we had to keep track of which aircraft was in for maintenance and which were out of duty for a longer periods of time and how long that time frame."
good,I've worked for L3 for over 30 years and have progressed throughout my career.  I started as Fabrication Assistant and am now a General supervisor of production.
good,Difficult but challenging evironment includes daily problem solving and working in a near prototype environment.  You're on your feet and working with customers from all fucntions.
good,"Great company to work for.  However, they need to be more competitive in the compensation area. This will go a long way with their employee retention."
good,"If you are looking to advance your career, then this is the perfect place to start. They offered a generous tuition reimbursement program and definitely invested in the growth and development of their employees."
good,"Good technology company, defense contractor, and information technology services provider, that produces C6ISR systems and products, wireless equipment, tactical radios, avionics and electronic systems, night vision equipment and both terrestrial and spaceborne antennas for use in the government, defense and commercial sectors."
good,"Good technology company, defense contractor, and information technology services provider, that produces C6ISR systems and products, wireless equipment, tactical radios, avionics and electronic systems, night vision equipment and both terrestrial and spaceborne antennas for use in the government, defense and commercial sectors."
good,L3 is about average for a defense company. Management is about average. My experience with L3 is they buy and sell smaller companies as they fit their goals
good,"Good place to work.  Know your qualifications as a mechanic.  Do your job, mind your business, be respectful, and you will be successful.  Management relies  heavily on mechanic s experience."
good,"Under-resourced"
good,"Other than few persons on managment that need a little more training on how to be fair on desicions, company is good place to work. I enjoy my time while I was there."
good,"Was in a new division at Harris that didn't make it.  They decided to enter a new market area and eventually determined that they weren't going to be very good at it so they cancelled the whole thing.  I was laid off right before the end, which turned out good for me at the time."
good,"I have been with L3 Torrance for 10 years and it has been an outstanding experience until of late.  With the facility merger with the San Carlos facility and now the global merger and renaming to L3-Harris the facility has become toxic. There has been major layoffs. To maintain production most employees are working 10-12 hour days seven days a week.  Only the hourlies get paid overtime.  For the salaried folks overtime is for free.  If you are looking for hourly work then you will like L3 Torrance because with all of the overtime you will make more money than your Manager.  If you are salaried then get ready for long hours, little pay, unrealistic expectations in an environment where your job is constantly in question."
good,Harris gives you the flexibility to move around the company as you see fit. The growth they’re experiencing is bringing opportunities like no others. Benefits are great
good,This company no longer exists. It was a great company to work for. I was promoted numerous times in the almost 14 years that I was employed by them. I miss the people.
good,"Responsible for the repair and maintenance to military vehicles. Order of supplies, parts and equipment.  Also responsible that equipment is functional at the end of repairs."
good,"loved the quality department and everyone is family. The HR department is not involved with the things that need looked into. Too many relatives in management. Different departments but still related. Loved them all though. Ethic officer is a direct manager also, can not go to them for issues."
good,"A lot of work but doable if you are organized. The customer on this project was excellent to work with."
good,Great company to work at. Advancement opportunities available.  Can apply within for new job opportunities.  Medical/dental/401K benefits available.  Great company to work for;
good,Good place to work and go to school. Great for part time or full time. Possibilities for advancedment. Helpful management to push you in the right direction.
good,My direct supervisor and on site coworkers were pleasant and respectful to work with.    They providing accurate information to assist in my job task.
good,Again this is hard to define. The company is huge and one area of work does not spill over to what an work environment would be like elsewhere. In my corner I worked around a lot of former military. My being outside and no military background seemed to make me an outsider. I was with them for 5yrs though and at the beginning had great boss and leaders. Change of the guard happened and it turned into office politics. I was glad to get out when the timing was right. I did appreciate the work experience that promoted me on to other things.
good,"Provide Logistical support services to US Armed services."
good,This company does not care about family time. The salary was mediocre for the job market and should've been larger. They did not promote unless the position was available
good,Very challenging technical company with performance based rewards. Opportunities for travel and challenging projects offered for those ready to take them on.
good,New CEO is making lots of changes to transform the business for growth.  Lots of hard working employees who care about the business. The team worked together to meet critical customer deliverables.
good,"I had a great time working there. Always busy and always content. Good people, good pay. Wish my contract could have been made full time. Would do it all over again."
good,"Good starting point for familiarization with large scale government contracts. Downside is that projects can become stagnant, with limited opportunities for internal movement."
good,setting challenging personal time line goals and schedules for the boss often become stressful. The self induced deadlines cause problems for the worker himself. Delays outside of the workers control occur often and work quality is jeopardized.
good,It was a humbling experience to work at L-3 Communications and in the military industry.  It is a great place to work and would definitely work there again!
good,"Good company with pockets of excellent technical opportunities. The site I was at was in support of a large DOD contract, so the culture was driven by that contract and not by Harris."
good,Good place to work. Happy people. Good pay. Good benefits. Would recommend working here to anyone with the needed skill set. Clean and secure workplace.
good,"Harris Corporation is one of the few places I enjoyed working for.  Environment is professional, quiet.  I have been a floater between a 4 or 5 groups to help out and everyone is really nice and helpful.  There is no competition or negative remarks towards anyone whether they are a level 1 or level 5.  Everyone is treated with respect."
good,"I was repairing night vision devices for the army units that were returning from Iraq, as part the reset initiative.  It was a good place to work for."
good,"I worked at L-3 for a long time and if it wasn't for the change in managers I would still be there. My job was to help the top level executives with their computers and be ready at a moments notice. All of the executives were easy to work with and understanding when it came to issues with their computers. "
good,"My coworkers remain close friends of mine to this date and were the best part of this job. HOwever, the job itself was not challenging and left copious free time"
good,"Interesting job, lots of opportunities for growth. Management sees your efforts and rewards you accordingly. Job location is at NIH campus in Bethesda."
good,"Worked as the service desk for the FAA"
good,"Harris is a great company to work in. It has great benefits.  It also has unlimited time off. Like any other company, your experience can be what you make it."
good,"L3 is a great place to start for working, but I was never able to fully connect to the company as a contractor. I wanted career growth, but have been able to go anywhere for a year. This is due to the fact of them not offering me a full-time position, and going from a 3 month contract to a full year one, which was a frustrating position to be in."
good,"Harris is a military quality radio manufacturer. It is a very large operation with lots of parts, they have great resources and opportunities. Temp jobs rarely result in permanent employment."
good,I think reviews of companies I have worked for should be optional. I am actually unhappy with Indeed for forcing me to review companies without making it optional to do so.
good,"Working remote in a changing organizational structure was a challenge as support was limited by site and each site has its own requirements that were not always clear.  However, talented peers and managers made success possible."
good,"Working overseas was rough at times, but supporting the mission is all that really mattered."
good,"If you get an offer from this organization . . . you should probably take it!"
good,"The company works on many different projects with opportunities to learn a lot about many types of aircraft.  Steep learning curve each time I was assigned to a new project, but I enjoyed the challenge."
good,Harris is a large company with a diverse workforce and many opportunities. They compete for business across the government and private industry. Many opportunities are available.
good,"Driven, friendly, intriguing: Harris Corporation possesses the right mindset and productive drive to perform their duties to the best of their capabilities."
good,"The job is interesting and fulfilling.  Most of the people that you work for and with are also good.  The hardest part of the job is that they generally do not care about the employee's family.  The second hardest part is that there is a lot of nepotism and ""good old boy"" network that goes on.  It is best to keep your head down and do all the things that they ask, regarless of the impact on your life."
good,Their vision and reputation as a good company in the field of telecommunications is an excellent place to start your career in the technical field.  The work was challenging but fair and the management are competent and looking out for their subordinates.
good,L3 is a great company to work for.  They offer competitive benefits including tuition reimbursement.  The company works hard to keep employee moral up.
good,Great pace to work. Lots of room to grow. The manufacturing facility is also very efficient. When they moved to the new location they incorporated a lot of lean six sigma.
good,"worked on new computer system"
good,"Good Benefits but had short breaks, however management is unstable and unpredictable. As big as this company is it lacks direction and future predictability."
good,"Harris is a proven leader in tactical communications, geospatial systems and services, air traffic management, environmental solutions, avionics and electronic warfare, and space and intelligence."
good,Working with the drafting department in reviewing and releasing technical drawings was very informative and interesting.  Working in the data library was also very helpful. I learned alot about scanning and using adobe acrobat.
good,"Good teamwork, good ambiance, benefice and salary was ok, technologie was interesting."
good,This is one of the most well know companies in Rochester and looks great to have on your resume if you live in the Western New York area.
good,Good company to work for and supported employee needs as needed. I would work for them again if the opportunity arose. Definitely a top company with experienced leadership.
good,Well liked and respected by Management and fellow employees.  Always looked for better solutions to technical/marketing issues on both current and new products.
good,worked with older women and the facility was much more open minded then other places.  loved the work environment and excited to go to work
good,"Performed duties as an on call Crytologic language instructor.  Travel to a location to supervise and train English speaking members in a classroom settings.  Provided high level language training utilizing the current events, country economics, government, military and international affairs."
good,Very good company with good working staff that are the common workers for getting the flight mission completed for the training program for the Army.
good,"Had a few ethical disagreements with management, but considering the overall, It was a  GREAT learning experience.  I would have enjoyed getting this ready for DSS review and training new hires, but was not comfortable with some things that were seemingly acceptable.  Was relieved when my position moved and account transferred over."
good,"CEO's sempre dispostos."
good,I worked here for over three years. The pay is quite high for the area of living I was in. Overtime is a regular thing whether you want to or not. Management not the greatest.
good,Very well organized with a mature EHS division. L3 is a holdings company which makes job security a concern. My division was bought out by Coherent however L3 did a great job in transitioning employees over.
good,"As a helpdesk analyst, we took care of internal customers across the Globe, and I was glad to do it.  You spoke with many of the same people across time, and I was able to get to know many of the staff across the world."
good,"Great working group and the support of HR is phenomenal. There is plenty of room to grow within the company. I was able to be deployed most of the year, so I didn't get to experience office life."
good,"The day to day is schedule oriented, working on customer requirement, Learned about X-ray system as well as other technical skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing a task"
good,"the company was a good place to work the hours were good, the people i worked with  were very nice and helped me get the job down, management was always there should we need to know any changes in the day or work week."
good,It's a good company to work for. Very helpful people to work with. I learned a lot of different things working here that cannot be disclosed in this review.
good,they are good paying. they have good benifits. they have room for advancement.Honest people. Can move world wide. they have excellent job secuirty.
good,Accomplished professional with more than 17 years of experience managing all aspects of software and hardware testing through the full systems lifecycle from requirements gathering through implementation.
good,Great pay. In a wartime area so very dangerous at times. 2 week vacations. overtime started after 48hrs worked. Great people to work beside.
good,"L3 Communications offered a benefits package with medical, dental, vision, and 401K match.  Management was very flexible when working with employees."
good,"My first post military experience with government contracting.  "
good,I learn what happens when government spending shifts when figure heads change in offices. Took advantage of my GI-Bill after this company closed the doors on a satellite office.
good,great company the only problem was the insecurity of the contract position.  You could be here today and gone tomorrow. most enjoyable part of the day was the non-stress workday.  As long as you could do the work and be caught up when it was time to go home it was great
good,"It was a good Company to work for. The hourly people were great everyone was always willing to help each other.The product they build is the best, they have the best engineering staff."
good,It was a fun place to work and I really enjoyed the many different positions that I was able to hold. Over the years I worked for a variety of management. There was a time that we worked many long hours to achieve our goals and we did it. For the most part everyone got along and pitched in and helped each other out.
good,L-3 Mission Integration has a very well-defined vision and the employees really buy into the responsibility to the customer and the US service men and women. The company offers solid benefits and a 401k match.
good,Great company for many years but has slowly declined due to continual changes in upper management which does not allow the company to stay consistent towards development and growth which leaves the employees wondering about their security in employment.
good,"Work mainly on the Facilities/Machine Maintenance SAP (Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processing) software system. Troubleshoot and repair process controls for heat treat ovens, chemical treat tanks, paint booths, ID printers, Haas CNC mills, and much more."
good,Benefits were great and the 9/80 schedule is awesome. If you can get a job there do it. Working in the IS department was a great place to be that is for sure.
good,"The program that I was associated was a classy group of people. Had my job position not moved from MS to TX, I would still be there."
good,Like any other bigger corporation it has it's ups and downs I guess. The nicer thing was that I had a manager who was willing to support and award his team whenever possible. L3 did make a few mistakes early in my tenure but gladly and proficiently corrrected those mistakes to my satisfaction. I couldn't have been happier working for the company other than to say that I wished they had offered me something a bit closer to my home negating my longer commute and 24*7 work schedule.
good,"Jefa muy humana, excelente persona, fue agradable trabajar para ella.-"
good,"L-3 is a great place to work. The company contributes to the local community, and provides a significant number of jobs. It has been around for a long time, and entire families across generations have worked there. It offers great benefits, and people tend to stay for a very long time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the variety and the since of pride everyone shares."
good,Overall good experience. Typical 8-5 workday. Great time off schedule. Good co-workers. There are opportunities to excel.
good,My career path within this company has developed over the last 26+ years.  Company has been through many name changes.  The company has offered me a continued growth path and allowed me to work many projects outside my normal work environment.
good,L-3 Communications was a pretty good company to work for as well. I had job security a that time. I was working for 75th Ranger Regiment. There was no stress working there everything was good until the contract ended.
good,"Not much to say except this company is based half on a good boy system.  the other half is based on the ""New York boys"" mentality."
good,On a daily basis I am to make myself available to answer questions and assist in accessing Technical data and making sure that it is understood.
good,It is an averaged work environment.  It has its own pros and cons.
good,"A very welcoming and friendly workplace.  The coworkers were very helpful answering questions and were eager to make you apart of the team.  It was a productive workplace, everyone was focused on their jobs and held true to their motto ""do it once, do it right."""
good,"Harris Corporation is a multifaceted, multinational company with a wide variety of career opportunities in many disciplines.  Most of the employees are engineers and scientists who are involved in producing cutting-edge technology for commercial and government customers."
good,This company has terrific people. They have 9 hour work days with every other Friday off.  They have a standard benefits package with room to move to other L-3 divisions.  They are located close to 215. They have core working hours which leaves some flexibility in a workers schedule (not all positions).
good,"typical day I was either at the shop or on the road traveling for work"
good,Company was very nice to work for.  Treated employees with respect and upward mobility opportunities
good,"L3 Communications is an ideal place to work. You are exposed to numerous training techniques and there are also opportunities for advancement. The Management is excellent and a delight to work under. Would love to continue to work there, however  have a wife with severe allergies and cannot stay in Florida."
good,Stability is a great thing. The people are great and the management is talented. The work varies and the deadlines are challenging.
good,Daily interaction with various employees who were stationed around the world.
good,Overall a good experience working at L-3 Communications. Management is good and a great job work/life balance.
good,I worked with AutoCAD to build mechanical parts and assemblies for their units that they used to hold all their product in the field.
good,get at least 5 to 7 calls day from different police  departments. with different issues with their DVR systems in their cars. also with thier servers that are used to download the videos
good,"Good place to work."
good,"A good employer/employees."
good,"L3 Communications Eo-tech has overall provided me with a great job experience. A typical day includes working on the line, or in sub-assembly the whole shift, however you are allotted two 15 minutes breaks that are paid, and an half-hour lunch that isn't paid. The management is really helpful when needed."
good,I enjoyed my work and I felt that we were a significant factor in mitigating green-on-blue threats overseas.
good,Great company to work for. Good benefits and health insurance. Stressful work schedule due to type of work contracts but overall good experience.
good,"My typical day in the offices includes multiple tasks for several executives ranging from travel plans, expense reports, supply orders, medical records request, office move request from one space to another, scheduling meeting and managing supervisor’s calendar and the list goes on. That is a typical work day. What I have learned since taking on this role it to always think and plan ahead. Management is always busy as have little time to ""manage"" an employee so it is important to know EVERYTHING about your job and to know where you can turn for outside help or for questions."
good,"Computer on, phones answered, conferences for next project."
good,Management and lack of orders are tough to work as a career. Too many ups and down with union shop.
good,"Good salary and job benefits, the not a lot of opportunities for advancement in the Product Assurance/Quality Dept. that I worked for. L-3 Corporate has removed the VP and Director that were the source of many of the moral and ethics problems during that time period. However, L-3 Communications West Div.  in SLC has been experiencing a high number of reductions in force from May 1013 through the end of last month.  Hopefully they will be able to reorganize and provide the stabile work environment they enjoyed for many years. "
good,"On a typical day I use lean/six sigma tools to error proof manufacturing processes. I conduct root cause/corrective action activities for non-conformance's. The hardest part of the job is not having the most up-to-date tools/software to help be more efficient. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding ways to help the assemblers to their jobs better, more efficient, and more effectively."
good,"Great co-workers"

good,Tasked with mentoring and advising the U.S. Army and Iraqi/Afghan National Police investigators in complex criminal investigations and targeting IED and insurgent networks.
good,"Went to Afghanistan and Iraq.  I spent 26 years with L-3.  Most of it was great.  The part I liked the best was working the Aircraft that was to be the first one built.  This required not just everyday routine work with my hands, but thinking and solving problems."

I also handled Travel Expense Reports and Base Site Reports for employees off-site, including over seas."
good,the job was enjoyable but I was a fuel tank mechanic and there was no opportunity to move to other areas besides management.
good,I really enjoyed working at Harris Corporation.  I especially enjoyed the flexibility that was given to the employees.
good,Work was challenging as Harris placed me in various jobs which required constant learning.   Data Analyzing was new and that last position I held.   I became very comfortable with MS Excel and learned how to manipulate large number of data.    My Co-workers were fun to work with and eager to help.   The hardest part of working for Harris was the lulls in work.   Working for the Government was a feast or famine type environment.   What I liked most about Harris was the people.
good,I would like to skip this section for now.  L-3 Was a great place to work for until they ran out of work.
good,This place was a great place to work with very friendly co workers that are there to help if it is needed.
good,"I worked for this company for 4-yrs, great benefits, and growth potentials.  Facilities were above average, but management was closed minded.  Co-workers were fun at times, but closed off...no outside activities or cohesion while at work."
good,"Good people, good pay, good atmosphere. I never had any issues with any of my coworkers."
good,"Great company to work for"
good,A bunch of great people to work with. Made quite a few friends that I will not forget.

good,This posistion created the opporntunity for fullfilling work.
good,"I have learned a lot during my time at Harris.  I was able to expand my technical skills in integration, scripting, and automation with great feedback and acceptance from my peers and management.  Most of my co-workers were very encouraging and provided great motivation/feedback.  They are a great resource when trying to expand and grow your skills.  Management sometimes seemed to have tough or unreasonable schedules that involved a lot of late nights and working weekends.  There have been multiple periods of work everyday for 3+ weeks.  The job is technically challenging but it is very enjoyable to see the results, especially when testing or demonstrating the product with our customer.  Overall, working for Harris has been a great opportunity to challenge myself, learn new skills, and find career advancement."
good,Provides both individual and team opportunities and flexible schedules.
good,Employees are empowered to be entrepreneurial and work together to meet goals and expectations.
good,Regularly given new assignments with ever increasing area of responsibilities
good,"Aeromet was a recent purchase of L-3 when I was hired and had a lot of growth pains to endure.  I was called about an opportunity in Orlando, FL with General Dynamics and decided it was time to move back home closer to family. "
good,Team work good people and good management I had some great co-workers and I miss them...
good,A group of dedicated aircraft mainteance professionals. Very skilled.
good,Leading a team of requirements engineers working in a DOORS environment was challenging. A steady stream of ECR and CCB preparations kept the team fully engaged. Developing relationships and communication was a requirement in order to perform in my role and was one of the more enjoyable and hardest parts of the job.
good,"Working between 8:30 and 9:00am, and ending around 6:00pm, although that could go longer depending on the circumstances."

good,"Each day required the ability to adapt to any type of work. Assist with inventory, procurement, and Request for proposals. "
good,"Prepared various reports including Actual and Forecast Hyperion, Management Discussion and Analysis, Percentage of Completion, and more.  I have learned to resolve the issues or problems with the minimum assistant from management.  The work place was often in a professional environment.  My co-workers and I were always cooperated to get the works done right and on time.  The hardest part of the job was to get many reports done in a strict deadline.  However, I was able to manage by putting extra effort and time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to know the works were properly done and exceed my management expectation."
good,Harris was a great place for me to grow my career at. Worked on great project and with great people.
good,-0800-1630 work time

good,I was so excited to be apart of a team that collect data for the employment rate for each state .
good,Very busy work schedule producing reports and analyzing financial data for various programs inorder to determine if we are gaining or losing profit .
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the employees in my department. It didn't matter if it was a stupid question, a form that needed filling out, help printing documents, whatever the need, I wanted the employees to feel comfortable asking for my help and knowing that I would help in any way I could."
good,"Great benefits and competitive pay, long hours (6) 12 hour shifts is common. 6am-6pm or 6pm-6am. It might drop to (5) 12's, but not much, at least in the program I worked in. They know what they're doing and they don't allow a lot of lagging around. There is some stress in regards to getting the jobs done on time, but if you know what you're doing you should be fine."
good,Fast paced maintenance prior to an following military unit deployments for functionality.
good,"My co-workers are are wonderful group of skilled, diverse people. My job is fairly routine, but there can always be a little diversion on a daily basis. I currently handle al the utilities,leases and phones,both cell and business lines.There can always be a little diversion on a daily basis. This can be in the form of a site having a problem with a utility or an employee losing phone service. Whay ever it may be, I look at it a a break form the regular routine."
good,"Responsible for alignment of Thermal night sight units,in addition to doing Acceptance test before final delivery. Our managers our gave us room to to do our work. As co-workers we all each had a responsibility and shared information if something was out of flow. Most enjoyable was when we got customer feedback on the quality of the product."
good,Good Company to work for lot of learning experence had a great boss
good,A typical day of work is when the System is keep failing to start up. I have learned to work under tremendous pressure. Management is cooperative. Co-workers share information. The hardest part of the job is back to back traveling. The most enjoyable part of the job is to visit Air traffic Control Centers.
good,Started as a supply clerk and was given the opportunity to learn production control position.
good,Working with mulit-million dollar aircraft and Navy personnel is only for the strong willed.
good,"First thing in the morning, check your computer for critical requirements"
good,"I was an electrical engineering co-op for ~30 weeks. It was a great experience where I learned a lot, but my experience will vary greatly compared to someone who will work there full-time."
good,I got to work with alot of people on various types of equipment. I learned from everyone I worked with on each specific type of equipment. Lacking was performance reviews.
good,"-Fast paced with lulls during the day"
good,"All of the merging has made Harris a confusing place to work.  All of the reorgs have everyone on edge. Waiting for the hammer to fall. Harris is top heavy currently, I see some cuts in middle management."
good,L3 CSW is a good place to work in the Defense Industry.  They pay for extended work hours and you have the option of working a 4-10 schedule.  They are the industry leader in intelligence communication equipment.
good,My four years at L3 was a great experience and taught me many incredible things. I am very eager to learn and L3 and its staff gave me the opportunity to advance and learn new things. I worked with a wonderful team.
good,"I was with this company for a very long time and enjoyed the opportunities I received for advancement, I only left since I accepted a management role for another company"
good,Great opportunities for all levels.  Management was too job focused and often did not listen to needs of employees.  Flexible schedule was outstanding.  Compensation was more than fair.
good,"Interesting technology at a slow pace. Upward movement is limited but the technology is bleeding edge. Great place to start, but management will not go out of their way to compensate. Expectation of weekend work/2nd shift/overtime is standard."
good,"The hardest part of the job is not knowing what hurdles will be required to hurdle that day.  While work would be planned in advance, a typical day would include throwing the old plan into the trash and must fly by the seat of your pants."
good,"One of the best things about working here is the work life balance. Our standard work schedule is 9/80-working 36 hours one week, and 44 the next, with every other Friday off.  The health insurance could be improved, as were are more high deductible plans, but this seems to be what most companies are doing now.  Everyone is very friendly and willing to help. "
good,"liked of the different people I got to work with, pretty demanding but also rewarding, it needs of a better manager that's more human, and understanding to employee family needs"
good,I was satisfied with my work experience at Harris. Management was fair and work/life balance was good. Management support was excellent and advancement opportunities were good.
good,17 Year’s I work in L 3  I enjoy every day coming to Work always looking forward every challenge . Problem I encounter is learning  experience for me and a good team work will make a Job very easy also our Engineers are approachable to Work especially when encounter problems.
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits, good pay. Lots of ethics & job related training. Typical large company environment with many managers. Annual raises. Company cafeteria."
good,"L3 is a great employer if you are okay with sitting in a cubicle all day and typing on a computer. as long as you do that, you will have a secure job for the most part. Pay is decent for the area but it can be torture getting use to sitting there 8 hours. There are tons of positions out there and they all are a little different. Hourly employees make the money, salary get straight pay after 40 hours."
good,performed maintenance 200 and 400 hour inspections on CH-47 helicopters as a contractor for military and helped to maintain their mission ready status
good,"Very fast pace but the people made the work fun and easy. we enjoyed  staying busy. Fast turn around, 7 days on UH-60 Helicopter Phase maintenance. Every 3 to 4 days a  Main Rotor came in for tear down. "
good,"The typical day at work for me started at 5:30am and ended anywhere from 8-12 hours later.  It was stressful, face paced and at times a challenging job. The best part of the day would have to be when supervision recognized the completion of a job that came in early and or under budget."
good,typical day at work was challenging but not difficult. the most difficult part of the job is working with the FAA. there are a lot of restrictions and processes due to public safety being affected. i design and build optical and TDM circuits across the Harris optical backbone network as well as the HTEN commercial LANPHY network. it is gratifying and rewarding work.
good,The Waco facility could be a better place too work however there are a couple of thing I would change if I could the number one thing being the pay scale.It is really hard to get a decent pay raise.
good,"L3 Technologies (PID) failed in securing long term contracts and with the reduction in government spending, upper management the facility just could not sustain. I hope one day it returns to full operation as it has been for so many years."
good,I liked the company and would work for them again if I choose to. I believe that they have descent growth and opportunity here and other locations. They have pretty good insurance and advancement depending on location.
good,Great telecom experience for a six month assignment. Management was great and so was the pay. Once they realized my extensive experience I was promoted to a supervisory position.
good,This company was okay at most. They changed job titles along with the site supervisor to make the all workers paid the same. People with certifications were paid less.
good,"Projects consisted of routing wire harnesses to their respective locations, and then terminating those wires with connectors. We received 3 breaks, two ten minute breaks one 30 minute break. The pay was consistent, raises were consistent, Paid time off was plentiful. The management left something to be desired."
good,A busy job with a lot of friendly people.  Keeps you hopping.   Challenging but rewarding.  They were getting paid for the number of employees that showed up for each shift.  Not by how productive they were.  Being productive as 3 other employees didn't gain you anything.  Also imposed an employee blackout during 911.  No TV or Phone calls until the shift was over.  Was not concerned about the employees that day.
good,"I was a contractor, so my work experiences are a bit different.  I'm always hired into the projects that are way behind and they are usually desperate by the time contractors are approved and hired."
good,Learned quite a bit from the veteran mechanics there. However had a supervisor who only seemed to care about his bonus and not about investing into his people.
good,Portfolio not diversified.  Management instability.  No real leadership from the top.  Strained relationship between ex-military personnel and those with no military experience.
good,"During my years with this outfit, I worked with many very intelligent and talented people.  Together we overcame many challenges, technical and otherwise.  We were a tight family."
good,"I enjoy working with my colleagues at L3.  The work is interesting and stimulating.  However, in my position as a Field Engineer I am required to put the job first above my family.  I have done that for 10 years and yet I am forced to continue doing so.  Therefore, it is time to look for other employment."
good,Great place to work.I have met and worked with a lot of good people here. I have grown to have a great deal of respect for there knowledge and wisdom.
good,"Large American Fortune500 company with top talent, superb colleagues but the company is reluctant to leave government contractor mentality. Low turnover so minimal opportunities for advancement."
good,"While there is room for growth, and Harris is a good company to work for, management is not always fair, being that if someone reports you for an incident, the manager does not contact you to let you know what complaint is made, he, or she just documents it, and you will find out when your yearly review comes up. This has happened more than to just a few people that I've come across while working for Harris."
good,I filled a contract position with the company for one year. Workplace culture is typical of most Corporate America workplaces. Most employees are in their mid 30s to 50s.
good,Great technologies. Super product. Wonderful engineering team. Lots of fun working projects together. Flexible hours. Allows innovation. All motivated to produce best product for customer.
good,"For the Camden NJ office, place runs like it is still the 1960's.  Company president likes to remind you that he is in charge.  In spite of that, the engineering team is excellent, and not a bad place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working for L3, I would still be there if my school and work schedule had been more compatible. Most of the time they were able to show they valued their employees. I was allowed to be very independent on what I choose to work on."
good,Never hire people fully on and the projects never last as expected always trying find work pay is ok this not a job or a career
good,"Older work staff.  Hard to make necessary process improvement. Like any other company, some good people and more difficult people individuals. Good HR staff."
good,A lot of change in my division right now so it can be stressful at this time but overall L3 is very good place to work. The 401k benefits could be better but the medical is good
good,"Les journées filaient à la vitesse de l'éclair, environnement intéressant et stimulant, des défis quotidiens, j'ai aimé travailler chez L-3 MAS. Environnement contraignant à cause du type particulier de clients (la Défense Nationale), ça m'a permis de développer des talents et capacités multiples, des trucs que je n'aurais jamais imaginé faire dans une telle entreprise. Mes collègues me manquent, j'espère ardemment me retrouver un environnement similaire pour continuer à aider et contribuer."
good,L3 bought the night vision division  from Northrop in 2008. we kept military supplied with night vision power supplies. we were good and could get the numbers
good,"I truly enjoyed my position at Harris.  I enjoyed the interaction and providing immediate support to the quality assurance group, supervisors, mechanical/electrical engineering, procurement, scheduling, product analysis lab, production floor associates, assemblers, testers, and troubleshooters."
good,Its a great place to work. Challenging and fast passed most days. My coworkers are very personable and we all work well together.
good,"""Harris Broadcast"" has been renamed ""Imagine Communication"" after they got divested by the main Harris parent company. There were massive layoffs and all manufacturing was moved to China and Mexico. The workplace is actually quite nice, but since I left I don't know what changes have been made."
good,Work as a Security Officer was very mundane but a secure job.  Co-workers make the job worth the long hours but there is not much room for professional growth.
good,"Great place to be employed , but laid off twice in 5 years do to lack of workload and the lack of combat missions.   I would go back if called back.  This is a union shop."
good,Great place to work just an unstable environment in regards to job security.  Every secretive environment which brings about stress.
good,Wonderful benefits and work / life balance. Poor local leadership. People are very nice but the overall culture is dull.
good,"I enjoyed working at Level 3 Communications but the stress of continually getting more and more systems piled on and no additional personnel to the team was weighing heavily on me and made me miserable.  Constantly on call (24x7), there was no work life balance which added to my misery.  Eventually, I hit a breaking point when I kept being passed over for advancement into other areas and decided to resign to pursue my startup business."
good,The management sucks and all take part in the good ol boy system. Other than that the people are good and the pay is decent.
good,Good place to get a lot of training due to the fact that the technicians work on all aspects of the communications industry on any given day. Also had a great training environment and traing is in an on line format doing the class work during slower times of the day.
good,"L-3 IEC is currently going through tough economy like others in our kind of business, management is trying and they have big goals.  I am happy and been OK with my job. I am planning to move out f California and welcome any opportunity around Reno Nevada."
good,"this is an excellent company to work for.  i have learned a trade that i enjoy doing for a living.  i have gotten the chance to see and be a part of a business that not a lot of people get the chance to be part of.  just like with any job,  it has had its ups and downs but overall i am glad i have had the opportunity to be part of this company for so long."
good,"Overall an exciting place to work with great opportunities.  Merge with another acquisition cause a continuous change in leadership, and subsequent dissolution of the group as the business evolved.  This created significant loss of jobs and human capital that was extremely talented and dedicated team."
good,"My work day consists of conference calls with my clients to update them on the status of their orders from inception to completion. Along with the conference calls, I also created spreadsheets in excel and managed upwards of 90 orders at any one time. "
good,"Good place to work, unstable employment due to random layoffs at times.  Management is good but advancement is pretty much locked up."
good,Work days have been enjoyable for last seven years. New management and government involvement has changed environment and lack of manning has made an impossible way to do what is asked from employees.
good,"Address network issues, prepare upgrades, configuration, installation, customer interaction."
good,There is always something that needs done. L-3 keeps the staffing at the minimum level so that means there is a lot of need to pick up the slack.
good,Great place to learn and have DoD experience. Help warfighters.
good,"Good place to work, well paying, good hours. "
good,I learned how federal government agencies function.  I perform various tasks within the IT department at Fort Lee.  I'll tell you more about it in the interview...
good,"I was hired in may of this year right out of college, and loved my job until I was laid off Mid - August, with no warning or notice that was coming."
good,I have been working for this company for 7 years.  Lots of changes.  Survived couple of major layoffs.  No professional growth for me.  There is not enough work to keep me busy.  No learning opportunities.  The working environment generally is welcoming.  Looking for more responsibilities.
good,"This company teaches a person to prioritize the many demands, duties and responsibilities; very high pace but the co-workers are incredible."
good,Don't have Supervision looking over you ever minute. Come in and start to work after pass down. In the department co-worker are matched to work together with least amount drama. Data entry was the hardest thing to keep up with and best part was interact Employees and Customers.
good,There is a steep learning curve and you must have a good attitude.
good,Contract continually goes up for rebid and benefits are reduced each time.
good,Pretty good company to work for.  Pretty good environment.  Work with a great engineering team.
good,"I enjoyed the challenges of being a technical writer for this company.  The most challenging part of my job, which I was the only editor to produce was the Time Compliance Technical Orders which at times could be very complicated.  There were people that I worked with that were very knowledgeable in this field and I admired them very much.  Most worked as a team.  Enjoyed using government specifications such as the MIL-SPEC-38784 to verify that my work was absolutely correct."
good,"A great company to work for. Unfortunately, due to federal budget cuts and sequestration, changes need to be made for this company to compete. This has created a very unstable and insecure work environment."
good,I rated the company only 2 stars for Job Security and Advancement but that is more related to the nature of Government Contracting rather than the fault of the Company.  I found Management to be lacking in many regards (borderline incompetent) yet at the end of the day Management makes sure that the paychecks arrive on time and eventually resolved issues.
good,my entire day was spent doing data entry and filing and making sure that the other personal has all the paperworks needed .
good,A typical day starts by getting on base. Make sure you are early because the line tends to get long. First I have to check in with a Lead worker. There is much communicating between shifts. The hardest part is all the multitasking involved as well as staying on your toes. The most enjoyable parts of the job are getting to know all the people you get to work with. 
good,"The work I did while working for L-3 I felt was most rewarding, more so while deployed.  I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the task at hand.  The feeling of a job well done once a mission was completed was more than satisfying.  Going from military to contractor was a major switch but I was able to learn so much while working for L-3.  My experience and gained knowledge I believe will benefit me where ever I may go next."
good,"Kind of stressful working for the government"
good,Great products for a good cause. Everyone wants to help each other achieve their tasks. Great team environment!
good,"Fast-paced work environment, employees are expected to achieve results on a daily/weekly basis."
good,"A typical workday includes working with writers, illustrators, and composition to ensure documents meet all Military Specifications and government preferences with no errors."
good,The company was a great place to learn about new products. I was also able to get hands on learning by traveling to sites.
good,"L-3 is a very large company with many different business entities that all function more or less independently under the L-3 umbrella. Many of the business units perform entirely different types of work. For example, one entity does engineering while another does training solutions. Each of these entities seem to do things a little differently so it's hard to say how things are in the other divisions that I was not a participant in."
good,i think army fleet support is on off the best aviation places i ever worked for ....its just great ...
good,working overseas not fun but the people i worked with made it so easy for me i love the money i made and i had good time's ..
good,I worked typically 50-70 hours per week. Working at L-3 developed my work ethic and abilities to perform and exceed my peers.
good,Typical day at work included working with Aircraft Mechanics and management of Aircraft parts. Learned nothing more than I already knew. Management level was average. Co-workers displayed questionable work practices. Hardest part of the job was being in the middle east. Most enjoyable part of the job was the pay.
good,L-3 is an integrator with great internal resources. The organizational aspects are lacking
good,L-3 was a fun place to work. I like what the company stood for.
good,I would come to work at 6:30 a.m. and get a hand down from my co-worker on what she did not accomplish on her shift. I would continue where she left off. I would go and get the parts that was needed to fix the aircraft. Some time I would have to order the parts that was needed for the aircraft if the items were not in stock. I had to keep a document control register for each aircraft. I had to do inventory on the benchstock and reorder when the stock was low. I had to ensure the recoverable parts were turned in so the military would get the proper credit. I work 13 hours a day and had a 1 hour lunch to include three 15 minutes break. My schedule was 12 hours a day and 7 days a week. Housekeeping was done throughout the shift on a daily basis. When the night shift person would come in I would give a hand down of where I left off.
good,Employees are hard working and always working to improve. The company is working hard to implement contiuous improvement through out the different departments
good,"My experience with Harris began with it's predecessor, Radiation, Inc. which was a very challenging place to work, technically. Lots of opportunities to design hardware in the early days. Very competitive place to work. Top performers often left a mess behind them and documentation was often left behind for less aggressive folks to clean up. Local doctors called it an ulcer mill, but I think that it was not that bad. I felt like I was treated fairly and advanced about as quickly as I wanted to. Although they are generous with 401K matching funds, there is no pension. System engineers need to stay current with the technology, esp. communications, and need to be computer savvy, at least with scripting languages. Occasional layoffs seem to target older workers but what else is new?"
good,The pay is decent. I enjoy the people that I work with regardless of shift. Sometimes there are not enough troops to provide the best level of support.
good,There can be of lots of activity. There can be at periods where work is very slow depending on the types of contracts that they secure with government.
good,I do not have any comment at this time for work at L3Harris other than I enjoyed my time there. They have good people working there and made some good friend.
good,"I rarely experienced issues with coworkers in the office, possibly do to the lack of outside work culture. There is a distinct lack of work-life balance, with little to no encouragement of developing relationships on a personal level."
good,"Good Company to work for that does important work. Benefits are mediocre, but salaries average. Key to advancing is to owning your own career, advocating for your advancement and seeking internal opportunities."
good,"its a workplace, you do work and get paid go home sleep and get ready for the same thing the next day ................................................"
good,Very busy  but a good place to work.  I had an excellent supervisor and great coworkers.  Some flexibility in schedule.  Good employee training available.
good,It a great place to work for under a stressful  environment.  The supervisor are very nice and very helpful.  The people there are very friendly and willing to help you when you are new.
good,"Overall a good company to work for, lots of opportunities to grow and learn new things. Great people, flexible work days and challenging work. ......."
good,"Working environment is rough on the body, but you get a good sense of satisfaction from working hard. The conditions are really hot and you have to get into tight spaces, but it was fun. You get dirty and sweaty, but at the end of the day there was plenty more work to do the next. "
good,Management. Could use some work highly skilled personnel are required on the floor. Very diverse work crew. Large well equipped  working environment. Tools are supplied.
good,"LA division is in a state of transition. "
good,"Lots of jobs to move within the company. Good paid time off and flexible schedules. "
good,"L3 has been a great place to work. I have had many opportunities for career advancement. Promotions are not given they are earned. "
good,L3 offers a pretty good work life balance with good benefits.  Not much room for growth but if you are not looking to advance this is a good company to work.
good,"My job here started from a very small company who was then purchased by L3 Technologies."
good,"Decent Fort Wayne company. "
good,"They need work in the area of Talent Development. Good benefits, good hours and interesting work.  Difficult to get promoted.  Family like work environment and good team building."
good,High stress but rewarding job. I have been very fortunate to have mentors that have taught me much about over all material management and supply chain processes . The employees are  great to work with and are very friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable thing about my job is the satisfaction of completing the task and seeing the results.
good,"Did not have a big company feel. Great company to work with, contract I worked on had a low ceiling salary wise which is one of the reasons I left. Otherwise great place to work."
good,"Large corporation with many changes in management.  Ability to transfer within the corporation at plants throughout the world.  Good benefits when I was there.  For the most part management I was under was very good to work with and willing to make changes for family needs, etc."
good,A hard company to get into but well worth it if you are willing to put in the effort. Programs and opportunities are available to all types of job positions but be prepared to put in the hard work to meet contract/department requirements.
good,Work hours were Monday-Friday 7am-3:30. Communication was good there and everyone worked together to get the job done. I worked with all retired military Vets. I learned organization at this job and attention to detail. The hardest part of the job was being laid off. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. A great group of people
good,Best place I've worked at in 25 years of experience. The software and computers were very fast and helpful. I loved working with the people there. There is much to learn and much to do to contribute to the success of the company and the service they provide to our military! I would do it all over again if I had the chance.
good,"L3 Technologies is a serious competitor in DOD, Homeland Security, and technology advances to support global customer base. Days are challenging and face paced environment. Always a learning experience and continuous progress for improvements. A diversified work culture. The hardest part of the job at L3 at times is staying on point with the ever changes taking place, but this is a double edge sword because it makes the daily efforts worth while."
good,The jobs at L3 are amazing and you are compensated extremely well for your job.  The management is all who you know and not the best picks for the positions but sometimes you can get lucky and land a good boss.
good,Every 6 month they restructure and lay off good workers. Workers are always on the lookout for when next wave of lay off will take place. They replace workers who make more money with new low salaried workers.
good,"I worked at a remote location four years on call,  and was only paid for forty hours. There were a few people in the company that could mess up your day.  "
good,L-3 Is a rather flat organization with many smaller divisions. Not much room for growth. Struggles with brand awareness and a common communications message.
good,Hired on to Harris 2 years prior to contract end for a portion of the work force.  No guarantee of a promising future as Harris wants their corporate managers to manage this Air Force contract. Most days are very active. I enjoyed training others on systems I had learned.
good,"Defense contractor that monitors your coming and going, Badge readers going in and out of plant. Parking lots are large and require a good hike to get in and out of the plant. Use to be a great place to work, not so much any more.  The place has lost that loving feeling.  Hard to put your finger on what and why management has lost contact with even the most senior of engineers."
good,"I gained a lot of experience and at first was afforded flexibility to do other jobs.  I started as a technical trainer, taught, wrote curriculum and technical procedures.  I would work as a field service engineer and back to technical writing but the last few years they required you to stay in one area only and that got old."
good,"Almost no opportunity for advancement you have to ""Get It"" when you're hired. advancement is very difficult and pay raises are your standard 3%. The job itself can be very interesting. I have made a lot of friendships while at Harris"
good,"I spent just over a year with Harris.  I enjoyed the company, but we lost the contract re-compete and sought out new employment at that time.  I would recommend Harris to friends."
good,L3 bids for government contracts in a wide range of fields. The company is mercenary and its employees are mercenaries. There is virtually no loyalty either direction top down or bottom up. You know your job can and will be terminated without notice going in.
good,"Pay is descent for average workers, but high achievers aren't necessarily compensated commensurate with their contributions or achievements. Pay is more impacted by how long you've been with the company and less with results."
good,"The company is great;  however it is a slow pace type of work. People is nice, but there it has an old boy scout club type of culture. If you can adjust to these... then the place is perfect for you."
good,Started out with one company and was sold several times and ended up with L-3. Enjoyed the work and my customers immensely. Challenging / Rewarding an
good,L3 is a good company to work for. Alot of options and good bennies. They are fair in hiring and treat their employees well. If you are on the government side contracting expect to travel.
good,"I would have never left Harris Corp. if my salary would have kept up with the market.  Hired as a new graduate from UCF, my starting salary was the median for the position at my time of hire; however, after 3 months the starting salary jumped 8%, and after 1 year it jumped 15% yet my pay only increased 3%.  Although, I stayed with the company and gained valuable experience, ultimately I left because after 4+ years I was able to go elsewhere for a 26% pay increase."
good,Mostly a great place to work. Top management change causing culture in mid 80s to turn very uncaring for employees. Complete levels of mid management were eliminated and managers with years of seniority were demoted and let go. Much of the senior talent was chased off.
good,I really wanted to retire there but I was one of the hundreds of employees that was laid off in the 3rd round of lay offs.  Every day was a challenge toward the end not knowing if you were one of the ones getting laid off
good,I still have high hopes that the company will find it way in the growing industry and focus on job security smoother process. Has undergone major changes at the top that are still filtering down.
good,"The company was a combination of private sector and government contractors.  My initial employer was a government contractor which was acquired by a larger company.  Within 4 years, that company was acquired by a larger company. "
good,"Engineering Information Technology"
good,"I like that my co-workers have my same sense of humor and we work well together. It is a friendly environment, well organized. Communication is always on point."
good,I enjoyed working at L3-Communications. I worked in a number of different departments over the years and advanced my career a lot during that time. Good training and Quality focused. Cross training was done with the worked in mind. If a job on the line didn't work out another place was found that worked better with employee. Team oriented even during times of high production.
good,"Everyday was a good day. I learned how to drive the auto scrubber. my manager was very cool and I enjoy being on his team. My co workers was ok, we got along good. The most enjoyable part of the job seeing a finish product completed on time and on budget."
good,Took over new location for the production of bomb detection devices for air travel.  Ultimately left company after over 20 years due to personal issues.
good,"I enjoy the everyday challenges of finding resolutions to issues, as well as finding a more efficient way to complete processes.  We work together as a team to receive, process, store and issue thousands of parts on a monthly basis."
good,"Productive and exciting place to work, learned a lot about electronics and test procedures. Very nice, friendly enviromnment. Management is great and easy to talk to."
good,"Decent employer, raises are hard to come by.  Management can be fickle, but, all in all not the worst company to work for.  They have excellent benefits."
good,"L-3 Communications lost the 5 year contract, after being employed with them for 13 Months. There were a good company to work for, spent 11 out 13 months in Kuwait & Korea."
good,"Typical workday was from 6:30AM to 3:30PM Mon-Fri."
good,"had some military ,government experience about documents and products,Management was poor ,no communication between first and second shift,The most favorite part is alternate Friday off"
good,I enjoyed my work at Harris Corporation and was very sorry to be part of the involuntary workforce reduction that recently occurred in March 2017 with my position being eliminated.  I looked forward to going to work every day and being helpful to many people in all departments.  I was proud to work at Harris and be a part of what they do.
good,"This place here in Enid, Oklahoma would great if the Union wasn't here and if the COR wasn't trying to run things. Union and the COR have their hands in everything, which makes it very hard to do your job properly."
good,"Since the start off my employment at Level (3) Communications, changes were constantly being made.  The entire executive leadership as a whole lacked purpose and spearheading a company mission."
good,"Developmental needs are diversity, equal opportunities for minorities.  A good old boy network.  Really great work and people.  Not great task management and group leaders, given lead responsibilities without leadership training.  Some very old and moldy facilities."
good,A high expectations company.  Technically very competent and production capability is outstanding.  Senior leadership has been with company for too long and needs new blood in a very different defense market.
good,"Great company to work for, don't have any complaints. Great people and culture. Fun to come to work and love what you do. Management is good and time off is fantastic"
good,"Days are 10 hour days, lots of good people and the work is challenging at times.   Come in with lots of experience because the training is awful. With a good attitude and a willingness to learn you will go far."
good,"A typical day, was a busy day.  There was always something to do.  Different departments to move to, so many chances to learn a new position.  Advancements was in the future."
good,I enjoyed working as an aircraft mechanic in a Navy contract. I did not enjoy working as a mid-level manager. I worked for L-3 for 9 years and enjoyed it for 7.
good,Good place to work.  Many challenges and different assignments kept the job interesting. I particularly liked satellite receiver and vehicle tracking projects.
good,"productive, and challenging. learned how to deal with different issues and also learned how to communicate with clients and different kind of people, race and beliefs."
good,The typical daily work is well planned out. There are many criteria aspect to your daily operation. Management is there to support you and not looking over your shoulder. Your co-workers are very knowledgeable of there position. The hardest part of the job is the communication gap between quality and manufacturing. The most enjoyable part of the job is being a team player.
good,"L-3 has been a good company to work for, but on the overall work experience on the CB, lots of travel. The people are good to work for and with."
good,"It is challenging work. Some of the items we build have never been built before. Others may only be built in ones or twos in a decade. Others we build in volume."
good,"Good place to work "
good,I really enjoyed working for L-3. The people were nice and friendly. People worked hard and looked out for one another. L-3 was a great place to work but unfortunately my position was no longer available.

good,"A leading federal contractor, great people with a strong customer focus.  Top notch management and support staff, always professional and striving for continued improvement."
good,"Harris is a good engineering company. It has many different communication programs."
good,"Great benefits and compensation programs.  This company did not staff positions at minimum required levels, and made for 60+ hour weeks."
good,Advancement was difficult without a degree. Easy to become pigeon-holed. No serious complaints. Management was effective from what I saw.
good,"I have learned a lot working for L-3. Been with the company over 7 years and promoted 4 times . "
good,"This review is specific to Harris RF communications division. Harris will allow you many opportunities for development. I have been able to move positions increasing my responsibility, improving skill set, and gaining new skills to further my professional development. Pay may be a little low compared to industry. This used to be made up for by the excellent benefits we enjoyed. But as the case with many places they have been reduced. Especially and significant increase in health care premiums with a reduction is what is payed for."
good,"Every week, imagery analysis work begins with a new Scheme of Maneuver scheduling the collection of targets to be collected on for the week. Forensic imagery analysis is conducted on the collected imagery each day and products are generated based on the analysis. Completed products are then uploaded to GETS for dissemination to battle space owners in Afghanistan."
good,Great day to day place of business with alot of potential for room growth.  The drive would be the hardest thing personally.
good,"L-3 was a great company to work for until they ran into trouble and started laying people off."
good,"When they first hired me I got to work 54-56 hours per week. Jan 1st they hired a new plant manager who stopped all overtime.Loved doing electrical assembly but since the slow down they had all of us who were temps to just count parts,do inventory,sweep floors.Then in march the new mgr ended our conracts.I was hired through superior group out of irving,tx."

good,"Working at L-3 Communications was rewarding to me financially, mentally, and challenging.  The company allow me the opportunity to apply my skills and abilities as I achieved my personal goals."
good,"A typical day at work is answering questions from traveling road teams and balancing the man hours (production/productive)"
good,My time with L3 has been challenging and rewarding experience.  My position offered a fast-paced day.  My co-workers were both helpful and became like family to me.  The hardest part will be leaving the job but as with all things we must adapt.
good,"A typical day would be me completing different projects in Optical Manufacturing. I learned various techniques of resurfacing optical lenses to the specification of the customer. Management was very difficult to work with and approach at times. I loved working with a diverse cast of people, despite sometimes working with difficult people at times."
good,"A place for advancement and where they give opportunities to move up when possible.  "
good,"I learned to be flexible."
good,Its a typical corporation you have to be in the know to advance the management seems to like it that way.  Co-workers are great but it seems like some managers are clueless in the buddies club.
good,"Typical day is making sure driver will deliver on time, if not notify receiving customer and then finding their next load and making sure driver gets the correct info for pick up. Have to keep the financial spread sheets are update daily. Help set up new drivers, set up drug testing."
good,"This was the first time I worked for them, I was treated as a professional, I was able to draw from my experiences to do my part.  My normal day consisted locating the fleet’s aircraft discrepancies and disturbing the work to the Mechanics.  Most times parts would need to be ordered which I would provide and receive the parts in a timely manner."
good,"there are some really great engineers at L-3 but the company does not value software.  They have the attitude that if it can be done in hardware then by no means do it in software, which is completely opposite of how most of the world functions.  Their desire is to sell hardware so software is a necessary evil. If you can deal with that attitude then it could be a good place to work."
good,"A typical work day consists of a series of meetings, review and updating tasks on schedules."
good,L-3 STRATIS management allowed those with demonstrated abilities to quickly progress with-in the company.
good,"A typical day at work can involve troubleshooting network issues, installing and testing new equipment, working with network engineers on designs, installing equipment at customer locations, troubleshooting/basic maintenance of critical infrastructure (HVACS, generator, back up battery power, rectifiers). I have great co-workers that are function as a team; we are constantly learning from one another.  The fact that there are so many different responsibilities is great because it gives you opportunity to learn so many different things, and the job is never monotonous.  The hardest part though is balancing and prioritizing all of the different demands that come from different directions. There is little encouragement of work/life balance, steadily increasing pressure to produce more with less has created a very stressful environment not conducive to producing quality work"
good,"I have had excellent management and support while at L-3.  The benefits are good and the pay excellent.  My coworkers have also been top-notch professionals."
good,Managers at all levels are empowered to make decisions. The work environment is great.  The campus is set up to help employees manage their day.
good,Very Military environment. Advancement takes a bit and there is a good change you'll be doing shiftwork (nights). Sumter is a high crime area.
good,Management never showed initiative to make the workplace a better one for tomorrow.
good,"I enjoyed my time there. Technician Manufacturing 3(AKA Electronic Technician 3)"
good,"I enjoyed this job, it was an opportunity to learn something new. As I did not know telecommunications. I interfaced with major telecommunications Off Net network sites to enter technical data specifications for equipment required to build Off net circuits. I would interface with companies such as Verizon, Sprint, XO, At&t, Bell South, etc. Provided excellent customer service. Accuracy in data entry ensured correct materials needed for project builds. Expedited work with project managers to assist with on time delivery for proprietary builds. Had technical training and professional development training. Attended seminars and completed courses in Telecommunication skills. "
good,L-3 was a good contractor job. I worked daily with the various levels of maintenance on aircraft and the paperwork involved. Management was not always on the same page as to what needed to be done and how. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and maintained a professional demeanor with the ones that I did not get along with. The hardest part of this job was leaving home on the detachments and spending the time away from my children with a husband on active duty. I did enjoy the atmosphere surrounding the job and the people that I worked with. I like doing administrative jobs and this one had me continuing to put my Navy knowledge to good use.
good,Large corporation with many products.  However extended travel (often 6 months or more) was necessary due to product types.
good,"Typical day at work includes sudden change in regular routine and learning something new."

good,A learning organization that supports growth and offers great benefits.
good,My work day would start at 6:00 am and end at 3:30 pm. I walk into work clock in and get to work on whatever my boss needed done first. And I'd continue to work hard and finish whatever I could with the time given to me. My coworker's where very nice and work hard as well. They would help me with anything I needed help with if they could. My manager was a very fair and respectable man. The hardest thing about working there was when it would get slow and there wouldn't be much work to do. And the best part of the job was always being able to learn new thing's to better assist my ability to do my best.
good,Willng to put in the extra time required to learn a new job skill or to get a project completed correctly and on schedule. Always striving to learn something new or a better way.
good,A typical work day consisted of learning new elements in working on military aircrafts to take with me on future job placements.
good,Family fun place where ideas are welcome.  They allow you to work independently.   They allow you to express yourself openly and all managers have an open door policy.
good,"Most days were filled with budget vs. actual analysis and meetings to review where projects were financially. I learned a lot about Earned Value and received Earned Value Certification. Management was difficult to work with and often went against their word. I really enjoyed my co-workers and have stayed in close contact with many of them. Most days I enjoyed going to work, just not who I worked for."
good,"I have learned alot at here about alot of technology. "
good,"On call 7 days a week with at least 6 to 7 days a week. 24/7"

good,Very busy work environment. Update and maintain schedules and cost programs. Incorporate Earned Value Management System (EVMS) into all schedule and cost programs. I have learned the value of hard work and how important a management team is. Work well with management to accomplish daily tasks. It is very important the we meet our reporting period deadlines to the customer.  We work as a team with our co-workers and management to succeed in our short and long term goals. 
good,"Contract based work with excellent "
good,"A typical day at work is quite pleasant. A great bunch of co-workers, who are very knowledgeable. "

good,Provides many opportunities to excel and work different contracts.
good,"This company gave a variety of possibilities for work depending on your skill set, but I was laid off after a year and a half with no explanation after having steady work for the entire time."

good,Review PO Mods and process RFQ's as received from customers.
good,"friendly management,good enviroment,every thing easy going"
good,"Good place to work, would return. Great talent base, good folks to work with in production test. The hardest part of the job was constant changes in goals and the idea that low yield is the nature of the beast. It does not have to be that way, at least not as extreme."
good,contractors that repair military equipment after returning from deployment.
good,This was a great experience for me. It was a work-study program I was apart of in high school and I gained a lot experience.
good,My supervisor was not the best guy. Most of the co-workers were great hard working Americans.

good,"good job, probably 30 percent travel,"
good,"Overall very satisfying experience in L-3 Communications covering all areas like: work recognition, responsibilities, working environment, cooperation from senior management, transparency in work, ethical values etc."
good,L-3 is a conglomerate of small independent companies grouped by technology/services.
good,only reason for not having the job is that they lost some contracts so i dont think they will be hiring anyone in the near future great place to work to bad they dont have the funds to keep people around
good,The company is very supportive of the higher learning and continuous improvement which are staples of a strong quality organization.  The infrastructure defined is vast and offers many challenges that spotlight employees positive performance.
good,"Great company and culture. Luck of the draw on management. I work in the manufacturing facility, which can get monotonous at times, but I am able to cross-train a lot which helps keep you moving and creates more opportunities."
good,Working 4-10s is great! Management is pretty good overall.  As long as you show up to work and do your job you should fit in great here. They try to really woek with employees to help resolve any issues.
good,Family oriented goal focused organization that is growing leaps and bounds under the new merger. More recent efforts are more focused on change and a culture shift to support the synergies across the company.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the job was satisfying for many years. I had mixed feel8ng about leaving the position at the time but it was a good decision.
good,Working at L3 has been a good experience for me. They have a good training program and most of the trainers are very knowledgeable and patient.  The management is understanding of personal challenges and the need for time off.  The hangar is the best organized hangar I've worked in with good lighting over the engines. The break-room is nice with cable T.V. although a little cramped.
good,"L3 Harris is much like any other defense company.  Decent salary and benefits, average job security.  Don’t expect to make huge bonuses and pay increases."
good,"Worked daily to meet weekly schedules, family atmosphere everyone worked together at helping meet the companies goals."
good,"I enjoyed my years with L-3.  Salary and promotions based on performance solid. Performance Reviews changed in the past 5 years based on department max. Performance rating and not individual personal performance. The negative side is once an employee salary increases and years of service, you become vulnerable to layoffs."
good,Was a nice place. would work with you if need time off and other ways . We’re friendly in the office. Was will to help in many different ways just had to talk with them
good,"Decent work place however training program can be improved. Enjoyed being able to work in different locations/ work sites. Typical work environment, however relaxed in some ways."
good,Harris was a good job while it lasted but with the work slowing down they lay you off based on the work.  Some of the people there should have retired along time ago.
good,Very sensitive and top secret work environment with high emphasis on quick turnaround time to meet customer requirements.  Ample opportunity to grow though as quickly as possible.
good,a typical day at work for a shop floor controller is to go in review your schedule nd acquire all the necessary parts and material that are needed to supply to the mechanics and electricians. attend meetings to compare notes on where the program is and needs to be.
good,"very nice place to work, hectic at end of year though, Lots of room to advance. lots to learn. Depends on what you put into the company. not alot of standing around"

good,"Typical day at work was always very interactive. I learned how military aircrafts work. The management there was alright, it varied from team to team."
good,"At the L3 Technologies division in Greenville, TX, the purpose is clear - noble cause, do it for the troops. The long work hours and intensity pays off with the feeling of success. It is also a good place to have a long, fruitful career."
good,"A good place to work. Unfortunately, it was a Corporate decision to close the longtime facility in San Carlos. Too bad, a lot of people put in years of hard work just to all be laid off."
good,"The company appears to be well managed, and listens to the needs/desires of it's employees.  The regional VP seems to go the extra mile making himself visible at the location."
good,Overall everyone is focused on mission accomplishment and recognizes the critical nature of the work we were performing.  We had an excellent customer community and there were always new engineering challenges that had to be resolved.  Never a dull moment!
good,"Management knew their job well, treated employees fair, and salary was decent. Too bad the contract ended. The hardest part of the job was working in a hangar with no A/C. However the company di do their best to provide ample amount of fans around the hangar floor."
good,"The culture did not want outsiders from other cities other than people from Waco. Very unfriendly."
good,"The hardest part of the job was being on-call most of the time as I was the only technician in Northern Ohio. Also, had to flex my hours as many of the Maintenance requests were done at night. This caused sleeping problems and my hours were so irregular."
good,"Worked for the reset contract. Full 8 hours of hard work with standard 15, 30, 15 breaks. Do your job and there are no issues, lack in production and there will be."
good,"Normal contract environment with occasional opportunity for promotions. Great benefits, most managers were awesome to work with.  Family orientated  company."
good,Harris was great for my first job in the software development industry. I learned a lot about the entire SDLC and my managers were awesome. The projects can be boring.
good,"The job of Test Technician at L3 was pleasant. I liked my fellow co-workers. A lot of them were willing to help you with any technical problems. The job itself was not especially hard, but if you made mistakes the Lead Technician would let you know about. My Supervisor was a pleasant person to work for . Over all the job was pleasant and you got to work on many types of projects."
good,"I enjoyed working at L-3 MID. They have the usual problems that come with federal contracts, they come and go along with the requirement for employees. Management was well run with few exceptions. Difficult place to work as management with the schedule expectations and a union workforce that can be difficult to handle at times. The company seemed to hire too many inexperienced mechanics in time of need and expected the supervisors to have high output which is ridiculous.."
good,"A typical day at work includes and not limited to directing operations and product team in meeting both schedule and profit margins."
good,loved the people and benefits. coworkers friendly. Awesome HR person that knew all the answers to any questions. I am not able to type anymore just filling out space.
good,"It was an honor to work with all of the customers of Harris Corp's Public Safety and Professional Communications Division. Working with Police/Fire/Military is an honor and the Harris products directly contribute to the safety and efficiency of our first responders. The environment is primarily positive, and the pay and benefits are fair."
good,"Working in supply chain and purchasing requires compliance with FAR and DFAR regulations. The people and processes in place to assure this compliance are a joke. Overbearing, excessive control, personally belittling when not in compliance or an expert as they are."
good,"Has been a great company to work for but is relocating to Michigan. Offers plenty of overtime. Great benefits and vacation time. "
good,A fun place to work at with very good management. The work culture was very relaxed and the work was not stressful. I learnt how the corporate work culture is.
good,Liked working at L-3.  I had a great manager who was a great communicator.  He fostered training and supported us in taking classes to improve our skills
good,"Harris is a good place to work, but management does not allow for a large variety of design changes or improvements. Seem to be stuck in the ways of the 1980's."
good,"Overall Harris is a good company to work for and I met many great employees.  My particular manager unfortunately let their personal life challenges seep into work.  The physical work location for me was in Florida and although Harris had a diverse work force management and senior management was comprised of the ""good ole boy"" network."
good,LOVE THE WORK PLACE but there is no room to advance.  The is a pay raise but you will not move up unless there is a change in leadership. Don't get me wrong I love the job. I am school trained in logistics.

good,"It was a productive work place.  Some of the people were challenging to work with, but that is life.  I learned a lot. I I liked the 9/80 time off for the summer.  The time flexibility helped us with our work/life balance."
good,"Being able to learn Oracle and SAP, along with the military Property book system. Assisting the local nationals with being able to order the necessary supplies"
good,"L-3 is a decent Defense contractor.  They provide many jobs for folks with electronics backgrounds.  Good people to work for, excellent benefits, and good environment."
good,Good place to work but too relaxed in my opinion. They are very much in line with the U.S. government on being politically correct. They are nice people to work with and my supervisor was a good person to work for. The work load was low stress and they paid for my training so I could be IPC certified.
good,"Goods:"
good,"Working at L-3 was pretty good overall. The pay and benefits almost can't be beat. Your co-workers, managers, and directors care about you. The executives of the company seem to have overplayed their hand, because while I worked there, about 1/4 of the staff were laid off."
good,overall good place to work.  learned many different accounting functions.  can be a stressful place to work. good people to work with.  under new management.
good,"good people make a great company, I enjoy the company of my fellow employees.  They are a good bunch of people from diverse backgrounds. The experience levels and knowledge base of the employees is unmatched"
good,"Not enough work given over a month's time frame."

good,"L-3 overall is a great place to work. The company is well established which provides job security, and there are excellent benefits and perks that are offered."
good,"Harris is a great place to work. It re-introduced unlimited paid time off program, which is one of the most coveted employee benefits. The rest is fairly standard with the corporate culture."
good,"The company is very well establish in few market niches such as Weather Satellites, Air-Traffic systems, and moderate IT systems."
good,Worked at L-3 NSS for nearly 5 years and enjoyed the spirit of camaraderie and focus on the customer. Employees are extremely collaborative and highly skilled/educated. The company has an almost collegiate environment.
good,"The Senior Staff of this organization is very technically advanced, commending and aggressive in their industry. The serviceability and quality systems/products provided are state of the art. They take protecting our nation and borders very seriously. The Company is very passionate about personal growth and development of their people."
good,Great place to work.  The biggest issue is the silo each organization has built making it difficult to work issues across different departments and organizations.
good,Most of the requested information I could not explain without breaching corporate policy compliance or Classified work protocols.
good,My role as Executive Assistant was based on data entry. Updating software licenses using Excel and LANDesk along with searching for software prices. My supervisor was great to work with. I learned how to use LANDesk. The hardest part of the position was the drive.
good,"Productive, great co-workers"
good,"Great co-workers and a good ""can do"" culture. The pay was good for this area. New management didn't put much weight in past contribution only in what you did lately. However, the new management was increasing customer confidence which was leading to a solid turn-around."
good,"Provide professional HR guidance with employee relations, corrective and disciplinary actions. Provide assistance with on-boarding, new employee orientation, process new hire documents, data entry in HRIS, prepare correspondence. Maintain compliance with federal and state regulations."
good,"-Good benefits and work life balance, but confusing leadership hierarchy"
good,"Great company, enjoyed working for L-3 Communications. Great management, good benefits, quarterly company meeting to share information with all employees."
good,"Job security is poor due to the position being a contract position.  Overall the company was well led, with flexible hours."
good,Great place to work if you don't mined working with the Union and long hours without over time and comp time off is out of the question due to the Op Tempo. Constantly working on broken aircraft due to the amount of hours being flown.  A great group of people working together making the sift successful and watching New Army Pilots be successful learning a new skill. If there was one change to change or make better would be all of the overtime or some way to be able to have comp time off due to the 45-70 hours a week being worked.
good,"Pleasant work place with supportive co-workers and close attention to training to learn new technologies and keeping in touch with the old technology."
good,"I've been with Harris for 5 years now and I still enjoy coming to work.  I work with a group of great individuals and the work is engaging and challenging.  "
good,Company provides excellent benefits and excellent pay. The hardest part of this job was having to awaken really early to get in line to access entrance into the worksite.
good,"Difficult to get work assignments when first arrived. Need to take a lot of initiative and talk to a lot of people, but management was very helpful as well."
good,Very supportive management team.  Willing to assist to progress within the company.  Many programs in place to aid in professional growth  and development.
good,"Easy going and productive working area, people, teammates are very helpful. Manager, team leader are very supportive and striving to help you success."
good,Everyday a challenge. Lots of opportunity for self improvement and learning new skills. Good team players and supervisors. Latest technology. Never boring. Time went fast.
good,"Harris was a great company to work for.  the crew that I worked with was a tight knit crew, who liked working hard and having fun at the same time"
good,L-3 is an excellent company to work for. The job is good but the availability of advancement is pretty non-existent. They offer an amazing tuition reimbursement program however and would strongly suggest using it.
good,Great pace of work that made the day go by quickly. I learned that not all companies are Corporate America. Co workers were very helpful and nice.
good,Interaction with other engineers was very positive. Management understands pitfalls of engineering and realizes that issues do occur. They know that projects don't get done yesterday.
good,"Serious business atmosphere, good place to work but they are not hiring permanent positions which as a contractor I would prefer."
good,The compensation for the work we do is fair and competitive. The Engineers working at L-3 are some of the best I have ever worked with and have learned a lot from them.
good,"I learned new skills.  I would start the day washing airplanes.  Later learned to work tool room.  Hardest part of the job was washing planes in the cold."
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Harris Corporation. The management and overall environment are fantastic. My favorite part of the job is the people with which I work.
good,Have worked with L3 FOS for 13 years.  Was formerly known as KDI Precision Products.  Anyone would be lucky to have the opportunity to work there and support our military.
good,"(Military environment) so if you're looking for a quiet cubicle life, Stay away. Rapid pace environment. A lot of redundant, overlapping, and dated military doctrine which makes it a little difficult with Quality Control but its a learning process. Depending on which hangar you get plugged into, It seems to be a clash of old school vs new school. Meaning some management wants the job done properly and some wants the job done yesterday. There is room for advancement, but it depends on your desire. I've seen people get promoted to management and have done right by it. There are the select few that ruin it for everyone but what job doesn't. Advice, Learn doctrine, and always apply for the next step. Don""t allow how long you've been there to determine your desire to move forward."
good,A good transition from the military and I'm glad that it was this company.  Good management and people to work with
good,"Harris RFCD has a positive working environment, but PSPC is a ""numbers driven"" environment where company standards are not unilateral, and favoritism is evident."
good,"Small company where everyone can know everyone You are accountable for taking your breaks and lunch "
good,Benefits were good.  Payed for my gym membership.  People in general were good to work with.  Raises were pretty poor or no raise.
good,"As a senior technical writer, I was afforded the opportunity to travel with the Deputy Directors to many places which enabled me to show my writing talent and ability to provide support and customer service to a wide variety of customers."
good,It is too bad that they had a layoff due to lack of work.   The co-workers were very good to work with.    The work/life balance was good.
good,"Hard working and dedicated company/department.  Solid culture that is security minded"
good,"L-3 awarded me opportunities and was very understanding of my position as a single parent.  The hardest part of the job was the customer (US Army) support.  They often gave conflicting guidance, did not know what requirements they needed."
good,I worked remotely so I had little interaction with the company in general. But never had any problems while I worked there.
good,"While this is a good company to work for, there were a few inequality issues that sparked a union. A couple examples of inequality are pay and promotion."
good,L-3 is a great company to work for. Great people and great benefits.
good,The management of people and the organization of workload follows a typical work day for me.
good,Not a bad company to work for. Coworkers and management were nice and overall good people.
good,"A typical day at work is fast pace, high volume and this is a self managing position for the most part so you divide your time between your responsibilities"
good,"L-3 meets the Army's needs by overhauling UH-60 and AH-64 helicopters. Production moves smoothly and effectively. While working with L-3, meeting employees has been easy as well very useful knowledge of how to effectively perform my job well."
good,"I have worked for L-3 for 20 years, and have had a wonderful career.  Defense contractors in general are on the downswing."
good,I love working for Harris.  They are an excellent company with a bright future.  The people are excellent and the culture is awesome.  I have learned many skills
good,I generally like the company and the people who I work with but the way the current contract is set up is hard on my nerves.  It seems like every 6 months we were fighting for next years work.
good,"Learned a lot on a daily basis from all the senior engineers."
good,Empresa dedicada a los negocios corporativos. Buen clima laboral y buenos compañeros de trabajo. ofrece estabilidad laboral y buena empresa para dar sus comienzos en el área de telecomunicaciones
good,"Order Parts and Review Discrepancy Reports"
good,"I truly enjoyed my work there.  I learned quit a bit of the aerospace industry, including reading blue prints and used a variety of measuring devices and tools.  The management was sometimes unfamiliar with the jobs needing to be done.  Therefore they weren't of much assistance at times.  It was a very positive experience over all."
good,"M y job was demanding, but I enjoyed staying busy. I received a lot of knowledge  working in different departments at L-3. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people."
good,Good work environment and people. Turnover of key positions was too frequent.
good,"My job was very fast paced with deadlines to meet. "
good,This is like any big company. I enjoyed working with most. I could learn as much old or new technology as I wanted. It is a company you defiantly want to apply with.
good,With the company involved in Government Contracts in aviation most positions I held provided a sense of personal satisfaction that my work was needed and made a difference with our country's security.
good,the hardest part about the job was getting use to working in a military setting as a civilian. 80% of the employees are prior service so not having a rank structure was difficult for some. I believe that was the hardest adjustment.
good,OT always available but always the threat of a layoff due to all their eggs in one military basket. Love the people and the work.
good,I worked for a wholly-owned subsidiary of L-3.  We did lose benefits when the company was taken over but overall I would have to say L-3 was a good experience.
good,Great company to work for.  The benefits aren't too different than the other big firms.
good,"Great place to work, learn and grow. Good people and nice facility. I would go back in a heartbeat."
good,"Good place to work, People oriented, cares about you as an employee.   "
good,Quality personnel with a high level of commitment to performing the daily job functions
good,"worked as oracle-d2k developer"
good,"First class operation.  HR, payroll and benefits, all efficient and responsive and quick to straighten out any problems.  Pay is good and is fair at market rate.  Strong on training (depending on flexibility of client, of course).  Tendency, though, to cherrypick larger project employees for best training; smaller project teams are usually forgotten by headquarters.  Coworkers were closeknit and extremely competent.  "
good,"12 hr shifts, I got to work with and cross train with sheet metal and engine shops. I have several friends from this company. I enjoyed the cross training"
good,This company is very employee oriented when it comes to training and safety measures throughout the plant.  There are very strict governmental requirements which are carried out with all safety features intact.  All areas of your work is professionally inspected.  The hardest part of the job was the travel each day from my house.
good,"Thriving corporation with great core values, however compensation could be alot better"
good,"L-3 gave me opportunities to learn many different aspects of government contracting from accounting, supply chain management, asset management, integration, staffing to Project management. It is a good company with good benefits."
good,"A typical day of work involved reviewing product specifications, writing technical documents, testing and troubleshooting product, and suggesting product improvement."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is the vast variety of technology available. Worst part is dealing with government financial instability.
good,Everyday was a combination of tasks. After having been in IT for many years I learned how an end-user actually utilized the software I'd written. Management was a little distant. The site I worked at only had three other employees.
good,Typical Day:
good,Productive workplace with good balance between fun and productivity. Co-workers are respectful of each other; always willing to help out for the overall good of the company. Loved what I did which made the workplace enjoyable for the 9 plus hours spent there.
good,The overall company is great. I would love to work for Harris in the future.
good,"As with any defense contractor company, the days were at times tense but generally rewarding at the same time. I was given the opportunity to learn & allowed to excel in my field. Management was generally genuine in wanting to ""be all things to everyone"". Staff was very friendly and always offering to lend a hand where they could. Uncertainty of contracting employment caused insecurities of the future. For the most part, I enjoyed the acknowledgement of jobs well done."
good,fixed NVG'S and learned a lot about electronics. Never met a better group of guys to work with.
good,"Generally create course ware for Navy and Marine Corp. Positive working conditions, management is pro-active."
good,Each day was focused on the specific task at hand and all managers were driven to succeed with the end goal in sight. Management allowed the initiative required to accomplish each objective. Most difficult part of the assignments was the coordination with cost analysts and pricing specialists. The most enjoyable aspects of the job were interfacing with the other employees and being able to achieve a common mission.
good,Good People and Good Environment
good,You work around a lot of very smart people and interesting systems.
good,"A typical day at work starts with a review of current in-process inspection activities at the various work stations(Printed Wiring Boards, Mil-Spec, Cables, Electrical, XRF, Counterfeit Parts, Hi-Reliability Hardware, Work Orders, Complex Mechanical Inspection, Chemicals, and lastly CMM Inspection). Constraints are identified and are assigned to inspectors. Current throughput metrics are then communicated to the department manager. At this point it is time to begin programming routines for CMM inspection. Throughout the day, there can be numerous interruptions that require me to assist the team, customers(internal & external), Mechanical and Quality Engineering, Engineering Support and Make-Ready personnel in any issues that arise. The hardest part of the job is the amount of mental drain one feels at the end of the day. The most rewarding part of the job is modernizing inspection techniques, streamlining processes."
good,L-3 Communications is a typical belt-way bandit. There are no advancement opportunities because you are hired for one specific position on the contract. Training is not available unless the customer decides it is necessary. Management is often untrained and not prepared to deal with people issues from the top or the bottom.
good,Challenging work environment with great co-workers. I have had many years at this company and i have enjoyed the people i work with most of all
good,Job welcomed veterans that made it easy to transition. Work hours were great.
good,Excellent opportunity. The work atmosphere was relaxed professional and enjoyable
good,"Good place to work, mostly laid back atmosphere, easy to get lost in the shuffle if you're not a type-a person. Poor talent management."
good,L-3 Communications is a good employer. Most friendly environment. Learned alot extra computer skills from different people. Would highly recommend employment here.
good,12hr days every day working over sea with the army. hardest part was never knowing if you where going to get hit by a bomb or a bullet.
good,The supervisor and lead were very good on the shop floor and knew the work needed to be done and what it all entailed to complete. I like the Miller welding machine and it worked great all the time as I put many hours on it doing the work. I learned how to weld aluminum and stainless steel. Also I learned how to use the arc spot welder. I learned about sheetmetal fabrication in bending metal besides the welding side of it. The hardest was trying to weld brass or bronze with GTAW. I learned alot about brazing using silver solder for the wave guides.
good,"Good supervisor, learned a lot more about Excel, Everyone was nice to work with,"
good,"Solid company with good benefits and pay. As with many companies, systems were not well integrated and each business unit was allowed to run their current applications. My management experience was not particularly good, but I'm sure this was an isolated situation. Overall, above average with good work/life balance and typically a 9/80 work schedule."
good,"building coordinatior, ground maintence,."
good,This was a great place to work. The only issue i had with this company was that there was no growth opportunity. When i first started with the company i thought i would have great potential to grow so i was disappointed in that area
good,"Was a good company to work for, learned from more experienced employees. Management was ok, could have been better.  There is opportunity for advancement."
good,Still working there in 2006 as aircraft Mechanic doing jobs dusties as a mechanic on airplanes. The knowing how pull up prints to do job and T PS Requirements on how to complete job and look up T.O special requirements how and what to do to complete the w/o. You have to inspect the job after complete for government requirements
good,L3 offered me the opportunity to learn many different aspects of my job. It allowed to grow in knowledge and to achieve in areas would have not been exposed to before.
good,"Diversity, Job culture, and work and life balance are L3harris high priorities. Highly respect to senior employees, job rotation, and summer flexible hours are the best at L3harris"
good,"First and foremost, I love my job at L3Harris. The work is challenging, and there are plenty of processes to fix and improve, so it never gets stagnant. I work with a great team of technicians who are hard working and eager to go above and beyond, which makes my job a little bit easier. The day to day changes constantly, working on different pieces of equipment that vary in complexity and design. Unfortunately, career advancement and compensation for going above and beyond is non-existent. I advanced 3 levels in my time there, and absorbed and performed the duties of two others who were above me, as well as one of my peers, and never saw a dime for it."
good,"As in most corporate culture, you are just a number, which can  be a good thing, depending on what you're looking for in a company.  It's very difficult to stand out in a positive light and hard work is seldom rewarded.  If you're looking for job security, go here!  Once you're in, YOU'RE IN!  They are thorough in the their hiring process, but it's because they need highly skilled and competent people to match the current environment.  Overall, it's a good place to work.  I enjoy it very much- more so than other places I've worked recently."
good,"I have been working for the company for about 4 years and seen many people leaving the company. I was thinking about the same until I talked to someone that showed me that each project at this company is completely different from each other and you have the chance to change from one program to another to find the one you like to work at. the only downside to this program is that if you transfer from one program to another, you lose the accumulated experience and have to start almost like you just got hired to the company and will take time to get back to a position where you can be evaluated for promotion."
good,One of the best things about working there is that I know I am contributing to making the world a safer place. To know that the quality of workmanship I put in is appreciated by our armed forces.
good,Excellent company with bright future and growing niche of technologies and services. Good benefits- better than most. But some antiquated culture issues that sometimes make for a challenging work environment. Too many layers of management can slow things down.
good,"L3 is a great company to work for, they tried very hard to keep us all on but the contract was under bid almost a 400,000 dollars.  The company does a great job of creating an atmosphere of caring.  They have great compensation.  They provide lots of great benefits and have a fantastic PTO policy."
good,"Worked for some great people and loved the challenge.  Unfortunately the 7,000+ people left after some actions of the division president.  Wonderful people and genuine passion and positive attitude with a significant majority of personnel.  Had a LOT of travel but loved the challenges.  Would recommend company but you got what you put into it.  Learned a lot and felt blessed to work with some amazing people."
good,"Log onto computer for the most resent job to be done , check potting material for over due dates . Help out in any other area that might be behind schedule. Check on all equipment and make sure all in in working order..Terminated cables for Dipping arrays and Test for continuity . Helped worked on Towed sonar arrays . also Helped train personnel . soldered cables for termination. Was J-Standerd  certified ."
good,Good place to learn so you can move up in better companies later.  Too much micro managing.   Management should trust employees more.  Cutting back on benefits will not inspire people to work harder.
good,A typical day with l3 would be troubleshooting down motion sensors and tactical and ptz cameras installation of alarm perimeter security on military installations.
good,It was a great place to work. We were very dependent on the Military Contracts though. It has a great potential for a layoff but overall it was a good work experience. The hardest part of the job was the twelve hour night shift
good,Start early and stay late.  Managers push you to make them look good then act like the really care until the next crunch time and they leave early and want you to work the weekend.
good,"The work was interesting and challenging. My skill-sets developed beyond what they had been before my employment at L3 Technologies, and skill-sets that had languished at my prior place of employment came to the forefront on a daily basis and were renewed. I became familiar with terms and concepts integral to LASER and RF technologies, i.e. fiber-optic alignment, the use of the term dBm as a measure of optical power and the application of micro-assembly in addition to my skills as an electro-mechanical assembler proficient in, wiring, crimping and precision mechanical assembly. "
good,Worked with group contracted to US Army/US Marine Corps providing Arabic linguists and role players supporting Army and Marine Corps pre-deployement training. Contact was lost on recompete to another company. Not much specific knowledge of L3 as a company.
good,Working in the ever changing aerospace field was very challenging  handling multiple deadlines and contract guidelines.  Always kept you focused and on your toes.   Required lots of overtime due to dealing with people in various countries.
good,This is a real professional place to work. The balance between work and life is lacking. I like the 401 K plan and all the other benefits. The yearly bonuses were a plus.
good,Offers opportunity for advancement. The job pays well  but their Union needs some improvement. There are lots of positions for you to transfer to if that's what you choose.
good,"""good ole boy"" system applies here. It is possible to move up within the company, but you have to work extra hard as brothers, sisters, friends, and other members of managements family get first picks on new opportunities."
good,"Worked in a field office, culture & pace was good. I did work for them for two years and am interested in moving on only because there is a lack of work, and think it is better to find another job than get laid off."
good,"L3 Technologies SDS Cargo Division is, unlike that of the main part of the SDS branch in Woburn, located in Haverhill, in a hanger/office used for testing the cargo products, manufacturing, and keeping that team together. As such, there is a feeling of isolation associated with the team compared to the rest of the company. Any back and forth between Cargo and the rest of SDS is almost entirely electronic, and a trip to Woburn takes a good chunk out of ones day or schedule. That said, the work done for Cargo is not hard, and had a good sense of fulfillment in what is being made, and how it is being implemented. The Cargo team is a fantastic group of individuals that are great to work with, and the small sub community that forms from being at this sister plant allows for a closer knit workplace group."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Harris.  The people were very nice and accommodating.  The work was tough but the people were great.  Very friendly and helpful.
good,"Work environment is positive mostly and it does offer many benefits. However, the location in Arlington is next to Six Flaggs, Ranger Ballpark, and the AT&T Stadium. It has made the commute from Fort Worth/Burleson area unbearable. My team did not allow for telecommuting therefore, work/life flexibility became compromised. If you live near the facility then its great. If you live anywhere outside of Arlington plan to be in your car for at least 2 hours every day. As a Mom I don't have that kind of time to give up."
good,Great Place To Work. Was good till the end in San Carlos.All great people. Good working hours Plenty of Overtime.. All nice team memberse. All very helpful.
good,"A typical day involves configuring routers, switches, hubs and other equipment. Opening/Closing tickets and engaging the customer. I am learning many techniques/proceedures---I'm studying for the CCNA test as well as CISSP. The management is good as well as the culture. The hardest part of the job is the pressure to produce on the fly, the most enjoyable is completing a fix action that restores the customers service."
good,I was a HR Intern and everyone was so welcoming. Management was nice and were willing to work with me while I learned areas in the HR field. I enjoyed the ability to learn daily without the stress.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty busy but remains enjoyable. There are many ways to pass down information to to the lower level employees. The hardest part of the job is the intense schedule, but is the a issue in most Engineering positions."
good,A lot of the employees here have been here over 20 years.  Most off the time the work is not overly stressful.   Harris builds the stuff everyones will need in ten years.
good,"Daily analysis of program data, reconciliations, budgeting, financial review. Pleasant work environment.  Employee activities.  Clean, quiet atmosphere"
good,"work for several years in different dept.under various management would still be growing with the company but our facility was phase out"
good,"Fun working environment, challenging and stressful most of the time. Fast pace time sensitive and unpredictability environment, some coworkers are nice but the boss are not."
good,"My time at L-3 started with long hours and a large work load. As the work load reduced the hours did also. The management was very helpful whenever time off was required or needed."
good,L-3 was a great company in terms of doing a lot to take care of their employees.  It was a little slow-paced at times because of heavy governmental regulation.
good,"A typical day is spent auditing paperwork, documenting historical data, assisting mechanics with procedures, inspecting maintenance actions and enforcing company policies and procedures."
good,A day at work was good. I learned about the process of organizing parts and the steps to use to do and succeed at the job. management was decent......
good,J'aime la culture de cette entreprise et j'aurais bien aimé avoir l'opportunité d'obtenir un emploi permanent pendant la durée de mon contrat.  L'avantage d'avoir été à contrat  cela m'a permis de toucher à plus d'un mandat et de me faire connaitre de mon entourage.
good,L3 is truly a great place to work.  It's exciting due to the various customers they support and capabilities they have.  They promote from within and are consistently working to improve processes and make the company the best it can be.
good,"Great military employer, especially when drilling reserve members are deployed. Job security exists in most divisions. Good group of people with same goals and visions in mind."
good,"An engineering centric company in the defense industry. This is a focused, unspectacular company very good at what it does. Solid and steady are the words that describe the company and most employees."
good,I loved my time as a security analyst for this company while it had its contract with DISA. Due to family reasons I did not extend my contract with the new company that gained the contract. If you ever get the opportunity to work in the position I filled you should take it and hold on with both hands it was great.
good,It was fast paced days at work and good pay. Management was a little more to be desired but were good to work for. I enjoyed working with the customers and planning the parts for the different customers..
good,"The first five years I had no complaints.  Hard work, honest pay.  The last five years, the company started hemorrhaging jobs to the point where it made local front-page news. "
good,Enjoyable place to work with a great group of team mates. a person's past experience is taken in to account for new opportunities. Employees are encouraged to think outside the box for new innovations.
good,"Very good administrative support and benefits package. Solid leadership. Worked for a great immediate supervisor! "
good,"Supervise a 3 member team responsible for nationwide internet recruiting. Develop efficient, cyber-based, internet recruiting team for the US Army. Specialize in recruiting health care professionals for the US Army. Create nationwide lead-tracking system. Develop ten company recruiting contract (with team). Interview new hires, conduct skills assessment tests, develop training, and testing program for new hires."
good,I worked here for over 7 years.  They are a solid employer.  There is ample opportunity for advancement within the company.  They are reputable within the industry.
good,"Good place to work, but very slow with pay raises. Management "
good,"When I worked at L3 in Waco,TX O always had plenty of work. The last year I was there the work slowly dried up and management didn't get any contracts in so I was eventually  laid off. L3 in Crestview.FL was the best place I've ever worked. Plenty of work and great people and management. I works there 8 years but do to family problems I left L3 Crastview"
good,"As a Manufacturing Engineer at Harris you are the problem solver for most of the operations issues that arise. Doesn't matter if it is a planning issue, purchasing issue, management issue, or engineering issue, the manufacturing engineers are always the liaison and are usually tasked with coming to a solution. This has its pros and cons, job security but makes the scope of the job position expand easily. There is plenty of day to day firefighting but still time for strategic projects and kaizens. Workplace culture is good but the company is money hungry and put a lot of pressure on their employees to get orders out the door."
good,"Each division operates a little differently. There are some great divisions in L3 and there are some ""ok"" divisions in L3. I worked for an ""ok"" one. Management is all over the place with direction and employees were constantly confused on priorities, responsibilities and who they reported to. Company personnel changed greatly over a 5 year period with 4 major layoff, along with high level employees (directors, program managers, etc) routinely leaving for positions (sometimes better and sometimes lateral) at other companies. Engineers strived at the division I worked at while other professions suffered."
good,"assembled parts on boards while listening to music, talking to co-workers or supervisor.inspecting parts on boards or radios to make sure they met all of our standards"
good,"Good company to work for, it has a union but job security depends on contracts. It helped me learn mechanical skills and working hand to hand with others made it fun."
good,"This summary will not include overseas assignments."
good,"This company is great to work for.  The benefits are good."
good,My supervisor was outstanding. Very knowledge able and down to earth. She understood that I didn't know everything. Great first experience!
good,"Only worked for Level 3 for 10 months after acquisition. Managed transition physical security programs and systems programs during decommissioning of Genuity Solutions and was, with foreknowledge, laid off after transition was complete. Was always treated with respect during transition period."
good,"J'ai beaucoup appris sur l'aéronautique parce qu'avant j'étais dans le domaine du moule."
good,Solid company to work for. I have advanced to lead technician since starting back in August of 2001 as an technician. Learning more technical and leadership skils.
good,"Considering my education and lack of degrees, this company gave me a lot of different ways to learn new things and respected my opinion and just kept me growing in the company."
good,"Work days were generally enjoyable and my co-workers felt like friends as they were team players. Management were astute and able to answer questions or concerns in a timely manner. "
good,"Its a good place to work. The people you work with are awesome. Not to many days over 8 hours. Management is OK, they do what they have to do."
good,A good place to start off in the assembly/manufacturing field. Great place to learn about a lot of electrical/mechanical assembly skills. There is a small hitch in the temp to hire process do to lack of communication between the company and temp agency over pay and hiring processes to the employee.
good,All around excellent company to work for. From management to taking care of us during travel they were great. I've work for multiple contractors and they were one of the best.
good,"I was able to work in two different positions, while at L-3 Cincinnati Electronics.  One gave me good experience with the latest test equipment and techniques, while the other provided me opportunity to directly interact with people in many areas of the plant. "
good,"Good People, Management, benefits and work/life balance, 9/80 schedule options - every other Friday off, good training options, average raises for DoD contracting"
good,"Times are really slow in this industry."
good,Awesome people to work for and benefits are pretty nice.  Tough to get into the company due to it being competitive but once you are in promotion opportunities are there.  Easy to refer people you know to positions in the company too.  A little bit of work place drama but not out of control as most people are super nice and work together really well.  Every exec. and superior I met were awesome people and were very personable.  As long as you have a positive personality it is a great place to work.
good,The management was all about building a team from within. The staff was great to work with and it was a great experience. They drove you to acquire certifications and elevate your technical acumen.
good,"No growth, but good place to work.  Only one major contract which was with DND.  Company had a hard time seeing outside the box.  Stuck on trying to make savings and not looking to the future with R&D."
good,"L-3 has great options for benefits, and offers flexible schedules with very reasonable time-off considerations. The products are interesting, and the work is fast paced. Lots of change/development. Many opportunities to learn different skills."
good,"Proactively finding human errors brought on by others and getting them corrected before final processing or payout occurs.  "
good,great company if you can find your right fit.  great benefits  based on the management there were issues of lack of communication when processing security applciations.
good,"Great people, great management, doing great work for their clients.  NSS, the division I work for, was just acquired by CACI, so we're in a but of transition."
good,Management and team memmber alike communicate very effectively. A pleaure to join such an advanced team of professionals. On the job knowledge transfer and skills. Everyone was willing to help each other no matter any situation.
good,"Depending on your work area you may lots of freedom as to your hours. Most of the time I did not have to request days off weeks ahead, sometimes 24 hours was good enough."
good,"The division I work for has allowed me to work across many departments and on a level that would not be possible while working for most large companies.  This experience has allowed me to expand my knowledge and experience very quickly considering the amount of time I have been with the company.  While this is great for establishing experience and knowledge, it also means late nights and jumping in to do the dirty work.  However, it is this demand for dynamic employees creates amazing camaraderie and joint efforts across all levels or employees, entry level to upper management."
good,The only real issue I ever had was management never crosstrained the support staff. When one person left there was a major hole and things were misplaced and not finished in a timely manner.
good,advancement opportunities are very limited with little management interaction. the lack of opportunity to advance ones career made it difficult to remain motivated.
good,"Personally, I really liked the benefits offered by this defense contractor. However, take this with a grain of salt, since this was my first job out of college. "
good,Fun to work environment. Management is supportive and approachable. Some red tape and politics which is normal and tolerable. Place is clean and very professional set-up. Focused on quality and  continuous improvement. A place to belong.
good,Great job with terrific pay and benefits. Location wasn't great and advancement was nearly non-existent. If you moved this job to a better location t would be tough to leave.
good,"Enjoyed working with L-3 even if I was only there for less than 1 yr. Great pay, location, and benefits package. Would have liked to have been with them for more that just one contract."
good,"Productive fun , Hard long days sometime but felt like part of a team.I learned a lot and was a good experience.Good benefits and company cook outs."
good,I would have to say was the team of workers I had to deal with on a daily basis. We all strived to provide our customer's with the best quality product possible. It was a total team effort from the assembly thru the final quality buy off.
good,Navy contract keeps veterans in a sense of service.  CBA benefits are good and atmosphere is outstanding.  With such job security people stay for a lifetime which stops majority of advancement possibilities
good,"I learned several things while working for L3 on the base. I learned to lubricate aircraft gears, check for damage and corrosion in the components, and I also learned how to operate industrial machinery. All of which I just mentioned above were things that I didn't know how to do prior to my employment. These things that I learned, were taught to me on the job. Management was good in being concerned about our safety and making sure we knew all the safety regulations as well as ensuring we had all of our protective equipment. I enjoyed how co-workers of mine would work as a team to complete all our tasks, and we would help each other out with things the other didn't know or was unsure about. The job we did was not hard but repetitive, to me that actually is a good thing because you can really get familiar with the trades or things that you're working on. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be learning how to do new trades and tasks that I did not know how to do before i was hired for the company."
good,"At L3 aeromet I helped the IT team rebuild computers and solved internal customer issues. Also I set up end devices (PCs, print devices, etc) for the employees."
good,"L-3 is a great company, just attempting to build their shared services between the 86 different companies.  This leads to uncertainty about policy and procedures, however, you get to be part of the solution that is being build, instead of just a user of others thoughts."
good,"For almost 11 years, L-3 was a great company to work for. Sadly, they did not win the LISC contract at VAFB, CA. It's too bad they do not have any divisions in the area to work for."
good,"I  was promoted several times over the last five years.  The work is challenging.  Compensation is good, time off is great, health care plans aren't the best.  Generally the people that work here care about what they do and do their very best day in and day out.  TCS was a very successful small business that was purchased by L-3.  They have maintained their small business atmosphere but that is eroding as more and more corporate directives remove the local authority and decision making.  Leadership changes have led to a change in culture and a movement away from customer focus to inward management focus."
good,Good work environment.  Company has government contracts and the typical red tape associated with working with the government.  A good company for an individual looking for a long lasting career.
good,Fairly good place to work. Errors are attempted to be understood instead of quickly laying blame and moving on. Worker class folks are pretty friendly and want to do their job well.
good,I enjoyed working for L-3 the environment was some what laid back for a defense contractor. People were friendly and I did not have any job security concerns.
good,A typical work day would be us serving our country and making work easier for the war fighters.
good,"L3 is run professionally, with strict adherence to DoD compliance requirements.   If you want to travel, they will oblige you.  Variety of positions available, and they compensate very fairly. "
good,"The facility was unique in the fact that design and assembly took place under the same roof.  A part could be designed in one wing, and soon witnessed as a real piece in conjunction with the other components."
good,Enjoying reviewing different manuals and finding the problems before the customer. It also provides the warfighter with much needed data.
good,Management at L-3 was good with decent communication.  Company invested and valued its employees.  Turnover was pretty low since the company compensated well and provided advancement opportunities.
good,"Great place to work, but to slow paced for me. Awesome insurance and 401K."
good,"A typical day of work would be, checking a queue of trouble tickets and applying my technical knowledge to resolve them as quickly as possible while keeping the ticket well documented for internal purposes and with notes destined to the affected customer. Report network issues to third parties and involve their escalation tiers as necessary. Coordinating technical dispatch to customer sites or company's telecommunication nodes. Attend to meetings with customer to discuss the network monthly performance. "
good,"Very good work environment and salaries are paid for top performers amount of office politics is acceptable .  The acc ess to ISO rewards offered to top performers that can be ~$100,000--but you have to ask or demand."
good,government contracted work. industrial machining environment.
good,The site has a need for some strong management to be more productive.  There are a number of problems that are not being addressed and consequently I am looking for another position.  I am currently work with 62K lines of C software with no documentation and I can not contact the originator with any questions.
good,"I was a contractor from out of state.  Everyone that I met or dealt with was very pleasant.  They had a good company culture.  I worked in a Microsoft environment.  I had the freedom to figure out how to do my job and the freedom to vary my work hours.  I met with my manager about 3 times a week to see if I was doing what he wanted, the way he wanted.  I finished on time and in budget."
good,"it's a great place to work, provides good benefits and co workers are very pleasant"
good,This job can teach you a lot if you are willing to learn and you get in touch with the right people. L-3 offers a variety of positions working with a diverse range of peoples.
good,Worked seven days a week for 12 hours a da in a deployed environment. The company was very supportive until it came time to help getting hired after the deployment was over.
good,"Great place to work. I was a Network Technician in the Managed Services division. The things that the techs get to do there is basically operations engineering level. I worked on some pretty cool stuff. Network is Juniper, Cisco, and Alcatel mostly. Techs get to work on the PE devices as well as the CE Cisco and Juniper devices. I got a ton of exp there in a very short time as they give you lots of freedom as long as you don't mess anything up. You are not really on call much unless you ask for it. This doesn't include emergency situations like huge floods, and earthquakes which take down major parts of the network. Benefits are outstanding, including Vaca. You can move up to design, provisioning, engineering. Some fello technicians are complainers and bicker constantly as they will always be technicians, but are sick of being technicians. Other techs want and are working to move up. The group is mixed between these two. I liked it alot. The only down site is the group is very customer facing, and the clients disrupt troubleshooting continually during the day with their many phone calls. Sometimes though you can keep them on and troubleshoot their issue on the fly, but not all the time as you have a quota. "
good,"Great company which allows new Network Engineers a place to polish their skill set, and learn many more."
good,a good place to work. good management. i only work as a contract here for a few months so i dont have much to say about the company except it seems like a good place to work.

Landing gear removal and replacement. Conduct system operational checks and minor avionics duties. Engine removal, replacement, and associated required maintenance to include rigging and engine run-ups .Propeller removal, replacement, rigging, operational checks, and general maintenance as required.APU installation, preservation, de-preservation, and scheduled inspections .Aircraft jacking and shoring."
good,Nothing is organized and they throw you to the wolves once you're hired.  Training is not the greatest.
good,I love my job here but am just a contractor.  They are a large defense contractor and they have a great culture within.  They have a great benefits package and most people have a long tenure.
good,The job was cool and hard a little but over all nice job to go to with benefits.
good,A very positive working environment.  People are honest and alwayys willing to assist.  A very customer oriented environment.
good,"I was hired 8 1/2 years ago for a position with the Vice-President of Engineering.  I loved my company from the beginning as the people that I worked with and the company as a whole was a great place to work.  There were many perks including increased Personal Time and Vacation time earned, amongst other things.  I made many friends there and for the most part enjoyed getting up every day to go to work.  The hardest part of the job was it was definitely a top-heavy good old boys club where there was more VPs and Directors than worker-bees, and as long as they got there bonus's, all was right in their world.  Now that they have had a 25% layoff of mostly worker-bees, you wonder how the work is going to get done."
good,"You live where you work 11 months a year. You were paid well for it until recently, and you usually never got fired unless you really really deserved it. The company has a tendancy to hire anyone they can."
good,Strenuous work that keeps you active and on your toes. Co-workers were mostly former military and it was a perfect job to transition back to civilian life. Hardest part of the job was loss of life due to equipment failure. Most enjoyable part of the job was satisfaction achieved with every successful completed flight.
good,"Start at 9 am and finish at 5pm. Improved my work in company. I managed 12 peoples. Contact with china, Pakistan, India..."
good,"Great contract position. Work is steady, people are willing to lend a hand when in need."
good,Usually a busy day at the office.  The day goes by fast.  Managers and co-workers are helpful with any issues that arise. Excellent benefits.
good,"I always had a to-do list along with short and long terms goals. We would meet as a team to confirm our progress and or concerns. The manager was on top of the teams leaders and the team leaders where great at dividing the work load out."
good,Everything about this L3 was good.  The only down side was it was a contract job and they lost it to AECOM.
good,Very faced paced assembly operations. Strict schedule requirements.
good,It was a great place to work. It is too bad that too many expensive decisions came due during the political parties battle with each other.
good,"This is a great company to work for, and they are very family oriented as well. You will receive excellent exposure to a variety of helpful topics for the future."
good,"Good people, good management, very busy. Most of the design involve using COTs technology for fast development &  integrating with aircraft avionics."
good,"Review and edit power point slides and training materials for classes"
good,"Reviewing Technical Manuals"
good,"L-3 is a great paying employer with excellent benefits for this area. A typical week is M-F 10 hours a day with overtime available on Friday and Sat. from time to time. 1st shift is usually 0445 until 3:15 pm, second shift is from 3 pm until 0130 am. A weekend shift is also available in some sections which runs Friday thru sunday 12 hours a day. The shift differential equals out to a 40 hour work week pay scale."
good,"L-3 in Salt Lake is a huge place with lots of employees. The environment is rather relaxed."
good,"There were a lot of transitions in the Financial Department that cannot be discussed but what is public is that in 1999 Harris Corporation went from individual Financial Departments in the divisions, to a Global Shared Service, and throughout the years the company has had many changes which is natural for growth, they have lowered the  head count. have had management changes, process changes and metric changes. This all effects the individual and that is why I am back in the career market. I worked numerous positions throughout the years, Account Analysis, Journal entries, Inter Billing System (IBS), Data Entry, Non Po Entry, Wire Transfers, my greatest pleasure is the people I have worked with and the Team I left behind and how we all worked together to reach the goals that was set by management."
good,"Review jobs--schedule those which are due first--requires project management."
good,"I was laid off, but I still like the company and people. Good experience. "
good,A typical day at work consisted of plenty of analysis work and a feeling that tasking was being completed.  I learned how to use different types of databases and how important it was to keep data up to date.  Management usually looked out for their employees.  My co-workers were easy going and easy to get a long with and everyone helped each other when tasking called for it.  The hardest part of the job was having to sit in front of three computers all day and ensuring tasking was done correctly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that what I was doing was helping the United States Navy.
good,"They provided a lot of work experience in a variety of ways. I was kept busy with documentation, testing, and research. Most, if not all, of the people were understanding, caring, and hard working. I found it relatively easy to work with people rather than being forced to work around them."
good,Advanced skills in SONET/Routing
good,I love working with my team. Everyday I learn something new and have the ability to work in other areas to expand my knowledge and experience.
good,"L-3 is a great company to work for, however, like most companies, there are some issues. In my specific workplace, there is little room for advancement, and any advancement is based on the customer's decision."
good,"To receive parts and inventory them,issue them to the mechanic,everyone gets along .The hardest part of the joob was in the winter ause the connex didn,t have heater."
good,Good leadership on the corporate level. Talented individual team members on the local level
good,Excellent company whose current successes with very large (multi billion dollar) government agencies.
good,working hard to meet deadlines.working with a good team .made working there a good place.and enjoying what i did.
good,they've got good training skill
good,"L-3 Communications is a great company to work for. The hourly compensation is awesome, even for jobs that don't require degrees (electronics technician). I felt that my hard work was always appreciated by my supervisors."
good,Hired as a new grad from UCF so had the opportunity to rotate through positions almost every year gaining a broad knowledge of the business. Expanded my excel skill set and learned Earned Value Management with Deltek MPM software.
good,this company is great if you are single or available to move when contract is up - which happens every couple of years. the shifts are tough - 12-hours or longer - and change often to nights and or different days. overall a good company - just tough for a family man.
good,Enjoyed my 24yrs. with the company. Had the best co-workers. it was a great place to work and learn.
good,"L-3 is a excellent company to grow with. Entering at entry level, there will be many opportunities for growth & advancement. Managment structure is not well planned, too many upper level managers and not enough worker bees to complete orders."
good,"I developed interactive learning material for the military using Adobe Flash. I furthered my knowledge of Flash and Actionscript 1, 2, and 3."
good,"L3 was a great employer to work for and with!! They lost the contract to affordable engineering at our usaf installation and things were never the same after that. Management seemed to care about their employees and co-workers also seemed to be motivated.The most difficult part of the job, was the uncertainty of whether the contract would be renewed,etc."
good,"Overall, this is a very good company to work for. The company continually invests in the traing of personnel on new and old products to sustain a positive and productive service call flow."
good,"I started working with the night vision branch of L-3 4 years ago. After budget cuts, buy-outs, etc. it has had to go through an immense reduction in force which has caused the atmosphere to be tense for the most part. In general, it was a wonderful company to work for and I love my management."
good,"All in all L-3 has been a great employer to work for; my division at least. Good benefits, good pay, treated like an adult and human being, trusted with many responsibilites, and boss leaves you alone as long as work is getting done effectively. My only complaint is having a lack of social/personal life. As a single dad it has been very hard to get my children to school and such, as well as plan things in the evenings, due to a demanding on-call schedule and mandatory immediate response time. Ideal for a single person."
good,Good conpany. Great people.
good,"I worked both in a business development office and on a large govenment program. I learned alot of things on the programs and people working on the program and with other individuals. We went from awarding the contract to working the project, working closely with the customers and handling all the detailed work involved. Good working environment and chances to promote."
good,Management gets involved.
good,Work in the electronics industry designing radios and modems
good,Great experience for a young college graduate whose just starting out.
good,"Great training program with this company, Speed is not as important as getting the job done correct the first time."

good,Recommend Harris to anyone looking for opportunities and challenging work.  Numerous programs currently held with chances to move around and develop your skill set.
good,I like the job and the people are easy to work with. The company has growth potential and has interesting products. I would recommend this job because of the fair pay and positive atmosphere.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at L3. Plenty to do, a good commute, supportive team. I learned a lot. L3 merged with another company, and things changed"
good,Very friendly people to work with. Sometimes overtime and weekend work is required. Management open to help and work with you. Multitasking is a big part of the work.
good,Nice company to work for making cutting edge technology there is good pay and long hours 12 hour days 3 days on then 4 days on making night vision goggle for military
good,Everyone is very friendly and I believe that all employees put there best foot foward. We have a new ceo and he is the best. I've never seen such a friendly person. I believe centra is a stepping stone for the younger GENERATION and the older employees are their to stay.
good,"Great place to work.  R&D work was interesting cutting edge and intellectually rewarding.  The culture was great. Great people to work with."
good,"I started with L-3 in 1999 back when it was Raythoen E-Systems as a senior mechanical engineer,  I retired from L-3 with a pension,  great company.  worked my way up the ladder to eventually become the chief engineer for navy programs.  My manager was a super person never once holding me back from advancing,  I spent many years with Lockheed and feel L-3 is a much better place to work plus I love the area."
good,"Depends what type of job you are assigned to do, they are willing to cross-train you if you want to. Great people to work with, you have to stand up most of the time when you are working."
good,"I went to work, did the work, then went home after work.  Some travel  was required locally and out of state. Training was provided both formally and OJT."
good,"Good place to work, good co-workers. Location is good. Process optimization is a priority. Managers listen to good ideas. Many advancement opportunities."
good,"I find working at L3Harris enjoyable. The work is challenging enough and there is due recognition for contributions. Co workers, supervisor, leadership are understanding and very co-operative "
good,"Typically a very laid back environment, except during the busy seasons. You can learn a lot, but you'll need to put in the extra effort since the deadlines don't always allow you to grasp the work as well as you should. However, in the off season there are definitely good colleagues and managers that can help broaden your understanding of the tasks performed."
good,"Fast-paced, exciting place to work developing cutting edge technologies. Very collaborative environment where senior management works with and for the employees ensuring they have the tools and resources they need to do their jobs. Benefits are much better than the industry norm."
good,"Was a small privately held company.  The owner was a retired naval aviation officer and a devote Christian.  The company had a wonderful family culture and the leadership was outstanding.  The company was sold to L-3 Communications and became a corporate division, part of a larger group which included L-3 Link Simulations.  DPA than became part of L-3 Link Simulations."
good,"very family oriented place. there were chanlenges every day, but I was able to acomplished my task. Management was not the best, but they were able to help us get our job done."
good,Call center. Collected labor statistics for a confidential jobs report from employers throughout the US. Specific goals and procedures required  to maintain accurate and consistent reporting.
good,"A fun and challenging working environment, working in a diverse environment to achieve a common goal. The management was great as they bring out the best out of individual. They gave employee opportunity to communicate and collaborate to help achieve operational excellence. I want to be a part again in this company in the near future."

good,was a good place to work.. culture was very good friendly and flexible with job in terms of working form home and taking time off........................................
good,"Good management, great co-workers, not much can be done about the particular environment because it's ship repair which is pretty arduous.  Great hours and satisfactory pay."
good,"Due to the merger with L-3 requisition load was significantly cut.  Management and workplace culture was good, great team in my segment.  The training provided was good and everyone on my team was very professional and very helpful while I was there."
good,I worked for L-3 a short period of time.  I received a minimal amount of training.  The people there were great to work with and the company provided a nice atmosphere.   We could only work from home if we had something at home that needed you to be there. If we new of inclement weather approaching then we could bring our laptops home as well.  I learned Cost-point while I was there and Deltek.
good,Good group of people to work with.  Everyone was in it to win.  Contract work is made more difficult when everyone is trying to be cutthroat and these guys did not do that.
good,It has been a great working experience at L3 Technologies where I have learned many great skills and gained experiences in various areas of the aviation and interior design industry.
good,Extremely talented people work at Harris Corp.  Work life balance is good with good pay.  Management is good with the exception of frequent mergers / acquisitions.
good,"This company began its day as Litton Systems Canada, which later merged with Northrop Grumman and then was purchased by L-3 Communications. Unfortunately over the years it went from a thriving company with over 4000 people to what is now a small company of less than 20."
good,"Productive an fun workplace with ping pong table."
good,"Value their employees, good benefits, good career paths, challenging positions, great products, good tools, great management, 9/80 work week in the summer, matching 401k"
good,company that is strong defense contractor leader in new technology company has fair salary and good benefits  allows employees to work together at all levels .
good,"Have to pay attention to detail. They make it easy to work there, comfort and excellence. The company is very good at checking your work and rewarding you"
good,"L3 is a great company to work for, good compensation, lunch allowance, the managers need more training and more open discussions would be good. Lots of closed doors often."
good,"For the most part its a pretty relaxed place to work. Can seem a bit face paced when starting out, but most of the time you get into the groove of things pretty quickly. Most employees tend to be easy to work with and very willing to help, but there are those who can make performing your tasks a bit of a challenge. Benefits are alright for the most, though I do enjoy the amount of vacation that is given."
good,Harris Corporation proved to be a pleasant and rewarding place to work. Workmates and environment pleasant and productive. Project was challenging and rewarding.
good,I did enjoy working for L3Communications. Coworkers and managers were good people. it was almost like family. Things got slow do to government contracts slowed. Got laid off after 14 years.
good,worked with the military overseas. enjoyed the benefit of learning different aspects of my field and ensured staff was taken care of. contract was changed to another company.
good,"It was one of the best company i worked for, managers were kind and caring. The company cared about the employees and their families.  Great benefits and fun lunches."
good,Staff at L3 Technologies are friendlier and cooperative. Management is focused on career development of its employees and provide opportunities to staff for enhancing their skills.
good,Supported joint liaison office between US and Iraqi Head Quarters in Baghdad and Interpreted daily military activities. Facilitate joint conferences between US military advisors and Iraqi ground force leaders.
good,"Harris is a great company to work at. It is a very professional environment, though too much red tape. There are some redundancy and too many systems to do your work, I wish someone can tackle the great deal of non value added and be more efficient."
good,"Although the work was stressful at times, I knew what I was getting into. It wasn't too much to handle, but it did keep you on your toes. With the FAA being our primary (Only) customer, each call was treated as a priority one call. I usually averaged 20 - 25 calls per work day. Love figuring out issues and solving problems."
good,Good place and people to work with. The location is very close for me to commute. Flexable schedule. The type of job we do always changing so that always in the lookout to learn and adapt
good,"Great company to work for and has many internal opportunities. Culture offers excellent work/life balance. "
good,Very friendly customers and upbeat work space! I have been with the company for almost a year. And they really care. Helping customers find everyday needs is a pleasure.
good,"I worked a long time for Harris. Left them to start my own business. Decided to move out of state or I would have gone back to work for them. The work I did was interesting and challenging. Direct management was problematic at times, but probably has changed by now."
good,"A typical day for me at HEB spans many different systems and even groups."
good,Working to keep the schedule is not as easy as it sounds.  Management and Customers understand if there are unforeseen circumstances but never when these become routine and still expect the worker to work around the clock to meet primary delivery dates.
good,Co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. Some of the builds could be quite challenging but there was always someone there you could ask for assistance.
good,"I would recommend other to work at /for L3 Communication, I found it to be laid back and relaxed.The supervisor was on point and you moved at your own pace..."
good,"Overall L3 is a good company to work for.  HR is very helpful and seems to take care of employees issues in a timely manner.  No issues with direct deposit, Management was strong but lacked interface and support from QA department."
good,working in the aerospace industry provides a different and unique challenge every day from issuing out parts and supplies to trying to source that hard to find part.
good,"Started as accounting clerk and moved up to senior analyst."
good,L3 allows the different companies to operate independently as long as they are profitable.  That allows the acquired companies to keep their brand and their loyalties.
good,The division of L3 that I have worked with has provided me with the opportunity to grow and excel. The management team maintains an open door policy with a focus on continuous improvement. If you are a motivated individual with a desire to succeed then this is the place for you.
good,"50% structure / 50% innovation"
good,"It's all about the people.  Do they share ideas and seek your opinion?  Are they open to teaching you new things? My division management was  great.  But many decisions are made by the corporate office, and the division has no say,"
good,L3 is obviously a good place to work.  I have been here for almost 15 years.  It offers a great benefits package and lots of perks. We are also afforded  the opportunity to have paid summer days off every other week in the summer months.
good,long days and had work but liked that they provided everything I need to live and do my job. having medical and transportation available was a blessing.
good,L3 Technologies is a good company to work for.   It has provided a lot of things and adventures I would not have imaged.  I recommend it to anyone looking for an opportunity to start a career.
good,- A typical day for a supervisor was 10 plus hours and fast paced.
good,"This job was alot of fun. You had to be able to read and understand inventory numbers quickly and where what item is sent to what place. Although stressful, this job taught me alot of multi tasking and how to be better at my accuracy in a fast paced environment."
good,this is a good place to work very good place to work . the building needs some work and up grade the bathrooms so it can handle the amount of people that work there..
good,Harris Corporation is an excellent company to work for. They seem to be committed to recognizing their employees when they do good work unlike some companies that only communicate with you when you are admonished for something.
good,Good company that paid for my Master's and facilitated advancement from mechanical to systems engineering. Best part of my job is getting to work with planes.
good,"Good place to work."

good,"I enjoyed working here while the contract lasted. Call center work, not very exciting. Great experience for entry into help desk work. Management was great. Easy to get along with. Best part was the fact that everybody in the office got along well, baring a few conflicts of interest here and there. Hardest part (rightfully so) was advising people in how to use the software or assist them when a technical problem arose. Provided a good challenge."
good,"They are a wonderful company to work for as far as contract companies go. They pay well and the management really seems to care about their employees. They do not try to work you to death and they seem to understand that people have a life outside of the job. The only downside is that it is a contract company and you may be laid off, however they make an attempt to find you another position once another contract opens up."
good,"Good place to work. Great people, fast paced, never boring!"
good,"Every day as a team we complete a daily schedule. We know what is expected of us, and we are giving all the tools to compete our job successfully. We have a timed schedule, but we can not leave until all task are completed. We lack a learning environment because once you learn your task it becomes repetitive. I don't see my manager often because we have shift leaders. Their Job consist of managing our team and making sure we know exactly what our numbers are for the day. They also make sure that we are doing our task in a safe manner. My coworkers are welcoming and helpful. The hardest part of my job is not being able to leave until all task are complete.

On a more positive note, the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing what is expected of me and having all the tools I need to complete them."

( tugs fork lifts booms and so on) also responsible for longing and tracking tools and aircraft parts using excel. i have learned the operation of different ground support equipment and diff computer software's. people skills and organizational skills. management is OK over the past 7 years iv seen many transitions. but for the most part great company to work for and they continue to move forward acquiring more contracts and supplying jobs for the community. for the most part the co-workers here are extremely friendly and very family oriented. matter a fact that's one of my favorite perks of the job. very people friendly work place. as far as hard parts. sometimes you are pressed for time but other than that its all hands on and pretty much self explanatory. but the good thing about the people here are always willing to help. great team work. i enjoy my job very much. i am always getting to think outside the box. like finding ways to create new kits , and finding ways to boost production by making our employes jobs easier and more efficient. i enjoy working with the ground support equipment as well. very well maintained and luv being out side. plus the facility here is very nice and clean as well as organized."
good,Great company to work for. Pay is above average benefits are great and the people are very friendly and helpful.
good,"A typical day at work is being in front of computer and entering data. I did learn alot about what it takes to do a complete overhaul on an aircraft, alot of attention to detail. I was important to be productive and manage your own time. Co-workers came and went depending on where you were assigned to.The hardest part of the job was probably getting in so early to fight for a parking space. The most enjoyable is getting to know all kinds of people from all kinds of backgrounds."
good,"Harris is a great company with thousands of excellent employees. I started there straight out of college and worked with them for nearly 10 years as a financial analyst. While my experience was positive, there is unfortunately very few opportunities for growth inside the company as much of management is ""entrenched"" in their positions for decades and usually the only hope for advancement is when significant changes to the company's organization yield the creation of new positions. Unfortunately, this happens very seldom, and even less so given the current economy."
good,"I have been here 9 years so that tells you I like it. We deak in a variety of arenas, there really isn't a hard part but that may be because I have been doing this so long. The environment we work in is the most enjoyable part."
good,Good managers
good,"I was with the company for 1 and half years, as a contractor. As a job and a overall company all was pretty well. Plenty of experience and personability for personell. Lacked overall corporate cohesion, especially in security. Security is very knowledgeable, but accountable and dependable to get information where it needs to go."
good,"Great compensation and benefits, management needs some improvement, but overall a decent place to work."
good,"Everyone was a team and would crosstrain so that all of us could inprove or share our idea's. They would make sure that all the employee's were in a safe enviroment, Safety was one of our main gools, because without safety it can endanger all of us."
good,Excellent company that provided resources and information to ensure the mission was always met. Great management that cared about both the emplyee and the company. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep the spending within the budget. Enjoyed the new state of the art building built for the supply warehouse.
good,"Can have great pay, but will cut it if needed. Good Management, can take time to hear back some times though. Good relationship with DOD and Gov."
good,"This is a good company and is growing.  They seem well positioned for new projects.  The recent merger has caused the type of discomfort that would be expected, but it should continue to be a good workplace."
good,"Had a lot of travel with some great work with a lot of different places. The only reason I am looking for a new job, is the current position is going away.  Was great work."
good,"Competitive defense contractor. 401k match, paid-time-off, and paternity leave are very good. Health care options are not great, but no benefits package is perfect."
good,"for the most part work environment is very fun, there is always something to do. you do have to keep you head on the game and no horseplay.  attention to details is a Must!"
good,It was a Fun and friendly place to work for. Took a lot of pictures for the company events and employees for the newsletter that I published each quarter.
good,"Although the work and the environment was sufficient, the pay was not nearly enough to cover basic living expenses. For a married working couple that would have the opportunity to work for the same company, l3 is the perfect environment for that sort of lifestyle."
good,I am given enough home time. they treat you fairly. it does have its downs not enough paid sometimes seems like they under your appreciated great leadership
good,"Productive fast paste work environment, multiple cross functional Job responsibility for job role, good overall benefits to include insurance, 401 k, medical, school assistance and paid time off."
good,"Other than the shift changes and open seating arrangements in the operations center, the place is pretty great. They specialize in government contract work and that provides for heavy staffing. They were great at providing education. A sleepy beach town may not be for everyone, but Orlando was only an hour away."
good,"Worked at L3 in Gardena, work environment was great, people were great, the actual job was great, the bad part was lower than industry standard pay and lack of support from management in acquiring necessary tools and equipment which would enable us to perform the job far more quickly and efficiently."
good,"Management is open and caring for individuals."
good,"Harris is chock full of really nice, really smart engineers.  There’s lots of interesting work for self starter types.  Upper management  can be clueless, making fatal technical decisions without engineering input.  This has caused senior engineers to jump ship, leaving new hires and fresh-outs with no one to support their growth.  It also leaves huge knowledge gaps that can’t be filled by any amount of new hires.  I personally left for a more telecommuter-friendly company that understands that software is often better done remotely, where there’s less noise and less distraction."
good,"Secure place to work, with company politics being the only downside. Work environment was fast paced, and enjoyed working with very skilled engineering workforce."
good,"As a defense contractor, there is often quite a bit to do and limited time to do it -- time management is key. This may sound stressful, and yeah, it certainly can be, but you are working with excellent people and working on extremely cool projects."
good,"Best thing about coming to work are the people. Good place to work, good benefits, engagement and the opportunity to learn new things, while moving up in the corporation."
good,"i came to work for L-3 in 2006, and it was always fun to come to work and interact with my co-workers and our customers. I have made so lasting relationships that have continued even after L-3 lost the supply contract to my current employer"
good,"Overall, L 3 communications was a good company to work for. At times there were a little vague on communication between employee and employer. The pay could have been a little better but they were under  a contract"
good,People are professional and management know what is going on. The work days were long and conditions were not great but the pay was awesome. Vacation time could of been better.
good,"Truly enjoyed my wide and varied experience working for L-3"
good,Typical office job in a nice location new the Potomac River and Old Town Alexandria. Free parking. Job is interesting. Lots of trainings in the office and on the client's site in Falls Church.
good,Fast pace work must be self motivated. must be able to work long hard hours at a moment time weekends or daily. when management does there job you will have work.
good,"Productive and rewarding workplace that builds product for military, aerospace, and medical devices.  Company took ethics and policy very seriously and provided a fair workplace."
good,"While no job is perfect, I had very few complaints about this one.  I got to do my job without someone breathing over my shoulder.  I got to go around during the day getting work done without having to report to my supervisor on a regular basis.  Great coworkers too."
good,"While with L-3 and working at the Corpus Christi Army Depot, I worked in different roles and learned many things in each role.  The workplace culture was busy but relaxed and I met some wonderful people."
good,"It is a good place to work. They have good benefits, good work culture, and good management in general. A typical work week for an engineer is 40 hours but they sometimes require overtime for several weeks at a time."
good,"I've learned a lot and gained many technical skills working for the company. They have great benefits and pay.  The only thing that I didn't like about the company and working in the field is that I get moved and deployed oversea a lot, so life is tough when you have family."
good,This was a great place to work.  Management was fantastic and helpful whenever you had an issue.  The pay was excellent as well.  The insurance was on par with other companies I have worked for.
good,"The Benefits are good."
good,Working here was very enjoyable for me.  Our team consisted of 12-15 and we were proud of the Support work we did for our Military Customer.  I wish L3 still operated Bluegrass Station.  I'd go back in a heart beat.
good,"Value their employees, good benefits, good career paths, challenging positions, great products, good tools, great management, 9/80 work week in the summer, matching 401k"
good,"Although lay-offs were made, the work environment and the people were great to work with. All the employees had no problem helping one another and teach each other new things."
good,This is a company that you can  work your 8 hours the way you want. This allows me to leave at 4 instead of 5 and have more of my day ahead. Also they give you full benefits from day 1.
good,"Typical work day, work 8hr shift w/ 30 min lunch and two 15 min breaks. The culture is broken as far as the top tier is concerned. Upper management cares nothing for completing jobs to work standards when it conflicts w/ their time restraints. No accountability is recurrent theme. An open line of communication is available as long as it doesn't involve constructive criticism. HR refused to address any issues."
good,Support  to help with preparing information to create successful sales.  It is a very difficult item to sell.  Co-workers and management work as a team.
good,"Was compensated well, not well enough. Co workers and supervisors were well liked as well as knowledgeable. Management may not have been the most suitable for the job, but it got done."
good,It's a union ran facility that has great benefits and is always looking out for you as an employee. There are plenty of opportunities of careers to pursue from management to mechanic.
good,"I start cleaning my place where I am going to work that day ,if ,I need to calibrate any tool ,I  do,wait if the Supervisor  has some special task for me for that day,if not,I look for a job needs to be done."
good,"Not a bad place to work.  However,  the National Security Solutions division just got sold to CACI.  Not sure what to expect once we are integrated."
good,"Design and manufacturing of advanced electro-optic equipment primary for airborne use. "
good,"I enjoyed the variety of assignments I worked as a General Clerk III. Gave me a great knowledge of how the depot worked. Worked with a great team and management was very approachable. Hardest part would be dealing with extreme weather conditions when i worked in the hangar. One thing i didn't like was that employees who didn't follow the rules only got a slap on the hand, not fair to those who worked hard and followed company policy."
good,Thoroughly enjoyed my job. Being able to keep my head down and do my job was the best part of my job.  Well paid and great benefits.
good,"The people who work at L3Prime are good people and it's a place where you can work without having to wear a corporate mask."
good,"excellent company that was negatively impacted by the economic downfall of 2008, thus losing contracts with clients, thereby reducing staff."
good,"Excellent place to work at.  My reason for looking around for another position is that I am a bit limited by restrictions placed in my department.   I want to be able to write code, design circuits, as well as test hardware/software.  I am extremely limited in what I can use/develop."
good,L-3 Communications taught me the value of utilizing Configuration Management practices for all aspects of a project.  Starting from a known baseline and progressing to the desired new state sets the stage for successful upgrades to any system.
good,A fun place to work because my professional opinion was never overlooked when it came to improvements. Learned from the engineers as what the products were. Co-workers were generally pleasant and supportive. I'm sorry that the company decided to move to Ohio.
good,"L-3 is a Large Defense contractor. My typical day was spent interfacing with highly educated and qualified engineers. There was always new designs and ideas challenging me to learn and be engaged in the design process. The most difficult part of the job was knowing when to turn out the lights and go home because there was so much to be done. The best part for me was the interaction with the people, customers and vendors."
good,L-3 is a wonderful company to work for a bit labor intensive at times due to way too many meetings which may or may not accomplish what they set out to accomplish.Other than that it is a very good company to be a team player.
good,calm and easy going work flow not hard to do. help me improve my team networking skills
good,"As part of the Executive staff, I was able to support many C Level Executives including the President, CFO, VP of Business Development for DoD and International, and Legal Council. While supporting these executives I took care of the following items including but not limited all travel arrangements, internal and external meetings, lead Assistant on all government and military proposals, calendar management, formatting PowerPoint presentations, coordinating off sit meetings and events, etc. My job was making the day to day lives of busy high level Executives easier and run more smoothly.  L-3 is a great company and your potential as an employee is endless.  Management is very supportive of an employees goals and aspirations and helping them achieve them."
good,Every other Friday off and got to work with cool infrared camera's.
good,"Really enjoyed being apart of the biggest challenge and opportunity of my mechanical career, also took my welding skills to another level. I worked 7 days a week 12 hour days, had to have your mind focused and do your best to stay physically fit, I also made sure that I was spiritually fed as well, gave me amazing strength be so far away from home, and especially my family. I worked 8 strait years, in between Iraq and Afghanistan"

Being a great role model and being head strong and confident takes you to the top. So i would like to Thank CCAD for the opportunity for working out at the base for L-3 communications."
good,"Working at L3 Communications was my first real job in logistics. my supervisor was excellent. She trained me in the majority of the basics of logistics while I also developed my own feel for the job. I trained with multiple types of forklifts, though I'm not certified. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment. My co workers all did their part ensuring the daily tasks would be completed in a timely manner."
good,"I'm a person looking for a job to either use my skills or gain more experience. I'm not afraid of learning any job nor afraid of working any shift."
good,L3 is a great company and I enjoyed working there but unfortunately due to new government contractual requirements L3 could not bid on the 2013 contract and I was laid off.
good,"Typical day was pretty laid back"
good,In my five years at Wescam I met many wonderful people and enjoyed working there very much.  The daily workload is a full plate challenging you with many trials and tribulations daily.  It is a very rewarding place to work.
good,"Manage six million dollars of inventory."
good,"Lots of movement potential. The company is big and has a lot of projects, if you don't like the one you're on, you can transfer to another one and the culture around doing so is very positive. Benefits are good and jobs are secure."
good,I learned a lot as basically a highschool graduate during my first year on the job as an intern.  I shadowed a senior engineer and helped him along with other managers complete their daily tasks and project goals.  It was a good experience.
good,"Enjoyed working with people and management"
good,"I'll miss the team environment and willingness to help forward your career. The hardest part is the fact that they're a military defense contractor, so when the defense contracts dry up, there's trimming of the fat."
good,"I am a cafe owner and looking to return to work as an interpreter/cultural advisor position, which i really enjoyed working side by side with our military."
good,"Good company with good benefits.  Growing company, good growth opportunity, flexible schedule. "
good,"This company is like other companies, it has its ups and downs. "
good,"Every day is a challenge in Self-sufficient work environment, where responsibility lies on you to find solutions to issues and meet deadlines for projects you are producing products for. The most enjoyable part of my job is extending my limitations to do something I thought I could not do and communicating with project engineers."
good,"Very mentally stressful, extreme flight requirements. a coordination of scheduled, unscheduled, and Aircraft Launch, manning cutbacks, production meetings and maintenance forecasting, with in a daily priority changing environment.  The personnel who worked for me, where very dedicated to me and the mission. In 9 years I never missed daily mission requirements.   "
good,"I have worked here for over 15 years and have seen a lot of changes. L-3 is a solid, ethical company. My local management, as well as corporate staff, take our role as goverment contractors very seriously."
good,"Excellent family to be part of, confirm the Night Vision googles that were manufactured"
good,I always recieved top performance recognition. The program was sold and all employees were let go.

good,The usual for many workplace environments.  Very fast paced.  Constantly busy.  Must be able to multi-task and switch focus rapidly.  Great people to work with and for.
good,"Most days would include modeling, drafting, walking the facility for different reasons. I was responsible for working out production issues weather it be in the backstops or in the hanger. Overall most of the days had something interesting to do."
good,"I worked in the training area, it was well organized and we had a team structure.

good,"Excellent hours, helpful and pleasant co-workers during work hours, enough work to do yet not stressful. The job has been good to me ever since I started working for L3."
good,"There is plenty of room for improvement, unless you ever show an inclination to look elsewhere.  If you are deemed a ""flight risk"", it is near impossible to gain any career advancement."
good,Was a wonderful place to work. Good Management team. Employees respected. The most professional place I worked over my 35 years in the business. The typical day at work included meetings with all departments and with customers.
good,"I have over 15 years experience in soldering, which is part of why I enjoyed my jobs day to day duties. I feel when you learn something new like Dye-attach there is a learning curve. Which deterred me from completing the number of completed boards that were required hourly. Management was very determined to get the product out at a fast pace with a high percentage of quality. I would have appreciated a bit more hands on training. The coworkers in my area were very patient and helpful, but overall I would recommend L-3 as a great company and place to work."

good,"At this point, I do not desire to comment on this particular topic.  I will respectfully answer any particular question when the pertinent occasion present itself."

good,"Enjoy working in the aviation field and look forward to learning more, training more with junior aviators across the board."
good,"L-3 Henschel was a terrific place to work where I honed my spray painting skill set but was able to also take on additional responsibilities and learn other skills.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the location change from Newburyport, MA to Ayer, MA.  Trying to get home during the summer on Thursday's and Friday's was almost impossible because of summer traffic headed north for the weekend."
good,A typical day was busy working on vehicles and ordering parts or cleaning the shop after vehicles were done.  I gained more knowledge about mechanics and the different ways to do certain things or fix certain problems.  Supervisors did not want to accept responsibility for issues that went on in their shops.  My co-workers were willing to any knowledge they had about mechanics and assist others if they needed help with work load. The hardest part was finishing vehicles and getting them pass company and government inspectors. The most enjoyable was going home after a days work and leaving whatever happen at work there.
good,"If you love to build defense equipment, It's the place to be."
good,"A typical day consisted of a routine walk-through to ensure all systems were operational and running.  Routine inspections and preventive maintenance were conducted on any systems unused and on standby.  Diagnostics, Troubleshooting, and repairs were performed on any downed systems with precision and diligence to ensure quick restoration of up-time."
good,"One of the best jobs ever, and would recommend to all ex-military"
good,"I enjoy working for a company that supports military aircraft. It never panned out for me to join the military as I was always a family man first, but this is as close as I will come to fulfilling my personality as an employee. I enjoy meeting high ranking officials who are courteous enough to take the time to thank the workers who make their aircraft mission capable. I enjoy working with the team around me and getting the job done right the first time"
good,"I have always enjoyed getting to work early and starting the day with a smile, and also enjoy a good conversation with other employees to see how there weekend or day is going/went. I try to learn as much as I can about any job that I have so I can excel and do a great job for the company. My experience in dealing with other employees as a manager is try to get a one on one conversation with each one of them so they will know where I stand with the company and what is expected of each employee. The hardest part of any job for myself is playing politics, its hard for myself to sugar coat any situation I will tell you either yes or no. its really enjoyable when I can see a lot of happy employee's enjoy what they do and with a company that they work for, because happy employee's always makes for happy employer's."
good,I initially worked for another company and then Mantech one the contract and ETS/VETS is a sub contractor for the Mantech. When they came aboard they really worked with use on getting things situated from pay to insurance right away. I did enjoy working with them.

Also provided answers for the government test team and supported the development team with answers. Went to the field to support the trainers of the systems and areas where users were having problems with data entry. Some of the co-workers were fun to work with and others were a constant battle to work with especially when they were expected to know what you knew but did not. The trips to different sites was great Pureto Rico, Charleston, SC, and Ft Lewis, WA."
good,"I don't have any complaints about L-3. I enjoyed what I did, worked with a great group of people. I just wished they had positions on the West coast."

good,"Fun place to work the co workers are great and Management was awesome would have stayed but family emergency."
good,Workload can be crushing and exhausting for engineers and program managers.  Pay is excellent and the atmosphere is laid back.  Projects for engineers can be very challenging.  Lots of opportunities for promotion.  Good work/life balance for most salaried employees.  Not a bad place to work.  Many positives and few negatives.
good,"Good place to work. Lot of opportunities for career advancement. Frequent training to learn about the products they manufacture. Most enjoyable part is flexible work timings. Also allowed to work remotely whenever needed. Hardest part is when you are unable to help the customers due to system issue, which I can't do anything. Work environment is very nice. Group works like a family. Always someone there to back up when you are on leave."

good,"I had a great team to work with, so that made the job easier. There are many positions, but if you have any sort of technical background, this is the company for you."

good,"Civilian component of the Navy's Training Squadron; Work and run through the whole shift, Extension of that which I learned to do in the Navy. No advancement due to being a bottom dweller; In the line division, Navy or Civilian, no one works harder than the individual themselves; Best thing was the pay"

good,"Harris Corp is a wonderful place for new grads to grow and advance. I started straight out of school working on design projects. I had a mentor to turn to for questions and a ""buddy"" for Harris help. Co-workers help out, not turn away because they are too busy."
good,I think that L-3 is a great place to work because of the feeling of stability and the pay and benefits package is hard to beat.
good,"Worked very independently every day with minimal supervision."
good,Harris has been a great place to work.  I have had many leadership and advancement opportunities.  Everyone works as a team and makes work fun!  They value their employees and offer many employee engagement activities.
good,"Aprendi muito nesta empresa, onde contribui em todas as funções."
good,I would come in the morning I we would open mail sometimes pull case files we then would enter Claims into the system for people and their Families. The hardest part of the job is when we started to run out of work. I enjoyed everyone who worked there Management and Co-workers were Great! We would file cases that were being processed. We would occasionally pull for CE's whom where working on the case files. Everything was so good but was laid off because we had run out of work

Random employees bring in goodies to share on a weekly basis, also donuts every Friday in QA. Employee appreciation luncheons or awards meetings are scheduled quarterly to monthly.

good,Great company to work for as far as culture and company is concerned! Pay is low and lay-offs are a big issue although they almost always call you back!
good,"This was a good contract with good pay. However, it was top heavy with management looking to make a quick buck. No strategy or focus for future development."

good,Loved my job. Just hated being away from home. Lots of cool things.
good,It was a great learning experience but none of the managers like to get work early even though manufacturing began at 5:00am. Too much of the corporate environment and not enough focusing on the priority tasks at hand.

Interaction with the different departments is vial to the success of the company. Management is always willing and able to work with you, to ensure the proper maintenance of scheduled and non-scheduled facility preventative maintenance programs.  The most difficult thing I faced was finding the energy to continue my daily duties after holiday and reward lunch functions. There was not a holiday that wasn't celebrated, whether the food was catered or cooked by the gourmet chefs hiding behind corporate titles. Overall Linkabit is a remarkable company, with room to grow and unforgettable people."

Everyone pitched in and helped where they were needed. I enjoyed working there very much. The hardest part was leaving. As the company moved forward to become more competitive, they were forced to downsize in areas that were no longer as productive due to the lack of need for older products. In order to compete in today's market, this was a difficult but necessary decision. I wish them success."

We worked at a side of the area we were at and kind of cut out of the communication chain, that happens everywhere, especially the military. (I loved my 24 yrs service though). The best part of the job was the people, you figure 90%  were ex- military retired or whatnot. Had a great manager where we all worked at. He bent over backwards for me with some family issues I had and he was over all a great man, and I still thank him today......L-3 is the perfect place to start if you are retiring from the military and never worked any where but the military. They understand all the talk and most of them are retired from the military too."

good,"As a new mechanic you get to learn the basics of blueprint reading, drilling and riveting at L-3 with proper mentor-ship. Sometimes you get thrust into a situation that you will have no idea what you're doing and end up messing up along the way.

Some management made you feel inferior.And there some who were direct and honest while supporting the efforts of employees.Some employees got special treatment while others who worked hard were overlooked for wage increases and promotions.I understand cross-training is important but some employees excell more in certain areas and would better serve the company if they stay in one area.The hardest part of the job was lack of supervision in some areas.Just because a manager does not know the task does not mean he can not be a better support to the employee.

The work was basically facilitating production, providing training and mentoring, generating work instructions and tooling drawings, product enhancements, and problem solving.  Enabling suggestions made by the operators provided great satisfaction both for myself and for the operators.  The daily demands are often difficult to balance, but perseverance always prevailed.  Providing clear, simple, and easy to follow instructions to the operators was the key to success.  People appreciated time spent teaching, showing, demonstration, and complimenting on difficult tasks.  L-3 is a very good place to work, but unfortunately is relocating to Cincinnati Ohio in Q115."

From what I have heard, not all departments are like this. It has been great other than the recent cutbacks. When I started, we had BBQs and Zoo days, I have heard there were also Lagoon days before I started. Now it's a rare occasion that they spend money or extras. It is understandable that cutbacks have had to happen, and it has still been a great company to work for."

L3 really took care of their employees and refused to under-bid the contract, in order that we would have a solid career path and would have the opportunity for raises. SAIC underbid the contract and was not counting on the amount of pay we were receiving. they forced some people to take pay cuts.

I was a billing specialist and quickly worked my way up the ladder once  I caught on and learned the ropes. They are also a very 'family comes first"" oriented company. L-3 always accommodated me when I needed time for my son. They also worked with my schedule regarding daycare. The most challenging part of my day was tracking down and reconciling any discrepancies within the bills. It was only challenging due to the fact that you had to wait for other departments to get you the info. And while they were always as prompt as possible, when you're in the groove, it's always frustrating to stop and wait. :) The most enjoyable part of my day were my co-workers. I loved my work family at L-3."
