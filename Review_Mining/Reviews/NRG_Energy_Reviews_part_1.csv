rating,review
bad,"Very high turnover."
bad,Horrible place to work feels as if your a prisoner. You have to lie to people about high electricity prices that you know they cannot afford. Management is also horrible they dont know what they are doing half of the time. They just pure suck
bad,"When certain management left late last year, it went downhill and fast. The enforcement was no longer there and the 'secondary' management is a joke. If everyone was responsible from the beginning to the end in supply and demand response, they wouldn't feel the need to fire their best people. Not sure how they're still running. Demand Response group is the only department that runs right"
bad,We had unprofessional people working over us. You could tell they knew nothing about management they abuse their power as being managers. We’re jealous of some employees and took advantage of them. Their pay systems for set up for you to lose your commission of each sales. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. I called the ethics hotline they didn’t do anything. They get over on customers for money. And expect you to lie. If I could I would get this company shut down.
bad,"Job changed day to day. Management would tell you to do something one day, and have you do the complete opposite the next. Favoritism was the deal breaker for me."
bad,"ownership lies to government about money they made, they refuse to pay there employees and have been sued at least 47 times that I know of, also they have changed their name several times because ownership was sued."
bad,to many hours only commission pay outside in any weather not promised a sales everyday. the hardest part of the job is the walking and being on your feet all day long. the most enjoyable part was help customers lower their bill and save money
bad,overall a bad experience. They did not pay me right. One of my bosses did drugs. If we did work it was for an hour and then we would go on break and not go back to work due to the boss not coming to get us. We were supposed to be paid for training and never were. We were supposed to work Christmas eve but we went on a car ride to the bosses doctors appointment. The other employees got paid more than I did.
bad,"Very stressful to work in this area. I was with one group, but they were always giving stuff from old job to do.they had enough people on that side. Gave me stuff no one else would. Training was not complete"
bad,It was more of a job than career. People I worked with were always looking over their backs and making other people look bad so they can look good. I worked in the Omaha Area. They were dishonest and finger pointing.
bad,Terrible temp service.  I never met anyone  spoke with.  I was laid off an assignment and was told my personal items would be mailed to me.  Three years later....nothing.  HMMMM
bad,training is horrible. No really good way of advancing in the company. Need a better structure when dealing with problems with situations there.
bad,Your nothing but a number corporate staff is fake as sh** glad I'm leaving  also u get directions from more a**hol** who have no idea what's going on all you are are statistics and easily replaceable it's ran by boouji robots
bad,Way too much childish high school behavior from managers. Do not expect management to support your goals. Once they discover your passion to advance they kick you out the door
bad,"The company does not provide you with the right training you need to be successful with the group. It was basically a learn as you go type of job when it shouldn’t have been if you have to meet certain type of goals for the job. It was really a lot of favoritism going on in that place honestly, they keep who they FEEL will be best for the job, they don’t actuslly give you a chance to succeed and show them that you are really a hard worker and was willing to learn. It was too stressful trying to get sales. Customer service wasn’t bad at all, but meeting the sales and getting wrote up if you didn’t get enough was a lot of stress. I wouldn’t suggest anyone to work here unless you are willing to work in sales. The company has poor management and communication skills. Basically the job sucks! Also DO NOT WORK HERE IF YOU ARE PREGNANT OR PLANNING TO GET PREGNANT!"
bad,Treat this company like the popular girls in high school (I.e. toxic and avoid them except even worse gossipers). Hire others based on nepotism.
bad,"A typical day consists of selling people plans they couldn't afford and  making it seem like it was a better option. getting screamed and cursed at bc people ( who didn't pay their bill) got their lights cut off. Hearing every excuse in the book and when someone actually needed help and were a good customer we couldn't help them bc they didn't scream and cuss like the irresponsible customers.  If you didnt sell a higher ( proactive) plan every time someone was up for renewal you get a ""coaching""  your metrics are put on display for everybody to see and its one big contest to see who can brown nose ,fake help, and scam customers. basically if you can sell energy plans to people who have no idea what they are signing up for and make it sound nice , and have no problem being cursed , yelled at and threatened DAILY then this is the job for you. beware they will deny your sales check if you have 2 ""mess ups"" transferring to the wrong dept, using a different procedure ect ect."
bad,It's an old company cash cow that's been in the same business for 40 years. They aren't very innovative or profitable. Management is weak and their trading desk continuously loses money.
bad,Managers are terrible. Very inefficient use of personnel. Dishonesty is the dominant personality trait with management. The job is governed by a union contract that is not enforced. The union reps are typically MIA while the company runs roughshod over workers. Pay and benefits are good if you can tolerate incompetent management.
bad,"very stressful job. leadership was never there. people working are great to work with. benefits are fair. plant was old, things break all the time, but money was never their to fix things. safety was a joke."
bad,"NRG is a terrible company to work for, ever since NRG Energy took over the Illinois plants there has been nothing but plant shut downs, multiple lay offs, and a gas conversion, if you want to be with a stable company I would recommend you stay clear of this place, everyone that is left working there is over worked and stressed."
bad,"That is the only way you advance - poor performance does not matter, its who you know.   No advancement - very cut throat, all managers are afraid of Sr. Leadership - no courage to speak up."
bad,wouldn't go back for any amount of pay. This company literally just snatches the soul out of people to work mundane tasks all day. That is probably why you would only consider this place a job and not a career.
bad,"Consider other choices before working for NRG.  The pay is above average but the culture and work atmosphere is close to terrible.  Management typically has no idea what is going on.  They aren't concerned with you or what value you may add.  They are worried solely about the bottom line.  They preach safety until you can regurgitate in quatrain but expect production to include unsafe methods. Safety is good when it is convenient.  "
bad,Waste of time was what they did to NRG home solar.  They ran it into the ground by putting New Jersey people in charge.  Supervisors were uneducated and unprofessional.
bad,"This job was very exciting because there was something new to happen everyday. New neighborhood, different people. very exciting. Had time to really learn my part in the company and feel comfortable with my job."
bad,"Advancement opportunities only given if you had a ""hook up"" or hooked up with someone in upper management. Didn't understand family emergencies and fired agents for no reason !"
bad,Company is growing. need better management. I'm looking for a better opportunities. Good compensation and benefits  Lots of perks.
bad,"They have brought in new management again, maybe this time it will work but I left before it didn't. The culture is horrible with fellow co-workers telling on each other and in many cases falsely. They will routinely force you to work 4-8 hours past your normal 8 hour shift because the power plant is woefully under staffed."
bad,Management is poor and some are bullies. They reward and promote based on friendship rather than performance. Hard workers cover for those who are not.
bad,NRG contracts with ECG to promote their product. ECG requires you to work more hours than they pay you for by forcing you to clock in hours after they required you too be at work. They blame you for not really wanting to succeed if you point out this is abusive and in violation of labor laws.
bad,"most enjoyable part of the job: work schedule (hours)"
bad,"This company has changed drastically.  There are a ton of management lever or higher positions that serve to employ favorites but not substantiated by actual position need. Lower employees are constantly laid off, especially tenured employees."
bad,"Lower pay than national average. No progression within. Always on the road working. Good job culture, but long hours away from home. Shop environment is toxic."
bad,"Outdated and old fashioned, good ol boys club of has beens and wanna be's, inefficient, stale and crusty upper management just minutes away from retirement, counter intuitive practices and counter clockwise procedures, lacking talent, field experience, credentials and worldy wisdom. Ranchy cowboys and east coast jersey boys without any construction or logic. frustrating and unethical workplace culture and dirty southern stink."
bad,"I was with GME when NRG took over. It has slowly ranked as a place to work. Less autonomy, more micromanagement. We used to be treated with respect..."
bad,"Management has become unprofessional.  Has cut back on benefits."
bad,Was a good place to work until NRG took over People are leaving as fast as they can.As people retire their positions are not being filled.NRG is trying to fill job positions with outside contractors.
bad,"Immediate manager is awesome, he's all about the employees. Upper management not so much. Great group of ppl to work with for the most part. Company is all about the money which i guess is normal in the corporate world. Our plant is converting from a coal plant to a gas plant in the spring so quite a few ppl are lookin to lose their jobs. And the company view is that we're pretty much on our own. Its a huge company so I dnt see why they culdnt offer us positions elsewhere, but no we have to apply like we were coming off the street. They claim to be saftey oriantated but dnt fix the problem until sombody gets hurt, then blame the employees for the existing problem even tho upper management were aware of it prior. Like i said alot of ppl are losing their jobs come spring so moral is in the toilet and alot of ppl have pretty much laid down as far as actually doin any work, an these are the ppl that have enough seniority that they will be keepin their jobs jus transfering to another location. The small few of us that are doin our jobs it seems like our workload is double because we're the only ones actually workin, and we're the ones that'll be gettin laid off. Bs i think."
bad,"Bad planning on capitol projects, company gave up on coal plants."
bad,"nrg is not a good company they bought Genon kept all  the big profiting plants, transferred 500 million dollars of debt to its balance sheet and then filed bankruptcy. NRG is a company of no integrity."
bad,Great company with lots of opportunities to excel.Love the money I made.work outside at table tho sale electricity service. Great company lunches. Commission was great every check. The sales position offers unlimited salary cap
bad,On the first day the manager went over the job duties and assisted with initial training and within an hour stated they had to leave the site.  The managers would drop in to check on things once a week.
bad,the guys were great but mgt was awful. the work was hard but rewarding. the pay and time off was great also. there was a lot of overtime daily and sometimes we worked 7 days a week.
bad,When I started working the company cared about the workers. After NRG took over it just got worse. Moral is at its all time worse. Management is so cut throat they will stab you in the back to get ahead.
bad,"you do not want to work here the hours are long and unnecessary, the management is terrible, they act as if they own you, they want you to slave in the hot sun all day"
bad,"When NRG bought GENCO they laid off a large number of GENON personnel without giving them the opportunity to interview.  You could have been a consistent top performer, they didn't care."
good,"There used to be a lot to team building activities and a very open and transparent, interactive culture. But now its just a ""need to know someone"" to get somewhere, type of culture. There is no such thing as finishing work for the day. You have to work til you drop."
good,"Has it ups and downs, every day is a new day with new challenges"
good,Managers were able to treat non-union employees with a lack of respect - which at times created a hostile work environment.  I enjoyed the job - but I felt very much pigeon-holed and unable to further my career - so I moved on.
good,"Overall it was ok. No benefits, 10-99 so you had to do your own taxes. I was not considered an employee, but an independent contractor. Not that great at responding to your needs and requests. When i mentioned I was leaving to my regular customers, they seemed like they were going to miss me, and asked if the next guy will perform just as well."
good,"Very insecure work environment because of large reduction in force.  Company going from size of 10,000 to 4,000 by end of year.  Not sure of future of company."
good,"The job is easy, helping customers set up new service when they're moving to a new address or switching from one company to another. I've learned how to be more patient when talking to customers because everyone doesn't understand electricity. The hardest part about the job is not being able to help customers when they have small children and are currently without power. But the most enjoyable part of the job is being to give the customer a satisfying experience."
good,"We shut power off , and nobody’s tell the employees nothing Management is keeping everything from us nobody knows what’s going on last year’s payouts bonus they’re keeping it till later on this year to force employees to stay if they want it they said they would be a severance but they do not know when or what it will be and the few people that get to stay will have to rebid for their jobs atlower range wage"
good,There is no job security as  the company is in a period of unprecedented disruption. Huge cost reduction target. Rounds of layoffs will hit NRG as they prune staff across the company.
good,"Due to my tenure with the company I  was able to learn quite a bit.  However, there were a few lay offs that occurred during the ladder part of my tenure.  The workplace culture was demanding and continuing to change."
good,"Pros: good environments, good equipments  and nice chairs."
good,This was a great financial opportunity for me but the team was biased as they worked together at other companies and they pretty-much knew each others work habits and during the merger they kept the people they knew.  Management talked bad to their employees (at least on the team I was on) no room for growth.
good,NRG is a good  Company for young people starting their careers.  It pays well.  Not flexible regarding working from home.   Great benefits regarding Vision.
good,the upper management change over constatly which lead to spartic policy changes and conflicting excution proceedures to meet growing goal expectation. Leading to a cut throat working enviroment.
good,You will be expected to do the jobs of many until you take a stand. Then you may risk getting replaced for the next person to be exploited. The current morale situation at the worker level is toxic at best. Just waiitng for your turn to be cut essentially....
good,"due to poor past decisions and failed initiatives, NRG is leaning on a successful retail business to reduce costs which has created an overworked environment.  Great people there, just too much work for those who remain."
good,Gained plenty of social skills dealing with negativity and rejection while consulting with and a pool of diversity. Walking outside door to door for up to 8 hours a day.
good,"Pay and benefits were excellent but management was very incompetent. While this was a union position under a labor contract, the company broke the contact agreement and laid off employees"
good,"doesnt provide any room for growth, have been contracted here for 5 years with no solid oppurtunity of a full time position even though i have been employee of the year and have accomplised many goals."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Young manager's that do not have experience managing projects!"
good,"hard work and long hours,not enough work,very unorganized"
good,"Quiet place, just did some filing and scanning and stapling and faxing, easy temp job. Recommended. Also, no one bothers you, you get a task get it done that’s it. No supervision, trusted."
good,"It is was a tough place to work. No work/life balance, but I am thankful I took the job. I learned a lot in a very short amount of time. Most of the employees were wonderful."
good,"Bullying and management did nothing about it. Job positions eliminated and some of the people that complained lost their jobs."
good,NRG is an ok company to work for. Once hired hard to move to different area to work. Not a good environment to work in at this time going through a sale of assets and reducing work force.
good,"The rotating shift work is difficult,  along with numerous pay discrepancies.  Required to to be proficient in technician skills and operator duties."
good,NRG's lean staff and rudimentary system pushes it's employees to know more and work harder. This creates opportunities for greater exposure and more hands-on learning for those willing to put up with the long hours and tedious data-entry necessitated by the software.
good,"When bought out by Clearway Energy, many managers were severed, or transferred to other locations. HR was changed, or not renewed, and engineers were transferred to other locations."
good,"Things changed there over time, job security diminished. Management was not involved in day to day operations as much as it used to be. Too bad because used to be better."
good,Work long hours. We work to keep the electrical grid up and running. We keep the lights on no matter what. Safety culture is number one. I have learned alot from the old school persons here.
good,People left often to work somewhere else after they obtained a skill set.  Six of the twelve operator left within a two month period to work at another plant.  This left the plant in an unsafe condition due to the lack of qualified personnel left to operate.
good,"Depending on where you work, your manager will either help you advance or throw roadblocks up so you cannot move ahead. Senior leadership often has no idea what the customer-facing team members face and continuously ask for changes that make their work harder. The focus should be made on maximizing profit versus cost-cutting as most measures caused difficulties that outweighed the perceived benefits."
good,I'm glad they were able to make it work. Team members were like minded hard working.Market was extremely difficult at that time - clean energy business was gaining ground slowly.
good,I enjoyed working with this company    The pay is competitive and the insurance is pretty good  I would recommend them to anyone searching for a career
good,We had a gym onsite and got free meals on holidays. Management does not follows through with what they promise. Hired by Plant Manager and Operations Manager(My Boss) said he would not have hired me.
good,"It is a great place to work, It is meaningful workIt is a great place to work, It is a growing company, It isi a great location in the Princeton area. Benefits are great. Free lunch"
good,NRG operates in a lean fashion by focusing on the bottom line. At times there were no control systems in place to properly detect inefficiencies or reward honest hard work.
good,"It was a good experience working there , I can't complain. I  learned a lot  "
good,"There were good professionals within each of the functional groups, but the overall cohesion of leadership between divisions of the company was unclear.  There was clear separation, but little in terms of unity of the branches of the enterprise."
good,"Good company, good benefits. Nice people to work with and pay is good.  Need a long-term strategy other than being a old brown power wholesale/retail company."
good,Overall good company to work for.  Company is currently downsizing.  The company pays weel and treats its employees fairly.  This company has lots of locations all over the USA
good,"Have worked here for two years and in that time the company has gone through three (3) major lay-off cycles."
good,Good place to work and learn about the energy industry. The employees are dedicated and intelligent. Decent work / life balance. Only drawback are the layoffs that have been happening for a couple years.
good,"The Sales Management of the retail departments rarely had any sales experience, but rather engineering and project management experience.  This made it difficult to get results quickly and to communicate with leadership.  The culture is that of a library and the constant change/reorganization to TRY and fit the shareholders expectations is never ending.  This is a keep your head down and don't ask questions mentality work environment with little room for personality."
good,"Every day is different - dependent on power grid requirements, company safety and environmental requirements."
good,"I performed economic analysis to build or acquire assets at NRG, the largest independent electric generation company in the US. I worked in a fast paced deal oriented environment where multiple regulatory, financing and liquidity challenges had to be mitigated for prudent investment recommendation. This required supervision of cross functional teams to develop a view on the deal and thorough analysis to identify value drivers that may maximize returns."
good,I was able to work my way up from the bottom of the operations department - great advancement opportunities. This company is no longer in operation in Tonawanda.
good,"typical corporation you were just a number in a computer and as long as you did your job you were ok ,i cannot speak for upper management but it seemed to me it was pass the buck down until some one paid for the mistake ? the HR dept. was put under pressure to reduce cost of medical insurance and that caused a lot of grief throughout the company ,"
good,"Responsible for complete Big Data Administration."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my job.  I enjoy handling situations that arise that I know I can help resolve with customers or hr questions.  "
good,I have had a lot of good times and made many good friends thru the years. I have learned a lot thru the years to sharpen my electrical & mechanical skills. This plant has fed and clothed my family for 30 years.
good,Layoff after merger with my company - didn't stay long after merger
good,"They send you in areas where no ones interested, which means you have to work 10 times harder and still sometimes youll go home with nothing, which makes home life harder."
good,"Everyday was an adventure, truly enjoyed working there.  I worked with a team that was hard working and innovative.  We were all sad when the team was dissoved and laid off."
good,People are great and certain managers are too. Pay became better but the company now is going through big layoffs and than started hiring for the same position they laid people off from.
good,The company as a whole is at a point to where there have been lay offs and a lot of upper management changes.  Future is uncertian in a lot of parts of this company
good,NRG is a company that is constantly changing. Because the company is always changing you may find yourself with new opportunities. The pay and benefits are good.
good,"Shift work, 6 to 2, 2 to 10, 10 to 6. Good group of guys to work with. everyone is willing to help each other. Supervisors were very nice and willing to help if needed. There was a lot of equipment operation daily moving coal. I think management could have been a lot better."
good,A couple of activist investors came in and purchased 10% of the stocks.  They threatened the company and demanded to be on the board.  Of course the company obliged.  The CEO has now become incompetent and incapable of making any decisions.  He is nothing more than a puppet.
good,"Working here you are hired through a temp agency, but once you become permanent you get great benefits - medical, dental, vision, 401K, tuition reimbursement. Its best to keep yourself out there and make it known you want to advance. Otherwise you could remain stagnant in the same position."
good,"NRG is a large company with a startup's work culture. They expect their employees to think quickly on their feet and take initiative to improve their work product and develop new tools . "
good,"On a given day; you answer to six different bosses. They all expect you to come to them for input and in most cases the answers conflict. Training consists of a list of about 500 items that require 2 signatures each. This would be a great process if getting signatures wasn't the focus. Gaining actual working knowledge of the position suffers when everyone wants to rush through this process. After signatures are received you face a gauntlet of questions in ""the board"" which... no matter what they tell you at the start of it... does hold your fate. This whole process would be great if it was handled the way it should be. Instead of a way to help you succeed, they have turned it into another way to watch you fail. They make a game of that. "
good,I enjoyed my 24 year career at the former companies before the merger of NRG.  I would have loved to continue my career if I had the opportunity but my position was transitioned out due to the merger.
good,"Complication work."
good,NRG is currently going through management transformation which can create confusion except that it’s a good company to work for. Usually the teams across the company are fun to work with
good,"NRG was very good to me for several years, but after I moved to the Solar group in NRG i felt like I was an outsider. Although I had given them the better part of 6 years, they did not attempt to re-assign when they closed the Solar office. I had excellent reviews at every performance review and did a lot for the company so I thought that was a slap in the face. Before I moved to Solar, I thought the growth opportunity was endless, but it was cut short based on my one move."
good,It was a good place to work.  The culture was a bit cut throat.  Advancement was non existent. The management team had big dreams but little focus and poor execution.
good,You have to be able to be nimble and wear many hats if you plan to succeed here. The environment is also very fast paced and often times ambiguous in the things you need to get done. You must be able to take initiative on your own as well.
good,"I'm a contractor so I don't have much feedback to offer from an company employee standpoint.  However, I enjoy having a flexible schedule.  Its an open work space environment and everyone does their own thing.  At times I like that and other times I don't."
good,"I worked on various national contracts that were out of date with our legal department and vendors.  This was a company that had just purchased 8 power plants, so the contracts were important to get updated so all plants across the country could be in a better buying position with their material and services.  The co-workers were good professionals who were contractors like myself.  They had been in procurement for many years and new what they were doing.  The hardest part of this job, was trying to get workable contract agreement with large vendors who didn't want to change anything.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning what the power plants needed and working with the legal department.  The people were great to work with also."
good,"NRG works safe and promotes a safe environment to work. Room for advancement, written procedures and what is expected of employees."
good,"great company to work with, they do give you incentive checks. But training could be better if it’s actually trained the right way by qualified personnel."
good,Anything and everything very busy day flew by. Heavy finance and interesting work that is a learning environment. Challenging environment by any standards and it will not be routine.
good,"Working as a employee for NRG reliant energy can be stressful and dangerous due to the fact that your knocking on strangers doors all day . Getting home late and working in the cold, rain,snow,or heat can be an issue as well . Although the benefits are good.  Weekly pay. a lot of traveling.lots of money to be made"
good,Management typlically is non supportive and unwilling to provide assistance necessary for success in my current position.
good,"	4+ years’ experience as a Mechanical Engineer in the field of technologies and system design including test fixtures, programming languages, 3D printing, CAD, data acquisition/experiment techniques, drafting, project management and production environments. "
good,"Spent 28 years with the Co. and went from Bankruptcy to fortune 250 Co. to the forced breakup by hostile investment group."
good,"I liked working here, but there is no set timeframe on when you would get full benefits. This means no paid time off even on holidays and no health benefits either."
good,"Loved the people I worked with, but lived in fear of being laid off all the time...then after 13 years it happened.  But if it wasn't a pretty decent company to work for, I certainly would not have stayed so long and been disappointed when they closed our office and we were laid off."
good,"Flexible schedule, upward mobility is difficult. There are many programs to get involved in at NRG, like the march of dimes fundraisers and the MS 150 ride team."
good,your salary and culture experience depends on the department that you work in. i worked in sales and my direct supervisor was awesome but the higher levels were not great.
good,"Very good paying job,  work enviroment is very friendly, travel from plant to plant, nice never actually doing the exact same job twice. Good place to work, only down fall, due to company position & cuts, lost my job"
good,a good place to work.  work life balance is there...   freedom to your work is there.  people are friendly and helpful.  training is minimal for new employees
good,NRG is company on the move up. CEO has a vision to  expand. Would love if there were more job opportunties outside of Princeton  & Houston
good,"The office of Bowline in west Haverstraw where I worked was great. Managers and staff was very nice to work with. Its a low pace, very relaxed unless we had event or union meetings. For Administrative positions there was not much carrier advance but for an entry level its a good experience and great pay."
good,"Good company to work for.  In my experience, moral and a team atmosphere were excellent.  Somewhat flexible in work schedule with good management.  Not a lot of success trying to contribute to process improvement."
good,Good place to start out at.  Work was fun and challenging.  Some difficulty in being able to advance. There is a silo effect where your boss does not always want to let you go to other departments if you are key in theirs.
good,"Lots of work pressure but steep learning curve! Though my immediate manager was extremely demanding, the senior management was very erudite and exceptionally encouraging!"
good,could be better with  clear direction for the company as part of corporate investment group forcing sale of assetts- structure changes could be in future.
good,"what i really  found out was that this was a time management ,  & reviewing ,  your self the performance  , so you critiqued yourself , but ther was a lack of training"
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy fast-paced challenging responsibilities. If you can embrace change and non-routine environments, this is the ideal place for you."
good,"Outstanding co workers. Loved the job itself. Disagreed how management treated there workers. Pay was on the lower end but made up lost wages with a tremendous amount of over time, weekends and some holidays."
good,"NRG provided a nice atmosphere to work in everyday. I enjoyed working with my co workers everyday."
good,It was a rewarding company to work for if you are interested in trading commodities.  It was a great experience to be apart the company's growing environment.
good,A typical day is processing enrollments for 3 lines of business. Reliant Green Mountain and Cirro Energy management was ok think trhey could do things differently but overall they were good at their job co workers pretty much stayed to themselves. The hardest part was when calls were slow and they letting people go home early the most enjoyable part is people knowing you are good at your job
good,"NRG Energy is a great company, although my division Renew, has been impacted by a reorg, which has essentially, eliminated the original core team and many outstanding employees.  Our super star team generated 550 million in yearly earnings for the company over the next 20 years, in Power Purchase Agreements.  Our Solar/Wind division will be combined with 3 other Renewable energy divisions and sold, although NRG Energy will retain a minor share.  "
good,This is a very fast paced department that is best fit if you are a self starter and do not need guidance on day to day job duties.
good,"It is the company very one could hone their skills, i felt very extol work this company."
good,"Your success at NRG will be driven by your manager.  If you're on the wrong team, or if your manager falls out of favor...good luck.  That said, middle management (Manager and below) doesn't carry much authority, as most decisions are made at the Director level."
good,"This company is no longer in business. Prior to leaving the company (moved to another state), a new executive manager took over and moved the company to the east coast (from Minnesota) and most of my co workers were left without a job. The business was then sold soon after."
good,Great job with good benefits. Management is a bit over the top with most things but overall a great place to earn a living and learn a skilled trade you can take with you
good,"I have learnt a lot working at this company."
good,"Due to the rapid changes of fuel commodity prices, everything was in the moment and rapidly changing.  Tightly controlled by managers and those with connections to the top."
good,"The job pays well but as you see I call it a job and not a career. The management staff here is horrible, no backbone. Management is consistently inconsistent with poor communication skills."
good,"It's a good job to have. Working here was a growing opportunity for me. daily tasks were pretty easy, there were different nationalities working for this company so the cafeteria was multi-cultured with their food selections"
good,Good solid organization that is innovative and forward thinking.
good,I would have remained had I not been laid off by a subsidiary company. I worked for a partner company called Green mountain energy that is now in the process of closing it's doors
good,"NRG has been a great place to learn about all types of generating units from coal fired, gas fired, gas turbines, drum boilers, super critical boilers and more....I have learned and worked on all of them and continue to learn more every single day."
good,"Overall, a good place to work.  There are a lot of silos where everyone keeps information to themselves so they won't lose their job in another round of layoffs.  Good bonus program but took away employee stock purchase plan (at 15% discount), stock awards to everyone, and annual one-time extra contribution to your 401k."
good,"The company was a fun and great place to work.  The employees are mostly friendly and help each other out as needed.  Travel and professional meeting attendance was always available."
good,"good company to work for as an engineer, well diversified problems for an engineer to get involved with.  no lack of work.  no lack of support from the engineering to help solve issues."
good,"I had to travel a lot and didn't really like that aspect, but had fun with my co workers anyway. Driven environment and very constructive team everyone working towards the same goal."
good,NRG is a great place to work and develop your career.  They allow you to grow and develop your career path you desire and fits your long term goals. NRG has a great corporate culture.
good,Work environment is an okay place to work. You are challenged from day to day with different tasks preformed throughout the plant. I recommend this employer.
good,"Culture is laid back and yet progressive and innovative.  Be prepared to jump in and swim, as things change often. Community and customer focused. Thoughtful leadership. Great people and opportunities, take advantage of all of it."
good,"24- hr senior asset optiminization  position with  NRG in New Jersey.  Oversees, west coast assets. Each shift 12 hr day or night with 5 person team working the west desk"
good,i love my job at nrg but with todays war on coal and the price of other options in the energy sector it makes it hard for the coal fired plant to compete
good,"This division no longer exists, but it was a great opportunity to be a part of something larger, and have great impact on the overall community as a whole."
good,I learned a great deal in the 31 years I worked there.  My co-workes where very helpful to me learning many different jobs.  The management treated me well with a great deal of respect.
good,"Manage multiple Retail Electric Providers and other LOBS."
good,"Very progressive company, good pay and benefits. Room to grow inside the company. New direction from the new CEO is refreshing and I see NRG heading in a very positive direction."
good,"With all the recent layoffs and turn over, organization is still shifting and lots of un-easy feeling in the air."
good,Good company to work for. Company is expanding in new energy and green energy programs and products etc. Company has many areas to work in the US.
good,"Flexible hours."
good,This is a great place to work and learn. A person with technical skill can advance and improve on their skills.  The company is really behind the employee and safety is first all the time.
good,"I worked in several different positions during my 28 years of employment , advancing in every position. A typical day brought nothing typical, always changing demands, responsibilities, directives and operational requirements. In my last 8 years of employment in the Safety Managers position, I had 4 different Corporate Directors Of Safety that I reported to. This was quite beneficial to me because each had their own style, vision and philosophy of how overall Safety Goals would be achieved. I experienced a broad range of philosophy. All Corporate Directors Of Safety wanted the same final outcome, just very different ways of getting there. I gained many experiences from this. My direct co-workers were sincere and many faces changed as each new Corporate Director entered or exited. It became challenging to build a cohesive team. As Regional Safety Manager, I would instill upon the fleets Plant Managers and Supervisors the vision of each of the different Corporate Safety Directors. Even though each Vision and Safety Program were different, the final goal was always the same, ""An Injury Free Work Place"". With a multitude of daily Operational responsibilities that the Plant Managers and Supervisors have, a new Safety Program and philosophy was not always embraced. I enjoyed getting the skilled trades involved in making some of the decisions and input as to what makes a successful Safety Program and initiatives."
good,"Coworkers are generally great, love to talk and hold conversations, the people make this such an easy place to work in. youll love coming to work, the location is great"
good,"As a Plant Engineer, conducted projects/ outages related to reliability of the plant with much success. Conducted safety aboard meetings  with contractors and co-workers example: LOTOs, confined space, fall protection, hearing protection, respirator usage, and specific job briefing meetings. Conducting meetings with co-workers was a challenge with schedules involved. Meeting different people was a big benefit."
good,NRG is a company that is at the forefront of changing how people and businesses use electricity.  A solid financial footing and appetite for growth make NRG a dynamic place to work.  The patchwork of companies they have acquired over the past 4 years though can create as many challenges as opportunities.
good,Nrg is transforming and using more Robotic automation processes. I was able to start in the call center and move up to a permanent position after bring a contractor for 1 year.
good,"NRG has a strong safety culture.  ""Safety over production"" was very clearly communicated on a daily basis."
good,This was agreat place to work at. The coworkers were awesome. And the bosses were great people not ur typical yes men. I actually enjoyed goin to work here ervday.
good,A lot of competition due to the size of the company and the tenure of many employees.  The business flows from good to bad and back again depending on the decisions made by a select few of management as opposed to production of overall work staff.  Great benefits.
good,"Great place to work.  People are smart and the atmosphere is enjoyable.  There is always something new to do and new to learn."
good,"Great company to work for. and great opportunities to learn and grow. great benefits and very good bonus.  However, with new company philosophy of focusing on retail market and cutting down on generation and not able to aggressively win projects..will make difficult if you are trying to advance in engineering and technical areas."
good,I worked at NRG for many years and it was always a fast paced environment. Things changed quickly and you have to be on your toes. Much of the time was working in an open concept office.
good,"NRG is a great place to work.  You are not micro-managed and they trust you to do your job.  Hours are flexible, pay is exceptional and the people are fantastic."
good,Structured work environment.  Office environment is not friendly.  If you're not in the inner circle do your best at what you do and keep your head down or get out.  Corporate high school.
good,Nrg has been a good stable company to work for. Pay is excellent and benefits are in line with the industry standards. Promotion seems to come from with in and advancement is available.
good,"NRG was very flexible and provided a vast amount of work experience in areas such as network/telecommunications, trade floor compliance, and software licensing compliance."
good,"A day in the life of an NRG sales associate consisted of getting to work at 2 pm, minimum one meeting with the team leader and then breaking huddle to go out and go door to door. The environment was very nice and welcoming."
good,Competitive company with mostly younger employees in the 20s & 30s.  In the heart of the financial district in San Francisco with easy public transportation access.
good,"Love my department and executive I work for- has created a great balance of high achievement yet focus on work life balance."
good,NRG was not without it's issues but the management team made it easy and fun. Changes are never easy in an company but i was willing to go with the flow and train to be what NRG saw our plant as becoming.
good,"NRG is a great company to work for, there are excellent benefits especially the 401K and Stock options. The safety culture is strong, and hard work doesn't go unnoticed."
good,A typical day at work I consider to be very routine...It's a very diverse company and strives for all employees to focus on how to add value to the company...
good,"I enjoy my job at NRG/Energy Plus, however, the commute is getting to be too much - 2 hours each way.  Other than that I enjoy the autonomy and accountability.  The culture of continuous improvement is truly exciting, as is our rapid market expansion.  The culture has shifted some to a more hierarchical structure from a flat start up culture, but there is still room to innovate.  Great people to work with - it's really just the commute that has me ready to move on. "
good,"Overall Great company to work for, was sad when they announced that our plant would be closing. Was hoping for long position in the area in which I lived."
good,The commission structure was okay base + commission + overide as manager. Also completely flexible hours. Job culture was great too. Always had access to other managers if you need help.
good,"Typical corporate environment. "
good,"I was a contractor so I didn't get all of the bells and whistles of a full-time NRG employee. However, their employees and lives outside of work seem really important to the company and want to make sure people get work done while also taking care of what they need to. I liked my team a lot just not my commute."
good,"Company has undergone significant changes in a short amount of time, including two major restructures and layoffs. Employees are treated well but there is a lack of imagination."
good,"During my time at NRG, we were very serious about developing long term, advisory relationships with our customers.  I have worked at companies in which the relationship development attitude was very short sighted."
good,"Enjoyed my time there. Good culture and learned a lot. Provided me with the fundamentals to do well in my current role, as well as a strong network to carry me throughout my career."
good,Most of my time was spent traveling to power plant locations.  I enjoyed the travel and visiting my clients at their locations although the issues at these plants were sometimes pretty serious and required lengthy investigations and difficult recommendations.
good,"Good people, challenging work, lots to learn. NRG was a great place to grow. The hours could be long and the stress about meeting timelines was intense but the compensation was first rate."
good,"As an internal controls intern, my manager tried to expose me to areas within the company that was applicable to my studies. Everyone in the group worked with me and were were very accommodating when it came to answering my questions."
good,"There was never a dull moment. Long-term projects were continually interrupted with emergencies, giving me a real sense of purpose and urgency. Responsibilities covered the whole range of power plant skills and technologies, with an open hierarchy at the plants that encouraged all employees to participate in solutions. This last sentence encapsulates the good, the bad, and the ugly of working with NRG. I was sorry that financial difficulties forced them to cut back the engineering team, but grateful for the chance to work at a dream job."
good,"VERY clique-ish. If you don't get along with people on your team, it can be hard to fit in with the employee culture here. Outside of your team, people are not very friendly. That said, pretty chill place to work. If you are focused on your career and have goals, this may not be a deal-breaker for you. This goes for the Philly office only. Princeton may be different. The culture in the Philly office stems from the start-up mentality (EnergyPlus days). Princeton definitely is a bit more professional and corporate with more polish."
good,"Once you understood what was going on and who to talk to to get your issues resolved, the job was really pretty easy. Down side was the company is very siloed. Little opportunity for development even though they tried to pretend and say there were."
good,NRG can be a good place to work. The overall work future is more dictated by the environmental and political culture of the state of California. Work positions have shrunk over the years to that of a skeleton crew.
good,"This is a small power plant in Harrisburg, PA. The environment was like a family with a small group of employees. The pay was good and the benefits sufficient."
good,I have enjoyed working with and for the Gulf Coast region management team. They are realistic with expectations while holding  employees to high standards.
good,"This place is great to grow"
good,"The typical day at NRG is filled with a wide range of projects to work on, everything from technology implementaitons to SharePoint projects, to Microgrids to Business acquisition.  Truely a dynamic place to work."
good,"The caliber of employees this company hires. I’ve noticed it and our clients notice it. Highquality"
good,I had a great experience at NRG. There are allot of great people and the company is growing. The Sales and Use Tax was outsourced. The job was great because I was able to learn allot about the Power Industry and the different types of returns related to the business.
good,"great work environment."
good,"I learned everything i needed to learn to grow as a wind tech with NRG."
good,I enjoyed my time working there even though it was short' if i could i would definitely would work there again. The management was great and they even had little outings that was fun and they treated everyone like family.
good,"family oriented, collaborative working environment, high career advancement, learning a lot, good management, paid-time off, good people, and fun working environment"
good,A good place to work at in the area we live. A strong safety culture along with strong enviroment operating levels. working in Power Plants in 4 states has been a rewarding career that I truly still enjoy.
good,"Conducted legal research on assigned topics and prepared legal memoranda summarizing research, contracts, pleadings, depositions, real estate documents, statutes, laws, and regulations; prepared draft pleadings, finalized and submitted filings to various courts and administrative agencies; assisted General Counsel in managing law firm relationships, including drafting of retention agreements, processing bills for payment, preparing budgets and monthly accruals; assisted General Counsel and West Region staff to organize and manage legal documents in accordance with the NRG document retention policy; assisted Director of Community Relations on projects related to local, state, and federal governmental relations on issues important to NRG and NRG West; assisted General Counsel and Director of Community Relations with scheduling, travel, expenses, and correspondence. Boss was very patience and eager to teach me various aspects of law and energy business."
good,Work day was from 7-3:30 with some folks working 8-4. Worked wit a great bunch of folks that helped in gaining experience in the accounting profession.
good,"God Company to work for if you get into the right department. Work is fact paced, lots of deadlines and on going career training is required. Minimal room for advancement"
good,"Ive been very fortunate to work many years at NRG - very dynamic and busy organization in the energy industry. Has recently transformed the businesses to scale back and refocus on its next venture which is mostly retail customers around Houston "
good,"The project that i have worked was a integration with third part tools, which was a bit complex at the beginning but got better later."
good,"Large generating facility with equipment dating from the late 1930's up to modern times.  Facility is undermanned to maintain all working equipment properly.  Work ranges from routine PM's, new installation, troubleshooting and repair."
good,"Interesting work from technical perspective."
good,Productive.  Very nice co-workers always willing to help each other out.  shootouts when we did a good job.  work place felt safe.  the hard part of the job was when we had to speak with a customer that is not able to pay a bill and there is nothing we can do for them.  getting off the phone hopping the best for them.
good,"For the over 10 years of work experience at the Boston Edison Mission Energy/Boston Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, I found it to be a very team oriented environment.  The job was quite satisfying."
good,"I was provided a great deal of flexibility at NRG.  TEAM is the key at NRG, a highly matrix'd organization. Cross functional business groups were highly collaborative. Each day I had the opportunity to serve my internal clients in the way I saw fit to the ever changing day-to-day goals. Empowered to do the right thing to best drive value. "
good,This company is a good company to work for. Especially at the plant level. The SLT are typically available and take care of the employees to the best of their ability.
good,"There was never a dull moment. Long-term projects were continually interrupted with emergencies, giving me a real sense of purpose and urgency. Responsibilities covered the whole range of power plant skills and technologies, with an open hierarchy at the plants that encouraged all employees to participate in solutions. This last sentence encapsulates the good, the bad, and the ugly of working with NRG. I was sorry that financial difficulties forced them to cut back the engineering team, but grateful for the chance to work at a dream job."
good,hard work but honest made me feel like i was worth something ;and everyone I work with had smile so that always put me in a good mood.
good,"Overall, the company is very nice to work for.  The people are friendly, and the work can be self-paced, as long as an appropriate end result is produced.  The management is very serious about safety of the employees, and everyone is active in maintaining that safety.  The only disadvantage would be to those seeking rapid advancement.  There are few opportunities for advancement, only really appearing when a lifelong employee retires.  That being said, if you are looking for job security and are a good worker, you will not have a problem keeping a job."
good,"Every day was busy and productive day. I learned a lot working with SAP, Oracle, Business workplace. Co workers where a great joy to work with and we always worked as a team. There was never a hard part of my job while there for 11 years, I approached every new assignment with a positive attitude. Most enjoyable part of my job was the location,"
good,I really enjoyed working for this company.  THey were flexible with my need for a part-time work schedule
good,"A day at NRG is very busy, challenged but fun. We are busy with the daily work to ensure all tasks are done by the end of the day. It challenges because system issues or human errors arise every day. We always have things to do and know for sure the company still needs us tomorrow. The coworkers are charming, the relationships go well and the managers are understanding. It also provides pretty good benefits in terms of vacation, retirement plan and health care."
good,Co-workers were easy to get a long with. management was was helpful and easy to work with.
good,"A great place to work, fun, family oriented, and community involved. Room for advancement and multiple ways to learn through training and alternative training options."
good,I have grown to be a major asset to my current company. I have worked very hard to prove myself that I belong in a leadership role. I am the right hand to my immediate supervisor that manage a team of 22 agents on a daily bases. Maintain positive and projective numbers for the company. I enjoy assisting/managing the team with their daily tasks that meet business rules.
good,"The initial period can be a bit challenging, no training,  must be proactive and unafraid to ask for assistance and where to/how to.  Your coworkers are your best resources and with few exceptions, are more than willing to help you succeed.  "
good,A typical day at work is handling a large amount of incoming calls but now and then dealing with the unexpected. I learned to deal with different type of customers. The hardest part was even though I went out of my way to help a customer I could not find a solution to their problem which was out of my control. I loved to help and get feedback from my coworkers and superiors it helped me grow as a person and customer service rep.
good,"Easy going work environment, but lack of direction from managment."
good,"While work life balance can be a challenge depending on the position and level you are in, there are high caliber people working there and most roles entail high caliber work.  Location isn't in a major city."
good,My current & previous manager are really enjoyable to work with. They are very helpful in work matters or any matters. They have an open door policy. With a great since of work life balance.
good,"Would return for another job if it were available but sad to say the project completed early and all contractors left to other jobs, me included. Maybe next time it will be longer."
good,"The company is well run by top management. I have been able to advanced into my 3rd different position in 4 years. From retail to corporate to power plant. There are several opportunies in different business segments such as solar, electric vehicles, retail(Reliant), & others."
good,"NRG was a good place to work if you are will to work there are many options for advancement. processes are slow due to the ""big business"" process. "
good,"Good Place to work Great pay and benefits, enjoy working here.  People treat you well, and are interested in your advancement.  Lots of internal jobs if interested."
good,"For the most part we stand outside places like HEB and pitch clean energy to people who have other companies such as TXU, Reliant, Amigo Energy, Ambitt, etc. We also work events sometimes and the pay is good if you are good. In other words. it depends on you. If you can get sales, you get a fat check, but if you don't.... then you suffer lol"
good,Great company to work in. Energy Domain. Colleagues were excellent.
good,it was my second job and I my skills were built from this job. I  used to love this company very much.
good,Enjoyable job with advancement opportunity. I learned about the energy market and different functions within the industry. Management was always available for support. My coworkers were like family. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the public.
good,The job was a great job to have just not everyone wants to sign up so that was just the hardest part to get customers to try and sign up to lower there national grid bill.
good,In order to work for a company like NRG you should be familiar with working for a company that is ever changing. The company changes its goals for employees monthly.
good,"Great fun place to work, learn and grow. Great vision from leadership."
good,"Stage building is fun. Takes a lot of team work. The hardest part of the job is laying the panels down. Managment is very nice and helpful. Workplace is amazing, the bathrooms a huge and theres so many around you! Ive learned more about team work working here. The most enjoyable part is sometimes you get to watch the show for free!"
good,Maintenance technician electrician/ Instrument Technician/ Analyzer Technician very pleased with the company and all employees I would go back to with them tomorrow if I could
good,a great place to work they have exciting lunch programs for associates which includes desserts.  everyone is working hard to keep their jobs looking to merge
good,"I loved this job as it is a great job for a thinker. I was able to jump around to a few positions before I was let go because of my own personal issues. Was my fault, not the company."
good,I really enjoyed this place other then managers and ppl that is over you. Besides that this place was wonderful. The environment was peaceful for the most part
good,Enjoyable company to work for. As an operator the day is pretty standard. Can be fast paced at times. We always value safety over production. As an operator we work swing shifts.
good,Reliant Energy/NRG was a great place to work. Although at times working in a call-center became pretty chaos due to the high call volume at times during peek months; working at Reliant allowed the opportunity for growth when it came to customer service.  One Stop Shop; Is what we called it!!
good,Very nice environment to work. Fast pace & calls are back to back. pros was the base pay but you don't get much of raise working here. You also receive a monthly bonus depending on how many sales you make
good,"Great company to work for. Typical day involves interacting with my agents, helping increase sales, answering and formulating e-mails, gaining and maintaining new partnerships, and creating reports."
good,While interning at NRG Energy: Indian River Generating Station I gained valuable information on how real work engineering problems are solved. I also learned how an engineering team operates in the real world. Many disciplines learned in the classroom were demonstrated in principle while working in the field.
good,"Good salary, good coworkers, constantly changing workplace. High performance solar arrays and technology providing sound fundamental background into the renewable energy industry and political uptake of these cleantech solutions."
good,NRG is a good place / company to work for. they are employee career minded. I would recommend employment to anyone. they are willing to stand by their employees.
good,Management is good. Employees are hard working and it is an excellent place to work.
good,Position required attention to detail and the ability to adapt to customer personalities to provide service
good,Steady work and good money. Work was never random unless a unit came down at the plant. Bean counters in Houston were the biggest issue holding the company back.
good,"busy balance between administrative duties, and observing maintenance activities in the plant."
good,I really enjoyed my time as a Contractor there. I would recommend them to hire the contractors they have trained rather than find under qualified candidates.
good,"Great job for the pay. Good benefits. Hard dirty work in extreme environments. You will use all the skills you have everyday. Everyday was different, from turbine tear downs to building new buildings, installing piping systems to working on the coal yard equipment.  Scheduling is unpredictable. Hard to plan your life around this job. Feast or famine sometimes."
good,"Walk down the plant for any issues existing regarding safety and environmental and equipment. Learned a lot about the environment regarding the ocean water we used for cooling equipment. Management was strong on safety. Work place culture was safety over production. Driving 104 miles to work was hard, especially in traffic. Most enjoyable was watching the ocean waves from power plant smoke stack."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. They treated me fairly when I left work there! I was let go due to my own personal trouble and they understood!Thank you NRG
good,My typical day at work is balanced.  I have learned a lot about the retail market.  The culture is diverse.  I enjoy assisting external and internal customers.
good,"NRG is at the forefront of changing how people think about and use energy. Whether as the largest solar power developer in the country, by building the nation’s first privately funded electric vehicle charging infrastructure or by giving customers the latest smart energy solutions to better manage their energy use, NRG is a pioneer in developing cleaner and smarter energy choices for our customers."
good,Was A Fun Work Place Must Stand On Your Feet All Day Plenty Of Water to Drink if Working Outside Not A Hard Job At All And The Management Was Very Nice
good,This is a good job to start out in the professional world. I enjoy my supervisors. The work is rewarding. I would recommend this to people who have just graduated.
good,"The benefits were good and plenty of good opportunity's, good place to work.  My experience working on these wind turbines was a dream job when i started and still is."
good,"Great co-workers"
good,Challenging project however great support from IT management to get the job done.  Well compensated with good rate for strong Concultant.
good,"The Past 8 Years Have Been Great For Me And My Family... Day to day jobs change , not 1 day is the same. Management members are great to work for as well as my coworkers."
good,"I find this place a friendly, calm place to work. It's not to busy nor is it too boring. I find all the people here polite and very charming. I have nothing bad to say about the location nor the employees or Clients. However, I think the pay is not so good. Other than that it is a great place to be employed."
good,Maintain plant reliability and ensure proper equipment operation. Budget development and project implementaton
good,One of the best places I have worked. Need to update there training program. Need to hire more people. Needs to be more sustainable for the future. Coal needs to be our future energy source.
good,"Gret people to work with, everyone will be treated as a family. Of course, there are moments when you'll be struggling and the work is going to pile up. Don't hesitate to work there, if you see there are a massive hiring process and new people be aware that a major layoff is going to occur in the near 2-3 months. lol"
good,"I worked as a TEMP at NRG for a 6 month project. I learned a great deal and had the opportunity to work on several side projects."
good,NRG always tried its best to keep their employees happy. The building was very modern as nd up to date with new features. Availability to Houston tunnels.
good,I overall thought it was a very relaxed place to work there was not too much pressure to be at your desk for 16 straight hours. People expected you to be human
good,"Solid company to work with, many opportunities. My work was as a contractor. Due to mergers and acquisitions, NRG acquired 5-7 additional energy companies, and did not renew contract for all in the role."
good,"Fast pace, high output environment"
good,Productive and fun workplace for 12 years just had tough luck with our cogen partner went bankrupt so took us down with them.over all it was a great exprience and great plant
good,"Working at NRG Energy in Minneapolis MN, was one of the better experiences of my life.  The management was fair and friendly, the job duties were well defined, and the work days were for the most part stress free."
good,"Have fun with your job , enjoy your customers guide them in the knowledge of your product and why they should which to your company. .what benefits your company has over the other"
good,"All in all, my position is great. I have smart people around me and a dynamic atmosphere to work. The only real setback is that travel is upwards of 75% and it is throughout the entire U.S. I spend weeks away from my family and it is difficult."
good,"I started at the power plant as painter. I later bid myself as a mechanic / Welder, then SDG&E sold the power plant the NRG at that time i went into operations as described in my resume. I recieved an abundance of knowledge and training throughout the years with the only downside being with working rotating shifts."
good,"Although I only worked a temporary position for three months, this was the most amazing place to work. During that three months I never was treated as just a temporary employee, I was part of the team. From day one, my name was on the cube, I had a dedicated phone line, email already set up, and when small motivational gifts were given to the employees I was included. This was the most non stressed atmosphere I have ever worked in, start and end times were very flexible, everything was based on team work, and employees were respected by the company and fellow employees."
good,"Fast growing so there is very little HR or SAP help. The training is lacking and it is hard to get credentials. "
good,A typical day at Nrg Energy would be work all day you do get your breaks but Desktop Support Team at Nrg Energy has allot of work we provide Support to a large number of users across alll 50 states and you have to be able to work with little or no supervision.The work environment is great co workers are always willing to help and work well as a Team.
good,"Excellent place to work. Great co-workers"
good,So the job paid about 13.80 an hour and if you cant tale getting yelled at by customers or being able to answer all of questions under pressure then this is not the job for you the management is amazing they work with you and honestly just want what's best for you and offer coaching every week Ieft due to my son oir baby sitter had quit cold Turkey so we I had to go
good,Come to work with a positive attitude and be open to feedback and you will fit right in. I love the culture and the continuously changing environment. Leadership is open to every idea and encourages innovation.
good,"Lots of calls, ,fixed schedules, routine job. If you work retail, there's sale goals every month. If you are tech support it's more of a routine jobs. Not much fun except for coworkers. One-hour lunch which is nice and great location in downtown Houston. But almost 50% of the company works as contractors which make the opportunities very competitive and not available to everyone."
good,I enjoyed my time at NRG and learned a great deal to further my career.  The people there were great and I had a very good manager who helped me along the way.
good,Great company to work for there biggest asset was there dedication to safety. Every morning they did a plant wide all hands on deck 15 minute stretching video that was mandatory.
good,"I have worked for them on a 3 month contract for years. The expectations are realistic and they are very appreciative of hard working people."
good,"It was a fun environment, but it can be very cut-throat. You have to meet weekly goals for sales, which can sometimes be stressful, but rewarding when you get your paycheck lol/"
good,Facinating place to work if you like power and controls. There was too much turn over in personel to keep any harmony.  I would like to have been in a position to make manager level changes to improve efficiency based on my experience from the front line.
good,All in all NRG is a good company to work for. it is a fair and balanced work place with opportunity. I really enjoy my job at Limestone Power Plant in Jewett Tx.
good,"I am lucky enough to be working under, in my opinion, one of the best managers. Very knowledgeable and very supportive. Work/life balance is great and they are very flexible with the schedule. The job itself is not hard, if the people surrounding you are helpful at the beginning."
good,A wide range of duties and assignments.
good,"Very friendly and great all around folks."
good,"I learned a lot about RPA UiPAth. Learnt about the infrastructure of UiPath, in relation to Orchestrator, machines, robots, processes etc. "
good,"Everyone here seems to get along great, from the entry level clerks to the upper and senior management level folks. In fact, I have seen many a senior manager ""get their hands dirty"" and work alongside their subordinates when IT deployments come through. The added value that the management places on their employees is top-notch, assuring that changes will come and go, but the employee value will always be here and can only go up. I really liked the discounted lunches being catered by many different downtown restaurants, so imagine having a nice lunch brought to you by Birraporetti's and only paying $1.55? Not too bad, right? And there are perks too for full-time employees too. Unfortunately as a contractor, I haven't received those benefits, but hoping to one day."
good,I worked twice ere at Noram which became Reliant as an employee. I went back to NRG in 2015 as a contractor.  Good company to work for.  Lots of opportunities to learn and develop new skill sets.
good,"NRG Energy is a great place to work. They have open office environment and fast-paced environment."
good,Fun place to work! The management is very understanding and allows you to do what you need to do when outside problems arise. I learned a lot about the solar industry.
good,NRG purchased the gulf coast assets about 12 years ago and they have been a great company to work for.  Unfortunately there was a reduction in staffing and I was given a severance package that was very generous.
good,NRG was a fun and relaxed job environment. However the industry and job requirements were detail oriented and there was little to no room for error. Overall Nrg is a great organization and I would look forward to working for them again as my time there was on Contract in which I was asked to return twice.
good,"Great place to work and great corporate culture. Green Mountain Energy provides adequate continuous training to all employees. Departments work well together and strive to accomplish joint tasks. Company has two headquarters, one in Houston TX and one in Princeton NJ"

good,great for travel and gaining experience in the gas compression and power generation field. it is difficult to be a family oriented person as you will be traveling often.
good,In ability to become permanent. makes it hard to want to stay at the company. The employees aren't just numbers they are people and management is friendly.
good,"I haven't been at NRG Energy for very long, but I have enjoyed my work experience so far.  Everyone is very nice, it's a more casual environment with an open concept.  One of the NRG office locations has senior staff intermingled in cubicles next to their support staff...it took a while to get used to, but the setup encourages teamwork and sharing of information."
good,It was a pleasure. The people were of various backgrounds and a real joy to work with.
good,"Day at work:"
good,"NRG changed my life for the better in many ways, socially, financially, and mentally. The managers here aren’t just role models but they are there to help when anything goes on in life.  hey have helped me grow into my true self. They care about all of their eomplpyees and that’s what made me love this job more then any of the ones I have had in the past. Between the competitive atmosphere and the quick routes to promotion through hard work, this company has pushed me not to just stay competitive in the work atmosphere but live a better life style out side of work as well."
good,A typical day would be pronouced pretty calm when you arrive. Very busy though everybody is very kind and welcoming. A fun job to have because it stay busy and I always had something to do. I'd refer friends and family to work at the nrg most definitly.
good,I was a temp employee at the Keystone Station for several years but only left for permanent employment elsewhere.

Management very intolerant of inmaturity and unprofessionalism and will purge those that are not up to the high standards and work ethic expected.

An on site electrician on site programmer and on site plant engineer.  All extremely knowledgeable and motivated.  This allows the operator to actually focus on plant operations.  I have worked at several plants and this one is ran very well by comparison.

good,"Very easy and laid back job, your just talking to people as they walk by you and you try and pitch them to switch the electric bill to NRG. But if your not a very talkative person or your more reserved like myself, then you won’t meet your daily goals and they will let you go."
good,"Great company to work for, great experience and hands on. Great management very enjoyable and very challenging. Everyday was a new learning experience."
good,The position entailed something that was not very meaningful and very stressful. It provided me a commission job and was very hard to maintained contacts with other people and there was a lot of loop holes once you signed an account to the point of you wont even earn enough money for a living.

I had to wait for security to let me back into the NOC and there for was let go. Overall Excellent company, great people and my boss A.J. Gelose is a great boss and a stand up guy. Highly recommended....."
good,"First time working through an agency, and I was very pleased with the way they were always taking care of each of their employees. The only reason I probably wouldn't work with an agency is because of the pay cut. But other than that, they are a great staffing agency."
good,Great place to work. The management is collaborative and the corporate culture is conducive to an open work environment. There is not much opportunity for advancement due to recent budget cuts but nice place to land a job.
good,"If i could continue to work for this company I absolutely would. The managers were great, many years of experience and very professional. There was always something to do and was rarely boring. I organized files, did payroll, and prepared all documents for their upcoming out tage. The compensation was great. I would highly recommend this company."

good,Gave me the opportunity to operate as a Shift Supervisor a 1700 Megawatt supercritical Generating Plant. All co-workers are very professional and are very proficient at what they do.
good,"I had a very demanding work schedule at Reliant. I had to prioritize every job assignment I was given because everything that I was responsible for was incredibly time sensitive. My work went straight to the director of billing and was then sent out to customers. While this seems like it could be stressful, it was actually the best opportunity of my professional experience so far. It enabled me to hold myself accountable for the structure of my day, without the need of supervision. I knew exactly what I needed to get done the minute I walked in the door and I excelled in my position tremendously. This job was a great experience for me. Due to a family emergency, I made the decision to leave my position at Reliant. If it had not been for that unfortunate circumstance, I would probably still be working with the company. But I took the whole experience as a sign that maybe I was meant to explore other opportunities."
