rating,review
bad,I worked here for 18 months and thought I mattered. Then my 13 year son died. I applied and got accepted for FMLA. The same day I was approved I was let go. So much for work/life balance. I simultaneously experienced two catastrophic events. This experience showed me what type of company I had been working for. .  all along.
bad,"Horrible management, compensation, and work life balance. Long hours, on call, terrible customers... I could go on and on and on but I won't. I do not recommend this company."
bad,"No work life balance, good ole boy culture, training that's worthless in the field, expected to know how to fix everything even though you haven't been trained on equipment, must rely on pictures and trial and error, micro managing,  GPS tracking your every move from start if day to end, management only cares about the numbers, and your productivity."
bad,They will lie to you about hours ans pay.  The amount of overtime can be dangerous as you are constantly driving.  I would not recommend this position to anyone.
bad,"My lead was constantly using profanity at me. Nonfter. "
bad,"worst employer I have ever worked for, 6 minutes loo break allowed for whole day. Shocking management style - I was let go because 1 caller said I was slurring my words and thought I was drunk which I certainly wasn't. I have neurological condition which affects my speech when I'm tired. No questions were asked just phone call from agency to say I was no longer required. Discrimination at its worst."
bad,I worked at the plant they shut down in Columbus ga. No one cared about there jobs and that made it so hard to get anything done. Managers literally left the plant during the day and told employees they just don't care anymore. I was pretty much left alone to my own devices unless a fellow employee needed help. I was hired as a quality analyst and did everything from throw trash away to creating an SOP
bad,"Sketchy interview through text and was emailed a check to deposit into my account for work materials, just to be told to go to Walmart and buy gift cards... this is a scam off of a real company."
bad,"I was transferd into the company,my contract was good . I still took a payout and left"
bad,"Don't work for this people only cares about their self and to make money slave drivers , look for a real job somewhere else don't come to work for them"
bad,The NCR environment is an environment that stifles creativity.   There is change needed at this organization but unfortunately the product management teams don't want to be current and change to build outstanding superior products.
bad,"Poor management ( yes you in redditch birmingham )"
bad,"You will not get paid overtime if you're paid hourly.. If you work 50 hours a week you will only get paid for 40. This is a big deal as over a month you will work an extra 40 hours on top of your 40 hours and will not get paid.  Very sad indeed!"
bad,The management would often put all of the stress of deadlines onto the assembly line workers and the deadlines would often change with no notice and we would have to stay later to complete the new goals.  The plant was run so inefficiently that it eventually shut down.
bad,Not a good company to work for. My job was outsourced to India. NCR outsources any and every job they can to pay the lowest cost per hour. I would not recommend anyone to seek employment with NCR. Horrible Company.
bad,"There is NOTHING good I can say about the company.  Horrible management, you need to give your life to NCR as it is more important to the management than your family."
bad,They dont care about your work\life balance and they only thing important to the company is that the job is done.  You are constantly doing jobs that you are not qualified for and they then they punish you for not doing this correctly.
bad,"Don't care about skills experience or work ethic"
bad,"Worked for NCR for a little over four years during which I had 7 different managers.  If your position can be transferred to their Serbia office for 1/3 of the salary they will do it.......it happened to me twice.  There is no accountability for intermediate and senior management.  No employee is of any value.  Agree with another review that employees that do not contribute get to keep their jobs while they pile on the work to others with no consideration.  Raises, promotions or even department transfers are non-existent.  "
bad,"NCR wants to be a software as a service company, the ""Silicon Valley of the South"".  With the current leadership, business practices, ""benefits"" and antiquated and outdated policies, it will never get there.  It has taken 10+ years for the company to attempt to shift from hardware to software.  Sadly, the board is out of touch and the leaders (albiet all new ones) are still stuck in the 1960's."
bad,NCR corporation is too large.  If a company gets this size it's hard to manage all the moving parts. Therefore depending on what position you get hired into depends on if the company is a good fit.
bad,Poor Management within the ATL territory. SGM wants to grab every TM by the neck. Every TM is wagging his tale to keep his job and the TM doesn't care about his tech. Bottom line this is a micromanaging company.
bad,"Work is non stop and over 18 hours per day for the whole year. They don't care about your personnel life. Even on holidays and vacations, they will expect you to work."
bad,i worked a lot of overtime and very stressfull job. This company culture is very bad.The manager do not have good training.It is the hardest place to work
bad,"Do not work for ncr  very bad work life balance."
bad,"NCR doesnt care about their employees "
bad,"not a place to work, they are unorganized, it wasnt a clean place,the management was HORRIBLE, you work on a line making self checkout for stores.........."
bad,NCR's stated vision is lead as a market innovator however so many of the companies practices are manual in nature driven by spreadsheets with minimal automation. The level of redundancy for a company this size is astounding.
bad,"to start each day you look at the website to find a ticket saying where you are going to go and what will need to be done, you fill 3 or four tickets per day."
bad,"Management is a joke. I don’t have time for gossip, and the fire they put you through is definitely not worth the compensation. And they wonder why they have a 95% turnover rate. This place is a joke."
bad,"Management is not supportive and do not treat their employees well."
bad,"Overall it was a okay job. I would do it all over again, I learned a lot from  inventory to transfers to operate a machine, driving a fork lift meeting new people. It was a great experience!"
bad,"For a company that has been labeled ""Technologically Advanced"" the utter lack of communication between departments let alone other facilities and from the corporate management is appalling. Lost contracts due to misinforming customers, lack of inventory and order systems that communicate properly, and working daily with no idea of how many customer orders are coming that day makes managing Work flow, people and schedules almost impossible."
bad,a very hostile facility to work in.very stressful with a very low pay rate.a lot of bringing the employees self esteem down.management is horrible . The only thing that was worth learning is to stay to yourself.
bad,travail très agréable bonne entente avec les élevés. Beaucoup de choses promise par le patron mai jamais abouti .Aucune communication avec autre collègues très dommage.
bad,Under no circumstances do you want to work here. Your best bet is if jobseekers has sent you. You will get the job everyone gets took on as turn over of staff is nuts. Take the job then try to get sacked.
bad,"Stressful,unorganized management was poor. Tell you last minute that you have to work weekends.Does random lay-offs. Workplace was color separated with management."
bad,NCR provided me with a great knowledge of Point of Sales machines. although I had pretty stressful days because we had to meet a ridiculous amount of calls closed in a single day.
bad,Horrible place don't waste your time! Horrible hours out all day and night. Verbally abusive management staff. Low pay no raises. No lunch brakes no 15 min brakes. Constantly being sued by former employees. Usage work conditions. Company sends parts that they loose and hold you accountable for it.
bad,"Great work / life balance, focused on innovation, customer satisfaction, business and employee growth and enhancements; amazing benefits, knowledgeable people to work with..."
bad,I worked on there ATMs when I worked for Diebold so I can't say any thing about working there. But there ATM was ok it had some good points and bad ones
bad,"worst place to work with ever , bad management bad people bad schedule bad customers everything is woeful I will never recommend this company for any future job seekers ...TRUE"
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone wishing to develop a meaningful career. Mandatory overtime without notice. Very poor management. Training was the most basic available, although clients were sold specialist knowledge."
bad,Expect you to work your tail off. A lot of politics involved.. Easy work for not much money. A lot of driving which isn't bad but sometimes road conditions are not safe expect you to drive quickly to locations in the boonies.
bad,I use to work at NCR I just recently quit and they are horrible they do not care about their employees all that is important to them are their units that you have to get shipped out. You never know the time you getting off everyday and you won't know until that Friday before you get off of if you have to work that Saturday. They are very unorganized and they do things their way instead of the right way but taking all kinds of loopholes.. Their leadership is never no where to be found and they don't ever do what they promise to you and if your a contractor (temp) if your not hired within your first year they walk you out the door and end your assignment then tell you that you can reapply in 90 days.. If you want to work for somebody that doesn't care about you and give you no benefits until you get hired on permanently and can lay you off whenever they want too without a true reason and be treated like a slave then NCR is the place to go but I will NEVER work for them ever again...
bad,"I have never worked for a company that treated their employees like this one. No appreciation at all. They always talk about work life balance but there is none. You go in never knowing what time you're getting off. If you are to work the weekend, they don't tell you till Friday. The management is nothing short of joke. If more people would go to HR or higher on management and the employees there, it would be shut down. There were no benefits in working there. They work you till you are close to losing your sanity and still keep pushing you. It's all about quantity not quality. The employees are what get the orders done and out the door but it's the management team that reap the benefits. Will never work for this company again."
bad,Management is clueless and do care.  Upper managemnt is a joke.   There are better companies to work for.  Trust me.  I have worked  there for 5 years and I  am trying to figure it out why I  waited so long to leave. I am at a lot better place now.
bad,"Worst company to work for. Disorganized, Dishonest, unprofessional "
bad,"Use to be a fun place to work, "
bad,They show favoritism and they are very unprofessional. The men are inappropriate at times and they will lay you off for no valid reason at any given time.
bad,"Hated the Management, people, attitudes and unconcern of training us to fit in with them. Nobody ever had time to stop and train us on building or testing of their products or processes. They got our newest products that were ready to hit the market and all of our knowledge we had and sent us on our merry way."
bad,"Expected to work night and days in same  week sometimes in same day. No time to adjust to schedule, ruined my health. Managers cared less had to make there numbers. When interviewed I was asked if I was sent to training if I would learn or party. I passed all courses and tests but at training all I found were DRUNK NCR employees. So if you are looking to party this company is for you."
bad,"The Management part is very bad."
bad,"Don't bother with this company, they don't care about there employees, they hire through a temp first to see if they like you or if you are really good they will not promote you so that you can work more hours for them through the temp job and not get the benefits"
bad,Unable to balance life with working environment. Jobs are often out sourced to other parts of the country with little notice.
bad,"This company promised a ton to Gwinnett County - and now the City of Atlanta - and all it has delivered is a steady dose of misery."
bad,The management was permitted -- even encouraged - to ride roughshod over employees.  They demanded endless hours including nights and weekends with not even an occasional thank you.  The company is just too large for its own good. One hand doesn't know what the other is doing.  I've never witnessed such disorganization before.
bad,NCR is an example of a numbers only company. Financially forcasting is put before the client's needs. They run on broken processes that continue to create future support issues for clients that we do not have the resources to recitfy.
bad,They need to go out of business . They have owned the industry for many years and bow down to the mighty stock holder. Dont exoect to advance or be anyone at this company.
bad,"Horrible management, a very entrenched good old boy network.  If you tell management what they don't want to hear, they will make your life a living h*ll.  Salaries are low, benefits are terrible, no HR department - it's all self-serve online.  Same with I/T.  Trying to accomplish anything in this place is impossible.  A very, very political place.  If you are in the inner circle of your organization, you can do no wrong even if you're a complete waste of space.  If you are not in the inner circle, look out below."
bad,If you like to work long hours and very hard with little pay then this is the job for you.
bad,"Typical day at work = no training, none. zero. Mentality (must fail first to learn, no help from management). "
bad,"Reconsider before accepting an opportunity, do your research first! The only gain has been meeting a few good people."
bad,"Worst company ever. Reputation has been well earned. Ethics and Integrity are non-existent. Unprofessional from the interview and hiring process, thru logistics, employee-employee and employee-management interaction, guidelines and policies. "
bad,"Did not have room to grow in the company. If you did not have family working there, you could not move up in the company."
bad,"The management was inept, didn't care for its employees.  We were understaffed, poorly treated and worked for almost minimum wage."
bad,"-Health insurance coverage is horrible."
bad,"In my opinion, this company is terrible to work for.  I worked for them for 23 months and absolutely hated every day.  Even management said maybe NCR was not a good fit for me when I made a suggestion. Priorities to customers change daily.  Some days they say run calls as quick as possible and just get calls closed, other days they say spend extra time and repair properly to reduce revisit rate."
bad,"Avoid this company unless desperate.  If you are hired, keep looking for another job."
bad,You want my opinion on NCR.The work day goes good you come start taking calls and there is always something that has to be said by managment.I have learned to keep my mouth shut even to managment and all i see at this work place is favoratism clicks and un resonable people esp managment.They do everything there way with out using protocall.At this job you must always be careful with what is said and done.
bad,Production is smooth an work makes the day go fast I learned how to build atms from the ground up the management is fair the co workers are just co workers the hardest part of the job is nothing its all easy I enjoyed the job and all the events and learning new things
bad,they demand 24/7 work. The VP of customer service sends email telling managers to micro mange the technicians more. Your not allowed to think for yourself have to get everything pre approved. the schedule changes every 2 or 3 weeks so you can't plan anything. unwilling to work with you for home or school.
bad,i hated working for this company cause they do not listen to you when you have a serious problem with another employee
bad,A company I believe that has lost it's way .. At one time looked to future company growth .. now focus is only short term profits.
bad,"company is only worried about making money day by day, never look to see the weeks ahead always reacting insted of being pro active. They will bring you on as a TEMP and low ball your pay and tell you they want to hire you ,but there is always a company hiring freeze. You can bet you bottom dollar you will be let go right before Christmas thats their MO."
bad,low pay
bad,Very sales oriented - disengaged staff - management was not experinced at all  - operating in single silos - the customer had complete control of the contract details as the targets proposed and agreed during the service agreement were unachievable to meet.
bad,"no improvement at all , life and work balance were not good in NCR. the management is not good at all, also the salary is not on time.  poor experiences"
bad,NCR is a great place to work.  However leadership is a problem.  They do not acknowledge your work and take credit for it.  HR is undesirable and they are also a problem.
bad,NCR puts up a good front but for a large corporation they seemed very incompetent. most of their support team is overseas (Serbia and India) to avoid corporate tax and US employment laws. pretty poor HR and territorial managers I worked with had no answers when asked technical questions. Most people their just spend the day casting blame and covering their but to keep their job. Not a friendly environment to work in.
bad,"Had meetings just to justify ""Scrum Masters"". Poor pay. Lack of communication between team members. Mentoring is a joke there. No advancement opportunitues."
bad,Horrible  place. No leadership quality. Floor manager doesn't  know what the he'll going. Always corrections and modification on equipment. Very poor management and leadership skills. Too many brown nosers at Midland factory.
bad,"Managed by the 'croney' system ... if you're boss likes you ... you will be held close and have a good job... if not, you are sol... and the next opportunity available they will fire and replace you."
bad,"Management taking on too many projects . "
bad,Worked for them a while back. Too much back biting going on by the Senior Tech's (Pat). The company has major problems understanding the issues that Tech's go through and are paid poorly for it. NCR use to be a company you could hold your head up and be proud of. No longer unfortunately.
bad,"Terrible!! Terrible!!!! Management, Unorganized, and very Unprofessional, No actual training at all with the products just a powerpoint overload and you start taking calls your 4th or 5th day there,"
bad,Never knew what was going on or who was in charge. Replacement parts was second rate and often damaged coming out of the box. Management regularly blamed the lower techs for their bad decisions. Schedules regularly changed often without warning. The cold is the hardest part of the job
bad,"Managers are Shady and schedule ""on calls"" to their convience. They pay little to nothing. You working crazy hours.. cant see your family. You get paid 12 a/hour and you are working a 25 a/hr job. Again.. Watch out for the Managers .. Not at all professional. Whoever still works here. IM PRAYING FOR YOU. Benefits are so-so .. your on AV just about everyday. A Big Joke. Doesnt look like they will last 2013 .. Good Riddens. If you have a interview ask about their turn over rate. They dont set up the right tools or people to guide the new people."
bad,The NCR local office in San Antonio lacked depth. Management would show bias toward employees. And worst of all they dismissed me soon after the death of my child. I would never want to work in such an unprofessional environment again.
bad,"This could be a great company.  So many intelligent and considerate employees.  Unfortunately the leadership team is more focused on seeing people sitting in the office 5 days a week, or jetting around the world to talk about how visionary they are, instead of keeping a great culture and allowing the smart teams to build the future.  Due to this and other short-sighted initiatives, they consistently tail-grab other companies leading in technological advancements, and rely upon their massive size in the marketplace to keep NCR alive."
bad,Work life balance wasn't that great. Too many weekend work. Political Corrupted management. Was abused verbally. Management did not keep up with its promises. Did not let grow.
bad,"Laid back"
bad,Poorly organized dispatch system managed by offshore individuals that have no concept of the daily tasks being performed. Management focused on closing calls and not quality customer service.
bad,"I was located onsite in Greer SC. The manager over this site was located in New Jersey and NEVER visited the site in person. This manager was all stick and NO carrot at all."
bad,Kept getting worse so I quit. NCR took a great company and is running it into the ground. Losing market share year over year with old software and no development. New managers don’t care about people. Only money
bad,Everybody there is toxic. The management is worst. If you’re not kissing a** then you’re not advancing. They said I violated the attendance policy but there are people that are still working there with worst attendance than me and it’s only because they know how kiss a**. People say inappropriate things all the time but it’s just the culture of that place
bad,Worked way too many hours in the salary and hourly positions with very little family time. Little to no appreciation for the extra time spent. Leadership team constantly grinds you and makes you stressed out.
bad,"Unless you are coming into a position other than services, I would not recommend this company. The services side of the business is over worked, under paid and under appreciated."
bad,"Basically, repetition everyday with no room for progress or promotion. The job is nice because you get to do things on your own. However, scheduling in the Bay Area branch is too versatile for a person who wants to be with their families."
bad,"I stuck with ncr for 34 years. I was a c.e.3. They ellimenated that position in 2000,cut me to c.e.2."
bad,Then they got rid of many good people made us all wear to many hats and take blame from customers the Project managers should of handled.  It was all out the money and not about people and building good businesses.
bad,"I was told that I would have two weeks online training but they only gave me one week to train. I was also told that My territory as a Tier-II Field Support Engineer would be in the local Delaware area but after about two weeks my territory was changed to Virginia."
bad,"Your jobs were routed by a service planner that is located out of the country and was learning on the fly about the area you serviced.They also had little knowledge of your skill set and would often have you scattered everywhere which cut in to your productivity. The management was Whack, For example I was with them for 7 months and had 3 different managers. Culture was  discriminatory  toward female. No team work everyone was out on their own missions. Never had face to face meetings. All communication came over conference calls which did not provide for any team building. The hardest part was being sent on jobs with no formal training because they had no one else to send and this happen more often than not.Having a vehicle was a benefit although it was normally full of unused parts that was outdated and jammed into your van. You were like a warehouse on wheels."
bad,answer and troubleshoot atm and cash registers reach out to different departments to help ensure service has been fix. provide follow up calls
bad,"I truly feel it's inappropriate to speak about how poorly i was treated with this company. However good luck to whomever fill the position i worked, and never approach management with an issue or you might get canned."
bad,Very bad medical insurance. The salaries are less at least 30% less than in industry. Management doesn't keep its word.
bad,management is to poor...they r only focus on production. nothing learned y because the staff members and even manager also dont know about the tecniques and how to handle..
bad,"Horrible work life,  balance, no compensation, work every weekend and nights, total disregard or respect for family and health, no appreciation"
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, poor management, lack of communication, not a good company to work for in general, would not recommend to any one."
bad,"company does not care about employees"
bad,"This company in the NYC area was only good for its union. Everything else felt like a waste. You can't have a life and do this job. It's easily corruptible when it comes to servicing the equipment. Most times, you get stuck on others assignments and the dispatcher is rarely helpful. I  lost my freedom in both senses of the term being in this company. My advice to you....don't take nothing and just get out after 2 years......you'll be relieved."
bad,"I worked for NCR for 7 years and was RIF'.  My functions weren't going away - I was.  Evidently when you speak your mind, directors and executives get very threatened.  Instead of contributing to the success of NCR as a whole the directors are only concerned with their bonus payouts."
bad,"Management changes frequently and you are under constant stress, you dont get to see your coworkers, you are responsible for your parts and its a logistics nightmare. Constant schedule changes."
bad,"This place was absolutely horrible and I wish it upon my worst enemy.  It's not progressive at all, with very poor IT leaders.  The culture is stuck in the 70's."
bad,"Great job, loved my co-workers but horrible, horrible, horrible management."
bad,"Awful culture run by narcissistic execs who ""manage"" by bullying and mocking and who have absolutely no respect or concern for employees as human beings. Everything was urgent and everything was a priority and I found myself working 12- to 14-hour days on a regular basis, racing from task to task and conference call to conference call with no time to think, breathe or eat... much less do any of my work very well... and I paid for it with my health. HR is neither human nor resourceful and is run by a bunch of ""mean girls"" who sit around making fun of other executives and employees in their meetings. I would not recommend working there, unless you enjoy being abused."
bad,good place to work but the management was very rude and discrimated against me
bad,"Management aren't that concern with workforce.  nepotism is rife and NCR only focus on negative feedback.  Poor wages and NCR don't care about their call centre employees, moving job to cheaper locations."
bad,Nice place to work but they knew for months that they where laying us off but did not inform us until late. They also have a horrible temp agency hiring for them. I’d rather go through permanent
bad,"I saw heads roll quite often in the various  divisions at NCR Australia. There is zero job security and upper management have no regard for the success of you as an individual, only care about managing up and looking after their own hide. "
bad,NCR was an uncaring corporate giant when I worked there.  I would not recommend working there as a systems/network engineer.  They were forcing us to work 7 days a week.
bad,"This company looks at the field employees as a necessary evil."
bad,"NCR is only concerned about how many calls you close per day, without using any parts. If you use parts, it goes against you. If you do not close enough calls, it goes against you. It is all about the numbers, not quality repairs. NCR only cares about the ATMs that they service-the Retail accounts that NCR services is second, and it shows in the NCR culture. Employees get many emails about what they did wrong, not about what they got right."
bad,"I worked at NCR for several years. The only positive thing about it is the salary - which is decent for this industry. And while the work itself may be very interesting and provide positive experience, the atmosphere is very stressful. Many managers have no people's skills for the job, they resolve workplace problems by intimidation of their subordinates, micro-managing and creating an environment of uncertainty. Initiative is not welcome and often frowned upon. Swearing and demeaning co-workers is common and collaboration is not on the list. Also, there is no job security as most of the positions have already been outsourced. Overall, I suggest to stay away from NCR, unless it would be a great career move that wouldn't require to stay there for more than a year."
bad,"As being a ce, it is not for someone with a family. You will work long hours and possible work up to 13 straight days. Pays well, company provide car and electronic"
bad,"If you are married, I would not work at NCR.  I don't know if things have gotten better there since I left.  It was so bad, even my wife asked me to leave."
bad,"I use to love my job at ncr but for the past 3 years I've had a manger with very poor leadership and manager skills. My manager is all about the numbers could careless about the team, we have lost a lot of good team members due to his very poor management skills here in the Phoenix area."
bad,this company does not care about US jobs. thousands of jobs being sent to Serbia and India
bad,"This company has found every way to make sure employees work through their lunch breaks, no notice schedule changes, and sends good techs away from home with no notice to suit their needs. the 401k has all but gone away from employer match."
bad,"cherry picker, receving, and shipping"
bad,"NCR's 2013 'reinvention' brought retirement buy out packages for many seasoned veterans in the services sector of NCR, and mandatory overtime for everyone else left standing.   That's fine and dandy for those workers who want to live at work and sleep at home, but not so for us that prefer more balance with a home life. Many Territory Managers who didn't seem 'qualified' to tow the new line were terminated.   Life is short.  Time to move on."
bad,"The management at NCR is too focused on cutting costs related to labor -- i.e., they are cutting headcount, even to the detriment of customer service ratings.  The culture is toxic, where people guard information for fear of becoming obsolete and expendable, which has developed over the last 5 years due to numerous company-wide layoffs.  Most people are over-worked and stretched too thin to respond to emails and/or phone calls.  Those who are not over-worked are most often too lazy to be helpful.  Overall, the culture is affected by very low morale and bosses who don't seem to care about employee welfare."
bad,"High pressure due to lack of resources to adequately service customer base. Overtime was worked even if you didn't volunteer.  Field management not engaged or had llittle or no expertise to direct reports in  LOB. The constant or what seems like every other year of the change in direction (re-org's). Worked with some really talented technicians that were either laid-off or quit. I really enjoy what little time off I had, ........"
bad,"Serious ethics problems at NCR because they don't deliver what they charge for.  Thier labor philosophy is ""drive them till they drop, then shout NEXT."""
bad,Needs to improve on resources for employees. They started out well but have been cutting back more and more and it seems that there is no room for growth.
bad,Ever changing management.  Ever changing work schedules that only benefit NCR.  told we cant go home after our scheduled shifts on a regular basis to meet company metrics. Plenty of overtime!!!
bad,Things may have changed but my experience lead me to experience a level of stress I didn't know was possible for me. The culture was not as supportive I as was used to.
bad,Management think that employees are property of NCR. They treat people as a slaves not human beings. There is a lot of discrimination in this company and there is nothing equal. You can be the best and they will retaliate against you. Avoid this company. When they hired you story is totally different and after a while you can see true picture. They has a problem hiring people because nobody wants to work for NCR. Don't be that unlucky guy and fall for they story.
bad,If your single have no life or need to get away from your friends and family NCR is for you. The 401K and benefits were great. Definitely a golden handcuff company.
bad,"NCR could not care any less about it's employees. They lay off entire teams with no regard to the impact of the people left in it's wake.  They are more about the show of the fancy building they spent too much money on. They don't give raises fairly, if at all. Generally a feeling of apathy among the employees. People who are terrible at their job get to keep them with no consequences but people who are valuable and have tons of knowledge are laid off without any forethought."
bad,Pouco funcionário e muito serviço e cobrança de resultado.
bad,No time for family with this company at all. On call shifts 24 hours not a lot of time off with 2% is all they will give you and that's if your doing a great job.
bad,"Ruim por conta de politicagem excessiva, falta de reconhecimento e afins."
bad,Too much emphasis on short term wins as against long term value wins. Wrong notion of leadership. Task masters are being groomed as leaders instead of candidates with real leadership qualities. NCR has and will always underachieve because of its culture. Think NCR and IBM started at the same time with the same strengths and  see how far behind is NCR
bad,"On my first day with NCR, I attempted to set up all of my benefits including health, dental, and vision insurance, my 401K and my stock purchase plan. It was a nightmare that lasted almost as long as my employment - 5 months. NCR still, to this day, has my permanent address listed as the actual business address in Alpharetta, GA. The receptionist occasionally puts my mail into an envelope and mails to me. NCR had my identity wrong, they had my MAIDEN name as my last name so they couldn't find me and I couldn't set up any benefits. NCR finally matched up my request to buy stock, and set this up on my last paycheck. I own 4 shares. LOL. My manager quit 4 months in, and I had not been exposed to very much. So I quit too. Three weeks later, I got my health insurance card. In June! HA!"
bad,no job security wonderful co-workers good company benefits.
bad,"This company is an absolute nightmare. Service Parts is supposed to be their selling point . . . No budget, No Management. No Teamwork, finger pointing at its best.  No root cause analysis, just bandaids and demerol to fix the issues. People laid off in US and jobs moved to Serbia because they can hire 2/3 Serbians to every one American. Goal to hire additional 600 in Serbia by end of year. No tools in place to do your job, no accountability.  Management makes decisions that affect customers then have amnesia the next quarter. Empty desks and cubicles everywhere. Every day people wondering if they will be next to be riffed. The future is always kept secret. Key positions not being filled when someone leaves. Place is a joke. But posting profits for Wall Street and account holders. Unobtainable measures set for employees so that bonuses won't be had by anyone but Nuti, who is extremely disliked by the people keeping the company afloat. Searching for something else desperately. Layoffs happen every quarter and other positions filled in other departments instead . . . People being walked out the door my first week with the company, last layoff was last week. No dedication to the employees. Can't afford bonuses and pay increases but sponsor of the NCR Level at the GA Dome. Company is about as good of a performer as the Falcons."
bad,The company used to be great to work for. Current management is a disaster.
bad,"I was very excited to join NCR, but once on board, the culture was not a match.  The focus was to short sighted goals to hit quarterly needs, vs long term strategic vision."
bad,"Poor place to work - very draining.  Managers dishonest, they expect loyalty- non given. If you don't eat crow run. IT a joke! Frequent layoffs. Worst"
bad,"Most unprofessional senior leadership team I have ever come across in my professional life.  It's as if they promote vindictiveness and back stabbing.  Very toxic work environment.  Had a great manager, the comp was fair, but the place is an ulcer factory."
bad,Atuando durante 2 anos e nove meses percebi que a NCR é uma empresa séria e muito competente com seus colaboradores e clientes.
bad,Great place and nice people ...but long hours overall it's ok to work there
bad,"Only employed for no more than 5 days."
bad,The company thinks your entire 24 hr day belongs to them.  The managers frown on employees going to college and will adjust hrs to make it near imposable to go.
bad,Work schedule changes weekly. Working 7-10 days straight. You really dont have time for family. Constantly changing managers. Very underpaid compared to other companies. Wont recommend this job to anybody.
bad,As a Customer Engineer you are customer facing most of the day.
bad,Too many experts. NCR is beautiful place to work. Every single day you can have smile on your face like little child in candy store. And you can stay single forever.
bad,"The biggest problem I had working with NCR was management. The company has grown so quickly in the department I was in that people were put into management because of the time they had within the company it appeared. The manager over me would tell me to do one thing then email her manager that she told me to do something different. Because of this, it created a lot of problems and leaves the new employee out catching bullets from all directions."
bad,"Currently Manager "
bad,"Do a search for the company's web site. Take the name of the president under Executive Management. Add the words that would indicate unlawful behavior: DUI, drugs, child endangerment, and mug shot. Laugh like all get out."
bad,Great co-workers! Learned great skills at this company. This is NCR
bad,"I worked on my own at NCR, my main duties are Installation Services which included, using single/3 phase electrics to wire up the power to the machines using wiring diagrams, rewiring new PCB's into the new system so that the machine would come online, wiring UPS's to machines and testing to make sure that it was online, testing all the mechanical equipment to make sure it was working. Also Hardware Maintenance Service which includes, analyzing and correcting all technical problems on equipment within assigned customer accounts and perform periodic preventive maintenance routines on products and install modifications to equipment."
bad,I learned to work with ORACLE System.
bad,They ask to much as of asking to clean bodily fluids and don’t care that you don’t care if you don’t have the training for it. Management don’t know what they are doing
bad,"more work than home life.  yea was cool being on own every day but management was meh,  cool people work with made bunch of friends that still contact personally"
bad,NCR has the worst management EVER!! EVERYONE there is ready to leave! they dont care for the employees.Plus they dont pay well at all  for the work they expect from you.
bad,"This company takes advantage of the employees, works them to death. No work life balance. Management is poor. Company pays employees on time and lots of OT whether you want the work or not"
bad,"Do not seek a career here. The management style is not ideal. I would be wary about support. It is difficult to keep address HR needs/issues. Qualified, talented people are not being recolonized for the work and value. Compensation (especially in marketing) is not equal."
bad,"In NCR there is no single  management and fixed work process.it keeps on changing when ever  manager changes ."
bad,Be prepared to live for NCR. They call before shift after shift and think of you as a tool. Micromanaged me out of my job. When I was the cleaner. Going around cleaning up what other techs could not fix.
bad,"The interview was nonexistant..The job was of high intensity and anxiety mixed together with fear of being assaulted or rob.. Communication was thru emails,no calls . So if you where having any issues with phone you where lost . Deiving was also a potential threat constantly on route 75 and up and down sarasota county"
bad,Prior to moving inside of 285 everyone felt like they ere important.  Now everyone is expected to work more that 40 hours a week (with NO overtime) and only driven by results.  The quality of work in no longer there and the new management team is pushing the seasoned people with the know of the company out of the door.
bad,management is a mess to be honest would not recommend anyone to work here. i worked there for nearly 1 year and the trainig had nothing to do with the job the team leaders did not know what they were doing and didnt help in the slightest as they were to busy on there social media.
bad,"traveling, 17 hour days, working 7 days a week has affected home affected relationships at home. I feel that NCR is a good company to work for and I wish there was some positive changes that would allow we to continue my career with NCR"
bad,NCR has no concern for the feild worker as compared to any other employee. they will work you to death and wont attend the funeral. no matter how far above and beyond the call of duty they wont appreiciate what you do for them.
bad,Went through training for two weeks and they were in a rush to get more people through training that we were basically put on the phones with hardly any support.
bad,"If your not thick-skinned, and cant watch over your shoulders, you will fail in this position. If you love to travel, you will be traveling for miles while working daily. You will be saturated with calls on daily bases. There isn't a set schedule, so your days will be off/unorganized. If your uncomfortable working outside on your own (Day or Night) then this position might not fit your needs."
bad,"NCR has a long and storied history, and some interesting new technology. But that's about all. The leadership team turns over quickly and erratically. The primary objective each year is cutting budget. Seems to have lost focus on what it wants to be, and how it;s going to get there. Scrifices the future for short term metrics."
bad,NCR is a decent starter job for someone looking to get into the IT field. The company will provide training. Lower pay than other similar companies. Clueless management and no regard for employees.
bad,"I was in charge of an account team dealing with logistics. While some of the old timers above me were very helpful and just lacked some technology skills the head of my entire dept. was way out of touch and hired his friend at five times our pay to take credit for our work (his friend who had previously been let go from the company). Things like sudden panics over a cellular hiccup from our service provider resulted in stern emails and me being told to ""stay on top of things"" until I was working 12 and 14 hour days. Or just suggesting kiosk reboots for months instead of listening to our advice that their was a software issue. Or purposely reclassifying issues to keep our numbers good, which in the end is what happened. I had moved on but about 6 months later the boss stacked up all his bonuses and awards and moved to another division. When the numbers were run again and they saw how bad it was the division was sold off and everyone got laid off."
bad,NCR needs to work on their balanced workdays and inconsistent messagees coming down from higher up. Management needs to filter these messages and not just be the messengers.
bad,"Unfair job advancement "
bad,It was challenging working at NCR.  It was extremely make dominated.  They practice an unrealistic closing period for the books.  Constant fires to put out because of the lack of training with the staff.  Benefits and salary did not meet industry standards.
bad,"The Company Culture is treat employees, especially Field Techs, constantly with threats and intimidation. Company is constantly being sued by employees for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, The Family Medical Leave Act, Wrongful Terminations etc."
bad,"Can't say much of the good things about this company. So, I rather not say a lot about this company. However, the people worked at NCR are not all bad."
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone because of poor management. The managers there have their favorite workers who gets somewhat special treatment. There is no room for advancement or raises.They give you mixed messages and late notices about working days and hours.
bad,"I cannot tell you how much I hated working here. The employees are over worked and under paid. Taken advantage of and thrown away like they mean nothing."
bad,It was a Good company to work for but there wasn't any opportunities to move forward most of the positions were offshore . I'm hoping to find a company that I can move up in and also grow with the company .
bad,"what can I say? Layoffs because they send jobs to europe... Low pay.... Managers had no idea how to motivate staff."
bad,you can not put your time in until you get to your first site. If you work an hour away then you can put in after 30 minutes on the road. But then your not being correct on your time. they expect you have be at work by 8 but you may have to drive an hour to two to get to your first site. the hardest part of the job is getting to some of the equipement your working on in department stores and kitchens
bad,"a typical day at work is hectic."
bad,Management is unreasonable in expectations of CE in 250 mile radius.  Working for NCR basically is a 24 hour per day working in a rural area. When one person is required to cover half of a state the customer is not getting service they are promised. Not fun.
bad,"ineffective low/mid management"
bad,Was a fun place to work until the only thing that mattered was making the Qtr'ly results - regardless of customer impact.
bad,"I accepted an offer in 2013 with this company. I ended up having to leave after 8 months before likely being forced out. But I was going to leave anyhow. My manager NEVER had time for me. Never spent a single hour training me for the role itself. I was thrown into the deep after barely a couple week's training at best, and expected to learn a complicated business and work large deals with little or no ongoing guidance."
bad,"Management is immature, and not customer oriented, work environment is unhealthy and job culture and moral s below normal"
bad,No morale values.  No proper assessment towards team members.  Frequent changes in Management. No proper marketing.  HR department is dummy.
bad,"The company does offer decent benefits, stock options, 401K matching plan, and paid time off."
bad,"At NCR, men are always promoted over women. Women do not get equal pay to men. You also have to have a degree at this company to advance. Doesn't matter what the degree is in, you just have to have one. Experience means very little to management, degrees  matter more."
bad,Poor management but great team of colleagues. None of the shared values are executed for management having unethical behaviors. The stress is not worth the lack of integrity & dishonesty HR has a clue about
bad,"Unfortunately, territory managers in the sales division are expected to be available 24x7.  This is a highly metric driven business, and support, including I.T. is sorely lacking."
bad,"management sucks, culture sucks, environment is toxic, people have been faking the funk for years...and its finally caught up...New management, but kept a lot of existing managers"
bad,"Loose your identity and become another number, focused on making numbers for your manager.  Expect to be harassed by customers and the general public every day.  Expect to work nights, weekends and holidays, including Christmas."
bad,Management lacks field knowledge. The philosophy at NCR is if it is not the field techs fault then it is no ones fault. Very poor moral because of no interaction with Management especially in Vancouver. This used to be a good career years ago
bad,not recommended. please don't ask me anymore. I need to skip this part. this is not a good place to work.  please just please leave this part I don't want to do it .
bad,I never really felt connected to the Company during my two years there.  A strong company culture that may exist at the HQ does not translate to the Field based employees.
bad,"NCR struggles to transform to a software company as their executive staff continue to run the business using a manufacturing approach to everything from process to pay/benefits. They would do well to bring in, if only temporarily, some seasoned executive leadership from successful technology companies that could help them drive proper change and restructure that aligns with proven successful software technology leaders."
bad,There is no direction. Goals are extremely high and commissions are minimal. The product has many flaws and company doing nothing to keep up with competition.
bad,"I did enjoy working there but lazy people get away with way too much. I worked very hard every day for over 2 years, well they bring on these temps that don't want to work but for some odd reason they get away with it. Then when you say something about it you are the bad guy trying to start trouble. I see why they need temps no full time person whats to pull there weight all the time."
bad,"Mandatory 6 days a week and 10 hour days. plus on call days. Rotating management, went through 4 managers in one year. One of the worst jobs I ever had"
bad,"NCR even though it is a large corporation the company does not have their stuff together. It is a nightmare, avoid if possible. "
bad,The job as a tester was great as it had less supervision then some of the other positions. The mangement was poor. Job security did not exist. The employees were great but that's about it.
bad,"Lots of work, not much personal time. Good people, however, lots of day to day stress. No objectives set to achieive corporate & personal goals."
bad,"This company might be a good place to get your first job, but there is no advancement in this company, and you will be mostly working on OLD TECHNOLOGY and HARDWARE. Take a quick look over the responsibilities of this position once again, now ... you could and likely will touch each one of those bullets in a day (or 14 hour shift)"
bad,"NCR culture on paper does not come close to the culture of the actual company. My advice would be to gain as much knowledge from the company, and use it as a stepping stone."
bad,"You will live to serve. Start early, stay late. Multiple schedule changes, sometimes within the same week. Any and all instances where a tech may fall short is emailed to the entire team. It is discuraging to continuously see other techs called out to the team."
bad,"The management team makes more money when they pay less on labor, so they won’t give raises, or add benefits or anything for employees. If you insist on a raise or promotion or benefits promised, you’ll have to quit or potentially be fired. Anytime a manger makes more money by paying their employees as little as possible there’s going to be a poor work environment and super high turnover. Make sure you have a solid employment contract with raises and promotions in your contract so that they have to provide them. Otherwise you could be stuck on entry level pay for years."
bad,NCR management in middle east is a cheat. They play with people career by hiring people on temp positions without informing them and then terminate them on one month notice. They should be transparent to candidates and tell them clearly that it's a temporary position. Communication within company is very poor. Management will hardly respond to employees emails or phone calls.
bad,"No advancement opportunities"
bad,NCR built a new building in Midtown and the work-life balance suffered greatly.  They now want you to commute and still work 50-60 hours or more regularly.  No remote working anymore.
bad,"The general atmosphere isn't very happy. Company does not seem to treat it's employees as well as other companies. Not a good work/life balance, or a good job planning team bonding."
bad,"First year was amazing. Then mid level management all got replaced, and everything went bad. Had seven different managers in a two year span. "
bad,This job requires you to work a lot of hours. Be prepared to stand on your feet for 8+ hours. Working along side everyone was a smooth experience. The HR department is unorganized.
bad,"Management are blind to issues of workload and more interested in numbers than engineers health and well being."
bad,Company never meets promises when it comes to compensation. The poor raises are almost worthless because the 2% they give you is a wash because they keep taking benefits away. This company is a dead end for young techs. The only reason I haven't left this company is vacation time for years spent and I am near retirement
bad,"good place to gain experience for next Job."
bad,"Started off as an OK atmosphere, The pay isn't good enough to compensate for all the driving/gas/maintenance for your vehicle thats required of this company. A lot of underpaid employees. Disorganized and dishonest management even after informing them of problems. Mistreatment of minorities, complete disregard for disabled workers. Company collected data on all situational experiences then proceeded to layoff North American division of extremely talented employees who've mastered their craft and equipment. Exported the jobs to another country to lesser qualified workers using that database of information they collected."
bad,"The people who dish out calls are dumb, they don't know what they're doing and some can barely speak a lick of English. I hate when I get 4 different calls in the same 10 minutes from 4 different phillipinos trying to tell me how to do my job better. They themselves can't even fathom what I do."
bad,"making CE redundant every year, No job security and manaement don't care about CES, service coordinator based in overseas have no idea of local traffic."
bad,Global IT is a typical IT sweat shop. Avoid unless you want to consistently work 50-60 hour week MINIMUM and have no resources to get projects done. The culture is very rough and leadership often has unreasonable expectations and treats managers very poorly. Other managers and employees are nice but totally under water all the time so hard to get anyone's attention. The company is also cutting costs and off shoring jobs everywhere so would have low confidence in the company's future direction and growth. Limited work from home opportunities.
bad,"NCR is an decent company, they will train you and they will give you cross-organizational experience.  This company looks out for their upper crust in the company only.  In order to stay ahead of the curve and keep your position, plan to work 60-65 hours a week."
bad,Recklessly dangerous human resource policies. Employees who drive all day are working up to 80 hours a week for multiple weeks. Poorly implemented updates to IT infrastructure. Lack of interdepartmental communications causing numerous unnecessary blockades to performing basic work duties.
bad,"Unrealistic expectations of technicians in regards to call volume, size of service area and on-call rotation. Insufficient/untimely training  for new equipment, and technicians are consistently shorthanded regarding coverage of service areas. Poor health benefits for a multi-national corporation. All that being said, the people that I worked directly with were undeniably some of the best technicians/people I have ever worked with."
bad,"We are NCR, a global tech company—and we run the everyday transactions that make your life easier. We’re the world leader in consumer transaction technologies, turning everyday interactions with businesses into exceptional experiences. With our software, hardware and portfolio of services, we make nearly 550 million transactions possible every day."
bad,"NCR retail services are stuck in the days of old. Culture of incompetent middle management. Lower management are forced to be ""YES"" men or else. Too many layers of management, Territory Managers are not needed, local areas should be run by team leaders. No wonder NCR loses money in retail services division quarter after quarter. Like most large corporations NCR used to be respected, that's all changed. Keep looking!!"
bad,"When I first started, the job was great, tedious repetitive but the job was great. I feel that in any job that a great lead and management makes all the difference in how you perceive your job duties. When our line was shut down and we all were moved to a different line under different management and team leads, the job was no longer fun and made you feel ill to come to work.  Several of us was being harassed and bullied and no one as high up as management was willing to do anything but sweep it under the rug and threaten your job when you mentioned the harassment and bullying.  I learned a lot however from this company, how the inside of the computers work and how to build on an assembly line that moves for you.  The hardest part of the job was honestly working in uncomfortable conditions where no one cared.  I learned that even my old team lead cared more and that is what makes a team lead a great person and will make employees work harder for them."
bad,NCR is a decent company with a decent work environment. NCR allows for growth.
bad,Most enjoyable part of working at is NCR is the people.  The pace is intense and there is a lot of overtime to meet objectives.  No Life/Work balance truly exist in practice at NCR.  There is no investment in employee training or advancement.
bad,"This job is number based. If you dont get their numbers then you wont be employed long. Even with a maintenance team there to fix machines, it will always come back to the operator. Management will not back you unless you are one of their friends. HR is supposed to be there for the employees but they only help when something is in it for them. Like I said, its a paycheck but good luck."
bad,The work environment is not a 'team' environment and there is not
bad,"NCR did a major hiring blitz in late 2011 to cover new major accounts (but much less profitable). In mid 2012 they turned around, and started firing a huge percentage of employees (mostly tenured and higher paid) from every department. In several cases, they immediately hired new ""green"" replacements (with little or no experience) at a third less than the seasoned people they let go."
bad,"BAD"
bad,"keine weiter kommen möglich"
bad,"The hands off management approach is an understatement. If something happened, you may not find out for a few months. That leads to a failure in management. I received very minimal training. Most of my training was go figure it out. Call help desk. The pay is decent as a contractor, but having to use you own vehicle and pay for the fuel really cut into the paycheck."
bad,"I worked there 10 years , always busy no relax time, "
bad,Stressful and mundane work environment. Co-workers are not friendly and will throw you under the bus at the first opportunity they get! Relaxed dress code.
bad,"if I wanted to work at NCR I would have applied at NCR, mega corp removed the perks that made me want to work at the previous incarnation of company. not happy about it"
bad,"Zero training, lack of continuity throughout company. Massive overtime - 60-80 hours a week. All work is outsourced to other countries.  Calls all times of day and night.  Yet to understand how they ever pass an audit."
bad,Overall the job was unorganized at times but the pay was pretty good. At times due to corporate I think the managers would be just as lost as the regular employees when it comes to what’s going on with the company
bad,Worked for a company that was bought by NCR and was the worst experance. NCR means Not Called Radiant! No one Cares Really. Morale went way down as did the quality of the product and software. moved  development to india and quality went way down
bad,Compensation is not good. working long hours everyday. typical day you will be driving from east to west and most of the time you will not get paid for your travel home which is more than an hour.
bad,"The job itself is OK. The things I have against the the company itself are as follows:"
bad,"Management knows nothing of what goes on in the field yet expects miracles and when they're not delivered they only get angry about it. The hardware created by NCR fails constantly and is harder to work on than it should be, but the engineering team doesn't consider repairs when building the machines."
bad,"This company cycles through executives like the spin setting on a washing machine."
bad,"Work was good, a lot of driving, support slow responding, many location, a lot of customer support, equipment easy to work on with training.  Training all online."
bad,I  could not comment on the present state as I last worked there in 2015. But I was disappointed with the lack of communication between myself management. I worked very hard there. But would say  the inventory control responsibility left a lot to be desired.
bad,"Not sure how they work now, but they used to take they workers and contracted workers and lay off around Christmas even when there was enough work. Then they would bring them back at a lower rate because they knew they people would take the job."
bad,"Complicated interaction between contractor and client. Was told, multiple times, that I would be brought on after 6 Month contract but after rearranging service area; I was called and told that contractor would no longer be required due to area overstaffed. I Loved the job, coworkers at NCR were all awesome. Unfortunately management was almost non existent; and was either misinformed or wasn't truthful."
bad,"As a quality inspector, it was very difficult working for an organization that continuously dodged the policies and procedures, including ethical policies and procedures."
bad,Territory manager position managing the union technicians is very difficult. The union seems to have more rights that the manager. Lack of respect by the technicians for management.
bad,This was my second time with NCR and this time it was a horrible experience that I could not leave fast enough.  Management was unreasonable with their demands and there was absolutely no concern for employee quality of life.  Benefits were poor at best and the work environment was miserable.
bad,"The management in Midland GA is not organized. The co-workers were pretty cool to work with. The hardest part about the job is not knowing the status of advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job is the overtime. I learned no matter how long (which is working over 12 hours), how hard, even going above and beyond, stepping in doing other co-workers job when they are slacking off that you will not get appreciated."
bad,"The work was hard core calling and they even suffered from losses that they wont have money to pay our salary."
bad,stop relying on this company. this company will ruin your life. there is nothing else to say. this company doesn't last and will not work with their employees. they hire disrespectful and rude managers who makes the employee feel bad.
bad,Good company to work for.  Great experience and knowledge learned on a daily basis. I would recommend this company to someone just coming out of college
bad,Every person is always on call and there is mandatory overtime every week. It is not uncommon to drive over 250 miles a day to different locations within your area on service calls. the company lacks the manpower to keep up with the contracts that they acquire so each person is required to do the work of 3.
bad,"If you don't mind working a six day work week and 12-16 hours a day then a Customer Engineer job is just for you. At the time I left it was a business model of ""Run & Gun"", meaning if the equipment was up and working without really having done anything to fix the problem you were to get out and close the call. You knew it was going to come back in again soon, but that was the environment management was fostering. Which wasn't really helping the customer nor helping the technician. It wasn't like that when I first started, but quickly changed not long afterwards. It was very sad to see the state of morale. To say it was abysmal is an understatement. It was a great team when I started and very few of the original members were left."
bad,"A typical day is researching missing inventory. I learned how to use the Oracle system that we have in place. My co-workers are very knowable and works together as a Team. the hardest part of my job is not having the support from management to complete tasks, I enjoy training others because I had to leaen alot on my own."
bad,Long and shifting hours. Lack of decent pay. Some managers that are micromanage or don't manage at all.
bad,A day at work consists of taking inbound calls and troubleshooting self-checkout registers at various stores. There wasn't much to learn as this was a straight forward 'follow the script' type troubleshooting job. Management when I first started was very competent but quickly devolved as sever nepotism allowed for the advancement of incompetent employees with no ability to manage. My co-workers were great people for the most part and we frequently engaged in activities outside of work. The hardest part of the job was handling the high call volume which was compounded by poor mismanagement in which we frequently had to work through breaks and lunches. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the co-workers.
bad,NCR is closing down.  That is why I am looking for another job.
bad,"Service on-site of ATM financial products of varying brand names, Imaging equipment, Network equipment, & Servers. Approximately 40% of workday is driving throughout a 5 county area. Shift hours vary, and on-call availability is a must, and happens often (2-3 weeks rotation)."
bad,HR = HoRrible
bad,NCR was great place to work at.The management staff were always easy to talk to.I dealt with technical support and offered new accounts.
bad,"NCR has overgone some changes in the past 10 years. Most notably, is they are disloyal to the community and willing to pack up and move their offices to they anyone with tax money to give them.  They are focusing more on software than hardware and leading in the digital age of transactions, therefore they tend to push for college age employees and cater to what they perceive is going to attract them (gaming areas, etc.). MId-managment is great. They try to develop their teams and prepare them for career advancement, but there isn't really much room to move around w/in the company.  They expect long hours and created an office environment intent on removing any reasons for leaving.  Amenities are nice in the new HQ, thinking of most employee needs except help with day care. They do assist with the commute forced on to some 2000 employees, paying close to half the cost if you take the express buses. "
bad,"Was working full time for Fema when I got call from Barrister for job at NCR.. Came back home for job, under the impression that it was permanent. It lasted 6 mo's and ended because of rollout that was not planned well. "
bad,"NCR has a history of ""Never Completely Restructured"". It's always changing managers and management chains. It's almost impossible to develop any working history wtith anyone except immediate co-workers."
bad,"Management was poor, Unfair work hours with lac of days off. No Team Work. Poor pay. Minimum training. Benefits were great for hours worked. Management was not supportive"
bad,At first I thought this would be a great job to learn and advance in but as I started working there I experienced the truth about the job and the role I played there.
bad,"Working Support queue to assist software end users (merchants)."
bad,Sadly the upper management at NCR has no real direction and that trickles down to the middle level managers.  The company is trying different approaches that aren't working and all they can do to make the books look good is out source which is causing the quality of the software products to degrade.
bad,"NCR is a dual personality company.  They do certain things that make you feel supported like better technology to make your job easier and some attempts at employee recognition.  Benefits are decent.  But then there is the side of the company that looks at their employees as an irritating expense.  A few summers ago they monitored our gas usage claiming we were costing the company too much money in gas while at the same time demanding we drive long distances between customer sites ???  "
bad,Worked as a CE/FE and its great for someone that's just graduated or looking for experience that doesn't have a family requiring work life balance. Management doesn't value employees nor reward performance.
bad,"Overall this company was ok, just long hours. Again great coworker and team players. this job was very interesting because everyday you have new challenge that you have to figure it out. Great Experience."
bad,"If you are a single person with no kids, then this job may work for you. You work long hours and on call many nights. Training is a minimum and are thrown into situations you are not trained for. Must have a quick adaptability while working for this company."
bad,"Software.  My boss was arrogant, incompetent, feared, and disengage. High turnover due to the negative work environment. "
bad,Huge Corporation trying to branch out into the small and medium markets and failing miserably at it. Restructured their help desk and its a mess.  Customers can't get help in a timely fashion.  Communication between departments is terrible.  It takes forever to complete the simplest tasks if you have to rely on a different department.
bad,"Company is great, salary, perks and benefits but management could be better more profound and ethical people. Hassle to join as a starter."
bad,It's a hot environment and straight forward job. It's an ok job. I learned how to put together an atm machine and how to put together different parts that goes with the atm.
bad,"High intensity, high demand, job first, life second.  Overtime ebbs and flows- either mandatory or not allowed.  Techs are self-regualted, but dispatcher not local."
bad,The management in different departments is very rude to employees. They are often shouting and being condescending even though they don't understand what the nature of the job is.  There's a lot of swearing in the rooms and no corporate events whatsoever.
bad,As a materials handler you are expected to account for all items in the warehouse and coordinate with the main production lines in allocating the specific amount of supplies needed for the final end product. the overall tempo is fast pace demanding and requires a high amount of attention to detail.
bad,"NCR is a Global company. There have been many ""Reductions in the Workforce"" over the past years. Many jobs were outsourced to India and to Accenture."
bad,NCR is big on services. Was run those days by older generation management team and hard to work with. Very good service team worldwide and effective.
bad,"Benefits got worse, "
bad,"Go into the office you do your assigned work orders to make sure their getting completed. Take calls from techs throughout the day. "
bad,"The work itself is actually fun, but the office environment and training is terrible. They run understaffed, so the employees that they have get run ragged. Management in the office gives very little positive feedback and does not accept any responsibility when something does not work out as they wish. Expectations turned out to be much different than those detailed during the interview process"
bad,Over worked under paid! If you want a personal life STAY AWAY! Management is no help and does not care about there employees. Leave your house at 8am and you may be home by 9pm. Very stressful ALL the time.
bad,"NCR has been in alot of transitions in the last couple years, they still have alot of bugs to work out of the system. At this time the management over me is not very strong and has no work ethic. Your employees are only as strong as your managment."
bad,"-They give you the flexibility to work in the office or from home "
bad,ambiente di lavoro pesante e difficile in cui le ore della giornata dedicabili alla vendita sono ridotte ai minimi termini a causa dell' eccessiva burocrazia interna
bad,"I was hired through a temp agency. Never had a clue what was going on as my Blackberry never did arrive though they ordered one for me 3 times! Every morning I would start my day by calling dispatch in Serbia..yes Serbia!  This is how I would get my work orders and other information about each job which of course is what the Blackberry supposed to give me. I will say the dispatchers in Serbia spoke great English."
bad,"overload works ,new management suck ,no work and life balance"
bad,"Peach Tree City's Official Rating From A Current Employee"
bad,"Desde a contratação a empresa nunca atrasou os vencimentos, porem na área de serviços ao cliente não se tem um plano de carreira pra incentivar o funcionário a evoluir. Na área de recursos humanos não tem disponível local pra uma confraternização entre funcionários, e não oferece ideias para tal."
bad,"Equal pay for equal work"
bad,"Work an average of 50 hrs a week, no set days off, work weekends. Turnaround is high, might explain 50 - 60 hour work week. Work is graded on SLA."
bad,"The company rushed on-boarding to fill vacancy's in the field. Class room training was a joke, for the same reason. Not enough field support to fill the customers needs. Little time off. Almost half of my income is in Overtime."
bad,"typical day was 12 or more hours, more time at work than home."
bad,"Es una excelente empresa a nivel mundial con características y cualidades de muy alto nivel, mi experiencia en México área de ATM México, no tiene la cultura y fortaleza de crecimiento con su personal de campo. No hay un salario rentable y en la parte administrativa. Les falta mucho por mantener el desarrollo y el crecimiento laboral de sus empleados. Es un empleo que pones a prueba tus fortalezas, tu compromiso x la empresa y sobre todo los que hemos trabajado en ella nos entregamos  a su nivel de competición,  demandante de 24 x 24"
bad,"Too much work not enough time off for decompressing.Placed in dangerous situations with no assistance, Calling a guard was often frowned upon as it cost the company money. 14 days straight average 10-14 hour days, Always were labeled for availability which means you are on call for 24 hrs that day, and scheduled Available EVERY day."
bad,"Revenue objectives ridiculously unrealistic.  Every company is in business to make money for their shareholders, and that is understandable, but the only incentive in this job role is getting a paycheck.  Often I find myself working 60 hour weeks (this includes full Saturday and Sunday working some weeks and no overtime pay) to achieve revenue goals.  Looking at the amount of work and revenue I manage and not getting bonuses or sufficient raises or recognition for the level of workload and accountability is not worth the never-ending stress.  It is not a good work/life balance."
bad,"CEs are overworked and underpaid low men/women on the totem pole. We are constantly given expectations but they are too high to meet reasonably. If you give 110%, they ask why you didn't give 111%"
bad,"Good stepping stone, comfortable work environment, but not a company where you can advance or build a career. Turn over is only about 30 percent. Friendly environment"
bad,"Bad work culture for ground level employees"
bad,"There is no job security. This company is too busy exporting jobs than actually trying to satisfy their customers and employees.  They have moved all customer service jobs, including US customer based call service to countries other than the US."
bad,"NCR is currently trying to transition from a hardware company to a software company and it is not succeeding.  Management is far too reactive to problems that occur and this means that staff find it difficult to know what direction the company is heading in.  "
bad,NCR buildings are very modern and energy efficient. The working environment is very friendly. It is going through restructure and making rapid changes. The heavy manual processes and lean head count along with the restructure changes make things even more difficult.
bad,"Do not work under a Micro Managed team , especially under the CxMarketing team. They are the micro management experts. They will not i let you rest in peace."
bad,"depending on your skill set a your working day is never the same. You can be driving to a destination then all of a sudden a phone call comes and you need to drop everything as a type 1 call comes in. Although helping the company achieve call closure this doesn't help your measured statistics, so be prepared to write it all down when your in front of your virtual manager. "
bad,"Don't have much idea about NCR in other countries but in OMAN it was a very good workplace, but everyone has to do more than his capacity. people were overburdened throughout the project."
bad,NCR is an average place to work you compared to all similar jobs you need to be a road warrior ... At the end of the day if you like fixing products it is a rewarding field
bad,Worked on a contract basis.  Solid CEO with focus on revenue. Not the best culture to work in but had lots of smart people working there.  Office environment was outdated.
bad,"but there is no safety for workers, learn little thing. but it not use for furture. co-workers are friendly. but some problems in them. transport fine. and company environment is cool"
bad,Productive and competitive environment. Don't have an idea for career advancement if there's a chance. I think it still depends on your job position that you applied.
bad,"It's been 16 years since I worked for NCR, so take this with a grain of salt. Management has changed multiple times since. When I was there (in the Dayton, OH World HQ before the move to Atlanta) almost everyone was miserable and hated life. There were two kinds of employees: those who had given in to the drudgery of the company and were constantly depressed and those who were arrogant and rude, believing that they were the single busiest person in the company. Pay was pretty good (especially for an intern) and there were a lot of advancement opportunities."
bad,"No job Security, "
bad,The first company launched ATM machines to the world and it has so many branches and coustmers around the world.IT has succesfully complted 150 years .Nice place to learn about ATM technology and how differnts are there in worild wide .So much new technical exploration is there in NCR.
bad,"Work starts at 8am and if you're lucky you're finished by 10pm. Travel can be up to 200 miles a day or more, but they give you a car for work. I've had 5 managers in my 2 years, it's a revolving door. My current manager's catchphrase is ""If you don't like it, maybe you're in the wrong line of work."" My coworkers are, mostly, great; some people need to go back to training for a few more weeks. The hardest part of my job is getting snapped at by our dispatchers or manager for being at a single location for too long, They want us to diagnose, fix, and leave within 30-45 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you've been working on a big job that people are having trouble fixing and you finally put it back together and everything works perfectly (but then you get an email asking why it took you 2 hours to tear a 150 lb piece of equipment down to frame to fix the issue)"
bad,"Good people, poor management.  Onboarding process was by way of self directed online training and webinars.  Not much in the way of mentoring by new manager (hiring manager took lateral move 6 months after I started).  Typical response to requests for assistance or where to get an answer was:  ""you need to figure it out"".  My peers were all long time employees and were helpful and supportive.  Several confessed to me that ""We do a terrible job at onboarding new people""."
bad,Bring all parts to the line in a timely fashion so that the line will not have to stop. Maintain an keep equipment in working condition.This job has taught me to have a clear focus on high quality and business profit.Made me able to see things from the others person's point of view
bad,its was unorganized. too many mangment and not enough workers. the hardest part was trying to accomplish a three man job with two people and no help.
bad,the job was mainly a call center help desk dealing with payroll inquires via cases all day.   update the payroll system with maintenance changes ~ 2 days a week.   boring job
bad,Company had no competitors to compete with and they were successful. They had several locations through out Georgia . Not too long after I started there they moved the Customer Service jobs over seas and then the assembly jobs followed.
bad,"My experience with NCR was terrible.  Shortly after they purchased the company that I had been working at for years, I noticed the culture seemed to go downhill.  For the last few years, I've had several friends laid off from there, and they don't seem to treat people fairly any longer.  I would only work here again if it was a last resort."
bad,No room to advance or make more money. When positions for management open up they only hire from outside of the company never from with in. The managers do not pay attention to employees needs. For example i complained about certain co worker about harassment and nothing was ever done.
bad,The company relocated and did not inform us they wold be closing down until the very end. My job moved to India and they tricked us into training our replacements. The people shadowed us and told us they were a quality review team when they were actually management from the India call center.
bad,"At the time, I was wanting to ""take a break"", and to get a position that would not be too technical with no stress. While this position met my ""not too technical"", the stress was unbelievable. This was a call center position. We were not allowed any time between calls (even 2 minutes would have been great). We had to request any personal breaks, and if we missed our window (because we were on a call), we would have to wait even more (bladders can't wait too long). Call time was so limited that most more difficult issues weren't resolved without multiple calls from the end user."
bad,"I was a finance analyst in Peachtree City, GA. The job was my first job out of college. I gained good experience. The people were nice. There was zero training. The job is what you make of it: you can chose to learn and try to grow or just do the minimum which is all that is expected of you. Once you know what you are doing, you are very self-directed. The company is very siloed. Also, lack of basic communication on the part of management was a big problem affecting the business. It got a little better over the years. Knowledge is power and people purposely withheld information to give them a leg up / make themselves feel like they were in control or to get back for having information withheld from them. The culture is laidback, maybe too much. There were constant changes-- outsourcing different business units, headcount reductions, system changes / upgrades--in the business that kept things interesting. Although, sometimes the outsourcing didn't go too well and headcount reductions aren't good. There is zero opportunity for advancement due to the fact that most of the finance / accounting function is being offshored / outsourced to Serbia or India, especially finance analyst thru senior finance analyst. During my time, the headcount in Peachtree City was reduced by ~30%, before I worked there it was reduced even more. Some people were overwhelmed with their workload. There is extreme pressure from executives and VPs to meet unrealistic results that put a lot of pressure on finance. Several people on LinkedIn had asked to me recommend them for a position, and I couldn't do it"
bad,"It was my first time working there  and I learn that  is an American technology company that makes self-service kiosk"
bad,"Management had decided to move the company from its founding site in favor of a bigger city.  They then abused their power and took tax advantages, but did not follow through with promises."
bad,Had multiple jobs during the day.  Processed Registrations for our Partners. Learned to use multiple Order Entry Systems to process orders and invoice. Processed Credit Cards for payment on orders. Processed the Activation keys for our Software   when sold. Learned to do Expense billing to be sent and processed for invoicing.  Processed the mail with Pintey Bowes postage machine. Use FedEx to ship out company product as need.
bad,"I have been working as a contractor at NCR for almost 2 years. I came in working in one department and then was transferred to another. Most of the people I encounter and work with are team oriented. But, the upper structure and employee morale are major factors of what is ruining the company. There is no job security and they try to work you as long and hard as they can until they can find a cheaper contractor. If you are looking for security and advancements NCR is not the place."
bad,"This was a magazine company that integreated technology into the classrooms, via lesson plans. Processes magazine subscriptions via  phone, fax, mail, email, and online. Contributed lesson plans, articles and photos as a contributing writer. "
bad,enjoyed my job. One man operation.  I was on call 24/7 365 days a year.  I did not miss a day of work in over 19 years.
bad,"would like to further career but unable to"
bad,"Although it is not an excellent company, the frequent overtime and benefits makes up for the cons of the environment."
bad,This Consist of downloading software and imagining software to Kiskos.
bad,job taken matching technical skill sets while searching for a better match for opportunities and future growth
bad,"The benefits were outstanding. When I started working there I had quite a bit of autonomy to make my own decisions. By the time I left, that was all gone. My day was micro managed down to the minute & it was incredibly stressful."
bad,"If u see salary wise its not a good company.At start of the career one can expect to get 16-20k but increment are very sluggish ..allowance are not as per MNC standard ..when it comes to medical benefits, u can say its good not so good not so bad.if i summerize salary structure and allowances needs to be revised drastically."
bad,Very. Good place to work. Lots of hard work and long hours but rewarding. Would probably still be working for ncr however ncr sold the division that I was employed at lots of history that dates back with the company for being in business for over 100 years I started out as a line operator moved into supervision then into project management
good,Company always had an issue with having enough of a Workforce to match the workload.  they were always changing the schedule so it would be hard to plan personal allegations around work hours.
good,Job was very demanding on the production which require long hours and weekends. No real room to advance at this company or recieve a new job tittle. This was a good job to introduce me to a production atmosphere.
good,"You’ll get hired to perform a certain category of work. Then be expected to take on other roles without any additional pay. Treated like a number, not a person. Terrible life/work balance. They preach balance and do the complete opposite."
good,I have nothing to say about the job had fools working with me Like I said they told me they were did not keep there word to hiring me so I left that place
good,Senior leadership lacks true direction.  Vision/mission seems delusional and management changes have become the norm.  Transitions are abrupt and implemented with little to no input from employees. Company cares more about numbers than it does its employees.  I witnessed top talent depart in the last year and decided it was time to explore my options as well.  I know that all the effort to make the company appear lean was NOT worth it.  Company culture is segmented.  Double standards abound daily and if questioned nothing happens; instead HR and management come together to spin up a story that the masses have no choice but to accept or in this case explore other options.
good,No knowledge base to learn the product. Currently changing the rules as they go. Unwillingness t listen to any ideas. Never had a team meeting. NCR Silver has been the worst job I ever had. I highly recommend no one works there. Management was the worst threatening people's jobs daily. A terrible environment for anyone.
good,"NCR is good to work for but management is insane, no work / life balance and on call schedules were very problematic, the work is great and the independence you get is awesome."
good,"Non of the companies I worked for will ever appear on this site, no review needed."
good,High stress environment with little to no room for advancement. I wish I had money for legal representation due to the fact a disagreement with my manager on Friday got me a reduction in force email on Monday. Totally unprofessional and illegal way to fire someone.
good,Management too focused on bottom line.  Employees judged on making numbers.  Employees must use their own time to take online training.  Mandatory overtime most of the year.  Then overtime is cut off and customers are not serviced per the contracts.  Management is clueless on staffing and managing in general.  Many long hours for  not enough pay.  It was very hard to have a life when you are on call every three weeks.
good,"no team work, the management is really bad,the team leaders never teach proper rules,"
good,dealing with multi national environment and how to adapt your culture among them . the Technic of work is more structured than other environments  . following up process is very important within multinational environment which in return will enhance your performance accordingly .
good,Back office systems are too old and antiquated to be salvaged yet a lot of money is spent on band-aiding these applications.
good,Not racially balanced in management positions. Frequent instances of nepotism and blatant favoritism.
good,Working at NCR I do not have a home life at all and I am very underpaid. About every 3 weeks or so you get two days off where are you are actually off and not on call or on backup
good,I've been working here for almost three years and have yet to learn anything different. I'm always given excuses when I ask to learn new things. How can you advance or try to get any type of raise if you're stuck in one spot.
good,"Ncr is a good company for a beginner but not so much for long-term growth. Ncr does not value their employees as much as they should., Management is borderline poor with a few good Territory managers with field experience are the best managers all the other ones only care about the numbers with no real understanding of what the tech does in the field."
good,Shipping and receiving new and old products damaged goods determining if they were reusable or shipping as damage. Forklift operator also has tube move damaged goods from one space to the other
good,I liked this company. However the pay wasn’t so great. The hours were great. Management was more organized then any other company I had worked for. I would work for the company again giving the opportunity
good,This company is no longer in Canada. I worked for them when I was younger and it was great hours at the time and great people to work with. great location
good,"Bar none, NCR is the absolute worst company that I have ever worked for. There is very little room for advancement and the pay is a joke and until this day, nobody is able to explain how the commission structure works. By design, they do everything possible for you to not attain your goals."
good,Long hours with little to no cares of work life balance.  Grueling schedule with one weekend off a month and only 4 days off per month due to the work week start and stop days adopted.
good,It was only a temporary position but the managers did not communicate with the employees. The managers and supervisors did not inform the employees of their last day until the last day.
good,"look over equipment along with the paper work that was submitted by tech, in put information in Oracle providing if the the unit was going to be an Exchange or meaning customer send in their product and we exchange it with one of our product or if the customer sends in their product we were to repair there unit and send the customer back the same unit back to them."
good,"No advancement, unless you are part of the click or related, if you are not, there is no place for you at this company. Overloaded with work and under paid for the amount of work."
good,The advancement at this company has nothing to do with your dedication nor the knowledge that you've acquired at this job. The only thing they really care about is numbers and how much they can get out of you.
good,"The company has a very dispersed executive team and the culture as defined from the top is not conducive to growth and learning.  Given how little the company invests in marketing and employee development, its a difficult company to promote and thrive within."
good,"Incident Management, Management Trend Analysis Report."
good,High energy sales job.  No two days are the same.  Lots of travel was required.
good,Weekend deployments and 12+ hour days are the norm. Nice offices until you realize that you’ll never have a dedicated desk and you’ll be living there due to the work load. No work life balance and mandatory 5 day a week in office for IT while business skates. Don’t believe them if they tell you that you can work virtual from home.
good,"Did not treat all employees equally. Jobs were not posted or given fairly. Made to work to much overtime. Didn't practice what they preached. NCR used to be a good fun place to work, then they started putting people in positions that shouldn't have been."
good,It was self paced. Management changed hands frequently. Large inventory to maintain. A lot of driving per day. Fair environment to work for. The customers were very receptive.
good,"From 8 am to 6 pm you were on the go, hardly a moment to go to toilet, lunchtime couldn't happen due to the volume of work and pressure from management who didn't care whether you had a break or not or any lunch."
good,HR is horrible and extremely one sided too many issues swept under the rug no real advancement. Talent knowledge and skill is looked at as being a threat and being bullied is ok by HR
good,"NCR has no training program, and frankly no culture of accountability. They are very reactive with every step we take 2 backwards. They need a lesson is structuring."
good,Alot of the supervisors like to play favorites and fire folks for stuff they let other people do.  Its crazy what they are allowed to do in here. Glad they shutting down
good,The overall pay was low and the marketing process for leads was not managed well.  My manager was supportive and fun to work with.  He worked side by side the sales team and was very professional manager.
good,Estrutura matricial da empresa burocratização determinados processo e resoluções de problemas
good,"The territory managers care only about their numbers, despite claiming they care about their employees health.  They will try to get you to prioritize taking calls even if you feel you're driving is hinder by exhaustion."
good,"Management seems to put there Intrest FIRST which is understood to a certain Extent "
good,"NCR uses mainly temporary workers so when production goes up, they bring in anyone who will take the job. When production goes down they lay them off."
good,Overall it was good experience. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before I started working there so thats a good thing.  The Workplace could be better.
good,"Job itself is great, Drive around you assigned area and repair equipment."
good,NCR offers a good benefits package which offsets lower than average salaries. They typically advance from inside the company so opportunity is there for committed employees.
good,Be on time to work. Clock in and out. Get Paid. Every thing had order. I worked through a temp service so i was placed in production. On the job training and hands on activity.
good,"As a lottery technician, I repaired, replaced defective lottery machines to vendors across county. I enjoyed meeting other technicians and leaned some things."
good,"Very fast paced and very minimum training provided. If you do not pick up quick you will not succeed. Support from management is minimal but they tend to have a very patient lower management within the support group."
good,"Fast paced, detailed oriented environment.  Co-workers as well as management are focused on the task at hand."
good,learning how to count supplies for atms machines and car parts for clients who needed the supplies /hardest parts was being accurate
good,"A typical day of work would be challenged in achieving service level agreement, SLA. It's quite interesting to see productive works can be achieved when there are lots of calls coming and try to meet the SLA. Company, NCR, has gone through re-engineering and the result of management appears moving backward and getting worse. Almoset 50% of my co-workers have left the group and three bosses have been replaced from the best to the worse. The most enjoyable part of the job is to make customers happy eventhough issues were not resolved intime; but the hardest part of the work is to obtain replacement parts intime to resolve customers' need."
good,Education part of this company is great. However work/life balance not great at all.
good,"The NCR is the regulator of the credit industry in South Africa. It is very interesting as it gives a member of staff an overview of the entire financial sector in South Africa, and how it works."
good,"Forcasting of atms"
good,Empresa não investe no desenvolvimento profissional de seus colaboradores.
good,Respond to calls and perform preventive maintenance on ATM machines. Maintain parts inventory and order parts accordingly.
good,"If you want to learn how to play politics in industry and kiss-a** all the way to the top, this place is for you. You are encouraged to work long hours and do not get compensated in money or comp time. Spent 24 years there and survived 16 lay-offs. Finally, I just had enough."
good,"Ok, the main complaint about NCR is the lack of work/home life balance. No holidays off, round the clock scheduling, and constant AV. Also bonuses are non existent."
good,It’s all about computers assembling & other electric devices . But the management is not good enough for the convenience of the workers. Human relationships is the first priority for the workers to make the workplace comfortable.
good,The company is introducing a new work area and it is really stressfull to work because nobody has been trained on work processes because they do not have any in place.
good,"Good job but no work life balance, too much micromanagement, too much road time. GREAT work experience. You will learn A lot if you just try. Too easy for other employees to get by with bare minimum."
good,"Working for a big company has it's ups and downs for sure. Being Public is the same as well. NCR just purchased two companies, which will help grow the market share, but then also had some layoffs, which is not good for morale. Overall a decent place to work."
good,"- Auswertung der eingegangenen Werkzeugsanforderungen"
good,As a Customer Engineer you have the freedom of moving from one location to another everyday. You are not stuck behind a computer all day. NCR offers excellent training for most all of the equipment they service. If you work hard and stay focused you can get promoted.
good,Absence of Processes and Accountability in some functions and sub-organisations. Basic HR policies and lax attitude and culture. Semi-Transparent decisions and lower wages than the market standards.
good,"Empresa não valoriza o funcionário, uma vez formiga sempre formiga, não importe o quão qualificado esteja ou quão empenho se tenha na empresa. Sempre os da panela são valorizados."
good,I worked a full 10 months with this company I was suppose to have a 6 month review to be hired on fulltime. I never had one They used me in multiply departments gave me more hours but never gave me a shot at becoming a full time employee .
good,This is a good job for those without a family or life. The job is fast paced and sometimes enjoyable but when you see your hard work go unnoticed and a low chance of advancement unless you ready to kiss some serious butt
good,This company was quite challenging because when I first started there was very little training. I had to learn on my own be going to different departments observing and asking questions to veteran employees who knew the job.
good,Workweeks are 40+ hours with expected/demanded night work on top of typical 8 hour work day. Management is cumbersome and will throw employees under the proverbial bus when projects and operations have issues. Culture is a revolving door with loss of knowledge and experience where stress is the norm in IT. The team members are the silver lining where you work closely and learn a lot about your job and abilities. Hardest part of the job is trying to get plans and projects done with management stopping you at every turn and with no money to work on. Most enjoyable part is the team members.
good,"NCR is an okay company to work for but there is no stability. At any time, they can decide to lay off. If you need a place to get comfortable, it is the place to be."
good,"Driving from city to city providing tech services to stores, restaurants, airports, etc.  Fixing any issues with electronic devices preventing the company from continuing their sales or business productivity.  For those who enjoy working in the technician field figuring out failures and making it work, it was fun to have different challenges everyday.  Management in the other hand, was not as involved in the employee's future success or career. I worked two years with the company and only personally saw the manager twice.  After long shifts of twelve hours or more, no recognition or gratitude expressed.Like, after bringing up a network failure at a store from 3am to mid day, not even a phone call, e-mail or text message to recognize a job well done.  No three month period raised, not a yearly raise, not a two year raise."
good,"Good working place for new joinee but after 4 to 5 years, employee is at same place where is join."
good,"when I first started the new factor kicked in and it was a fun relaxed, helpful, productive environment. as management got reshuffled the work life balance became less, and more stressful and I resent waking up each day for it as there will be nothing but stress."
good,"An average place to work at. Management policies change too often, Looks like they are trying to re-position themselves in the market. Office will be moving to downtown in few month's time. Commute to work will be an added challenge."
good,"When I started at NCR, everyone was professional and knowledgeable, eager to learn what I had to offer from my knowledge at IBM. I enjoyed the first 4-5 years with NCR.  Afterwards, management started passing us around to different groups, hiring a manager that ran a few people off.  It went downhill from there, having our team with 45 years of experience train our replacements in Serbia to be outsourced to save a few extra bucks.  I would NOT recommend NCR to anyone looking for a company that is loyal to it's employee's and treats them with respect."
good,Average company. Work is average there. Management is really poor and poor salary. People who want a okay salary for living and want to do brain less work can join here and can enjoy there life.
good,"Good place to prove that you are tough. Culture very cutthroat. Do not apply if you desire work life balance; do not apply if you expect loyalty from the company; type of place you come to in order to sharpen skillsets, but not the  place you make a career."
good,"Working doing well but company change over to others company name"
good,"Management are clueless , to much in-house fighting for the corporate ladder , to many family members work in same department  , no corporation, if you smoke you with management you are in the circle ."
good,"Worst management i have ever worked in my life. Very much frustrated."
good,No Job Stability. My duties were outsourced overseas each period of employment.  Management was always changing and with that the duties and work environment changed.  Favoritism was prevalent as well as gender bias.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the team work to get from your co workers. The management really does not respect the field technicians.
good,Most coworkers are friend and responsible. Multicultural. Overtime is frequently expected.......................
good,"A typical day for a CE involves working with customers to resolve transaction-critical work issues.  I learned a lot about their systems and hardware, once I received training after four months on the job.  Management is out of touch with the boots on the ground, living hours away from the region.  Work week typically exceeded 60 hours, not including 1/2 hour on either side of the shift.  This made for very long weeks with no time at home.  If the scheduling were better, I would have stayed with the company.  I really enjoyed the work, I enjoyed what I learned and I really liked the healthcare benefits."
good,"Rating says all,,, nothing to say more. management is not good at all. co-operation is not there between the coleagues."
good,I learned a lot and enjoyed working with most of my colleagues.They're working on some interesting stuff. But Upper management was terrible and morale was in the toilet. High turnover rate and no job security or hope for advancement.
good,"Very challenging and engaging opportunity.  Great benefits and I worked with some great people.  Upper management cannot relate to challenges and infrastructure issues."
good,Overloaded with several projects and short deliverable times.
good,Not the best company to work for.  Nobody knows what they are doing.  Not very efficient.
good,Need to hire management with great people skills and with actual management skills.
good,Interacting with the other associates gave me the drive and will to come to work on a daily basis.
good,"Ncr is an great company . I configure pos and prepare them to be shipped out,"
good,"Enjoy financial consulting as a practice, but NCR was a hostile environment to work in"
good,"Overall, NCR Corporation is a good company. The Plant where I worked was closed and the work was given to other plants. The factory was closed so I lost my job."
good,I enjoyed the contacts and accomplishment when issues were resolved.  I worked with a great team of folks--but was dissappointed not to have been re-hired by NCR when my year came to an end. Did not enjoy impersonal climate of contract work--but had no choice.
good,NCR is an ok place to work but they were not organized and they show favoritism if the pay was better I would recommend people to work there but by being so disorganized their product was assembled wrong most of the time.
good,meet some good people there hope to see some of them again. work was not physically demanding. i enjoyed what my task was and gave it 100% every day i was there.
good,"8-10 Hour daily. First shift only. Management wasn't so great. Favoritism was going on daily. Learned to stay to myself, keep my area clean daily as I worked. Get my work done at a timely pace. Wasn't really hard about the job, just the people u work with. The enjoyable part about the job is the holiday parties, and the vacation and time off."
good,"Lower management doesn't really know how to handle things well. "
good,Most of support work teams are working on very old technology to support old products. Please be careful while joining the team. Double check the technology(All ways outdated) they are using.
good,It's a job. You'll make enough money just to get by. Overtime is usually mandatory for some assembly lines throughout most of the year but for others it comes and goes. One week you may struggle to get 40 hours and the next you may be working 12 hour shifts Monday-Friday and 8 hours on Saturday.
good,"Due to the management lacking a clear vision plan, process improvements were hard to determine and difficult to implement"
good,"Balanced work/life... new technology and busy place."
good,No advancement opportunity. A lot favoritism. Overall a decent job but don’t expect career development and expect management that knows less than you do
good,You need to hit the ground running on your first day. The tools you need to do the job well are not given to you at all if you're a temp. You will put miles on your personal vehicle before you can earn a company van.
good,"I only worked as a repair technician for only a short period, and I was able to learn new skills and on how to repair damaged screens and process imaging and rating using computer programming. and applications. "
good,"Morning will be filled with reports of previous day's job scope and afternoon will be forecasting and analyzing cash movements in ATMs. "
good,The company was very cost conscious and was in a constant state of restructuring trying to reduce costs when its overall problem was actually lack of revenue from aging product lines.
good,"NCR is a decent employer with a higher than average pay rate. As with most international corps, they have some issues with implementation, coordination and technician assistance."
good,This is a rather large company with many moving parts and its usually a case where the little guy often takes the fall for the execs. There is virtually no job security at this company. Its money before relationships.
good,"Laid back atmosphere as long as the job is done. Barely any management present at the time I worked there. Nice that the role involved international work, however this has since been outsourced to India"
good,It all depends on what part of the plant you work in to determine wether or not you'll be working at a fast pace. you will get breaks and make a lot of new friends as well as learning a lot of different things.
good,"A NCR te dá chances de crescimento, várias oportunidades de viagens para integração com outras equipes globais, porém a cultura de trabalho (forçada pelo comercial e pós-vendas) é a de que todo mundo deve ser workaholic. Há quem goste e há quem não goste. "
good,Typical day at work consists of constant monitoring of customer orders. Handling any escalations from external/internal customers and working with manufacturing to insure all customer requirements and revenue goals are achieved.
good,"Average mgmt stuff, lack of agreement and understanding among top mgmt about future direction.No employee development practices,"
good,"too often waiting on parts to arrive. too long waiting to go temporary to permanent. Nice coworkers, when parts were there and all facets were clicking teamwork and keeping up with production was fun."
good,I am learing on negotiation skills here.  I am working on how to work as a team manager.Dealing with channel partner management
good,"Work involves lifting networking machinery, loading customer-requested data on it, then shipping it. The job teaches basic networking and Cisco configuration, and allows exposure to a wide variety of devices. "
good,No team work. Personnel need more training. Shift hours atypical. But work is interesting. These comments are my opinion based on few months there. it might changed.
good,The best part of the day was when you got off on time. All the overtime you can want. Sometimes it was hard to get the correct working parts need on time.
good,"Co-workers are the best part of the job and are helpful in training and sharing information."
good,"The company has a very dispersed executive team and the culture as defined from the top is not conducive to growth and learning. Given how little the company invests in marketing and employee development, its a difficult company to promote and thrive within."
good,this job is very stressful you work long hours and are set up to fail. the metrics they hold you to are not possible to obtain with out fudging the numbers. you are penalized for contractors and how they do their job. they worst part of this job was the manager you could never ask for help with out being them being condescending towards you or complain about one of your team mates to you. the management created a hostile work environment. the only thing that made it fun to work thier was my co workers becasue no matter what happen we could rely on each other to help get the job down.
good,Love working with the people.  NCR does a lot of things right but they do not take of their people.  They are a revolving door.
good,my coworkers are friendly. but service logistics business is outsourced too much.
good,"Low moral, no job security due to all the layoffs occuring. Very minimaul training and management support."
good,"1. Productive work place."
good,"Great work culture, good co workers. Collaborative management style"
good,Good company to work for. They offer decent wages and benefits. They do not care too much for balancing work/family life. They never acknowledged my requests for a schedule change due to the time of day my kids get off the bus and when my schedule started. This eventually lead to my dismissal from the company.
good,Supported financial analyst related activities. Was not very progressive in the form of technologies or process.
good,"As a Customer Engineer II, I often traveled throughout Central Ohio fixing computer based equipment and network equipment such as ATMs, Retail registers, routers and switches. I really enjoyed talking with the customer and letting them know what was going on. The team I had worked together to make sure we weren't crossing each other down the street and everybody had a fair share of work."
good,"The job itself and the work you do is great. The upper management of the company is in constant change, which cause constant stress on the work force. Pay is mediocre and they are not generous with raises. Management seems to care little for employees personal life with constant changes they make with in the company."
good,"Very safe place to work, with alot to learn from. You pick up on alot of technical skill and learn to work as a team called the LEAN process. The hardest part of the job is moving heavy machinery around. The management is helpfull and patient. The best part of the job is the skills I pick up on from the machines I work on."
good,NCR has a really fun atmosphere and offers a lot of room and opportunity for personal and professional growth/advancement. I would recommend this company to anyone with ambitious professional goals.
good,Low wages. People in management don't enforce rules. Not a relaxed place to work. Got to work two many hours to make end meet. No to work is encourage by management peolpe work around showing their underwear.
good,"In the short time that I worked for NCR, I had lots of fun , traveling from site to site , staying busy , dealing with customers , hearing there issues ,, the best part of dealing with site customers is leaving them with a compete site repair , networking issues , P.O.S. or otherwise .."
good,Most days were busy as part of the job. I learn to work on difference cashier registers. The management team was nice. The hardest part was having to put high mileage on my car weekly. The fun part was meeting new managers at the different locations.
good,"A NCR é  uma boa empresa para trabalhar, desenvolve treinamentos  a todos os funcionários, deixando os mesmos seguros para desempenhar as atividades gerias do dia a dia."
good,It's a great place to get your foot in the door to learn how to service specialty equipment.  But I wouldn't plan on spending your whole career there...
good,The salary is very less to fresher's..but work is very free and nice work place .But I gained knowledge about ATM MACHINES.Any want to gain knowledge about ATM machines you can work there..Finally company was little bit friendly nature.
good,Loved What I did for work.  Learned a lot about different systems and hardware. Always traveling to customer sites.  Get to meet a lot of different people from many companies.
good,"I am able to work in the office or from home on my own schedule.  I can flex hours as long as I am getting the job done.  My manager is very open and honest and allows room for creativity and offers a supportive feel.  The culture at NCR is very fast paced and at times oversteps on the work life balance feel.   The hardest part of the position is balancing all of the many projects that are extra along with the basics of the job role.  We are a very lean team, which allows me to work and have exposure to many different areas and projects!  However this at times can be overwhelming when trying to focus on work that matters most.  I enjoy the team and the people I work with, and I really do love my manager."
good,The building I worked at Shiloh everything was based on how lucky you got with your position. Your pay and the quality of management all depends on the department you got and it is very hard to change out specially if you are good at your job.
good,"I worked for Intuit and we were sold to Thoma Bravo who then sold us to NCR.  Previous to that, we were a startup and were very happy.  NCR basically took all that was good about a startup and crushed it.  If you are used to being treated badly then this might be a good place for you.  They did pay decently and if you could figure out how to manage your time wisely then work/life balance could be had.  It's a decent place to work but they are relocating people to Atlanta and I don't want to live there...so time to move on."
good,"Management is unethical and uncooperative, Management does not interact as team members.  Its all about what they require, no room for interpretation and does not respect their employee's or their opinions."
good,"An ok company, but I wouldn’t recommend it for a permanent employment. It can be stressful at times, the supervisors only cover their selfs and when they get in trouble they take it out on you."
good,Had to work with advance the product line of the company but the account manager felt we were there to spy on them .........................................................
good,NCR expects for many employees to be available 24/7 with little regard for home/family life. Many people have been converted to salary from hourly with the same work expectations.
good,"Columbus plants operate within their own bubble. There are corporate documents available for all employees to see that they do not adhere to. Clique mentality, not everyone is treated the same."
good,Worked for NCR and at first it all was looking great. Many managers tend to be replaced. This leaves the team having to learn other manager's preferences. Pay was ok but could be a bit more considering the hustle they ask from you.
good,"Most enjoyable about the job was paid time off. Overall, I liked working for the company but I wouldn't go back. Too much favoritism was shown and not enough authority."
good,"If you live to work, NCR works to make you live. If you don't, you are SCREWED. Not a single schedule in the entire retail or financial technician levels are set. Odd hours, odd days, special projects that require even earlier hours than scheduled, and extra time required by technicians randomly assigned to stay on-call. 2 weeks of vacation and pretty generous wages for a first-time technician. Just don't get your hopes up about having a life away from work."
good,"It's a fun job, I love my customers and co-workers.   The problem is NCR doesn't pay very well.   Raises are a joke, 2-3% a year, which doesn't even cover cost of living increases.   Plus they now are charging Spousal Surcharge for Health Insurances and just remove $600 worth of Internet Reimbursement."
good,NCR is an interesting place to work with many talented people.  They are the typical hardware company still trying to figure out how to be an efficient modern software company.
good,"Joined this company with so many expectations,"
good,"NCR is a complicated environment. Your job satisfaction will depend on several factors, including, your personality, how you deal with stress and your personality."
good,"I am playing a challenging role at my organisation as we have to satisfy customer by providing services 24*7 as we are the service providers of ATMs and BNAs. Our clients are the major such as CITI,SCB,HSBC,HDFC,SBI,KOTAK,ICICI and all other small government and private banks.The most enjoyable part of job is servicing their assets before their expectation time bound.The learning part of my job is making new connections with the customers as they are the key source of our business, in other words building Customer Relationship."
good,"Great people, great comradery, but management is insensitive to the personal needs of the people that work for the. They only seemed concerned with the bottom line and not with the lives of the people that work to make the company great. After the restructuring of leadership the environment that used to foster great results has taken a hit and the people who have made their comfortable and personable are now leaving the company when possible. This company is now a mixed bag. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. The hardest part is the volume of work."
good,"Every work gives us experience.   "
good,"- Good place to put on resume"
good,"Planning and managing daily Service Requests based on SLA."
good,The management at NCR seem to base advancement more on popularity then on job performance. I base this on the fact that of a 3 year career with the company I received only two job reviews both were outstanding but when I tried to seek advancement I was informed that I wasn't up to standard something that wasn't shown in any review or brought to my knowledge previously.
good,NCR is process oriented company & having both horizontal & vertical growth. Management is supportive. Good work place. With rich culture.Most important is NCR is giving complete liberty to work as far as you are working for organization goal.
good,"NCR is a great place to work if you don't mind working weekends and long hours. Management can be hard to work with at times, but the other employees make it all worth it and fun place to work."
good,"good job if you are just out of high school and looking to get paid, but down side is that they are out sourcing my department"
good,"Overall, NCR was a pretty decent place to work.  Great benefits, flexible schedules and very innovative in terms of promoting a self-service environment for their employees."
good,"Wake up around 0600 and start work around 0700"
good,"It's been 2 months since I arrived at NCR from their competitor, Diebold. So far I have found the lowest morale of any job I have ever had and that is saying something having come from Diebold where I was often covering 120 hours a week by myself. Overall, I have found NCR to be lacking in the area of logistics. Every company has such issues, but I feel they are magnified at NCR. Recently, I found NCR had been listed by Wall St as one of the top 10 worst places to work for in 2013. I don't think I can disagree."
good,"This is a full-time job that requires servicing various retail and financial customers throughout an assigned territory.  On average, there were 30 CEs managed by a territory manager, and service calls were dispatched by a call center.  Within a territory, the CEs were organized into teams of three to seven technicians.  Each team would service its geographically assigned area.  People skills are definitely a requirement, as well as knowledge of computer hardware and software."
good,Was your typical break/fix repair company. Had a few good coworkers.
good,Used web based analysis tools along with Excel and Access. I learned a lot about data analysis and mining. I didn't have a great deal of interaction with management and that was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility to work virtually.
good,Decent work place allowing me to use a few hours to take care of personal business and make up time by end of work week.
good,"Empresa de médio porte, com funcionários preocupados no atingimento de metas mensais. Espirito de equipe e ambiente agradável."
good,"Good company, but difficult to advance career. Very large bureaucratic organization with weekly changes in positions and responsibilities. Everyone is too busy trying to cover-their-butt to really put out good effort and new ideas."
good,ive learned being at ncr hoe to be timely and descreet caring about the customers concerns
good,I worked the 3-12midnight shift total of 40 hour weekly plus some over time. Leaving home at 1pm and returning at 2am. 1hour 45min - 2 hours going and coming. During Snow days 3 hours going and coming.
good,"I have service calls that I run throughout WNC daily averging 5-6 calls a day. Diagnose issues with equipment and order parts as needed to repair machines. Management is not personable. When things are done well we are praised as a team but if things are done bad it is not longer handled as a team but on personal level being called out in front of everyone. Hardest part of the job is not knowing what the day will hold for you. calls could be light or heavy, could get home on time or have to work overtime. The things I enjoy most about job is the travel, relationship I have with my customers, and working with fellow employees as a team to complete calls."
good,"They don't  make us permanent employee,and they don't increase your salary ,and there is no promotion in your job ,but it's a good and neat place to work"
good,Often you are asked to work well beyond 40 hours a week. There are often surprise jobs that need to be done. I never have a plan for the day. I start each day and each task with no plan for the next.
good,"Lots of bureaucracy, bad systems, some good people, some not so good. There's lot of opportunity for advancement because attrition is so high. I wouldn't recommend it to others."
good,Empresa com um ambiente bacana de trabalho e pessoas legais.
good,Assignments can be volatile and teams often fluctuate. The most enjoyable part of the workplace is the exposure to different people and various teams. Stay focused on career objectives.
good,"Like working in a Salt Mine- Endless hours, no appreciation, Work Life Balance is non-existent- Annual P&L growth is dictated by Finance people that are clueless of market conditions and customers needs,   Lower level Regional VP's do not respect the Sr VP's operational direction therefore ignore their vision."
good,"Overall NCR was a good environment to work in. It had a lack of communication skills. When it was time for promotion or raise, the reward was an insult for most of their employees. Management was not fair to employees when giving promotions. I can say no job at NCR was hard or stressful if co-workers work together to get the job done."
good,Materials arriving late for production. Having to stay late with little or no notice. Workers not informed on day to day schedules.Hardest part of job was lack of communication. The enjoyable part was getting off on time.
good,Modern workplace with lot of facilities on site. Work place does not appear to be demanding. Typical large company management. Great place for interns and new hires.
good,"every day is different. co workers are great. Dealing with the clients can be difficult at times. pay is OK, but  this is California and pay should be 15% better."
good,"This company has made me learn marketing from scratch."
good,"More Politics, Less Human Values and Respect. Management wont talk to employees. Only one sided decisions which will many times affect the employee. Not suggested company."
good,"Customer Engineer:"
good,"nice work place if you doing your job..a lot of standing an walking.its a production base company , but you get paid by the hour. guarenteed over time."
good,"on a daily work routine, you had to learn on your own. There were no training courses or team meetings to provide training. This was a sink or swim type of environment."
good,"Pros"
good,"Being in a Support role, reviewing issues that remained in queue for X and reassessing priorities.  After positions aiding in client facing/communication tasks, my position began to entail more tasks outside of technical ones.   My team was a very good team and that was the best part of the job."
good,NCR provided an employee friendly environment.  Unfortunately they experienced some poor leadership and tried to expand the business into areas outside their realm of expertise.  When this failed they were forced to layoff many employees.
good,"As a parts analyst, I helped local NCR cash register mechanic get the right parts. The work was slow paced and friendly. The pay was probably about standard for the industry."
good,"worked as a contractor, and it was slow paced job. it may have been different if i was a full time employee. Co-workers are friendly and willing to help at all times."
good,"I helped techs to put together equipment on sight and run tests to make sure it was working properly and helped problem solve when it wasn't. Management could have been better less family oriented, but in other work areas management was much better."
good,"It is not a bad job if you are passionate about tech and customer service. You are dispatched on calls to fix many different types of computers throughout your day which are run through your assigned territory. With not usually having prior knowledge as to where you will be working that day, the job can feel adventurous. You get to meet a lot of people within many different environments. Although the general nature can feel chaotic to some. Being a field engineer isn't for everyone, but it can definitely be a fun job depending on your perspective and what you are looking for in your work."
good,"High stress medium pay.  the demand to fulfill a minimum amount of service calls per day and averaged out through out the year. This is a metric that must be met.  No matter the personal days, weekends, or training.  a set number must be met"
good,"I have found that I had an overall good experience working at the company: the pay was reasonable for the work we completed, the infrastructure seemed to work well enough, and there wasn't a lot of stress. With that said, however, the biggest issue plaguing this company was a major disconnect between the internal teams - this disconnect carried through to the customers."
good,"I like working with the people who work with me. It's a good group, and has a very ""small business"" feel to the local office. That's not always a good thing though. Room for advancement just isn't there. I would like to climb a ladder, get some raises, and find some quality time with my family as well. That proves to be a very difficult balance. Job security is definitely there as long as you want to do the same thing, for the same pay, every day. I would recommend this job to people, but I wouldn't recommend it as a career."
good,The company offer great benefits that can support you and your family. The cons I've experienced is that within my department there is limited staffing. Currently for 7 months there have been two people supporting this department for over 500 plus customers with an ongoing 24 hour emergency support. Leadership makes no effort to bring in others so that additional support can be added. Also promised a raise but was never given that raise and that been over 6 months now. Within my department there is a high turnover rate but as previously stated they have currently halted an new hiring.
good,"As a field tech, this company gave me a great start. I've picked new and had an opportunity to utilize my existing troubleshooting skills. Nothing makes you feel better than a machine that wasn't working when you got there, and was when you left. "
good,learned a lot while there. Management local changed very often making hard to prove yourself. a lot of favoritism was played . Overall I was proud to have worked there for almost 10 years
good,Not good for long term career they seemed to have issues with orders also. i enjoyed building scanners for them broke my heart when then anounced the laid offs
good,A typical day like any other day goes the same. we are technicians making this happen for both the customer and management. My job is to make sure that people who use convenient ATM are well satisfied with the service we render
good,"A mature company with clear visions, plans and directions."
good,"NCR is a great company, but they outsourced so many of their staff. Needs more advancement within the organization. The company I worked for closed its location and moved everyone to Atlanta."
good,"While the work I did at NCR was great, be aware that they use every loophole imaginable to keep from paying fair rates. As a tech consultant, they try to utilize us like contractors, including penalizing us for taking vacation time in any quarter. If we would like to reach our full 'salary', we must not take vacation, or make up the billable hours we have missed while on vacation. Due to this, the work can be exceptionally stressful, but the nature of the work was more than fine."
good,Good Company to work for and will be centralizing workforces within the next few years in downtown Atlanta. Need to streamline silo'ed processes and teams to provide a better employee work/life balance.
good,"The company is very focused on its quarterly and yearly results, and consistently improving its products, processes and customer experience.  For some employees, the company requirements lead to an imbalance between work and life.  Work hard and you will be rewarded."
good,"Falta uma identidade para a empresa. Hora ela segue os processos e regras globais, hora ela tentar ter uma estrutura local auto-suficiente. Isto cria conflito e falta de posicionamento."
good,Management has to think about the employees who are working unstoppable.Also before communicate to customer any commitment first they have to discuss with team.
good,"Big proponent of moving jobs overseas. The jobs pay very well, but you can't count on having them through retirement, unless you are a field technician."
good,"When NCR left Dayton, OH for Atlanta, GA, they left a small group of Professional Services employees and Technical Support staff in Dayton.  I was one of those that stayed in Dayton and when not traveling, I worked remotely from my home office.  This was a tremendous opportunity that required discipline, focus and self-motivation."
good,Good company to work for. I Really appreciate NCR's work culture and process. Its a 140 year old company going strong by the day.
good,Very easy job. I learned a lot as far as build certain equipment. The  breaks was great and employees are friendly and very helpful.
good,it is a decent place to work. It's just hard to move up in that company. if you are looking for something to get experience in then maybe it's the place for you.
good,Work is varied and requires a lot of travel which makes it interesting. There is no such thing as a typical day. Regular opportunities to learn new skills through NCR University. Management slow to engage when it comes to reviews but otherwise good. Co workers generally good to work with although there is little interaction on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is being on call 8am to 10pm for 7 days every 4 weeks.
good,"Test equipment, clean, and replace none functional parts."
good,"A few years ago, I would have said this was a great place to work. In 2011, everything changed. Upper management does not care about the technicians anymore. We're just numbers on a page. Morale is very low. Although a recent survey said 30% of us might leave for another company. Based on conversations, I'd say it's more like 70% or higher. No one is happy on the job, and many are afraid to speak up."
good,"A typical day consist of following up on existing tickets, creating new tickets for customer accounts, attending meetings with customers to get updates on issues, working in labs to resolves customer issues. "
good,Currently working with ATM channel manager from  last 10 month & i have to total 5 & half year experience  same ATM field
good,"loomis and ncr merged together, large company to work for, very productive "
good,"*Normal pace of speed, paying close attention to detail while downloading program"
good,I would rather not comment due to proprietary nature of my position
good,I work in the call center and the call volume is high. There is very little room to move up in the department. Most employees move to other departments
good,"Fair enough. Looking for new opportunities, where can I can I put my education and work experience to grow. Location and other stuff is good for me..."
good,"the ATM side is stressful, when making service calls at night or in bad parts of town. retail service not  bad  overall. training was good when the company would send you, all fiscal training was in Georgia."
good,"Personal and work- life balance."
good,"I worked for the company for 10 years and accrued a healthy amount of vacation time to include floating holidays.  On a day to day basis, I worked remote with little to no travel."
good,"Tiene buenos beneficios y ambiente."
good,"just work fixing self check out at Walmart, Wincos, Target, Home Depot register at Starbucks and other Stores around Sacramento California. The work is intense, in involve a lot of contact with Help Desk"
good,"this job is just so stressful, they can not keep up with what they say, they are so last minute noticeable, don't have time for employees at all. needs improvements"
good,"Adding this review because it is required."
good,AS for upper mamagement the company wasn't manager right. The employees didn't get a decent raise. A typical day trying to get products completed to be shipped out for customers demand.
good,"- Pros"
good,decent place to work at. A Lot of over time available. time goes fast because most of the time you are busy. you work on your own on the field. company dodge caravan
good,"Management in the rocky mtn region needs to be watched more carefully. As soon as the management saw opportunity they demoted one of the most dedicated aloha managers ive ever met or worked for. Only to replace him with a younger, less capable person."
good,Good working place with a lot of stuff to learn and great management and all was just fine with them paycheck is little low and maybe the should start to threat us as humans not numbers
good,Spent almost 10 years working for NCR. There are a lot of positives and a lot of negatives. If you can handle a fast pace and like to be proud of your work then its a good place to work.
good,If your single and have a strong drive to climb the Corporate ladder and love to work long hours with little time to yourself this is the company for you and you will do well. If you value work life balance and time with your family I would suggest another company.
good,Good place to work. Everyday had a new challenge. Working with professional and personable people. Direct interaction with customers in working environment.
good,"I only worked there for 10 months during a union labor dispute. Nothing more to acknowledge."
good,"-worked as an STNA for national church residences"
good,"NCR is a great company for a young person who dont have any kids. I was working there after being a full time student in college. The are really no set hours. Over time opportunities is almost always there but it's not really optional. It was very laid back. They provided tshirt and you could wear whatever color bottoms and shoes you wanted. Fridays & weekends was a fashion show lol. Fridays was team day. Management sucked! Very disorganized; Some days you never know what time you'll leave work or when you will have to stay over until it's about time to go. Most times we wouldnt know if we were working weekends until that Friday. They were always laying off. Chances to get hired on was very slim. I worked there 13 months and returned after layoff for 1 month and was fired after I missed one day. On my separation notice it stated ""attendance"" but somehow I was still rewarded my bonus that they were rewarding for people who weren't late and only could have one excused absence! There are always bonuses but the come with gags...Like that one lol...For example once we got a $250 bonus but we had to work 16-18 for 2 days and it wasn't optional. But more money! But being that I didn't have kids or responsibilities I would like the money just not my days being tied up that long"
good,"A l'époque, société saine mais a vite été dépassée"
good,Get to learn new things at every level. Culture is good. Was able to learn and grow in the process. Varied levels of function at NCR. Always an opportunity to move ahead
good,"I was able to work from home on most days. The days I was working in the office, the pace was bustling and everyone seemed very busy.. My direct supervisor was not available to review my writing work and provide feedback on most days."
good,Now the management isn't good and we run out of parts everyday and now we are not getting 40 hours a week and being sent home early. The job is not hard at all
good,An Office Automation Division of NCR re-selling computer equipment from Convergent Technologies (also sold by Burroughs Computer).  We have very limited Applications to sell for Office Automation.  The success came mainly from selling additional equipment to Legacy NCR Customers. The product lacked a competitive advantage due to the reliance on the OEM Supplier - Convergent Technologies - for new applications and custom solutions request by potential clients.  Sustained revenue goals by up-selling Other NCR Products.
good,i enjoy coming in and dealing with my co workers. There is a lot to learn here from dealing with ATM's to processing registers for different retail stores.
good,"A long time ago. good to work there, most ever body was working hard. I dont know if they still exist or not. They are probably are bought out by some other company"
good,Was a great opportunity to learn how to build different units in the National Cash Register industry. I worked for them through a temp agency we were told after 90days we would be considered for permanent hire but that was true. But overall I enjoyed my experience with the company.
good,"Really enjoyed working for this company . "
good,"You don't feel like youre a part of something, just feels like youre just another average employee that is easily replaced. NCR does pay well, I'll give them that."
good,"Talk to customers on daily basis. Work with Dev and QA to deliver a quality product. Manage my team here locally in Dallas and in Prague .  "
good,A good work environment with great opportunities to improve. They could stand to improve on communication between locations and working to improve implementation of changes made by design groups.
good,My typical day at work is extremely stressful but a very easy place to adapt to . The supervisors are great and hardworking but the timing is never sure .
good,Highly dynamic and productive environment with highly skilled workers.
good,"NCR is a dependable company to work for, but there is little room for advancement.  Raises are small and regulated on a yearly basis. Middle management is a revolving door.  Good benefits, but not a good career path."
good,"Good work environment, but a lot of pressure to become a ""generalist"" as opposed to a ""specialist"". That translates to being able to do a lot of things adequately, instead of a few things exceptionally."
good,I worked for NCR and the companies acquired by it for over 20 years. Great company to work for with managers that are helpful an education is provided to employees
good,"It seemed like they were always squeezing the sponge for another drop of water. Not a bad place to work, but always seemed like they were wanting more. It's been several years since I worked there, so I hope some of that has changed."
good,I was only there for 3 years. I was sold to NCR by Siemens to work on the heritage systems that Unify had contracts with. Maintain service and MAC on the systems.
good,I believe that it was just my personal experience.with the management that was in place at the time. the job itself was not hard . management made the environment as stressful as it was
good,NCR is a good company to work for and grew with since provided a lot of training to its employee. NCR management was good and set appropriate and reasonable goals to be achieved. The workplace was very professional and nice.  I was in control and happy with my job with NCR and did not have any hardship.
good,"Learned different types of computer, software  and hardware, interact with customers of different companies which help me with my customer experience skills."
good,"It's  the second largest IT company on these days. Learned abt network engineering and database mangement."
good,Nice place to work. Great co-workers. Great benefits package. Management is OK. A lot to learn and they provide all the tools required for the job. Nice company.
good,Great place to work who wants to learn Oracle ERP or teradata. Highly technical and competitive environment give you extra edge to learn new things and very quickly.
good,"It was a great opportunity and training provided was unparalleled. The hours were a bear, and it was hard to get technical support. There was a lot of good work opportunity, but a lot of micromanagement went on from ABOVE my immediate Supvsr. (who was a great guy)."
good,Great company to work for.   Touch many different pieces of Hardware.  Never a dull moment. Technician must keep track of his parts  inventory which is sometime unclear because you are never sure which parts needs to return and which was does not.
good,Working the line was really fun. The management sucked though trying to push out too many product so they can get there bonus. After they get there bonus they run out of orders and have to lay you off.
good,"The company as a whole is a good company. However, from a data mining experience, they have system issues. Very hard to get the correct data out of the systems. Need better DW or ERP systems."
good,"Working at NCR gave a wider knowledge and a good experience about various aspects of my domain. Knowing the industry it caters to & the tight SLA's it has, one has to be on alert every minute."
good,"Answer all incoming telephone calls of a transportation nature and confirm eligibility, scheduling and appropriate mode of transportation."
good,"NCR understands people, there is a good life/work balance. "
good,working at NCR is so easy the workplace is what you make of it. the job isn't hard but the hours can be long. management isn't bad and its always cool inside
good,Poor strategy. The company does not retain talent. The strategy is very volatile. The organization keeps re structuring itself multiple times. No stability in decision making.
good,Solid products in the financial banking markets.  Servicing of products needs of lot of work.  Takes to long to integrate new technologies and innovative approaches.
good,everyone is passionate about the work and the clients served. great overall ministry with people of great hearts helping those in needs. would recommend
good,"Is a decent company to work for. Long hours but benefits are better then others. Get training system, along with great way to help provide a productive work day,"
good,I am not even sure if this company is still in the Atlanta Metro Area. This was a good job for me at the time.. it was close to my home and the hours were good.. the call volume was huge.. so I would leave exhausted from people screaming in my ear..  It was some times hard to have customer issues resolved
good,"No assimilation process for new hires;Culture, ethics, and Expectations are hard to convey when the position is 100% virtual."
good,"Job culture varies greatly by department. It  could be a very nice place to work or  the worse depending in which dept you are. Presently, there is no job security."
good,"NCR is a good place to work where you can learn and explore. People here are motivational you will find good working culture here."
good,"great team members, average environment to work within.  Very busy schedule when projects are incoming, slows down drastically once a project completes."
good,"8 hours a day at work. Testing out machines. Extremely boring but good people that work there. Most production jobs are ran by agencies, 0 hours contract. Not a good feeling getting told weather or not you've got your job for next week."
good,"I worked at NCR (In Ft. Worth) for a little over 2 years and was laid-off. My experience with the company was positive; however there are some things that you should know up front:"
good,ncr has much productive as well as many things to learn but there is no any respect for field engineer by managers in delhi team
good,Work day consisted of an 8 hour work day with excessive overtime. I have learned a lot about the IT industry and working in a team based environment . Flexibility was one of the things i enjoyed.
good,"Purchasing in one country, selling into another, teamwork is the main key in succeeding within the bilinqual team."
good,"As unfortunate as it was, I did learn a lot there and have made many close colleagues as a result working there that I'm very grateful for. It was a powerful work experience and I'm glad I spent time there, but am ready to move on and find a new opportunity where I can put my skills to good use."
good,"As the company has moved towards its future, it has seemingly forgotten about caring for the customer, and only wants numbers on the paper."
good,Great for upper level employees. the lower level tends to be a rough environment in certain areas. Good education availability. I would recommend for software engineers and IT business related roles.
good,Not a typical warehouse. Working with buyers and planners was a challenge. NCR is something of a know somebody to get somewhere company rather than let your work show for itself.
good,Management expected to get the work done with less people as required to satisfy the Client.. Management was to much number driven and not so much Customer oriented
good,Learning opportunities are there with respect to what type of job you are in. People are supportive ans friendly. Overall nice place to work.
good,Team player among co workers. Motivators in the area of innovation and community. Management very proactive in getting the job completed. The most enjoyable part of the job my co-workers. They encourage your ideas and pull out your creativity.
good,Simple Datamodels hence easy to understand and work even if others do not help. Not challenging from technical perspective but management and employees lack professionalism in implementing projects. Employees fool business with substandard work nor give KT to new joinees. Business better outsource IT work to vendors who will be more loyal and efficient.
good,"NCR has many departments and all departments are different. I would say my department is the ""stomach"" of the company because we are there to make sure the customer has what they need to run their business. Some days are harder than some."
good,"Typical day in NCR is dynamic, almost full-time brainstorming, analyzing, continual service improvement and troubleshooting."
good,"Being the pioneer and leader in self service technology and services, its the niche in its line of business and manages a balance in workplace with social life."
good,"I learned things i never expected that i would do. Highly intensive IT work is needed, to be analytical is a key in solving a problem. The Job is dangerous because of the risk involve in working with ATMs."
good,"I am really enjoying my Job. The atmosphere and colique are very"
good,Good place in terms of learning. Compensation structure is not that good. Not a good place if you're looking for a long term career.
good,"Management was very unorganized"
good,"buena empresa, solo le hace falta mas motivacion, como plantas, caja de ahorro"
good,"A little scrambled, but this is due to the extremely technical environment with steep learning curves. Overall good company with benefits, pleasant people."
good,"NCR is the company with great potential ... unfortunatelly on many fields just not used ..."
good,The hardest part of this position was the expectation of being available 24/7 365 days. The management here i was not very impressed with as they seem to want to manage to numbers with little care about the employees.  The most enjoyable part was that it was a virtual position and allowed me to work from home.
good,"Long hours, a lot of driving and you usually work alone, all work orders received via your cell phone or blackberry. Learned a lot about Point of Sales terminal and ATMs."
good,Work schedule and company metrics constantly chaning. 8 supervisors in 7 years. Not enough pay for the work required. Great coworkers.
good,I drove to ATM sites repaired them even under forced overtime. I risked my life to fix the ATM and the management was not good to work wit at NCR. I performed my duties in a good manner.
good,Traveled throughout Denver Metro area to service ATMs. Resolved technical and mechanical issues as well as clear media jams. Learned to adapt to new technologies/equipment fairly quickly.  Service call volume was high but was able to work with co-workers to keep it under control (work as a team).  Hardest part of job was at times driving long distances back and forth getting to job sites.  Most enjoyable part is learning about new equipment/technology and resolving customer issues.
good,"This is a company trying to turn around its public image, but it is still stuck in the past in many ways."
good,"This is the type of job where no matter how much more work you're doing than the other guy, he gets a raise because he knows the boss. They employ too many people who have no computer experience which results in the entire office being slowed down."
good,"Pizza is one of my favorite restaurants to go and eat, but working there was a good experience.  I had great team-members in my sales team.  Pizza Hut showed me what it's like to work in a team and be able to manage weekly pizza sales of $10K+.  Coordinate teams to meet annual objectives of 10% profit margin and do logistics of inventory valued at $150K annually."
good,"Bilingual Customer service job within a team of 15."
good,A typical day a either one of these jobs I had was great. But I learned alot of information on these jobs to help me further in life.
good,People were great!  Company communication was not so great.
good,Territory for my area is about 100 square miles. Parts availability sometimes requires driving between two locations and the store that requires the replacement part and driving approximately 3 hours. Long hours are required depending upon the situation and the location of the call. There are times that a technician can get trapped at a store trying to fix numerous issues. Okay position for someone who has a spouse or a very understanding significant other who is okay with changing pace and working conditions. Schedule may frequently change depending on co-workers availability. Work - life balance very skewed unless you are very on top of your game and make plans early and inform management of these changes.
good,"the job is mentally challenging, co-workers are great to work with"
good,Really enjoyed working for this company . Real easy going .Co workers were very friendly .
good,Life at NCR moved very fast. Daily status meetings where managers measured your performance.
good,Great work environment! It's very easy to become attached to co-workers.
good,"NCR is a ok place to work"
good,"Over all day to day work was very challenging due to customer last minute demands and short inventory."
good,There are chances to move up in the company.  The long hours can compromise quality of life.  Co-workers are  great when it comes to helping one another satisfy business and customer needs.
good,"I used to be in field by 9.00 am and back home around 8 to 9 pm moving in the field doing maintenance of atm."
good,Very structured company that continually replaces employees and frequently changes business model
good,"Make and receive calls, troubleshoot, dispatch, Remote access, ensure issue resolution,"
good,I formed great relationships with the people worked with. The work was very interesting.
good,"Could be very busy but very satisfying, coworkers were very helpful"
good,"Se trabajo en equipo involucrando todas las areas"
good,"Long work hours, no work/ life balance at all. Burn out happens very quickly. Benefits are ok, 401k match is decent"
good,Its 24/7 hardcore and challenging job. Always satisfy the customer by giving 100% outputs within the time periods and quality works.
good,A typical day was usually very busy with service calls and being on the road 75% of the time in Broward County. I learned how to work with many co-workers with different personalities and to be a good team player. The hardest part of the job was the challenge of meeting on time site arrival to make the contractual Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The company put a great deal of importance on customer service and big emphasis on reducing return visits. The most enjoyable part of the job was being at different sites throughout the work shift and interacting with bank personnel.
good,"was a great place to work I "
good,"Confidential.  I am committed to an NDA. I had a very successful, long career at NCR."
good,"Truly have enjoyed my job with NCR and have learned a lot in the year I have been employed here."
good,NCR has the greatest associates that work as a team which is the main structutre and success that made NCR successful.
good,"NCR was a high pressure role, working to tight deadlines needing an eye for detail. Starting a family meant I left the company"
good,"I learned how to create, develop and present reports from start to finish. mitigating and understanding the benefits of the analysis ."
good,"NCR is a middle of the group company; nothing ""world class"" about them but they're also not the Keystone Cops.  The best advantage of a company this size is that they can afford to take chances."
good,Worked in team group to acomplish strategic goals of the organization. NCR provided excellent communication and training for their employees.
good,A typical work day involved helping feild technicians service bank ATMs and help bank associate with techinical issues with ATM locks by troubleshooting over the phone.
good,This position required me to be on my toes. There were a number of tasks to perform daily. A good general accounts payble learning experience.
good,"Lot of travel required, but a great bunch of coworkers. Great opportunity to provide solutions to a variety of software and hardware issues in the retail environment."
good,"Most people are hired on through a temp agency which they just recently increased the starting salary to $11 an hour but for the type of work that's being done, I feel like their employees should be compensated more. If you are hired on as a permanent employee which takes about 9 months to a year no pay increase but "
good,"Overall a great learning experience I learn more about software and Programming"
good,Es una compañía procedimental que se apalanca corporativamente.
good,"good company ,good benefits , however the salary is not going to the reality , "
good,NCR is a dynamic and changing environment that is constantly buying companies and struggling to fully integrate so that the customer sees NCR as one company devoted to their success.  A completely new leadership team is working to take the company in this direction and it is truly fertile ground.  There are still a lot of silos in NCR and your work experience is highly dependent on the team you join and the disposition of your manager.  You'll observe all types of managers here - good and bad.  The company doesn't seem to be very good about differentiating between the two.
good,Job was ok.   Were finally told to relocate to South Carlolina or loose your job in a cost cutting move.  Choose not to move so my career there was only 4 years
good,I have been an employee now for over 12 years. NCR is a great place to work. One of the recent changes that can be noticed of of I-85 is the new North and South campuses in the heart of Midtown.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was being in the new corporate HQ's in Atlanta.  Company has a lot of initiatives and does not have a ""nimble"" mindset or process in order for them to excel vs. competitors"
good,"no life balance, you have to work overtime, "
good,"Job satisfaction depends on your manager.  I happen to have a great manager and team.  Only problem is that the new CEO is changing the culture of the company - and not necessarily for the better.  Once we moved to the new building in midtown, we had great flexibility and working options.  The new CEO changed all that and is now requiring that we come into the office everyday of the week.  Not good.  The work-life balance is what kept me at NCR.  Now, there is really not a need to stay."
good,The local Bentonville team is one of the best I've worked with.  They are dedicated to getting the job done and have a singular focus on customer satisfaction.
good,built a channel structure that leverage the sales and make better  sales coverage and reduce the cost of sales.. lack of attention to customer issues.
good,Essendo una multinazionale americana vi è poco spazio per l'autonomia professionale dei singoli.
good,"Not alot of OT"
good,as a ce2 I was working for this company for almost over four years. the work culture was fine but the management and leadership is a whole different ball game. upper management keeps changing policy almost every time they get sued by an ex ncr employee and to top things off they like to give you empty promises. they will demand more work than the pay will compensate in the industry to start. it a shame because this company wouldn't stand behind their middle management and help the company grow but instead they push out good techs in favor for less skilled and more compliant workers.
good,"Very busy with many clents calling in from RBC.."
good,"Great perks and benefits, but feedback is low and confusing.  Very flexible work environment.  Met a lot of great people.  Move to midtown Atlanta will force a lot of people to find new jobs."
good,"the hardest part of the job is management of workplace culture."
good,NCR allows advancement opportunities to everyone.  It is a very competitive company globally.    I have seen several contract employees go from temp to permanent into leadership roles.
good,"Opportunties for technical grow stalled in the early 2000's when the IT organization outsourced work to India.   In 2006-2008, many veteran employees did not make the move from Dayton to Atlanta either.   The company has been playing catch up to mitigate the impacts of outsourcing and the relocation to Atlanta.   Hiring and retaining talent continues to be a challenge.   The company does empower employees to take action and ""do what it takes"" to get the work done but this can lead to short term gains and unsustainable results."
good,"NCR is really a great place to work. You get to work with smart and hardworking teammates. The only bad thing about it is slow to nothing on career growth, management does not really make a good path to success, you are limited to your current role(you can't move from Engineer to Architect)."
good,"NCR is a pretty good company, but not very innovative and fast in their business processes. For the amount of great technology they have for their customers, they let their warehouse facility in south Georgia drive all decisions that impact customers greatly."
good,The job is stressful and expectations are a little out of whack.  I cannot go into details.  My biggest complaint was the expectation of techs in large metro areas were the same as remote.  Being remote it was difficult to achieve.
good,Excellent organization for incoming college graduates.  Ability to telecommute through the approval of direct manager.  The benefits are standard with subsidies.
good,Szeretek itt dolgozni ...csak kevésnek találom a keresetemet 10   év becsületes munkaviszony után!
good,I've been with NCR for 11 years. One thing that has been consistent from the CEO and executive team is the communication. Company wide emails are sent out a couple times a month on all sorts of topics. There are so many companies where associates have no idea who the executive team is. NCR has fantastic communication all the way down to the field techs.
good,"Great Benefits and flexibility."
good,"If you are a person who like to learn a lots of products, here is a best place to start. Do keep in mind that you need to update your learn every year."
good,Good company to work for.  Downside is the company is large and has become a bit cumbersome to work for.  Many departments are compartmentalized and do not share knowledge.
good,"Minha função na NCR permitiu um aprendizado a cada dia. O ambiente de trabalho era bom, com pessoas bastante receptivas e competentes."
good,"You have no control on your schedule, "
good,"The working environment at NCR is usually a productive but also relaxing atmosphere, but occasionally things can get a little hectic, in order to meet delivery deadlines."
good,it was a great pleasure working for this company. Management was not great there. It was to much racial conflicts going on. But through it all I learned a lot. My co-workers was like family. My hardest part of my job was learning all the computer processes. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I my training was over I was able to run my area by my self.
good,A good place to work. Comfortable place to work. Good Benefits. Team work was essential in my department. Easy to move to different department if you  are doing your job in your current department.
good,Local Employees were great. Worked well with each other to solve problems in a trying job.Local. management did all possible to assist employees
good,"Seule de femme de mon département , j'ai prouvé à mainte reprise que je suis soucieuse du détaille et apprécier de la clientèle . J'étais à l'écoute du client pour satisfaire à leurs exigences. J'ai réussi a intégrer un monde d'homme et de prouvé ma valeur."
good,"Huge management overhead. Not enough real engineers. To many meetings. The benifets are typical. Always giving less than previous year but never fully taking anything away. Again all typical for a large corporation."
good,Working here has been a great learning experience. Great place to start out working and gain knowledge. But the pay is underwhelming and well below market standards in most areas.
good,"While I can say that I am grateful for my time at NCR, I have to say that the many questionable decisions by upper management have supplied a more lukewarm view of the company.  There's a lot of promise in the people that work there and the products offered to consumers but the focus on sales has soured once strong relationships with clients."
good,Must be an individual that is willing and able to work completely independently. Most positions within the organization are remote with most duties performed from a home office with some travel.
good,Great work but too much forced overtime.  Help desk wait way too long.  Slow advancement.  Work alone majority of time.  Learn a lot about retail business.  Best part of job is meeting and satisfying many customers.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"First 15 years company was great received plenty of good training and management had lots of experience handling the work load and was responsive to employees issues. Last couple of years management changed, it was all about quotas instead of pleasing the customer and equipment upkeep."
good,i am facing challenges every day since I encounter different issues and resolving it in a timely manner.
good,"NCR is a leader in the ATM Software/Hardware market and has an awesome set of software applications and tools to maintain and monitor ATM activity worldwide for companies."
good,Ran a computer in a clean room testing microchips. This operation was ran 24 hours a day.
good,Good experience over a long period of time. Innovative company with a lot of good and dedicated people. Going through a lot fo change at present time.
good,"Supervise and manage day to day priorities of 25 to 80 Customer Engineer Technicians. "
good,disassemble and reassemble of Automated Teller Machines. Co-workers are great to work with
good,"Comunicação transparente, ambiente agradável, clara delimitação de responsabilidades, cultura pró-ativa."
good,"Good cooperation amongst team members, a very large selection of training available."
good,Ambiente de trabajo aceptable con posibilidades de promoción y beneficios
good,"Depends on individual's own sense of career progression, if you don't ask you wont get. NCR will always look at acquiring startups and/or other companies to stay relevant to market needs. Less in-house innovation more into integration work."
good,"Growth is minimal and based on experience even though your performance is one of best. "
good,"It 45 hr work in week. I learn Time keeping how to solve problem, Eco friendly company environment "
good,"The working environment is quite good, salary is not that much compare to other companies, thou the new management is quite rookie that they need to micro manage tenured employees who know the work better than them 10x. Team schedule does not allow everyone to get together at the same time since everyone on the team has different rest days."
good,"Good Place to work, work life balance is good. No technical exposure. Most of the projects are still using old technologies. "
good,Very polite and understanding managers. Very respectful crew and management. Very helpful and family oriented.They are a good christian based business.
good,"The company provided an opportunity to work with team players. A typical work day includes running calls, fixing point of sale systems and other IT .."
good,I enjoyed working at NCR.  My manager was awesome.  The job was very stressful at times but I did enjoy the work and learned a lot.  Need to be available 24/7.
good,"Check emails daily, send reports weekly to the IT Head...Set meeting with the members and Top management as well.Review performance management and work summary for the individual."
good,Working at NCR was very fast pace and challenging.  I enjoyed building and setting up programs and meeting daily requirements including different and new units to try out.
good,"NCR corporate is filled with fun, we have annually sports programs also every festival celebration. We have pick up and home drop facilities provided to each employees. also annually we have bonus as well as amazon coupons provided. NCR provides annually  refresher outings."
good,"compnay is good to start..Anyone willing to get experience in various technologies can start from this company, Work Culture is good. Work life balance is excellent"
good,NCR has been trying to go through a metamorphosis over the past decade or so trying to change from a hardware oriented company to a software company.  Longevity with the company is very common.  Lately they have been moving support jobs offshore.
good,"I was glad to be able to work for a respected, large company that was within 15 minutes of my home.  They are the leaders in self-serve checkout / ATMs"
good,Leadership sends mixed  messages. Organization changes every 6 months. They do not give ample time for change management to have appropriate effect.  Poor HR and Accounting procedures.
good,The team is very supportive with each other at the country level. Service is always a challenge though with client demands continue to rise.
good,Overworked employees for the company's own benefit. Mandatory overtime is the worst. When I started the number of completion was lower and time moved on in a years time they increased productivity by 50% or more. Employees had to produce simultaneously. Overworked production facility. This is why NCR is in Nevada where it is cheap!
good,"Job stability was not great, is not a good company to look for in longevity for a career to many abrupt change made at the drop of a hat."
good,"Its a good place to work, learn and grow with average salary."
good,"Opportunity to learn about several devices. How to fix, refurbish and re-manufacture. Team Leader and other team members are fun to work."
good,"Loved this job, going to businesses everyday and talking and taking care of customer's needs really made my day.  I learned all about the atm and technology industry working for NCR.  Management was what you would expect from a qualified professionals but at times, they could be somewhat overbearing.  Typical work days could wind up being anything but with really long hours, long travel days and unsatisfied customers, but at the end of the day, I felt really good about the day I had.  My co workers and I were a team, although we worked individually, we were always there for each other."
good,"It was separate project work, to work on hardly and very care full,and maintains separate in bound out bound details for each and every point."
good,"Highly experienced Leader and Customer Service Professional who specializes in quality service, customer retention, productivity and team management. Well qualified in providing consistent support to technicians, customers, and account holders in a fast-paced environment. Dynamic interpersonal skills consist of overseeing other associates and interacting with all levels of the organization and public. Ability to make decisions independently and quickly with minimal escalation."
good,"Learned to do the multitasking,working in friendly atmosphere"
good,I was in a mobile position that allowed me to manage my time very effectively and I love the fact that I did not have a supervisor hovering around me all the the time
good,Overall the management is great but  there are a few managers that know a lot less then some of the technicians  which I feel is  unacceptable and then there are some that have great knowledge and want to help you succeed in the company.
good,Department I worked in needed some serious management training but wasn’t a bad place to work for. Supervisors were pretty laid back and listened to us. Was easy to get time off when needed and they weren’t strict if you needed to swap shifts with someone.
good,"High paced work environment with collaborative teams. Promote from inside the company. Work/ life balance is fairly good, depending upon your role.Work independently little supervision from above. Performance ratings based on metrics"
good,"When I first went to work there, I worked in the accounting department.  I was involved in calculations/verifications of previously completed spreadsheets (by hand).  Filing, typing reports.  "
good,"There are many of opportunities for a Continuous Improvement Master Black Belt, but be prepared to fully justify your hard dollar project savings; soft savings don't count"
good,Requires lot of time management and constant engagement - 24/7 job.  Great growth opportunity or great place for starting career in management. Always on call
good,"Work for NCR is a very intense experience. The job is very cool, fixing ATMs is not a common thing that everyone do. The only drawback is that most of the times have to work long hours and is based on rotation which means that you will loose a lot of nights, weekends and most of holidays."
good,A lot of work. Dealing with different people and high pressure situations. Good management for the most part. Lots of hardware and software tourbleshooting for the most part.
good,it was a very hard and challging job witch I did a great job but had to pay a lot of detail to your work
good,The company is currently going through a huge transformational phase. The new building is incredible. The new ma managment seem to have an interesting vision but the current operation are very poor. They changed the rules of my job 8 months into it without any formal notice. Very unprofessional!
good,This position was my initial job out of college.  I learned a lot about sales and this was a great place to start.  NCR provides a lot of sales training to new hires.  I left because I needed to earn more than I could make there as a junior sales rep.
good,NCR was one of the great companies to work for.. the work was structured and the targets were reasonable & achievable. From day 1 you know what is expected of you and how to get there. The people form most of the positive culture.
good,"The codebase is somewhat antiquated, and the team is still trying to adopt an AGILE work environment.  Decisions over what to develop seem arbitrary and not planned at all."
good,This taught me the most about order management. I worked flex-time so some days I would work 8 hours while others I might work 6.5. Very strong culture of cooperation among employees. Was VP in charge of elections for Dayton 4A (Asian Club) for 2 years. Handled high dollar accounts.
good,Review available upon request if needed from the staffing agent. My experience working at NCR was a good one. Great team and staff to work for.
good,"its very cool working in NCR"
good,"Responsabilidade local pelos recursos humanos, sendo responsável no dia a dia não só pela aplicação dos programas corporativos de recursos humanos como também pelas atividades relacionadas com a legislação do País. "
good,Thus is very good company having good work culture.Good learning skills as well as new technologies used here.
good,You have plent of work
good,It's a great place to work it was just one or two management that wasn't experienced enough to be there I worked there twice I quit the first time I was working like a slave but never got hired went back and it was worst than the first time I had worked there
good,"Requiere mayor control gerencial en la labor de áreas estrategicas como Finanzas o Base de Datos."
good,"Loved working for the company, they had a rocky management personnel for the first few years. After management changed the job became better and employees were treated much better."
good,ncr lacks training and management. the work would be great if they let you do your job and provided real training. the pay is ok but they expect you to get certified on more and do more without a raise
good,"Training is out-of-date"
good,"Trabalho puxado, na maioria das vezes sem material de trabalho, o funcionário tem que improvisar suas ferramentas para poder  trabalhar a gerencia só aparece quando acontece algum poblema."
good,was promissed one thing when hired and then they did not follow through.
good,worked on next gen product which was a very good product. The team was hard working and always got the job done no matter what management did. Management made decisions without consulting team who actually would do the work and would make commitments for the team. It was difficult to meet all the demands.
good,A nice place to work. A clean place to work. 24 hour shifts. Job was easy. Co-workers was nice to work with.
good,No comments due to the salary was low as for bangalore and the t.a which i should get was the 50 % of my expectations. I will never want to work again with this organisation.
good,"Overall good if they change in behaviour. "
good,"Fast paced..."
good,"I learned C# during my first week, and developed my own project. There was minimal supervising, probably because it was during summer and everyone was on a break."
good,"O ambiente de trabalho é agradável, com colegas sempre dispostos a ajudar uns aos outros. "
good,"uma empresa emtermos de ambiente de trabalho bom, para com os colegas de trabalho, uma cultura americana forte, lugar bom para se aprender sobre o segmento de caixas eletrônicos (ATMS)."
good,There were many expectation but not enough resources.They didn't train you well and always blame you if you messed something up. Managers were no team players.
good,"my co workers were very friendly and hard working people. working in this company was like a second home. very pleasant environment ,secure and safe ."
good,"I worked with NCR (formally known as Radiant Systems) for 7 years.  While it was the best company I have ever worked for and advanced through three departments, my job was unfortunately eliminated and replaced by two people in Serbia."
good,"The compensation was fair, but could have paid more. Management was good at micromanaging but not good with interpersonal relationships between them and employees."
good,"Multinacional con alto grado de libertad en cuanto al ejercicio de actividad pero con limitación en cuanto a la toma de decisiones."
good,"NCR is universally acknowledged as the global leader in financial self-service. This success"
good,"It's been a good experience to work in NCR corporation  , and lot of challenges are taken to work here.I would like to change my work path to enhance my skills and abilities to improve next company."
good,"When I start working for NCR, we where a great team, at that time we provide support for all the country, on all areas, our manager was caring about each one of us, and I gladly remember him and my co-workers."
good,"Start my work day by going to FedEx to pick up my work for the day"
good,"Management is really bad due to so many layoffs."
good,"The people at NCR are great, and the technicians are top notch. However, the work/life balance is atrocious. That is to say, it's mostly all work, and very little life."
good,A typical day would be very busy. Everyone works together to get the job done. I have learned many skills working for this company.
good,Answered calls in regards to customer products and assisted callers with returning the product and making sure their account was credited. Adjusted billing on accounts and issued refunds as needed
good,Middle to upper management needs to be removed. Radiant Systems was a great place to work and then NCR took over. Lots of miscommunication internally and it seems to have gotten worse.
good,"I enjoyed working at NCR, Co-worker are friendly and supportive"
good,"This is a company with a rich American heritage. The company is very focused on quarterly, monthly and weekly order growth. NCR is doing a lot of great things with technology that drives consumer self-service transactions."
good,"uma emprea que ainda tem muito para crescer, mas que no meu ponto de vista ainda é fraca na aquisição de mão de obra."
good,"The NCR Corporation (originally National Cash Register) is American computer hardware, software and Electronics Company that makes self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, automated teller machines, check processing systems, barcode scanners, and business consumables. They also provide IT maintenance support services. NCR had been based in Dayton, Ohio, starting in 1884, but in June 2009 the company sold most of the Dayton properties and moved its headquarters to the Atlanta metropolitan area. Currently the headquarters are in unincorporated Gwinnet County, Georgia, near Duluth and Alpharetta. Future headquarters are planned for the end of 2017 at Technology Square (adjacent to the Georgia Institute of Technology) located in Atlanta."
good,"This is a place where lots of works are being reeled daily. It has so much potential on local employees, but it lacks the chain to properly reach out to the very low staff, hence the reason for many short-changing."
good,Work/Life balance was wonderful until NCR relocated from Duluth to Midtown Atlanta.  The employees were promised one thing and then it all changed after the move to where it was mandatory for everyone to be in the office 5 days a week...no more work from home days.  My commute was 90 minutes and sometimes 2 hours each way...96 miles round trip.  It made no sense for me to spend that much time each day on the road when I worked virtual at least two days a week before we moved.
good,"Mi paso por NCR fue una gran experiencia al conocer un gran equipo humano en muchos países de Latinoamérica y particularmente en Escocia, quienes rápidamente me integraron como parte de su equipo.  Tuve la oportunidad de aprender de nuevas soluciones y de trabajar con diferentes clientes y distribuidores en toda Latinoamérica y también de contribuir con mi experiencia y entrega personal lo cual fue bien valorado. Creo que NCR es una gran empresa que está en un periodo de transición, común a muchas empresas de la industria y que pronto logrará re-formularse como lo ha hecho en sus 134 años de vida y seguirá siendo un líder de la industria."
good,NCR is a good place to work - you will always be at the cutting edge of technology. Be prepared to learn - there is never a dull day. The only bad thing about working at Verifone is the pay is not competitive.
good,"NCR is transforming from a hardware based business to more of a broad based services company.  As such, the culture has changed over the years from what it was.  I wish them well as they continue their transformation."
good,An NCR life means crafting a story where you make a difference in the world; where you get to have daily adventures and experience the most iNCRedible ways of being collaborative and innovative with colleagues across the globe. An NCR life is one full of learning and new challenges. The best part? An NCR life is rewarding and fun!
good,Decent place to work.But no benefits for contractors.Overall i really enjoyed working With NCR .I leaned such a lot of things to be honnest. I was travelling a lot without but i did not received any money back for my gas.
good,"There was a lot of great aspects of this position. Cell phone, laptop. company van etc. As time progressed, the upper management became unstable and a lot changed, I was getting older so that might be the reason for the workforce reduction as about 60 techs were let go and 57 of them were 55."
good,"Productive fun place to work they have foozball."
good,"I loved the job, pay, and benefits, I didn't mind the long hours... 26% pay decrease in 2009 and always the flavor of the day mentality from management. D-"
good,"Answered about 100-200 calls/day from customers daily dealing with customer issues."
good,A normal day would consist of calls socializing and working with coworkers. I learned how to manage multiple clients worth thousands of dollars. I also learned how to manage my work load with being a leader.
good,"Good starting job for first timers however not a lot of progression routes, management tend to have a harsh time with you for the slightest of things."
good,NCR is the one of the leading company in ATM service  service field and it have a good team work  and they are correct  Co ordinance with their employees  and they are good  nature
good,It was a great experience working there. My colleagues were very helpful when I started and were always there to lend a helping hand if needed. You had alot of independence working there.
good,"it was a good experience to work for NCR however i got tired with long hours and working 9 days in row."
good,be prepared for the roller coaster ride. Dynamic fast paced environment with emphasis on growth and experiments to drive user acquisition at all costs
good,"Company is good and good working culture"
good,"This is a service job, so you drive around in a work van all day from site to site basically fix computers and advanced peripheral devices. It's a good company/department to work for if value job security because of the constant demand. You get assets like a company van, work laptop and company phone. As a tech you don't really deal with ""official"" management but the do have micro managers that you report to regularly. Most co-workers are really helpful and want to see you succeed. The hardest part of the job is the long work hours and you have to be on call few times a month.Sometimes you have to work 13 days straight with no day off and 14 hour shifts are common. The schedule gets at least once every week so its really hard to plan anything in you personal life. Good for single people, I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is married or has kids. At the end of it all pay is fairly competitive."
good,"No down time, your on call every other week and late shifts every week. On the good side you are a remote employee with a company car and parts, so you travel everyday in the same territory."
good,"Great company to work for.  At the time, I was working at the warehouse.  Unfortunately management is pretty bad.  My lead was definitely always on top of it, unfortunately the floor manager was someone who was always having a bad day.  There was no such thing as job culture because it was a warehouse."
good,"I had a friendly environment to work. coworkers are supportive."
good,ncr is a great company to work for I enjoy working for them I just wish my pay was better. I'm thankful to have a job but it gets hard some time for me with my husband being sick and not able to work.
good,"Busy work environment."
good,"This company has been here for a long time, they know what they are doing and they will keep doing business as usual."
good,Some days you will have to change what you are doing to take care of something else your boss wants. It is a job yet but overtime will be come mandatory and if you don't pace yourself you will become over worked and tired! So take care of yourself and do the best you can everyday!
good,We should work complete in given target & should be work in team member instead of individual person.
good,This is a very fast paced environment that will keep your skill set sharp.
good,Starting pay was not great but did help me get forklift certified
good,"Good job if you have the right manager to work with.  Many hours were needed, and if you didn't enjoy working with your manager, if became unbearable to work at times."
good,Have a great team I work with that doesnt hesitate to help out when needed.  
good,Work on computer e-ticket kiosks inside airports all across continental United States. Requires lots of traveling through airports and rental car agencies. High volume work load and stress.
good,Came in got overview. Found out where all the techs were and orgainized your calls in order of priority and location. And started taking calls. I took max 160 calls in a day. Average was 70.
good,"I learned to better communicate, listen, and understand what the needs needs were and what we were contractual obligated to do."
good,"Intense, high pressure work environment with inadequate support from management when really needed. Heavy workloads with under-staffed local team."
good,"The company and the job were perfect.  However, due to the change in CEO, the changes were dramatic and no one knew if their job would exist for much longer due to arbitrary top down changes.  So many, like myself left."
good,Enjoy working with the folks at NCR.  They are good folks who promote a friendly work environment while keeping up to date on new technology.  Overall a good place to work.

good,"Most days at NCR involve meetings and interacting with customers. The challenge we often run into is balancing the meeting times with productive times. Our customers often do not enjoy working with us, but see it as a necessity. Organizationally, we have strong leaders, but they can be out of touch with the day-to-day operations."
good,I enjoyed My job at NCR but the department I worked for was downsized and there were not enough jobs in other departments to place everyone. We had managers who showed favoritism to a few select people and a couple of managers who were not qualified to be in their positions
good,My work at NCR was too long ago to make any comments that would be relevant today.  It was a fun place to work and also offered memebership into a world-class country club.
good,"I have learn much being at NCR , I have over come the challenge of production and fast pace. I begin to meet new people and friends and was able too progress a start to build in life."
good,"It’s a great job to get if you are tryna get on your feet . It’s productive fast pasting and you can move up quickly great job to have , the pay is okay and you can live financially."
good,This was my first job in IT.  It was overall a fantastic experience.  We felt like we were accomplishing something.  The people were very positive.  Learned a lot.
good,"We went around the country and installed banking software, teller machine software and ATM machine software. We would do custom installation to meet the customer need."
good,"Ncr is an here at place to work! I actually love my job ! Great hours, incredibly amazing to watch someone build up arms all day!  Itsssss greaaattttt!"
good,"hard working job"
good,A Typical day at N.C.R. is Fun and fast pace work.  I learn how to install locks and alarms on A.T.M. safe.  The management was good.they expect your very best at all time.  The hardest part of job is the long walk to breakroom.  The best part of day is sitting in a nice breakroom for 30 minutes.
good,"Can't say much about this company. So, I would rather not say much  about this company. However, the people worked at are good. Work life balance is fairly good, depending upon your role though."
good,"NCR is a decent place to work as long as you don't have a family. "

good,Worked out of my house. Able to control my area.  Serviced accounts that where over 3 hours away. Had to be available 24/7. Company did supply a car and gas card. Was able to work on NCR products.
good,NCR is over 135 years old and must regularly reinvent itself to stay viable and grow revenue.  NCR is currently in a major transformation phase and the desired goal state is much more SW and service oriented than in prior years
good,this job was one I wish i could have keep I loved my hours and pay but due to the security of the job I was laid off and had to find something else. I wish I was still there.
good,"Working at NCR was very stressful experience while working 12 hours or more at day. with a very demandng manager and company expecting excellent results.  I was sent to Georgia for training. Once I came back I was sent to the field.  there is no support from other coworkers. The only help support you got is by calling a 1800 number. Sometimes you have to wait for long time for them to answer your call "
good,my typical day is to pick up parts and then get to the site where I have to fix things. learning is a daily part of my job especially with the person I work with. The management has changed many time through out the last 12 yrs. My job can be difficult when the person I work with swears at me and acts like a bully. I really like the people in the stores that I have to work around. they are enjoyable and make my days easier
good,"Managers would tend to come and go a lot, you would hate seeing the good ones leave and not have to wait for the bad ones to leave as well at least."
good,"Many benefits, fun culture overall. New management has caused many to have concern with job security even if they are valuable assets. They do however have excellent discounts and opportunities."
good,Pretty good company to work for before they started moving support jobs over seas and damaging some of the great customer relationships we developed over the years.
good,I liked that they paid for your health insurance and there was unlimited sick time. Management was very knowledgeable back advancement was great. I truly enjoyed this company

good,"nice place to work,"
good,"Great work environment, but lack in communication. Some leads show favors to others. Advancement may take 3-12 months depending on lead. Love working in different departments."
good,Upper level supervisors do not listen to the people in the field and only look at the numbers. Some days are significantly slower than others and they attempt to keep you to a quota.
good,"A growing EPC company having expansion plans, Management is enthusiastic and helping but dedicated towards work. company has pan India presence with exports to gulf countries."
good,"It's a good place to work, but you are doing 3-4 peoples jobs and not being compensated.  Co-workers are great and so is the Manager, but upper Management has no clue of the day to day business.  Never really feel secure in the job as they have lay offs every couple of years and they don't have any sense of loyalty for the community."
good,Assisted with design for manufacturability. Transferred products from one country to another with minimal downtime. Products are very competitive within the industry.
good,"Técnico de Campo, voltado no Atendimento de Automação Bancaria e Comercial"
good,"Not full time positions in this field. Although they offer you a full time position, around the holidays, projects get slow therefor others start getting laid off. if you haven't been at the company for a while and someone else on a completely different team is having their team shut down. They will take your position.. Seniority over quality."

good,"You will be busy, You will be expected to be available at all hours of day, night, vacations. Many managers and layers of management."

I also learned the basics like filling, copying and how to help costumers with their concerns about a product."
good,A typical day for me would be testing and  inspecting P.O.S systems.
good,"A typical day at work for NCR is that someday your busy and some days it slow."
good,Route work orders to the nearest technician in a given service area
good,"NCR gave me an opportunity to have a overall knowledge of different aspects of the organization, not confining just to the work concerning  my area. It focussed largely on the overall development of the employee."

good,"Completing 5 work orders on average."
good,whole day working and has to finish work with in very short time.
good,I have been with NCR Corporation for almost a year now and I love my job here and I have i big respect for the company. I have learned a lot of new things which help me grow as an employee. My only concern with the company is that career and growth is impossible to happen as far as my observation is concern.
good,Had a great relationship with my manager and co-workers.  Enjoyed working on new product introductions; working with people from different areas of operations.
good,Fast paced and constant assembly. Heavy production requirements.
good,"Get repair jobs from call office."

good,Lots of travel and you get to meet lots of interesting people.
good,I enjoyed working at NCR. The only reason I left is because the bookkeeping job at Home Depot opened up. I was already working part-time at Home Depot as I was working fulltime when I goy on at Home Depot. I got approved to work at NCR part-time and I did until the company let all the part-timers go. If I had known I would get taken out of bookkeeping two and a half years later I would have stayed at NCR.
good,Good company to work in.
good,Flexible work schedule and nice Peachtree City location. Friendly co-workers and management.
good,I was a outside sales rep. I handled large accounts and cold called smaller accounts. I received a large amount of training in information technologies and sales.
good,Co-workers are outstanding; very hard working. Great to work for a growing & expanding company that values innovation!
good,"As a whole, NCR is a great company. The benefits are wonderful and did not cost as much as I expected. Working in a Help Desk environment is sometimes stressful, but there is trainning in place that makes transitioning into the world of IT Help Desk jobs easier if someone has never worked a job like this before. I like it so far. Co-workers are the same at any job. Some you love, others you like, and there are the select few that you attempt to avoid. Its just the natural order of things. The hardest part of work a Help Desk position is working to calm a frustrated and possibly irrate customer. These situations are always tough, but working in customer service all of my life, this was the toughest and the easiest part of my job all at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping to resolve a problem remotely for our customer. If one of our customers calls and feels as if they haven't been helped or given 100% by a previous Help Desk Agent, it gives me nothing but pleasure to work hard and fix the issue for them. Without customers, a company is nothing. It makes me happy to help a person who might be in a frustrating situation. Helping them fix an issue relieves their stress and lets me know I'm doing my job. That is definitely the best part of my job."
good,I had a hard time at this employer due to not being evalued after three years.
good,good company
good,Was happy to work for a company that has been in business for 135+ years. They have a large list of account from a lot of different industries. You can't go more than 2 days without seeing NCR somewhere.
good,"Empresa tranquila de se trabalhar"
good,"Company was pretty good to work for, everyone was given a chair to work at there position when possible. We would have barbecues in the summer months and the Manager would cook steaks for everyone himself. It was a good place to start my IT career after school"
good,"Former FLM (first line maintenance) tech for about 7 years. The job itself is unlike many others as you are in your vehicle most of the day awaiting workorders or onsite at various locations fixing machines. You have complete freedom when you aren't busy which is a very appealing part of the job. The pay is insulting, however. It's a fine job, but a terrible career choice."
good,"I enjoy my time with NCR for the time I was there. I was let go for some issues with my license that caused this situation to occur, I so fell it is a great company to work for as long as you do what is needed to be done on the field as required and work with your team. I would love to be reconsider for employment at this company if given another chance."
good,"Ez a cég ATM-eket gyárt."
good,"NCR has good work culture, though it is complex to understand for at new comer but it gives immense knowledge while on the job."
good,"NCR was a great first job to have and people that enjoy the corporate field will definitely enjoy this company even more.I learned more about how the corporate world works, what are the pros and cons of the corporate field, and about the company in general. It was a great experience for me, indeed."
good,I came into this internship with no experience in Security. Now I can say I can take an entry level job to develop those skills and start my career in Information Security.
good,"gotten too far away from original roots and looking to get back to basics.  Driving to focus more on both employees and the customer, with the hopes of making this a fun place to work again."
good,NCR is a good company to work for. Their offices on Marylebone Road were very conveniently located and the building very professional looking. It has since closed.
good,I start working April 2016 overall Good company to work for a lot of freedom and less room for advancement you have know people within company to have to higher position
good,"My experience with this company was ok, nothing to brag about. The pay was pretty competitive and the hours were great. I feel like I’m a whole this place could have been a lot more productive and well sufficient of management would have been up to date with all that was going on. I would work for these people again. I have a great name with this company and plan on keeping it that way."
good,Los primeros años.  Muchos beneficios y preocupación por los empleados los cuales se fueron perdiendo y muy impersonal y poca preocupación por los trabajadores
good,It is a very good work experience at NCR Corporation India Pvt Ltd. Productive and challenging though. Team work is the key. Traveling is the integral part of the job.
good,I would start at 5 or 6 AM and distribute parts from the kardex machine to the other factory workers till about 3:30 or 5:00. their would be the occasional Saturday as well and they pay weekly.
good,"It was a nice experience working for NCR Serbia, the reason and only negative aspect of the work was the team itself and the complications that occured with it."
good,"Fast paced, independent working environment. Working mostly from phone no office. Work independently little supervision from above. Performance ratings based on numbers alone."
good,Great Job. Good environment. Management is working its way up towards success and understanding of their workers. End of Quater can be hetic but overall it's a good place to work depending on your supervisor.
good,NCR was a fun place for me to work as I interacted with my peers and others around me. I also had the option of working from home which made it convenient. They tend to send work offshore so there is no job security. It's hard to move up or to different departments.
good,A good place to work as new day comes with its own challenges and you must produce result not excuses; which shows high level of commitment to succeed.
good,"As a field Engineer, we work with so many different clients from one site to another on a daily basic. Troubleshoot known terminal issue ranging from hand scanner, receipt printer, system board and so much more. I work on all day on the field support various clients at different locations."
good,"Good Company but salary structure need to revise drastically as per global standards.Goals are clear and management is very good."
good,Ncr's a good starter job for someone just getting out of school are going to college. Need more advancement for management. Ncr's good starter job for anyone from 18 240 years old. Someone trying to get on their feet just getting into the job market.
good,"NCR feels antiquated culturally, but seems to hire very technical minds. Most people are highly work driven which can lead to a lot of politics, but also a more efficient learning environment for entry level employees. NCR is full of veterans in the tech industry which makes it a gold mine of knowledge and connections, but hinders the opportunity for upward mobility. It's a great company to work for if you're young and need some solid skills under your belt or if you'd just like to settle into a 9-5 role."
good,"NCR is a dynamic global Omni channel leader and provider of hardware and software for the Point Of Sale businesses. "
good,"You never knew from one day to the next when and where your next service call was going to be.  Sometimes the job required long hours well into the middle of the night, 7-days a week."
good,programmed cash registers and built automated machines also wrapped redbox movie dispensers enjoyed the people I worked with had good competition with co workers
good,"A varied day to day , learned to prioritise, management were dynamic and inspirational."
good,"Worked for the company since they acquired it. It was a great learning experience. I would recommend working for this company."
good,"typical day at work = excellent "
good,Overall good working environment until their is an OpInc shortfall.  They will then eliminate roles to make up for the shortfalls.  Management does not always stick up for their employees.  It's every man for himself.
good,"Working with NCR is one of the good experiences in life."
good,"No much room for growth. Work life balance is excellent but company doesn't seem moving in the right direction. Unless you want something for short term, it is not the place to go"
good,"Wonderful place to work"
good,"PS Resources will travel 75% of your time. If you like to travel and work for multiple clients, this company is a great fit. Many technical resources are able to work remote and often travel very little. Compensation is on the higher end. Make sure you ask for what you feel you are worth, you will end up at or close to the mark."
good,"It been always a pressure job for Finance planners. as we get pressure from business to get overall better results as well as from senior management to achieve better numbers and within budgets."
good,Many years ago NCR was the primary cash register company. Now it is changing into a solutions provider company and will continue to make it way out of the hardware service business.
good,"They drive for a great work/life balance. Management team does an acceptable job of communicating divisional goals, but lacks in coaching. Major complaint would be how often they change sales goals and raise/change quotas."
good,Worldwide vendor support experience.  A nice place to work and learn about technology.  Limited benefits and a bonus program if the company/division/group makes the revenue numbers.
good,Importante multinacional con buenos beneficios.Un día típico es pasar en la oficina todo el día y realizar las cargas en las planillas.
good,Work is not done.Management was typical for work. Senior person only need repot not performance. liability was only for lower level not for senior level. lack of coordination
good,"Every work environment has its pros and its cons, and NCR is not different. I listed the pros and cons I have and I plan to continue to advance within this company."
good,"Overall, the experience is pleasant. The work environment is complex but challenging. My compensation does not my match my level of Education."
good,"NCR is a metrics and performance driven company.  While often listed as primarily a manufacturer of ATMs, nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a services oriented tech company that is on the move.  Unfortunately, top talent often finds more financially rewarding positions elsewhere."
good,Experiencing new learning with work and people that you work with. Doing the job that you love and you enjoy. Productive in all aspect to  make your work easier.
good,Its a Good Company to Work with. They are the Market Leaders so the Job is very Challenging and Its Fun working with the people here.
good,"Testar equipamentos, pontuar com a gerencia o trabalho a ser realizado, avaliar uma agencia bancaria e liderar equipe."
good,"Working there is great, I've learned a lot about POS systems and they have great Managers. I have great co workers that I work closely with on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is just understanding the knowledge of computer system but once you got that the job wonderful and exciting."
good,"I enjoyed my time at NCR and had a good manager.  "
good,NCR is a good company . The Management supplies a lot of resources for you to get the job done. It was a contract position so i didn't have all the perks of being a perm employee.
good,"typical day at work was  a 7am to 3 day shift"
good,"Freedom to plan and complete your work in your own way and style,"
good,The company has been very good to me. The only down side is the lack of balance between work and life schedules. It has become increasingly challenging. to justify the time spent at work opposed to time spent with my family
good,"Level 2 help desk agent, that loved his job !! Daily activities included resolving point of sale and automatic teller machines issues at various sites. I had the best manager and supervisor! Great co-workers! Trying to get a internal customers to take a part a device for correct troubleshooting. Getting that same customer who doesn't have confidence. Has never taken anything apart ever, but trust me to guide them and resolve their issue all via phone."
good,Everything except being on call was an overall good experience.  There was extensive driving and the work was challenging.  The people I worked with and the managers here were excellent people.
good,"This was my first job and I had learned a lot working in a office -based environment. Even though things were challenging and hard for me, I had never given up. I enjoy working there but eager to move on to learn different things at different places."
good,"Es una empresa correcta con sus empleados desde la perspectiva legal, pero con un dinamismo muy bajo que impide que la gente crezca profesionalmente. La asignación de jefaturas es un proceso que no valora el mérito de la carrera del asociado en la empresa."
good,I can say it was a good job for me I had a chance to grow as a man and learn alot about of skills with the company. It was a company with alot of ups and downs but for the most part I will do it again if I had the chance.
good,"NCR Corp is a company of innovation. Throughout its history, NCR CORPORATION  has led technologies and implemented new ideas which have improved the connected world and improved our lives. The new HQ in Atlanta, GA is an awesome place to work. There are plenty of amenities onsite from a large food court to a rooftop garden. People appear to work well with each other and respect each other. It was a great company to work for. However, it does matter what team you are on and the management you have that determines the work experience. My team experience was not fun or welcoming, but I enjoyed NCR CORPORATION overall and would enjoy it if I could work there again."
good,"The office is in friendly environment, manager respect all the employee. Allow work from home which is nice one. Lot of fun at work as well and bi-annual outing event."
good,"challenging role(before), very nice management and its bosses, i learned how to work under pressure in a short period of time and learned how to stay calm, hardest part of the job is when doing nothing and most enjoyable part is when there is  party, everyone is welcome"
good,NCR has created a campus like environment for their employees in the heart of Midtown.  Employees have access to a number of amenities onsite to promote health and wellness.
good,"was an good company to work for, gave employees a 500 dollars bonuses every month, that is if you came to work everyday on time. The only bad thing about ncr is that they are closing to move to tennesse"
good,"Great place for fast learning and growth. Management is highly reachable to interns. Work culture is fun. Typical day at work- Meetings/Mails/Consulting deliverables e.g. Business Case, RACI, Scheduling, Brainstorming with cross-functional teams, Planning for next day/week"
good,"Proud to be associated with NCR corp for past 5 years, a company thhat does not shy away from innovation and enables it employees to maintain a healthy work life balance."
good,If NCR reduction in production did not go down i would have still made the best out of it and stayed as a loyal worker. great place to work and make money with some weeks offering extra hours would love to find something like it.
good,"NCR is an ok place to work.  Workplace culture was ok, but time commitment in working extra hours was expected. I learned a lot there. They moved out of Dayton in 2009."
good,The hardest part of the job was the travel out of the area daily.  Lots of driving and being away from your family. I did learn some tremendous skills at their training facility.
good,"pay and raises are to low. the one percent raise we got at the end of the year was a shame. can't keep up with the day to day expenses such as car insurance, food, gas."
good,"Since it was Research and Development, there were always times when a task should be put in this module or that.  That was resolved with a team meeting."
good,"Starting my career with NCR has been great especially working the the vast collection of customers. During my time with the company I have found that advancement can only be achieved by moving the the corporate headquarters in Atlanta, GA, to which I am unwilling to do at this time."
good,I like it wish they would open more full time jobs. can't get anything accomplished by not advancing people to fully time positions and just working contractors.
good,"As a field service Customer Engineer, I would travel to customer location. This could be a retail location like Wal-Mart or Target., or a financial branch for Wells Fargo Bank of America etc. I would perform necessary repairs or order parts if needed then move on to next customer."
good,Working at NCR is a privilege. The last few years management in Reno NCR was excellent. They value your family and the company managers  making it sure that the employees are working as a good team.
good,"its fun and enjoyable,i learned how to use time at work and how to deal with different people around .Its so fun during chritsmas party everyone so happy ."
good,"iNCRedible is what we call it, and it is. The kind of atmosphere has been made here that keeps the colleagues engaged and glued to their position. Keep a goal to work with NCR at least once in the career."
good,"I would have been happy to work there for 40 years... job market did not allow that. Layoff, required me to move on and look for other opportunities.  Ithaca was a fabulous place to work and live."
good,A typical day could start with no work and sorting parts or a drive across the county.  there was no consistency with the work flow.  There were 4 of us to cover from bend to eureka and eugene to klamath falls.
good,"NCR is a great company to work for but depending on who your direct manager is. Micromanaged was what drove me from leaving NCR. I left the company because, as I've mentioned, of micromanaged, and because I was denied for applying for internal career opportunities."
good,NCR has good exposure work wise.You will get a chance to know about different-2 domain and technology. You can work on outside team projects if you have bandwidth.
good,"As a senior faculty member at Vidhyamantra, I taught Economics and Statistics classes ranging from Senior Secondary to Graduation level. The key responsibilities included managing coaching center, working on employment assessment tools and proactive strategies to improve instruction methods. I used to work with average class size of 8-10 students, handling a total of 35 students in all."
good,"Functie prettig en afhankelijk van locatie bij de klant."
good,Great environment.  Everyone works as a team.  Ability to cross train and advance within the company.  Variety of work with each group.  A lot to learn.
good,I have a good working experience with this job.I am learning something new everyday but i want to grow so i am looking for something better for my future.
good,I do not enjoy getting off work early or when we run out of parts. I like the company but sometimes management can be selective in the people they chose to help.
good,"Worked for 30 years. Good company to work for."
good,"too much to learn. A big MNC with huge customer base and presence in almost 200 countries, vast data which will help to dig more into the details."
good,This organisation is having lot of projects and we will get good technical work. This is not a market leader but pays a decent compensation. This company mainly deals with the ATM applications.
good,"Pleasant work environment, great colleagues and managers, work was mostly steady. Only reason for leaving was company moved to GA from OH."
good,"Learned new things Hardware and Networking."
good,"ncr atms  is the best atm in the world , and providing good quality service to customer and supporting, management is very clear , providing security for workers in any ware , hear i am learned more knowledge in technical and management ethics ."
good,"Good place to work with good co-workers, good pay, recognized for work done. Good vacation benefits and health care benefits. Rewarding to see projects achieved."
good,I was intern while doing my high school graduation. I was an intern in customer support (field engineer). It was like training internship where they taught how ATM works. How they repair and replace the faulty hardware of an ATM.
good,"Great job if you had no other life, I run food donation centers in my spare time and always have to appoint a replacement for myself, But overall the job is challenging and demanding."
good,"A typical day working for me was I would get up, start my day with coffee, get my laptop up and running and log into phones, start on the task I was assigned to for the day and then answer the questions that the technicians had and help make this place grow. I learned that at any moment you may not have a job so definitely don't take it for granted and ALWAYS do your very best. The hardest part about this job was the amount of information that you had to cram into your head in such a short amount of time. You eventually understood everything but if you didn't always follow up with what else is coming next then you can easily fall behind and get lost, and that can cost you. The most enjoyable part of this job was the amazing people you got to work with; from your colleagues to the Wal-Mart customers, and the vendors. It really grew me as an individual and made me more experienced in certain skills."
good,"The company is a traditional industry high tech company. It is good place."
good,A typical work day was very much like jumping in the fire as soon as you get started with your day. I was involved with assisting in troubleshooting hardware/software problems with end users in retail stores around the world. I learned what it means to be patient and a good listener of people who are technologically challenged. It was wonderful and humbling experience. My greatest pleasure at work was with all the cool co-workers I interacted with on a daily bases. The hardest part of the job was when you were about to get off the job after working 8 hours and you get the dreaded call at 3min. before quiting time and they have multitude of problems to solve.
good,"I worked in a clean room environment in a  clean room suit (covered from head to feet). that is where I learned to work with others in a team. Nice communication and co-operation with management. my co-workers were great, friendly, helpful committed. The hardest part was working with the dangerous chemicals and gases. Meeting our quotas."
good,A typical day is getting logged in on time and going into ready when in a call center environment. Its a fast paced Customer care environment where resolving custoemr needs is the first priority.
good,"Working in this environment requires a strong level of maturity and patience as there is a variety of ages from millenniums to baby boomers in this company. The health benefits should be better considering this is a company of 26k employees worldwide. There is a big push for community involvement, however unity between departments and locations is allot to be desired."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company . I built a lot of meaningful and professional relationships here.
good,"how to make ATMs , i learned alot from NCR , nice people etc my most enjoy part about NCR how the money come out , and how the machines look from inside."
good,"É uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, salário, beneficio, e equilíbrio entre a vida pessoal com a profissional. Mas você tem muita dificuldade em reconhecimentos. Alta rotatividade em alguns setores e que está a mais tempo e sabe dos processos não possui uma oportunidade de efetivação."
good,"Very hectic but rewarding - managing various tasks while managing up to 20 employees,"
good,"I enjoyed working for NCR. It has taught me how to multitask, work with and talk to people from all over the world. I really enjoyed the flexibility in the schedule if needed."
good,"•	Installed and serviced ATM and POS for major banks and large chain grocery stores."
good,"Full scale high call volume Reactive vendor support company. Services ownership from cradle to grave, upgrade projects, escalations, and vendor requested side jobs. HR attempts to manage the team managers within the call centers from offsite when there is an issue with one of their subordinates limiting the effectiveness of the manager and facility. No management training offered prior to promotions within. Online classes are offered through NCR University, but no College Credit given. Low morale due to false promises and designated favorites ""clicks"" within some management and subordinates causing lack of trust and team effectiveness. Not all co-managers can be trusted as they should be when working together as a team. It doesn't take long to discover who can be trusted and who can't. The biggest challenge is when contracts are drawn up with their vendors, the people making the decisions and agreements have no idea what it's like to take a call, support a technician, trouble shoot with the end user, service a store. It seems that none of these are taken in account as to what the helpdesk is really capable of supporting. It's all about how much money can we make in a short period of time. This causes missed SLA's and penalties and the company ends up losing money because the wrong decisions were made when the contract was written which causes ALL teams to fail and too lowers morale. The most satisfaction is helping subordinates reach their goals and witnessing their promotions."
good,A typically day at WGS started off coming to work prepared to support to give direct support to all the Wal-Mart's and Sam's Clubs nationwide. I often  won  awards for great customer service but no certification was needed because at all jobs top performance is required on a daily basis. I learned no matter how small any given situation might see to the customer it's always deserves prompt attention to resolving any issue in a timely fashion. The hardest part of the job was having to past a job over to a coworker because my shift had ended and there was no overtime allowed. I was told I had to leave at that time no exceptions.  It made me feel incomplete because when I start something I make sure every detail is complete. The most enjoyable moments were making sure that the customer at the other end of that phone was always satisfied no exceptions.
good,Assisting global and international customers with hardware service support. A fun filled fast paced environment.
good,"Learned how to work on multiple things, compensation is good."
good,"Learned design, build and debug techniques for FPGA & CPU board designs,"
good,"Working in a good domains and with good colleagues."
good,"NCR can be a great company to work for, with all the flexibility, advancement, and growth you desire. Or, it can be a nightmare, which you seem to never get away from."
good,making up your own weekly schedule
good,Excellent Place to work with also great working environment its dream company to work
good,"In my 14years at NCR I found it very rewarding , made lots of good friends over the yesrs and NCR treated you with respect."
good,"It was a great working place with great view over the city of Atlanta and a nice gym. They have flexible working area. You can choose to sit at a desk, which has two adjustable monitors and electrically driven stand-up table, or work in various couches."
good,"good benefits, limited supervision, lots of travel, shift work (until midnight), weekend and holiday work. minimal training on new products after first year of training. pay was reasonable."
good,"I like Job! Not the management either the pay!"
good,I have learnt advanced technology over here and very good working culture in NCR. You can maintain work balance life  as WFH culture in NCR. Management also very helpful to learn the new technologies by providing trainings to employees.
good,"better scope of work"
good,"With its global leadership in the industry, NCR has most of the major accounts in the region. This provides ample opportunities and exposure to big organizations"
good,A very hands on organization. You get to learn alot doing things. Work culture is very enjoyable and fun filled. A very friendly and understanding management team who are always ready to assist you. With a very good team and management I have not found anything to very hard. we all are part of a very family and we interact with each other more like friends than colleagues. we all are always ready to help each other.
good,"Excellent job if you're single. If you have a family especially small children expect to be away from them. This is due to the mandatory overtime. A extra four hours added onto your 8 hour shift for a period of two weeks every month."
good,Not a bad company to work for. Only downfall right now is that Pay is a little on the low site for a top 500 company. benefits are great vacation is great. I work alot and where i work 2 people cant be off at the same time. But i think that is just my location. People i work with are amazing one of the best perks.
good,My company working us a production of Automatic Teller Machine . its achieved to get the first place in all over India.its nice place to work .but I can't work in chennai . my ambition and my dream is working in Trichy .I have more much interested to work in Trichy.so I consider my hometown.
good,It is indeed an splendid organization to work with. It give you enough exposure and challenge you daily to provide insights & value add.to benfit the organization and self improvement.
good,"Job was very productive. Leaders were very educated and knew their job well. So with that being said, I caught on very easy. I did not have to ask any questions because they explained everything thoroughly.."
good,"As long as you follow the company guidelines you will enjoy working here. Managenment lets you be your own boss, minimal pressure , proper training is given and senior technicians are always willing to help"
good,"Multinacional, con claras políticas de integridad en los negocios, buenos beneficios para los empleados, respeto por las personas"
good,Good people in the trenches. Upper management is beurocratic and distant. Great PTO and 401k benefits. Management is based on relationships and seniority.
good,"Typical shift started with CE stopping at local designated FEDEX to pickup/drop off service parts.  Meet with fellow CE's to discuss assigned service calls and possible repair actions.  Soon after, CE's dispatched themselves to their assigned service calls until finished."
good,"You can work from home and the environment makes the job. There are restaurants and an outdoor area for those who like to work outside. "
good,"Enjoyable place to work, pay isn't the best in the market but good work/ life balance. Employees are valued & engaged. The job itself was interesting where no two days were the same"
good,"The people were cool and my manage was great!! Great work life balance. We worked from home 3 days a week. The culture is very laid back, no micro managing."
good,"One person ran the machine which had a large roll of reciept paper on it and it'd go through and cut up into smaller different size rolls. The rolls came down the conveyor to me on a wide table and i'd pick them up 5 at a time and place them in the box. When its full i tape it, stack it, and count them."
good,Company offers Innovative environment to growth and is a great place to work. Company expresses progressive involvement opportunities that supports over all professionalism and market leadership.
good,"you feel home, surrounded by family."
good,"My work experience has been nothing but useful, not long after i have started working here I was included im management projects. They value hard work, dedecation and team spirit."
good,Lots of training opportunities. There maybe several nights per week of after hours on call. Will acquire a lot of experience and knowledge of electro-mechanical equipment.
good,A typical day of work is so structured. Meetings in the morning. daily work throughout the day. I learned how to ship and everything that goes with shipping products. Management was always on top of things. Workplace culture was normal. There was no hard part on the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the safety meetings. They were always informative.
good,"NCR is a nice place to work with and it`s not really a hard job I can easily learned my task.I`ve learned a new kind of job here and the people I work with are friendly, the manager is good. I`m just enjoying  my work everyday and the experience I had here helps me to grow and can find another job easily."
good,"I enjoy working at NCR, though we are at times understaffed or under resourced, teams work together to make the best of it and the Comms team really supports each other."
good,NCR provided me with great skill sets. They helped me grow as a BSA and taught a lot about how to manage work on a day to day and long term scale. Overall a great company.
good,"I loved getting to go to all the places I had to fix things at. They made sure you were trained, worked with you, provided you with transportation, and there was 24/7 support when you needed it."
good,"I work with an amazing team and pretty much manage myself.  It's a great place to learn and grow, I just wish they were a little better at showing their appreciation in the way of salary and bonuses."
good,"A typical day at work is checking in through security which I enjoy because it makes me feel safe. Clock in and find workstation/work area, and it is pretty clear on a day to day basis what needs to be done.  I learned everything from production to systematic support of NCR production.  Workplace is friendly. Hardest part of the job is the occasional overtime at the end of the quarter."
good,"As NCR completes it's transition from a hardware and services company to a software and solutions company in the next couple of years, things will be vastly improved."
good,"as pessoas com quem estive ligado no período, foram ótimas e me auxiliaram e todos os aspectos."
good,"A typical day was 20-30 calls a day. Talking on the phone to customers all over the United States and London. I learned about the a great software Aloha. Management was not the best because it was always changing and the processes and procedures often changed with the management. The workplace culture was the ""Good Ole Boy"" system and you either got on board or off."
good,Good for learners. Provide free food and good work place for employees. It's well developed with strong generation over 130 years. Job security and management is  good.
good,A financially sound company that did not change aggressively enough to stay relavent in the computer software product arena. I think the company recognized that they weren't able or willing to spend the money necessary to define and build leading edge products in the computer software market place.
good,"Aprendí la cultura norteamericana de trabajo,cada día era diferente, en contacto con clientes, interactuando con los sistemas, reportando resultados a la vertical de negocios."
good,"Good place to work, depends on your team and process. Approachable management, everyone have a good work life balance in the company. Limited growth opportunities."
good,"A typical day mostly involves working through design issues with NPI products, and troubleshooting build issues on the plant floor for products already introduced. A lot of the times, emergencies on the floor are prioritized and quick fixes are required, while permanent solutions are not."
good,"The management and team I work on has been great. Honestly, one of the best places I've worked. ONLY complaint is it takes an act of Congress to get hired on as a NCR employee. They prefer to keep you as a contracted employee so they don't ever have to provide benefits."
good,"US Driven."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, aprendi a desarrollarme como tecnico,"
good,"NCR provides good platform to learn new technologies and the workplace culture is very good. "
good,"Fun company, they sent me to school to learn their systems and networking.  Company vehicle with a good team to learn from.  Lots of systems to learn from Point of sale to Automated teller machines."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. If you are an innovator, there is a patenting system which is good and gives good incentives. Some teams the work is very monotonous and dynamic in others."
good,"really good company to work for, great benefits a,nd a good working environment, 9 years well spent, unfortunately made redundant, management scored low basically because of my last manager's lack of engagement. otherwise it would  e 4's across the board"
good,"Prioritize services call  while managing SLA."
good,"Good plae to learn"
good,Nice to work with Global Company and lot of things to learn and process oriented organization. Peaceful working place & good team/co-workers
good,Overall a good company to work for.  At times management micro-manages each of us.  Some employees are allowed to work remote which is a plus for many.
good,"É uma Boa empresa  que da suporte ao conhecimento e a evolução profissional."
good,Empresa agradavel de trabalhar que valoriza o funcionario e investe em sua qualificacao
good,NCR is a good place to work.  Nice co-workers.  A typical day is filled with managing the product for high quality delivery to customers.
good,"I had hoped this would be my 'forever' company where I retired.  As in most large corporations, there are yearly and sometime bi-yearly reductions in force (RIF).  I made it through more than 10 in my career with NCR until February of this year.  My manager had a tough decision to make within a department where everyone had many years of service.    I still respect the company and their decisions.  NCR has been able to maintain a strong presence in the marketplace by making hard decisions that make it a growing and solvent company."
good,"Normally, a good workday with new challenging tasks from various clients. Learned lot of management skills. Most co-workers were fine. Enjoyed working at NCR."
good,"I was very impressed with how they invest on employee training. The pay is competitive and there's always room for job advancement. At management level I think the company tries to take more responsibility and customer accounts without taking into consideration work load to service employee ratio. The would want to make the service tech work over their regular shift hours not caring if they had personal obligations and if you would turn down to keep working you would be looked down upon. They have a mayor problem with field tech staffing leaving some territories understaffed obligating techs to work longer hours, 6 day shifts and 7 day shifts every other week when tech is on availability. In person staff meetings are rare and there's absolutely no team work at field level. Job security is good as long as you don't disagree or swim against the current. Management is always pro company disregarding any personal opinion by field techs."
good,Great place to work. Can be a bit challenging working for physicians as they can be less business minded. Provided great work life balance.
good,"Average salary for the techs here is $12/hr. If you're a contractor, there are no benefits and no guarantee of being hired on. Constant worry about entire building being closed from day to day. In short, the job is great if you need experience in the IT field, but the people you work with suck."
good,Its a job with different ways to advance. a lot of older people who are real comfortable with there jobs and all they say it has always been like this. Need to get use of change.
good,With respect to learning the company is great as you get exposure to so many different technologies at the same time. But due to lack of management sometimes productivity is affected.
good,"An accomplished Developer with 4 years 7 months of IT experience encompassing wide range of skill set and roles, currently working with NCR Corporation."
good,"Was selected to be the part of Focus Group which catered Potential Long Term Prospective Business Clients for NCR, Hence Focus Group being the Specific Customer Driven Account need to ensure that all the Work Orders Logged in UK for Engineer visits & fix gets within the SLA hence micro monitoring of each and every work order is required, with the Account Support of Respective Customers."
good,"precisaria de mais oportunidade, colegas de trabalhos legais, e coordenadores e gerentes muito humano"
good,An organisation where the employees are respected within the team and even the customers do share very high gratitude towards the NCR employees.
good,"A typical day at work is sometimes busy and at a steady fast past.  The reason is because we/Logistics are ordering parts all day for different customers and per fedex website, we have to locate many locations and ESL's to ship parts."
good,"NCR is a productive work place to develop your professional career in terms of education, salary and health wise."
good,Technician repairing electronic equipment.  Working the field to provide customer support.
good,"Management is OK."
good,NCR is very good platform to start the career. As a corporate ( MNC ) ncr is giving good opportunities to freshers to build thier career. NCR
good,I learned how to deal with customer.Hard working like need to be attend calls at mid night.It deals with ATM's troubleshooting.

good,"Worked at the local plant for half a year before the company announced its closure. The closing date kept getting extended because they were still trying to take orders from clients and set up a facility in Tennessee, which was prolonged because of disagreements with partner company CEVA. Eventually, NCR took full control of that facility. SVT was brought in a year prior to closing and asked to create a plan for getting the inventory out of the building. NCR then shot down SVT's plan and decided they were going to handle it their way. Nothing was done pre-emptively; no inventory was moved prior to closure in March 2019, more than a year after closure was announced. At this point, I was hired on with SVT. It then took 4 months for SVT to clear out the building, going more than a month over NCR's suggested date. There were numerous issues with the inventory and only one person with NCR was left in the building to handle all financial and operational needs after all others quit or moved to Tennessee. Throughout this process, staff members from off-site locations  were still trying to get inventory from specific locators within the facility when they no longer existed (as all inventory had been consolidated to one location and we were trying to get it moved out). They all knew the place was being cleaned out, but all they saw was what was ""in the system"" and tried to take whatever they needed when it would have been simpler to order from elsewhere."

The most enjoyable part of the job, had to be when I realized that I was a very good data entry operator."

good,This was a very interesting job. It was night shift and I staged kiosks for video machines. I gained forklift experience and learned packing of kiosks to ensure safe delivery.
good,"Traveling around the Phoenix area is a plus. Learning the roadways and different areas was a nice way to learn my way around. Working outside was a plus, except in the heat of summer. But by planning accordingly with plenty of water, it wasn't too bad. Being able to work at my own pace was enjoyable."

good,a very fast paced job I enjoy being busy and learning different things.  the pay is decent but you don't get a raise like you deserve it. most supervisors get their position by moving up in the company and they forget that they were once a team member and get the big head and treat you unfairly at times.

NCR does what it can to continue to foster that relationship that I enjoyed so much before the acquisition.  I am exited to come to work each day because each day there is a challenge and there is always an opportunity to volunteer and serve outside of my work environment.  I am also very excited about the new headquarters coming up in mid-town Atlanta.  The amount of detail that the organization is placing in this new building project really shows how much they care about their employees."

good,Although I worked for them through a contractor they seemed to be a very good company to work for. And it was work I enjoyed doing. I just wish they had more contracts or a full time position. I will keep trying because I found it to be very interesting and it was a good match for my computer skills.

The co-workers are really nice we treat one another like family and are really helpful when situations occur. The hardest part for this place would be when we ran out of part and we have to wait which slows the work down. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I'm doing what I enjoy doing and get to use the skills I learned in school.

However, for the most part working at NCR was educational and did provide me with the opportunity to get more involved with networking and information security.  NCR wants you to keep your skills up to par and provides an extensive array of certification and corporate education through NCR University (NCRU).

They were hard working, always helpful, and they would see a job through to the end, no matter how long they had to stay passed their shift-ending time. The hardest part of the job was, pushing and pulling carts with computers on they, that could weight up to 400 lbs. The most enjoyable part was, if you had family emergencies, NCR would allow you off work to take care of your family without holding it against you. NCR is a family orientated company."

In this company, I am always learning something new, and becoming more proficient at troubleshooting anything I come in contact with. This company, and the experience that it provides me on a daily basis has given me the confidence to troubleshoot things that I have never even seen before with accuracy. This is a fast paced career, with a teamwork we provide service to more retail and financial institutions than any other company in the United States. The hardest part of this job is the amount of time that you spend at work on a regular basis, although it pays off through time as you build a name for yourself in the company.

good,I've loved working at NCR. The sky is the limit for someone with ambition here. While the company has taken some missteps along the way I believe it is headed in a good place and will continue to do so with the current leadership.

This was my first job where I was actively working on the registers and head end computers by using a program that allowed me to look at everything that was on their head end and monitors.  I worked in hospitality and I really did love the job.  I can only remember a handful of calls where people were rude but it was much more bearable than working a call center.  All in all I would recommend this place to anyone.  My contract ended in August of 2014 kind of out of no where.  I had been sick a lot during the time I was working there and one day they said I'd missed too many days during training (I missed one) and they had to let me go.  The contractor was shocked because they had never heard anything bad about me from the company, so I turned in my badge and moved on.  I wish I could go back sometimes though."

The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was able to make the customer happy and let them know that their part would be there within 4 hours."

good,"Working for NCR requires using a lot of different applications and softwares. Good thing about it - there is training for every single one of them. Management team is always ready to help, share experience and knowledge. Every single day is opportunity to learn something new. Hardest part of the job was adopting and adjusting to certain situation which would be created by unexpected event. Fixing the new existing problem could be stressful because in some situations coordinator cannot control situation. It is the nature of the job but again experienced management team is always there to gice advise and recommend solution."

good,"A 104 year old company before it was dissolved had actually become  perfect.  No whistles, no bells, no time clock.  You signed in and out.  The disciplinary system was unbelievable.  If you had children and flu season hit, you would have lost your job before the change.  The change was....If you receive 4 incidents you would get a verbal warning; 4 more was a written warning; 4 more was a 3 day suspension; and then you would get fired.  But! It took 12 occurrences of leaving early or coming in late before you received a quarter of an incident.  So, that comes out 48 occurrences for a whole incident; so, 192 occurrences would get you a verbal warning. Flat tires, doctors appointment, pick up a relative at the airport, sick kids, teacher conferences, pageants, recitals, scouts, over sleeping; yes, life balance was covered. We would meet for breakfast in the cafeteria an hour before our shift started, and you would find the plant manager there having breakfast with the managers.  We could plan our day before we went to work.  It was stress free. Personnel and Eng. had desks on the manufacturing floor.  Problems were addressed immediately. Laughing aloud was allowed. People smiled. Gone but not forgotten. The good ole bad ole days weren't bad at all. We even had one employ in her 80's."
