bad,"This company is not a diverse company in fact I was the only African-American that work in that office and as I worked for that company for a year and a I realized that going to all of their offices I was still the only African-American there were no other African Americans except for one doctor. And oftentimes I was made to feel very uncomfortable very excluded and my manager did nothing "
bad,Micromanaged to the point of not getting your work done. Too much favoritism in the department. Can’t move up without a degree regardless of experience.
bad,"Lot of work, great opportunity to learn the basics from the ground up.  Busy with a lot of work for several different roles that make it unrealistic to succeed"
bad,CHS is not a place I would recommend to anyone. Leadership is substandard and they completely lack respect for their employees. Layoffs have been the norm for several years now. Job security is anything but secure.
bad,This place is awful. Management is ridiculous and childish. They have no backbone and they are bullies! The pay is a joke. Stay away unless you are desperate!!!
bad,Could be good place if it was not for the clicks and boy old boys!! Needs to be clean up management! IT department needs clean sweep! A few other areas should also be considered for cleaning out but if all of the managers to CEO were replaced that would be a great start.
bad,I love My job and taking care of patients but in enterprise al I’m one of the oldest employees the hospital had for techs and I get Paid the least. 10.00/hr. That’s not even enough to buy food and pay my rent. I get Ran over all the time  and watch all these young girls with no experience and less empathy make easily 12-13 maybe more an hour than I do. I’m working almost 5-7 days a week to even maybe make ends meet. I tell My managers and CEO and I’m laughed at. It’s awful.... the longer you stay the less they care about you.
bad,Poor training and management. No room for advancement. Raises are virtually nonexsistant and poor when you do get one. Company culture is awful and petty. Company is unstable. Company provides sick time but you are penalized for using it. Don't waste your time or energy.
bad,"Full of spoiled, privileged doctors who treat employees badly, and administrators who usually never last more than a year or two.  Chronically short-staffed, with unsustainable demands made of all employees."
bad,if you like to be micro managed and constantly reviewed for a dull job then this is the place to be. they constantly have turn over and lose their best people because they do not care about anything but numbers and the best way to make the most money off  paying as little as possible.
bad,"They do not value their employee's co-workers were rude, the demand was unrealistic in the time frame allotted. The pay was grossly below cost of living."
bad,"We were informed Physicians Practice Support office in Sarasota Florida is closing September 28, 2018 moving it to the home office in Tennessee. Severance packages are offered however Shared Services in Sarasota, part of CHS,  is creating jobs, hiring everyone that interviews and pay the same hourly wage for over 30 people?  I believe this is to pull employees away from receiving their severence packages then lay them off. Why would they close the office, rehire at another location at the same hourly wage?  Do the math."
bad,"Company downsizing and lack of communication from upper level has brought the morale to a minimum.  While eliminating employees, then giving you their duties, you are being told ""be thankful you have a job""."
bad,"I would like to think, a very long time ago, CHS was actually a good place to work. Unfortunately, over the past 10 years it continues to go down the drain. The turnover is astronomical. It's CHS. My manager actually blocked me from any potential growth. I had other managers in other departments where I had applied come and tell me my manager was not letting me move. I'm not sure I would ever recommend anyone working there."
bad,Only go here when all other options have been exhausted.  Work life balance does not exist.  Management is detached from realities of the job.  NEVER trust their word on bonuses as they will not honor them.
bad,"I would never suggest to anyone to work there. I would only work there if I did not have a job and needed money immediately and no other options!"
bad,"I worked in ICU & CCCU with 3 different managers within 7 months, people were hired that had no telemetry experience to watch telemetry monitors, & there were also no set nursing guidelines for the Critical Care Departments. Benefits were very expensive, especially when the pay was only $12.00/hr with 14 years experience in Weatherford/ Granbury, Texas. The staff were nice & did the best they could with no real direction or leadership."
bad,"This company is terrible. They have low pay, the worst managers, no organization, or process. The only good thing is that you can weare jeans in the corporate offices. Please run away as fast as you can."
bad,If your looking to work at a place that makes you feel like your stuck in a class with a horrible teacher then this is the right place for you! Good luck!
bad,"I worked for Lutheran Health Systems will we got bought out by Community Health Systems.  I was able to grandfather my hours and pay at CHS.  I did not receive PTO or timeoff with pay while working for Lutheran only as a continuous PRN.  We have had 3 managers in 9 months starting in January 2016.  Two of them were let go and now we have had a new one since October 2016.  The hardest part of my job is the mircomanagement of the current manager.  We are asked to let her know if we have issues, but when you do, she treats you your bothering her and taking time away from her job.  She has sent me nasty e-mails on my performance however, she never worked with the systems as I have for the past 14 years.  Her education or lack of education is a joke.  There is nothing positive or enjoyable about my job anymore.  There must be a better management team and coding team out there who will accept my valuable skills."
bad,Most of the employees were uneducated and had absolutely no computer skills whatsoever. Not professional!  Data managers with no clue how to use something as basic as excel or outlook.
bad,Home of the stuffed shirt. This is the stuffiest company  have ever worked for. i would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. If you enjoy a dry atmosphere with the haves and have nots. Please feel free to work for them.
bad,departments are run by managers that do not know what they are doing.  they are incapable of running their department much less being in charge of another one.  they let competent people go and let people who know nothiig and are not qualified run the place and then want to know what is the problem.  they are the problem.  the CNO needs to go before she runs off every capable nurse within 100 miles.
bad,"Upper management is very unorganized, insufficient training and horrible communication. There is not enough opportunity for flexible scheduling and or work from home opportunities."
bad,"Great pay would benefit from raising salaries and listening to the facilities that work to maintain their cash flow.  Directors are overpaid.  However, facilities suffer."
bad,"very poor, political from management to Admin. very bad culture, very few true professionl people. "
bad,"Floor nurses constantly work short staffed, without managers taking into account the acuity of patients. Multiple floors closed due to lack of staff from house keeping to nursing. Managers cannot or refuse to help staff members with patient care."
bad,Not a good fit for me. Hours are not flexible. Management is not good. Training is horrible. Could do a lot better when it comes to training new employees.
bad,"Just not a good place to work. There is constant turn over and anti-support ethic."
bad,This company doesn't care about it's employees or resident's.  They work with a skeleton crew which creates safety issues for the residents in it's facility.
bad,"CHS is a wonderful place to work, learn, grow and advanced in the health care arena."
bad,"Through my interactions with other departments, my experience, the management was unfriendly environment that did not demonstrate a culture willing to learn or embrace new processes or innovation with very few exceptions."
bad,"CHS cares nothing about its employees. It was repeated many times that anyone can be replaced. The management uses fear tactics and bulldogs the employees with random layoffs. Basically, if you have an opinion, keep it to yourself or you will be fired. The company only cares about facts and figures on paper, not the people that work there. The only happy and satisfied employees would be those in leadership positions. Stay away from CHS. Go where you will be appreciated!"
bad,It depends on the department but Supply Chain support in to political and management does not help or develop there talent. Managers are in serious need of leadership training.
bad,"Company stock has fallen due to gross mismanagement. Company operates like it's still the 1980s. You have to wear a tie to work, no working remotely/telecommuting and the most dysfunctional management and operations that I have ever seen."
bad,"The managers were more interested in reports that were not missing punctuation than actual content or work being done. They tried to make square blocks fit in round holes. They missed the big picture on bringing HMA hospitals on board. They also used a worthless PM tool called ""Daptiv"". It was completely unreal in milestones, dates, work accomplished and schedules"
bad,"Unorganized, no true leadership direction, not a place for growth and opportunity. I would not recommend this place to save my life. "
bad,Need more integrity and diversity within management. Doing a higher position I wasn’t hired to do with no compensation and being told A higher raise and offered cents to do way more work
bad,"I was very happy to join Community team until working 2 months in to it. Horrible management,  company is very disorganized. Management is out for themselves,  and literally dismisses anyone with differing opinions. Management definitely plays favorites. My position was stationed in the front and we were not given an opportunity to be successful.  All was blamed on the front despite the fact that the doctor and registered nurses would not address their responsibilities in a timely fashion. For example, pre-auths were disregarded regularly frustrating patients and resulting in an excessive amount of call-ins by patients looking for status updates on their medications. Poor communication with in. Just sad. I feel sympathy for my friends, fellow college's  who are left behind and have to deal with the stress, mental abuse. Community does not care about their employees. Period. I would NEVER recomend working for Community Healthcare System to ANYONE!"
bad,"Negativity strongly hinders the overall workforce.  Thus, creating a less than stellar work environment. Turnover runs rampant here and will continue to do so until the negativity is addressed."
bad,"I have worked for this company for two and a half years. Just about everyone on our team are unhappy with one thing or another due to lack of communication, poor management due to high turnover rates and lack of recognition/compensation for a role that pays $5 more an hour at most places."
bad,New hire orientation doesn't relate to hired positions. A week training wasted for no on the job training. General group training not developed for  an individual training.
bad,"Managers were obnoxious bully bosses who rule by intimidation, insist on getting their way and fly off the handle easily. They treat subordinates like children and seldom ask for anyone's input. "
bad,"The Company is Fake!!!"
bad,"As an RN, I've never worked in such unsafe conditions. Staffing is always short, doctors admit everything to boost profits while administration turns a deaf ear to the real patient care issues. Facilities are antiquated and out-dated due to the tight wallets of the company and their top concern of profits. Inconsistent policies and structure , high turnover and frequent changes in management and administration. Wouldn't recommend anyone to work here or seek healthcare from them."
bad,"I've worked there on 2 different occasions for different leaders.  The overly conservative culture inspires negative competition among employees and leadership.  This competition becomes unnecessarily intense and a distraction from doing a high quality job for patient care.  "
bad,"The department is extremely over loaded and well understaffed. The weekly threats from the director of being fired has caused a hostile work environment and the staff is in fear. Tired of being mistreated by the director and the lack of pay is making people leave their position for better work enviroment opportunities. The HR department is useless and most the time they sit in a office, talk about other instead of working. If you ask them a question, more than likely they can't answer it. The provider enrollment managers are ok, but one is not so good. The lack of proper training sets up everyone for failure and it doesn't help that the director actually doesn't know how to complete any credentialing applications. He refuses to learn therefore the department will be in worse shape soon due to his lack of knowledge. His turn over rate for employees is at 95% since April when he started and here are more leaving. I wouldn't recommend this place of employment to anyone."
bad,"If you keep to your self, it's an ok place to work. Illness can cause job termination."
bad,The job is easy and good pay to keep you with them. If the supervisors or management don't like you anything might happen to make it possible to get you fired or for you to leave but possibly to get you fired. If there's personal stuff going on with management your days might be tense. People are daily worried about any little thing because you will be accountable if a supervisor sees something or if someone around you says something about it. Management has a hard time recruiting but they are firing people or people just leave. But the pay is good.
bad,has no respect for management team or staff.  not sure I am comfortable saying anything else as I still need to work for a number of years and do no need anything written down here to be attributed to me.
bad,"There are not many people in the organization I would work for based off of how they treat their employees. IF you get the right manager, who reports to the right Director, who reports to the right VP, then you could have a shot at having a great experience at CHS. "
bad,I cannot say what I want because they will know exactly who I am so I will keep my mouth shut. Investment of personal time and years invested does not mean anything to them
bad,Management was more concerned about attendance instead of properly training employees on the job. the only good thing was the monthly bonus. Easy job.
bad,"Awful place to work to try to learn, sharpen your skills or advance. Upper/Middle mgmt. have no clue and do not listen or allow strong engineers to give their input."
bad,"Do you enjoy working mandatory overtime, weekends and holidays? If so CHS is the company for you! Upper management is clueless and works people into the ground. Paid time off is a joke."
bad,"If you take some time to research the healthcare industry you will soon find that CHS is a company that is sinking.  CHS expanded too quickly purchasing hospitals that were in decline and infused no true infrastructure with Revenue Cycle that allowed those hospitals to be successful.  The culture within CHS has no regard for employee welfare, and is not interested in evolving to get with the current trends in the industry.  Quarterly the company is divesting facilities in a last effort to not fail completely.  Be very wary before accepting a job with CHS."
bad,"The workload was not evenly distributed among employees. "
bad,Management and VPs are highly stressed and the pressures are taken out on lower level staff.  Department stress and tension makes for an extremely hostile work environment.
bad,This company is a for profit healthcare provider. They pay their nurses very poorly. Its all about making money. They do not car about their employees
bad,"This company is the most destructive company to the employees I have ever seen. The people I worked with were fine. Upper management is always worried about ""MONEY"" and not patient care. "
bad,"I was let go, along with many others, in a ""restructuring"". They are now a revolving door of billers and collectors at this location. It is very sad."
bad,"As a contractor with CHS, they were always hammering into our heads that we could receive a phone call to let us go for the most trivial reasons. It caused a lot of folks major stress issues. We were there to help them deploy electronic systems because we cared about our work, but there was little to no training offered on the modules they expected us to support. The leads refused to 'approve' time off for contractors, instead they just ended their engagement. Their leads just keep telling you to think of the money you're making, smile, and tell people at facilities ""I don't know, but I will find out."" The leads put you into situations as a contractor that is unfair and unsupported."
bad,"While the staff and managers were truly friendly and helpful, the company's policies and structure needs a lot of work. Staff is grossly underpaid in their respective positions. Responsibility will continue to increase but not the pay."
bad,"Lead multiple EMR implementation for hospitals in the Midwest. (NextGen, McKesson, Cerner, HL7, HIPAA) Full life cycle, Agile Lean, vendor management and training plan development.  Develop Post Go Live support initiatives and transition planning."
bad,I was laid off after 5 years of working in their shared service center as a manager.  They restructured staffing after losing half of their facility contracts.  the SSC is a regional billing office and they went from serving 26 facilities to 12.
bad,This place is not organized at all and sets unrealistic standards for its employees. Raises are small. Workload increases daily. There are huge pay gaps better employees who do the exact same work
bad,"A lot of pressure with very little instruction, specification, or communication. Value hot bodies in seats over work life balance even when very little work is available. Not uncommon to hear management publicly shouting at subordinates."
bad,Employees are treated with complete disinterest and lack of caring. They could care less about employees thoughts and/or concerns. They believe that even one mistake a week is unacceptable.
bad,"There was never a cohesive sense of purpose or direction at this company. I would like to say that it was organized  chaos, but there wasn't enough organization to even give them that high of a mark."
bad,"CHS offers an excellent benefit package.  The staff are dedicated and hard working despite the fact of poor and antiquated leadership.   If you are willing to take a stand for the employees and refuse to perform task that are questionable, you remove yourself from the promotion track."
bad,I am customer service clerical support i process return mail i process bankruptcies i scan i fax and also take voicemails and type messages for the customer service reps.
bad,There is a lack of leadership in the company.  Management stumbles all over each other and there is no consistency for employees to follow.  The work is fine-but poor to little training. The HR Department is of no help for the employees at all.
bad,Large company with limited advancement opportunities with salaries that are below market.
bad,CHS hospitals are in need of overhaul. Highly political work enviorment. Fear controled. Gender bias. Very poor managment. Unhappy staff except for few who ruled the department. Patient care suffered as a result. Do not bring your loved ones here for care.
bad,"CHS is all about saving themselves from bankruptcy. They care nothing about patient outcomes, only the bottom line. I wish I had known more about their poor financial standing prior to joining. The Thechairman continues to get raises and bonuses as the frontline workers suffer. company."
bad,"The job itself was not bad, but training for an AR Analyst was horrible. This was the WORST experience I have ever had in my 25 years of working, with management!"
bad,It's disconcerting to hear about how troubled your company is on NPR while driving to/from work.  Even more troubling is learning of the bonuses granted to the President while getting an outstanding personal review and only $.03/hr. increase.
bad,"During the initial interview you are informed you will be well trained, that there are plenty of advancement opportunities, and how the management has an open door policy.  These statements are not true.  Within the first two weeks, you quickly learn what it's really like. Training is sporadic, procedures are constantly changed, there are very few advancement opportunities. "
bad,Horrible management of Admissions/Front line Registration staff. Very unethical workers and unethical things asked of workers.
bad,"Interesting work, challenging environment.  High population of consultants."
bad,"I don’t think the “managers” are even certified as coders. If you know more than them and point out their mistakes, they get rid of you. They can set you up to be terminated. Horrible. If you want to advance in your field, they won’t let you."
bad,"CEO seems immune to failure while his company loses billions. CTO and CIO are puppets of the CFO. CFO seems to be incompetent. Unless you are one of the top three executives, your decisions are disregarded and often ridiculed. There is only a ""here and now"" view regarding road maps and technology paths. Definitely a ""good 'ol boy"" kind of company."
bad,"CHS went through several changes in management and with each change the culture of the company became less desirable and more stressful.  In addition, the company was not honest and transparent when dealing with the employees in the field."
bad,"Its all about who you know thats jow u climb the ladder.  Its mot about the skill set, and that whst it should be. I wouldnt recommend this job to anyone"
bad,I do not recommend this job if you are looking to grow. Management was only put in place because the collection agency closed.  The pay isn't good... I've been there 4 years with less than a dollar raise!!
bad,Community Health Systems values profit over patient safety. Their nurses are underpaid and overworked.  Nurses are down staffed even in Emergency Department settings which is very unsafe.  Patient safety is not a priority and the nurse to patient ratio is very unsafe.
bad,"Culture and atmosphere starts at the top, and the SSC area of CHS had a very oppressive atmosphere that was intolerable for me, even as a manager. They micro-manage every tiny thing and want their managers to do the same.  It makes the managers unhappy in their work, and the employees resentful.  Team building was never a priority and you were never given time to conduct it for your team even if you wanted to."
bad,"Having worked professionally for over 35 years, CHS was by-far the most destructive organization I have ever worked for. Leaders have grown through the ranks and many are unqualified and extremely ineffective in their roles, specifically in Information Systems. The culture is to berate and humiliate anyone with an opinion, if and only if they are even allowed to speak.  Executives are out of touch with reality and the lack of emotional intelligence runs rampant throughout management (I would never describe them as leaders). It's every man/woman for himself/herself. The amount of bureaucracy pales in comparison to any other large private/public/federal or state agency. The reputation CHS owns in the Nashville area and elsewhere is horrible and I always receive apologies when I tel people I used to work there. You'll find more effective leaders at a fast food restaurant. Avoid this company at all cost!"
bad,Terrible job my department was PPSI supervisor and managers don’t care about no one but themselves. Also if you ask me they are very racist. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone
bad,"I wish I had read these reviews prior to accepting my offer; the cost for not was being released after only one week on the assignment. The only reason given was my attire, specifically no tie! Worse is the apathetic response from recruiter and manager toward the significant cost to me by leaving another assignment because of assurances of the long term security in this one. All of the other reviewers are spot on with respect to exceptionally poor treatment, poor project mgmt skills, and an organization structure in conflict with itself...all with bright happy smiles."
bad,"Worked too many hours, there some times to midnight at month end. No work like balance, had to work some weekends. No teamwork. Over worked good employees."
bad,"Wants you to hit 55 + accts per day with little no training and does not give acct of how much work actually goes into collections properly. Most ppl get in trouble for incorrectly working accts, but they fail to realize that there standards are set to high for most beginners, and sr collections have an advantage. Poor in job security."
bad,"Laboratory Techs are a great team.  The Phlebotomy Dept. has a high school attitude. The ""Mean Girls Club"" on day turn is out of control.  Certain cushy positions aren't able to mind their own business, because their to busy minding others.  Communication is a real big issue between the dept. within the Laboratory.  Not all jobs are posted and not all write ups are enforced fairly.  I have witnessed some inexcusable things that were not correctly handled.  The manager is not available to all because the Coordinator of the Phlebotomy Dept. monopolizes her time, which does not allow any privacy for conversations.  Advancements or promotions are not based on performances and only certain individuals can post unappropriate work related matter on Facebook and get a slap on the hand, while others are terminated.  The new culture is hired in as per-diam, but we'll work you 40+hrs. with no benefits.  But there the few who've schmoozed those who count to get benefits.  If you just want to earn a wage make some lasting friendships with not only hospital staff,but also patients and families and be there for those less fortunate and don't mind being spoken to like your a piece if dirt then the hospital in Sharon,PA is the perfect place to be."
bad,"On a typical day, it was fun to work there. The managers can sometimes play favorites but overall just do your work. The pay was AWFUL.. do better with that."
bad,"CHS Hospice had many issues, however it was fixable and I loved my position.  However when supervisor left and new supervisor was hired, the culture diminished greatly.  The new president did not understand hospice and made many dangerous decisions affecting the compliance of the organization."
bad,"High turnover, there are only a handful of provider enrollment specialist who have seniority and even they are looking for other jobs. New director who came from billing knows nothing about enrollment constantly giving new priorities and you can't even finish the first one! There is no room for advancement he hires supervisors who doesn't know squat on how to complete an application they are useless. One left and went to another department then came back and then left again, one didn't even last 24hrs and the last one didn't even last but 3 months! What?? They are paying new people 18 and up because they realize that the amount of work that is required, anything less than that ain't going to cut it. But yet the ones who are currently there make less and probably have more experience oh not to mention the little 2% raises every year sometimes less! If you do work there kiss managements behind that way when your ready to bounce they will accept your two weeks notice otherwise if they don't like you, the moment you turn in your notice, they baracade you in your cubicle while you pack and walk you straight out the door! You come home with headaches and anxiety and you think about the work you didn't get done because of the psycho director wanting his records cleaned up just so HE can look good to superiors. Management is all fake, HR is too. Don't apply! Fair warning!"
bad,"CHS seems to be have a CYA and pass the buck culture. You may be given assignments without the access or support needed to accomplish them, and are just left to figure it out yourself."
bad,The director of the IT department was the only reason I stayed as long as I did. The culture is horrible because the upper management doesn't seem to care about the employees or the patients. It's a shame that the culture starts at the top and filters down to the patient.
bad,"I worked nights, holidays and weekends with no differential. I made $5+ an hour less than competitors pay their social workers. The only positives to the job were that coworkers felt like family and I didn’t have a long commute."
bad,"As long as you are you have a medical background you will do well in this company.  Any other background is looked down on, as if you know nothing.  Compensations is nothing, even if you have a medical background.  Without one it is even worse.  Working a 40 hour week for pennies and expected to do a $40K amount of work."
bad,"Many of the best people are leaving for other companies.  Management is getting stricter and starting to do more micro-managing.  This used to be a great place to work, but as the company stock starts to plummet so does morale."
bad,"I've worked here for 5 years. When a new unit director and medical director came to a specific unit, everything changed for the worse- bullying, retaliation against any voiced patient care concerns, no support, no teamwork. "
bad,Management was uncertain of path to success. There were a lot of disparate unproductive activities that had nothing to do with accomplishing the work.
bad,In group out group work  environment. Nepotism and Favoritism   with a dash of micromanagement. Poor Health Care Benefits. Company takes little to no interest in strengthening Human Capital to gain competitive advantage. Management focuses on advancing their own careers instead.
bad,CHS is a very difficult company to work for the culture of the organization is hostile.  I would never work for this organization again.  This company should work on their culture.
bad,They recognize talent but don't want to pay for it. Lots of after hours work. Difficult balance of managing urgent requests and production support/regular maintenance.
bad,I thought I was getting along fine with my team leader and I thought I was doing well but they terminated my contract without warning. I didn't realize I was on thin ice. I wish I never came to CHS.
bad,It feels as if management does regard contractors with much concern. I understand that they can be replaced but why treat them that way. Get what you put out.
bad,"I worked at HQ in Nashville and I can tell you it was not a place to work at. The management lacked in every way, there was no direction or leadership and you were left to figure out what to do. It was very political and how well you did your job was not important. If they liked you ,then you were ok but if they heard something regardless of the truth then it was time for you to go.  They will not tell you why because they can not say the real reason so they will make something up."
bad,"A typical day at work is posting the charges for the Doctor's that I bill for.  Making sure they have entered the correct diagnosis codes and verifying that patient insurances are correct.  In addition, I also answer patient phone calls and deal with resolving their issues in a courteous, professional and timely manner."
bad,Lack of structure. Treatment of non medical staff poor. Too many meeting with no meaningful communication. Pay was stagnant. Bonus not given or discussed even with a sign on guarantee.
bad,"I worked very diligently and hard every day. Always met or exceeded my daily quota. Repeatedly, I was told I would be promoted but it never came to fruition. Also lied to and told I needed to go to Human Resources for a follow-up interview where I was simply terminated."
bad,This place is ok. They pay the bare minimum salary vs other employers with only .10 cent raises every year. The company will close the building for Holidays/Snowdays and take your PTO hours rather then using sick hours or being company paid. There’s no real room for growth. Management is overwhelmed and overworked.
bad,Micromanagement seems to be the normal management style.  Favoritism abounds.  Upper management appears to have blinders on in regards to specific Department Directors..
bad,"I have been with this company for 5 years and started at the bottom and worked my way up. One thing is that you are micromanaged and productivity related. I don't mind trying to get whatever claims in a day but I don't like the stress that goes with it. Then they expect you to also do the other projects that they give you and hurry up and call the insurances and work two claims at a time. Can't even talk to your neighbor without being watched. In fact, we used to have 32 people in our area and now we are down to 16 and doing double duty and expected to keep up on being within benchmark."
bad,Better off working elsewhere. Not a stable business under current management. Too many meetings to discuss previous meetings and many times with the same people. Absolutely no loyalty to employees.
bad,"No communication between management, tons of money and time wasted for no reason. There isn't enough time in the day to line out all the blatant issues with this company. They pay well, but at the cost of you rarely being able to  have a life. Work for this company if you don't mind being jerked around on work-week schedules or trapped in airports overnight/all day etc."
bad,Productive very high in 8-10 hrs workday. Focus on quantity and not quality.  Too many Director that's not on same page. Company not family oriented always work.
bad,"Being the only radiology tech on weekend I leaned to get things done in a timely manner without compromising patient care, or showing lack of compassion. I learned how to prioritize exams based on urgency, and timeliness of the exams. Management as a whole needs work. They are not willing to back their employees."
bad,Unlike most larger IT organizations this company has a reactionary culture. There doesn't seem to be any plan and all it takes is the right upper management to disagree to derail any plan.
bad,"On average most employees work 50 to 55 hours a week, which includes working from home. Even though their isn't a work from home policy. However, is it expected you will work from home. "
bad,"Nothing."
bad,"Felt like Junior High politics.  Most everyone laid off without notice.  Just over-all not a comfortable place to work, at least on the IT side.  I'd worked HIM before and had a great team, but the IT side was petty with little/no training."
bad,I left the job because I didn't agree with the way they handled situations. They left there people in the dark. They bought out small hospitals and sold them for profit after upgrading there infrastructure.
bad,"This is a fast and busy work place. There will always be something to do. You have to assist with phone calls and scheduling, as well as, working closely with a designated provider and his/her team."
bad,"Haven't figured out yet why Exec level management hasn't realized that people leave bad management, not their jobs.  The culture is horrible and the environment is toxic. The entire management team needs to be dismissed and replaced with people of better character. It's a disgrace."
bad,"Community Health Systems is a Fortune 500 company based in Franklin, Tennessee. It was the largest provider of general hospital healthcare services in the United States in terms of number of acute care facilities. As of December 31, 2016, it owns, leases or operates 158 hospitals in 22 states."
bad,"If you were an FTE, it was good.  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,   I was left alone lots but provided some direction.  Grew in my skill sets and gained confidence as i was left alone and needed to anticipate to be successful."
bad,"I personally enjoyed my job because of the people I had on my team. Overall, CHS has no room for growth especially within the entity I worked for at the SSC."
bad,"There are many wonderful ""blue collar"" workers at CHS. The Issue is with upper management. The decision making is suspect and it promotes a very chaotic atmosphere. As far as the IT portion of the company is concerned it is almost exclusively about correcting issues, not preventing them from happening in the first place. By my experience the company is only committed to doing the bare minimum."
bad,"Stressful environment and management focus on dollars and ROI rather than the people that make this happen each day at CHS.  In the beginning, it was good and thereafter downhill."
bad,"I’m grateful for the opportunity to have learned and obtain skills needed.  I really enjoyed working with some great colleagues, however I wouldn’t recommend CHS based on management."
bad,"It was unclear what the rules were for a SCALF Unit. According to policy, patients had to ambulate independently and be able to feed self. Yet we had those who could do neither. Criteria for sending patients out for violent behavior was not consistent. Constant fear of losing your position if anyone with seniority wanted your position. I was given 1st shift after working 3rd for 2 months. The care coordinator was given my shift. Only to find that I was scheduled for mostly 2nd shift  and very few first shift hours. I told them when first hired that I could not work 2nd. They only have 1 nurse per shift (except 1st) and so many walked out or quit that I had seniority over most after 2 months."
bad,Did not have much direction from management.  Too big to care about individuals.  Too many moving parts.  No one seemed to know the big picture.  Too many chiefs and not enough indians.
bad,Production was a ok but the management is not supportive at all. Nothing was not correct and the mirco management was awful. There was some enjoyable part at the job.
bad,"I enjoyed the work I did at CHS. I assisted in resolving Medical Claim accounts. Unfortunately management was the deciding factor for me as far as not staying with CHS as a career. The pay was decent and as I said I enjoyed the work, which especially made the 15/hr worth the work hours I put in. I also enjoyed most my workers at CHS.  I wouldn't recommend CHS solely based on the management."
bad,It was a difficult place to work. There were lots of issues between all the different teams and worst of all even the people on my team couldn't get along.
bad,"The casual attire is the best part or working with CHS, as well as the people. Most are willing to help out with no questions asked, most of those that have been there 4+ years do only their job and nothing more."
bad,"I stayed at CHS because there was not other jobs at the time.  I applied for jobs within CHS after I had been there for awhile.  The management is bad, and it was a who you know atmosphere.  I am glad to be gone from this place!"
bad,They did not Care about the person. They Hired according to Friends. Management did not care how you felt or how they could improve on making your work day smooth.
bad,You do not get compensated for the job you do. I have 2 job titles and was doing the work of 2 people and was only being paid $10.50 and he. After a year they gave me a 10 cent raise.
bad,"too much required"
bad,"Posting Hospitals mail and insurance and self pays. This was based on facility posting. "
bad,"The Case Management Director allowed  her supervisor to completely micro-manage the staff.  The complete lack of professionalism of the Dept Manager and Supervisor was unbelievable, in  the Case Management Dept."
bad,"Many smart skilled people... micromanagement stands in for leadership, it is an obstacle to progress and collaboration.  Favoritism is rampant and not everyone is held to performance standards."
bad,CHS has a reputation among Consultants to arbitrarily stop projects and end contracts on a whim.  I witnessed this many times and ended up being a recipient recently.  I will not go back to this company due to the disrespect I encountered.
bad,CHS offered great benefits. The organization was very open to hear employee concerns and needs. Employee feed back was welcomed. The company was proactive and showed a genuine concern with the employee satisfaction survey response.
bad,Culture change is causing chaos. Little time for learning. No Coaching from management. Lots of new changes...some good...some not so good. Loved managing and growing my people.
bad,"Like the proverbial football team on the crux of greatness, so goes CHS. The potential is there with the players on the field but the management either can't or won't get out of the way and let it happen. Turnover is always high as there is no rhyme or reason for promotions, there is a dearth of leadership across the footprint, and there is no seeming desire to improve things. Stay in 2000 is apparently the motto. Run a 135 hospital business like there are only 20 hospitals. You can work a job here...but career? Unlikely."
bad,Horrible raises for promotions (4% maximum). Poor leadership that does not care about employees or employee retention. Positive policies take years to come to fruition.
bad,"If you have a Family & can not work the demanded overtime, this is not the Department for you. I was not aware of the overtime hours until I started working & I wasn't given the option."
bad,"I enjoyed the challenges of using my analytical and critical care experiences to motivate others for the benefit of the patients and the facility. I had an excellent repoire with Dr.'s, RN's and coding staff as a result of my education modules and management skills. "
bad,Management is NOT trustworthy at all as far as sharing individuals monthly reviews or personal information dealing with health. Some of my coworkers are great but are not happy with the way managers do not work well with peers and are not trustworthy to talk to. There is a right and wrong way for a manager to approach an employee if they need to speak to them about something personal or related to work.
bad,"Was being able to see the professionals save patients lives, whether it be an injury, a small child having an asthma attack, someone in a bar fight, being apart of the direct patient care made all the difference."
bad,"Everyone had a specific task and to get a full project done required collaboration between large numbers of people with their individual tasks. These people were on their own priority and time schedules. this made completing anything close to impossible. Also, some of the higher level people were about 15 years behind in their technologies and the resultant work and systems reflected this. 10/10 would never work for them again."
bad,A very static environment.  Top bosses play favorites all the time. Too much indecisions and not enough recognition of your work. The C suite is only here for personal advancement. They don't care about the hospital.
bad,"Some departments within CHS do not provide guidance, direction, or support. No standard processes or useful documentation are available to help set you up for success."
bad,"You need to be able to multi-task and work a lot of overtime."
bad,I have worked for CHS for several years. When I was transferred to a different entity of CHS my pay was cut and our department was not compensated in any way. The Shared Services Center is unorganized. The management are still in need of training. The company and benefits as a whole are pretty good.
bad,"stable work environment, wages not enough some team leads think they are the CEO and some managers have favorites. Overall stressful and low pay."
bad,"To much nepotism.  don't ask to many questions and you should do fine.  Benefits are the best ever!  Be prepared to train yourself, not much training is given that is understandable."
bad,Benefits were great. Don't be late and be prepared to get wrote up for everything. They reprimand you but you never sign anything. They just make snide remarks. No personal calls my husband called one time and I got wrote up.
bad,"the coworkers are petty and lie about you so you are constantly in HR defending yourself.   After 14 months, you are lucky to get 10 cents in a raise which is nothing, and if you correct a mistake that 5 other colleagues missed, though are sent it for corrections, and that person calls and complains, you are then written up for being the last person to touch it though you are the only one to fix it...don't work here"
bad,"A typical day at work is fairly fast-paced and my direct supervisor was a fair and understanding person.  Most people in the area of the hospital that I work in are not team-oriented.  They are very vindictive and not very caring of their patients.  The hardest part of the job is not getting paid enough to survive.  It is not comparable to the cost of living here.  Whenever we get a yearly raise, the most you can get is $0.03 (and no, that's not a typo).  Health insurance is very expensive, especially if you're not the only one on the insurance.  They do provide 401K, but they don't contribute much to it at all."
bad,Very busy but I enjoyed it.  I didn't care for working until 10 and 11 at night and on holidays. I learned how to better write Business Requirements.  I enjoyed the work and travel of this position. I learn so much.  CHS is truly the school of the hard knocks.
bad,"The company has perks that entice you to the job. However, the workload is astounding since they acquired 70 more hospitals in early 2014. Now you have unrealistic expectations by management, emails threatening disciplinary action, and a workload that can't be managed effectively due to the high turnover. Due to management priorities, enrollment of providers is at the bottom of the list! This sets the whole team up for failure since this creates problems with offices, providers, patients, and the billing Dept. There are so many priorities, that you could never meet all expectations. We have management with no experience in enrollment who are ruining the workflow, morale, and the whole process of enrollment with their overwhelming lack of knowledge on daily operations of a successful enrollment team. No one will stand up on your behalf even when they know how overloaded you are and what a great job you are doing to juggle so many tasks. There is an obvious ""Every man for themselves"" mentality. The department has had 3 Directors in 4 years, each worse than the last. There has been so much turnover in this dept, that supervisors can hardly be reached since most of their job is spent doing interviews. The new people are learning quickly that no one has time for their questions, the team leads are rude and lack knowledge needed to train, and other employees are unhappy. They are leaving before 90 days in most cases now. HR has had several round table discussions to figure out how to prevent the turnover but the problems noted are not adressed."
bad,"Advancement to any other team is impossible, the people are great and the atmosphere is great."
bad,My time spent with the company was not productive. I sat in a cubicle wearing a tie even though I had no contact with customers. The Sys Admins did not provide access to the system for me to do my job properly.
bad,"I have gained a really good work experience, but the management wasn't good and the corporation suffered A LOT recently. They pay was sucks compared to the amount of work."
bad,"Good Team, Bad Upper Management, Benefits are not great, big-brother atmosphere. All about the bottom line, not about patient care. 90's style managment"
bad,"For the first 12 years at CHS I would rate the corporate climate and company future very highly.   Then the company made a huge mistake in buying another hospital ownership company (HMA) without adequate due diligence.  Took on WAY too much debt and hasn't been able to ""turn around"" operations/finances at many of the acquired facilities.   As a result CHS has a mountain of debt, the stock price has plummeted (from high $50s to under $10 per share), and the company is selling off assets to try to survive.    The company has made a number of bad decisions on management issues and is seeing accelerating turn-over as valuable people realize they can do better elsewhwere."
bad,"Micro management. Company going through financial issues. It could be a great place to work but it is currently not due to culture with middle management,"
bad,"My department was a very stressful place to work. It appeared that there were those who were always going to get treated better and as long as you played the games, you could be okay. LOTS of people leaving constantly."
bad,"Very unorganized company with no real leadership; timelines are not reasonable, very non-supportive leadership when present at all.  Unqualified people are assigned tasks with no direction or support, then when something goes wrong, all blame placed on them"
bad,as acontractor no life traveled 100% of the time with limited to no time off
bad,registered nurse turned clinical analyst that provided end user support during and post Go-Live for Cerner conversions
bad,They lay off contractors like no man's business. Beware!!! But their pay rates are good...
bad,Appreciate their top performers. There is nothing else to be said about the company other then they push good employees out instead of retaining them. Difficult to transfer between departments.
good,Employees are expected to meet unrealistic goals.  Verylittle guidance or support.  Not given any opportunity to work out problems.
good,"You work a lot for very little pay.  They do have very good health insurance though. "
good,"Enjoy the people on my team.  The benefits are decent"
good,"Management sucks"
good,They are not a family oriented company to be employed with. Their benefits and FMLA policy are significantly lacking compared to other companies in the area.
good,"Horrible Management, Cut Throat environment , cash posting works mandatory end of month. They are now hiring through a temp and firing people every 3 weeks.If you want job security apply somewhere else."
good,Upper management should listen more to the actual worker when making decisions that effect the worker. Very little chance for advancement no matter the skill level you have. It is a popularity choice.
good,Being that I have worked for CHS previously I know that some of the issues faced is a facility issue and not a CHS system issue. Overall working for CHS is a great experience with so many opportunities to grow and challenge yourself as a nurse.
good,Large Corporation where employees are treated like numbers. CHS has a lack of training program and managers do not have time to give clear direction on tasks.
good,"management heavy, Not very receptive to individual initiative.  Culture is very silo based (no one is willing to do anything outside of their assigned area).  "
good,All your skills are needed to work at CHS.  You will never get bored.  Management changes focus frequently.  The job description may not be well defined.   It is difficult to manage a team when communication silos exist.
good,"The good things"
good,"Over a year and a half ago, CHS took of Lutheran Hospital with all new management.  We had 3 managers in 9 months.  A typical day with this current manager is we get assigned high dollar accounts that need to be coded in 20 minutes.  As an inpatient coder, this is a struggle for most of us as extra time and care is needed for these types of patients.  We then are micromanaged constantly with other things we must do example, send an e-mail to the CDI is our DRG's don't agree.  Review the patient accounts for codes that were rejected and try to negotiate a correct code.  The hardest part of this job is being asked why I'm not able to make the productivity then the constant interruptions of e-mails.  The most enjoyable part of my job now is logging off after my work day.  I used to love working for Lutheran Hospital and my director and team."
good,I really enjoy my job but my issues revolve solely around management and culture. Management is promoted to get them out of areas where they are causing trouble. Some of the managers and directors are not qualified and turnover is outrageous. The culture is old and outdated.
good,Very poor management. They will allow coworkers to stand around gossiping all day. Very unfair. They will allow employees to disrespect each other by yelling at or just speaking rudely to each other.
good,I don't have a lot of comments.  I really don't have anything to put in this field; but it won't let me submit it until I put at least 150 characters.
good,If you didnt fit in the clicks that were at CHS you pretty much will be terminated. If you ask questions to get a better understanding of things you were told you were pushing back. To be honest no one will stay there if they dont have their managers take some type of people skills class.
good,"Overall great people to work with however salary is very low compared to other healthcare companies in the area.  Many areas and opportunities I am happy with at the company, but lack of pay for level of work required in position is very low."
good,You could have your moments but it was okay to work.  It was a place were you could learn.  Higher management had a problem sometimes.  Workplace was average but not always friendly. Hardest part was dealing with upper management sometimes. Mist days were enjoyable if you went out for lunch with some employees.
good,i would not recommend this company to anyone. There is room for advancement but it comes with a price.They micro manage everything and they are late on bonus.
good,"Insurance is HSA, good incentives that can be completed to increase the monies in the acct. "
good,"CHS was great to work for at the facility level. However, when they switched us to the corporate level, it wasn't as enjoyable anymore. Too much micromanaging with constant changes to only be changed back to the original way it was because of said micromanaging."
good,"Even with stellar performance reviews, leaving the call center is almost impossible unless you are a family member or have a friend in a different department.  The office is very cliquish.  Also if you have a doctors note for being absence they still consider it an unexcused absence.  Not a good place for people with disabilities or serious health conditions.  There is always the threat of being terminated for being sick in your first year."
good,I do not care to write a review on this company at this time. It is unusual to be asked to do something that a person is unwilling to do to find a job so I am saying No thankyou.
good,Collect on medical claims under lots of pressure to meet extremely high numbers. Lots of Company Events all cost and lots of pot lucks that cost as well. Extremely hard  job in regards to meeting metrics.
good,my direct manager was awesome however some people were rude and took their position far too seriously......they tattled on things that did not matter or should have concerned them.; making it difficult for everyone
good,I do not have a comment as to working at CHS at this time.  I am only writing this because the form will not let me pass this section without it.  Indeed needs to correct that so that this is an optional field  we should not be required to comment on the working conditions of the company we work or have worked for.
good,I loved my department and stated mission but found the company executives to work in a total reactionary mode. Never know from day to day if your job was safe or not
good,"This is a great company to use as a stepping stone to what you want. Work is hard, but everyone knows it's hard there. They understaff and plan on everyone working 120% all the time, but that brings with it the pride that you accomplished what you did there and others do recognize it."
good,"Travel required 100% of the time."
good,Good hospital to work at but the leadership turnover is high and constantly changing every few years lending to some local instability that could be avoided.
good,"I enjoyed my time at CHS, however, under the last Administrator things were difficult. It affected everyone.  numerous people left. Our census dropped from over 300 to 190. The Regional Manager was sent to talk to everyone one on one People would have stayed if we would've been heard!! Finally after we lost essential people, they listened but it was too late. The damage was done. They ended up firing the Administrator but only after losing some very valuable employees."
good,no job security they are constantly letting people go and no job advancement as once they let people go they do not refill the position.  Low amount of paid vacation days
good,"Unfortunately, CHS does not value employees who stay at the company. They recently capped annual raises at 1% with promotion raises being capped at 3%. These raises are totally unacceptable for a company of CHS's size."
good,"CHS has placed a hiring freeze, as well as a freeze on transferring positions within the company. As employees leave, the work load is shifted to the remaining employees."
good,"CHS has provided me an opportunity to learn the healthcare industry. I have gained Business Analysis and Quality Assurance skills as well as a wealth of knowledge regarding Project Management. The downside of all of this, is that it is purely self-taught. CHS has a mentality of throwing someone in the deep end and hoping they can swim. Most problems are resolved by throwing money at them. No bonus structure for non-executive level staff meant that the few perks (free soda, corporate Christmas party) were all that we had as incentives. Once CHS took a downturn, financially, those 'perks' went away. "
good,"I would consider this employer to be a ""starter"" job. No opportunity for advancement. Management doesn't care about employee well-being."
good,A small hospital with great potential. Significant pressure from Corporate to meet unrealistic money based goals. Management and staff overall are welcoming and supportive. Their pay scales appear to be best in area. Retention of staff is poor - directly related to stressors placed by Corporate. Understaffed. Poor safety iniatives.
good,registration tech for high volume clinic you have to know how to multi-task and be flexible. Not a good place for people that are used to a everyday routine.
good,"Typical day at work:  I self-taught myself."
good,"Quiet work space not much interaction with co-workers have to meet productivity guidelines, stressful being consistent. Other departments were better to work in, more teaming/cross-training."
good,Overall a good experience. Met and still consider many friends. Mainly a traveling job but developed excellent working relationships with many and still contact them and stay in touch and build our professional networks.
good,CHS was a great place to work before the company got too large and teams stopped helping each other. Projects were at the mercy of functional managers and leadership's direction was constantly evolving.
good,The processes in place could be streamed line. Accountability is a major part of the job. Ownership of past issues should be looked at in more detail. The company has the potential to be amazing if the protocol they have in place in revamped.
good,"Review current build of hospital system and design and build new system. Team is deployed to ensure the satisfactory deployment of the new hospital system to meet staff, patient, and government requirements."
good,A typical day was at minimum 10 hour work day with at least 50 hrs worked in a week. The senior management is constantly overturning and their hospice division is undergoing significant growing pains.
good,"12 hour shifts back to back, tired when you went in tired when you left. Benefits were excellent when started in 2000, fell by the time I retired from there."
good,"The ability to maintain your focus, detail, accuracy, and customer service is key to leaving at the end of the day feeling like you did your best work."
good,"Unsure of the future of CHS.  Mon-Friday 10-12 hours and on call."
good,"I don't have anything negative to say about CHS.  It's not the type of environment that makes employees feel secure.  If they were to improve in that area, I would probably come back."
good,"Anyone who works there need to be self sufficient, and have thick skin. Management is bad at the pineville location. You do not get compensated for picking up extra if you are a CNA because you aren't seen as equal."
good,on the changes the company made I felt like they was holding some information back and I didn't feel like they was being honest. Also felt there wasn't room for advancement for me
good,"The company seems good, management is really awesome. The department is growing so plenty of jobs should be opening up."
good,This ia a large hospital company with a lot of layers of management thus making it hard to get things done effectively as it seems like there is a lot of bureaucracy and hops to jump through.
good,"CHS is a company that grew through acquisition, yet forgot to manage its practices. There are serious data relationship issues, inept practice managers, volatile interdepartmental relationships, and micro managers galore. "
good,"the department works very well together. inter-communication of parts of department, enjoyed co-workers company"
good,You have to experience CHS climate to understand the workplace.
good,"Good place for an entry level position. There are few advancement opportunities, unless one is willing to commit to full-time traveling."
good,"A typical day at work with CHS is busy. CHS was currently behind in their work thefore, temps were brought in to help reduce prouction."
good,HMA was just bought out by CHS. Learn reimbursement processes and worked closely with provider relations to resolve claim underpayments.
good,if you are looking for a job here think about looking somewhere else overhead has favorites and you learn this really quick. So your choice to go or stay
good,"Fine company, lots of travel. Pay is just okay. Management was good. Company was very concerned on profits and made strategic errors that hurt employees."
good,"They keep buying up hospitals, but not making much money.  Turnover is really high.  Everyone is always on edge, so atmosphere is not great!  Would not recommend this place of employment."
good,"Great for entry level, but opportunities for advancement are only available as travelers, which means you'd either have to relocate or be stuck in the same position for the duration of your career with CHS."
good,"This was my first corporate position, and initially, CHS was still owed by 2 gentlemen from West TN, and things were really great.  When they sold to an investment Corporation, it was very eye opening then, why I felt Healthcare should not be for profit."
good,A little bit disorganized and high turnover in the physician's office I worked at. Management unwilling to negotiate salary. The coworkers were friendly and the doctor I worked for was wonderful
good,"CHS is struggling and they are making cuts.  The culture in the corporate office was very stiff and unfriendly.  The office is set up for work and no social interaction.  "
good,"I had a great experience working for CHS. Management positions changed frequently; so on any given Monday morning I could walk "
good,CHS was a growing company.  Accounting dept. is a hard working bunch of people.  Wasn't much time to interact with other employees. Employees have good working conditions and equipment.
good,"Worked with some amazing people but the place has some major silos which makes it incredibly difficult to accomplish things.  Lots of politics and power issues among leadership.  I had one awesome manager and more than one awful manager.  The hospitals feel corporate doesn't care about them which is unfortunate because there are a lot of people who really care about the clinicians and hospital level people, but they aren't allowed the power to make a difference it seems.  I would say I was happy overall during my time at CHS but there are a lot of areas for improvement."
good,Supports corporate culture found in most organizations. Everyone very busy with projects or own work load. Everyone tries to be very helpful just a busy environment.
good,"Great workforce. The cloud of uncertainty over the business is distracting, almost oppressive. In the end the lack of employment security and layoffs made the workplace uncomfortable."
good,No review to give. I don’t have anything to say about the company. It was just a job that I work for a short time. I can’t say my time was good or bad
good,"good company values, however opportunity for advancement not great, would have preferred more opportunity for growth and salary to be more in line with job required"
good,"Lutheran Health Network management was alright, but CHS national management decisions and policies interfere with local hospitals. Blocking purchase of several medications was frustrating and led to many inefficient processes"
good,Too many new leadership positions filled by outside sources...very bleak in opportunities to be promoted from within (in my dept). Immediate leadership constrained by executive leadership in making smart decisions
good,Reasonable place to work however vision long term is lacking and or not shared with much of the management team which creates lots of questions in the minds of those whom work there.
good,"Very long hours.  Management was not very supportive. Good medical benefits.  They had a 401K plan.  Location was very good when I started, however, they moved to a very isolated area."
good,The business is declining and senior leadership is struggling to right size the organization.  The employees are causalities of war in this environment.
good,I don't have a ton of positive things to say about this company. I think they try to go in the right direction but get caught up in the politics of things.
good,"working statements of vendor, working with AP processor and purchasing to get invoices processed.  Helping corporate and facilities with new system, approvals, coding and getting invoices with new accounting system."
good,Not much opportunity for advancement; employees are shifted around with no consideration for their personal career goals; have good Christmas parties though; regular drug screening also occurs
good,The company is wonderful but I think if you are goin to be a supervisor you should know how to do the job that your people are doing just incase your team lead is not able to assist
good,"EXPERIENCE: Community Health Systems Sarasota, FL 2013-Present"
good,"Eh, not bad, not great.  Zero advancement and average pay.  Unrealistic expecations."
good,I love CHS and I love the healthcare industry. I do not feel that I am able to utilize my strong points and I feel that I am not challenged enough to work on my weak points. I do now that I enjoy being in the healthcare industry and plan to stay in the field. I am looking for a challenge for I am a “fixer” kind of personality. I like to see something before me and look at all of the angles to figure out what works best and how to help the customer.
good,The corporate office was stressful and had challenging environment in relation to cross team communication. The travel was straightforward and  learned a lot of the hospitals which were part of my project assignment.
good,It has been  A pleasure working for community health system and I appreciate the knowledge game and time spent there. It wasnt alot growth and the salary wasnt fair.
good,A typical day was a little frustrating. The hardest part of the job was miscommunication and rework. The most enjoyable part was being close to the mall at lunch.
good,"Extremely busy, maily reactive.  Often involved in multiple projects or activities that may or may not indirectly affect your role and responsibility."
good,This job consisted of multiple visits to small locations in out of the way places.  Travel required me to land in a major city and drive from 1-4 hours to reach the location that I needed to work with.
good,"Left because of stock price falling, 35 when I started 5 dollars when I left.  Raises were not that great when the company was making money, my last one was half a percent."
good,"the company as a whole is struggling and politics plays a big part, but it isn't a bad place to work.  Underpaid for the amount of knowledge required and work done"
good,"CHS is the parent company of PASI, and working there was once fun, but went downhill quickly. You are micromanaged, the billing practices are so poor that the company asks for more than half the calls involving angry patients, and the pay raises are not meaningful. CHS is going broke and they are struggling. There are nice people inside the call center, and schedules are flexible, but salaries are decent (not great), and you have to stand there and affirm charges that are outrageously higher than the national average."
good,"They set the goals to high and skill where its hard to meet their monthy goal. They don't give you credit for all your money. Great people, fun environment but very competitive and they have favorites."
good,"Stressful, dysfunctional, lack of resource to perform in basic job function and accomplish goals. Lots of redundant work. Short staffed across he bore in every department."
good,"Very rewarding experience working for CHS. Specifically my location in Davenport Florida, I thoroughly enjoy my time here. There is plenty of room for advancement and I have taken advantage of this. My CEO is a visionary and inspiring which is what is necessary, in my opinion, in a leader."
good,"CHS is a great company.  They have over 150,000 employees all over the US.  They are moving forward as leaders in the healthcare industry. Very good advancement opportunity."
good,it's not a bad place to work. I have been here for 9 years and has experienced the highs and lows. the company has been good to me. My pay is good can't complain about that.
good,"Answer in-bound calls from patients in a professional manner, process return mail timely and accurately, make out-bound calls as needed, prepare daily reports in a timely and accurate manner, promote teamwork via helping co-workers when help is needed while portraying a positive attitude, demonstrate ability to be flexible and organized while functioning well under stressful conditions, and performs other duties as directed by the Manager, Assistant Director and Director"
good,I like the atmosphere of working here. The administrative and nursing staff are very hard working and appreciative. The commute for me is very short and co workers are extremely helpful.
good,Workplace is full of favorites with limited advancement opporuntities as they do not cross train.  They hold a merit increases/raises based on performance which is good.
good,Not a terrible place to work depending on your manager. Insurance not so great. PTO is good and holidays are good - they let you go early on most days before a holiday.
good,"Good Job Security, Micro management from Director level down. You work hard and work on the weekends. When your Supervisor tells you one thing then something different from your Manager then something different from your Director. Tough place to work."
good,CHS bought up numerous hospitals over the last four years and now they are selling them off at lightning speed and countless people have and are losing their jobs at an alarming rate.
good,It's a great place to learn about the ends and outs of collections. Especially if you have never done collections before or even healthcare collections before.
good,"There was a high turnover of corporate positions, but the job itself was a nice job.  The position was very demanding with little support from supervisors. But if you can learn quickly, you are alright."
good,"This can be a good place of employment, and can possibly lead to advancement and professional growth. Management is fairly easy, to work with; seldom if ever micromanages."
good,Not a beneficial experience.  I didn't learn anything in the field I was in and the turnover is ridiculous.  My bosses were cool but the mood around the office was weird.
good,Fine place to work. Great deal of growth. Processes are fine. Salary is fine. People are hard working and have a great  deal of charter
good,Knoxville Community Development Corporation is a wonderful company to work for. They do a lot of services for the Knoxville community. I would recommend the company to anyone in the Knoxville area.
good,"Typical day never predicted, but poor managers in place with Carolinas Healthcare System.  "
good,I always worked in the physician office and being in the CBO setting was a great learning experience.  I work with a great leadership team.  The company grew quickly so most of the managers came in at the same time which was great for us all to learn together.
good,Very corporate environment requiring shirt and tie. Management is hands on and engaged. There are fun moments depending on assigned team and management.
good,"A challenging dynamic environment, implemented many new programs and converted hospital to private room facility.  Recruited over 26 new physicians during my tenure at Brandywine Hospital."
good,The facility staff put in long hours to transition to the new EMR and did well.  The contracted managers were supporting too many EMR's at various facilities all at once and were not  thorough on any of them. Things fell through the cracks.
good,very quiet- worked well with the director- learned a lot and the management had the open door policy - my coworkers were very helpful-
good,"lots of changes in staff"
good,Flexability is required while working with the company. Things are always changing.
good,"Great company to improve your skillset, and grow as a professional."
good,Always on the go. never a dull moment. Don't go there unless you are prepared to work. There is plenty to do.
good,I loved my co workers. the corporate office and management made the job stressful. they flew in at a moments notice and fired people. no matter how hard you worked and no matter how much you put in of yourself. it sometimes only took 1 mistake and you were out.
good,"When the company is growing, seemingly endless opportunities. Now it is downsizing and no advancement opportunities.   "
good,"The payroll dept. allows the staff to process payroll from home a few days a week.  Payroll completion is required no matter the circumstances as every employee from housekeeping to CEO's, CFO's etc.  requires getting their payroll check timely and more importantly accurately.  "
good,During my tenure I came during a time when a lot of hospitals were acquired.  There was not a lot of structure there especially between departments.  I did however have a great boss (who was let go).
good,CHS IT is always changing how they provide IT support to customers yearly in an effort to reduce costs.  Employees are hired for certain jobs however Management changes job tasks and processes nearly every year in an effort to reduce cost.
good,"My one up was a quality human being and made coming to work a pleasure. "
good,"Good work life balance.  Filled with some bureaucracy.  Employees friendly. As with most corporations, too many meetings.  Sometimes the bureaucracy would hold up accomplishing tasks."
good,"I was so looking forward to my job but it got old fast. It was more like a family when I was a contractor, but as management left so did the family. I know there needs to be change but this was not the direction I was hoping for."
good,good and friendly environment. They are experiencing loses. so that's  they are selling hospitals and laying of people. they give reasonably good benifits.
good,"Very busy and face paced, there is a lot of turn over so its hard to get anything done.  The company seems very unorganized and everyone works for themselves and not the greater good of the company."
good,"This company operates by buying hospitals and larger health systems. The volume of transactions can be overwhelming, but it's not typically a high-stress job. Deadlines occur occasionally and usually an internal department."
good,"The most enjoyable part would be the pay.The micro management is the worst. Paid time off is one of the perks, Flex schedule , and the Café down stairs."
good,"I would leave the hotel and head to the hospital to meet up with my team. Have a short meeting and deploy out to the areas we were working for the the day. This included deploying new machines and imaging the hardware that met the new requirements."
good,A very large Healthcare organization with a lot going on. The opportunities that are presented come few and far between.
good,"Good job, but little respect for your position.  Few layers of mgt so promotions almost do not exist.  As a biomed, you may be reporting to less educated facilities directors."
good,"Basically what I did at this job was front office work daily. Periodically, I would help work patients up and give injections. But mostly I collected copayments and deductibles, checked patients in and out, answer phone calls, take messages, called in prescriptions if need be, and did medical records."
good,"Being a Meaningful Use project manager was a challenging position. While at CHS I had two concurrent Meaningful Use Implementation projects whic I brought live within one week of one another. I had a hospital in OK and a hospital in FL that I commuted back and forth to every other week. The company had challenging documentation requirements and compressed timelines which required a great deal of flexibility in order to meet goals. I enjoyed working with my team of analyst and business partners, as well as the hospital C suite and nurse managers."
good,On a normal day you average about 20 calls a day ranging from password reset to a switch going down. Can be a little stressful due to helping people that take care of the injured.
good,Management makes it an unpleasant work environment. Overall great company. Great benefits. Great pay. Just need to work on who they allow to manage a team.
good,"Could use better medical benefits packages, all in all good place to work! Wish I’d never quit, pay could be better, management was great, Physicians were great....."
good,Productivity everyday to meet. I have learned a lot about  healthcare with the position I am in. I am very successful with work that I am given on a daily
good,"This company was great to work for, however, there was no room for advancement. The people I worked with were some of the friendliest group I have ever worked with."
good,"CHS promoted within the company, there was room for all employees to grow. an education program (college tuition) was available to anyone who wanted to do better in their careers"
good,My department has a laid back atmosphere. There are no advancement opportunities within my department.  Favoritism is often shown within the department.
good,"It was a very relaxed environment and I was always comfortable reaching out for help. However, after two years I asked for a raise and was denied on account of ""the people at the top."" I found this to be very discouraging and led to my departure of the company. Maybe the CEO should spend less money on ""random"" drug testing and extravagant Christmas luncheons that most employees dread."
good,CHS is a great place to work and learn the compensation just does keep up with position or demand. I moved up from a Service desk analyst taking calls to an HL7 Developer working with two interface engines and the compensation never changed.
good,"During my 35 years at my facility, I have grown beyond my own, perceived limits...I have worn multiple hats...best part of working there? Seeing my co-workers and friends daily...feeling I was contributing to my community...."
good,The most important thing I learned was how to leave work at the door.  It is challenging dealing with collections with today's economic hardships.  I consistently met/exceeded goals set by the company.
good,As a AP Processor my job was easy yet challenging. I loved working with my coworkers and enjoyed the events that Chs did for us. Management could have been a lot better. My department seem to  have a lot of issues with software going very slow and management just not as knowledge as needed to manage the department. Benefits were great. The department could have been structured better.
good,"this is a great environment, friendly people, awesome insurance. I love the office setting and work well with computer programs. The job makes balancing work and home difficult."
good,Leadership lacks involvement in their teams. Compensation is low and bonus structure can definitely use some revamping.
good,Overall CHS is a good place to work.  The PTO/Vacation package is disappointing because it is separate from the sick time and does not add up very quickly.
good,"CHS is a nice company.  Manager and supervisors are understanding.  They offer inservices and information to help with the accuracy of coding.  My manager assist me with different coding and billing issues that I may not understand.  I am also able to communicate with the onsite facility, if needed."
good,Overall great place to work. Fast paced enviroment. The pay was not enough for me.
good,Unfortunately I was trained to do a job I did not get a chance to do because the ground work to implement the system was not put in place before they hired over 40 people to implement their BCMA system consequently leading to layoffs of all who were hired.
good,Excellent coworkers! Head management more worried about making money than safety of patients and staff. Often worked with very high patient load.
good,Very productive place to work at. I had a wonderful group of coworkers to work with. Management was very professional and did a great job trainibg and guiding me succeed.I felt very safe and was working with a great company.
good,"I enjoy working for CHS. I love the people I work with so much so that I have been with the company for more than 5 years, and consider all of my co-workers as friends. The benefits are amazing, the monetary compensation is lacking, however it balances out with the people. Plus, they are very supportive in the community and are always opportunities to volunteer your service."
good,"I really enjoyed my jobs helping patient's understand the process of how their Insurance would be billed and followup with the Insurance companies,I worked on several Hospital Patient account system's for Hospital's across the United States and learned a lot of Different State Law's for billing patient's auto insurance and follow up with health insurance after Auto Insurance Benefits had exhausted"
good,Not much interest in doing anything other than keeping the upper management happy.  Very little interaction between managers/team leaders and workers.
good,Management needs some work but overall a good company I have worked here for years and I like it pay is good and hours are conveint. You have potential to maek really good money
good,"ok place overall, needs improvement in management  - the company is stuck 30 or 40 years behind the rest of the world. No vision and no mission and no sense of purpose, but a great place to clock in, make your money and clock out and go home again at the end of the day"
good,Great place to work great people and friendly staff. The pay was very low for what I was doing. I worked in the cash posting department. They had great benefits because you worked for a hospital.
good,"CHS is not a place to go for career advancement.  Based on salary caps for internal hires, this has been a roadblock for many over the years I've been here."
good,"Hostile work environment, favoritism and cliques."
good,"As such, it is ever changing.  A good place to work, but requires long hours for executive positions.  An excellent beginning position for Medical Assistants, nurses and those new to medical skilled and/or licensed positions."
good,"Promoted to Facility Information Security Officer."
good,Travel is hard but the compensation is competitive.  On the job training is the training style.
good,I originally started at one facility with a great doctor. The company lost their NP at another office 30 min away and told me I would temporarly travel. I worked 2 1/2 days at my original office and then at the other office. Being spread between both places made it hard to be in the right office at the right time for my patients. Some patients traveled to see me regardless of the office.
good,"This company requires you to at your desk working all day long, with very strictly watched 15min breaks twice a day & a 30min lunch break.  A large corporation that owns hospitals all across the USA.  You have the option for very good insurance, but there are no yearly raises."
good,"my director was great, but the communication was not well executed much of the time."
good,"I enjoy being a contractor and traveling. "
good,Decent workplace for corporate environment. Process driven environment and management will give you the necessary tools for you to succeed. Would recommend.
good,Enjoyed working with staff. Nursing. Respiratory. Laboratory. All staff has been courteous.  Some have more vocal personalities and stronger personalities.  People in management  were easy to get in touch with and talk with.
good,I started with HMA as a Senior Project Manager contract position.  HMA was acquired by CHS and the transition was fairly smooth.
good,A very positive atmosphere. The respect the fact that people have families and work with you on your hours. They offer flexible shifts and competitive pay
good,"For two Hospitals--Environment of Care, Emergency Management, Hazardous Materials & Wastes, Medical Equipment, Utilities Management, Emergency Management & Life Safety"
good,"Working from home was a luxury.  As a coder, productivity was/has always been an issue.  Upper management wants quality AND quantity, but it seems in HIM that quantity overrides quality.  Therefore, at times, there's no time for training to help improve quality."
good,"Over all good company to work for. As with most companies, there needs to be some re-evaluation of some management. The benefits with this company are great"
good,"I enjoy my job, but would have to say the management style is poor. It is extremely political and you get advanced by who you know and not the quality of work you put out."
good,Love working with numbers and this job allows me that opportunity.  It is a challenging and competitive working environment.  If you love to work with numbers this is the job for you.
good,It is a fine place to work. Great deal of growth. Processes are fine. Salary is decent enough. People are hard working and have a great deal of character.
good,"Great place to work with a great team.  Like other places I've worked, the numbers are the sole focus at the moment.  The administration team is small, but the number of physicians and patients are growing rapidly."
good,"Great company to work for.  Fun atmosphere.  Paid holidays, good insurance plan.  Room for advancement, they like to promote from within.  But still has a stuffy corporate atmosphere that's to be expected with a big company."
good,"A typical shift would entail setting up the patient room boards for the nursing staff. Also would set up rooms for new admits, answer phones, use Cerner for patient data entry."
good,"With great people and clear vision of responsibilities, this is a great place to work as long as finances are available for your position for long."
good,Enjoy working in the Department of Medicine they are caring and considerate individuals that make my time here a pleasure.
good,"I have been employed for a few years, and I have had growth and learning. I am happy working here"
good,I recommend CHS for anyone searching for a large corporation to step into. You will have plenty of room for growth and advancement. It is a secure place to work and there are many offices which you can transfer to if you wish to pursue a different avenue.
good,"CHS as a company was a great place to work.  The Shared Services Center had its own culture.  Not a bad company to work for at all.  Just wish the advancement opportunists were provided equally to all employees,"
good,Decent pay for work required.  Not a lot of benefits though and not sure about how to advance in the company.  Health benefits are not very good at all.  No extras in benefits
good,"Glad they kept me when they acquired HMA.  They increased my negotiating skills with  training for an outside source.  I thought at the time it was a bad decision though to buy HMA, and it has played out that way over the last 4 years"
good,Decent workplace environment. Higher ups were at times disrespectful to hourly employees. Coworkers seemed to jive well together for the most part. If you were favored by the higher ups you had a better chance of moving up.
good,"I enjoyed the environment and my team, I learned quite a bit from working at CHS. I would recommend anyone with the right experience and skill to apply"
good,"Business office has went from 6 hospitals to over 40 in three years.    This rapid growth has resulted in a dynamic (versus static) environment. Positive aspect is this provides advancement opportunities in newer departments.  "
good,"Culture is conservative yet stressful as the focus is on profit.  Still, I have enjoyed my overall experience with those that I work with through the entire system."
good,"Community Health Systems has a very laid-back work environment. The management is not the best, but everything else is okay regarding the job. I love the fact that you are able to work at your own pace."
good,My time with CHS was filled with adventure and change.  The management are working hard to make CHS a wonderful place to work. The SSC in Franklin is the testing ground for new products to make the work place better.  This makes it crazy at times but the staff are hard workers and dedicated to the company.
good,I only worked her PRN for a limited amount of time. They company was very nice and through and made sure I was familiar with things before sending me out on my own.
good,"Most teams are very close and work well together.  The benefits are above standard and the work is challenging, but not overly challenging.  Upper management is still struggling with certain things to prevent people from leaving."
good,"Working for CHS for over 11 years, I find the company often meets my needs both by challenging projects as well as excellent leadership mentors."
good,"Proficient at improving wireless designs, increasing efficiency and developing solutions for companies and organizations. Possess extensive experience implementing Cisco LWAPP solutions to customers in a variety of vertical markets including healthcare, manufacturing, education, and government. Accomplished at maintaining Hospital IT systems and infrastructure environments on a day to day basis."
good,"A very busy day, co-workers was very helpful.  The hardest part of the job listing to other people problems."
good,"Interesting most days dealing with employees from all over the US."
good,"I only worked at CHS for six months which I came into a back end position as a temp and unfortunately within 3 weeks maybe that position was over and thankfully I was able to transfer to Pre registration. I loved my team and my supervisors although there is certain favoritism played within each team. I hate to actually say this but it is true. Other than that I did enjoy me team the most. The actual position was not bad if you like to talk on the phone, which was everyday. The goal was not crazy although I felt like a lot of the time people would complain about the work load. It was generally 60 outbound calls within a day and a minimum of $1,000 dollars collected from co-pays and other patient responsibilities they would have from the appointments. It overall was not a bad job at all."
good,CHS is a very diversified place to work. There are a lot of different job roles and plenty of work to keep you busy. There are 100+ hospitals and people from all walks of life are included. I would recommend CHS as a great place to learn and grow in the accounting field.
good,A good entry level position for HR/Payroll Shared Services experience. Basic exposure to some of the fundamentals of Human Resources. A good starting point.
good,The hospital was a fun dynamic place to work at one time. I considered it delivering first class heart care with dedicated employees and physicians. The on call staff would travel when called from their homes to the hospital and arrive within 30 min and give outstanding care to patients having a myocardial infarction. I was on that team and I felt very proud to provide that service any time day or night
good,"Good company but going through some changes"
good,"Great work place and coworkers, who mostly are always willing to help. Great benefit package and vacation time. Hard to get advancement unless you are one of the favorites."
good,Great company to work for if you're right out of college. Opportunity to be involved in every aspect of every team project. Doesn't like to promote from within.
good,Working for CHS is OK. I'm training on other types of charts which will help me to learn different types of coding. I''ve been there over a  year and I've had any real issues with the job thus far.
good,"I found the work pace to be moderate with achievable deadlines and goals.  Sometimes lacked focus with changing directions but overall, not bad.  "
good,"Company was very slow to give reviews/pay increases.  I had a great supervisor who helped to provide a good working environment.  I relocated and I did not want to commute to Antioch, so I was able to find another job that did pay better."
good,"People either love or hate this place. It is very fast paced and demanding, which to a lot of people can stress them out. however, for others it keeps them busy."
good,Review projects in Tool and run reports for Senior Leadership.  I have worked closely with Corporate employees and Vendors to provide the best practice of daily activities in hospital and clinic environments.
good,"Work with a good team, they are like family. Have learned that it doesn't hurt to be versatile in many aspects. Like willing to learning different functionalities of other areas of your department and how these jobs effect a project management work of scope or even a go live for a facility."
good,My direct management and most lower level management are excellent at what they do and take very good care of their employees as well as stand behind us when needed.
good," Install all types of computer hardware and peripherals that are typical of a hospital environment"
good,"I participate in conference calls with legal and acquisition teams for upcoming acquisitions.  I work with team members to train, answer questions and assist in prioritizing to get the work done.  I also do the enrollment with Medicare and Medicaid for all the ASC's, IDTF's and Urgent care facilities.  I complete reports on upcoming acquisitions.  We had a large acquisition the first of this year that almost doubled the amount of enrollment that needed to be done."
good,"Days were very busy, Management is always there for answers and guidance."
good,Typically my day is just completing the tasks I am assigned.  I enjoy my coworkers and my work.
good,"As a CHS Analyst I traveled almost every Monday to one of their many hospitals in all parts of the country.  I usually returned home on Fridays to my family.  I have done Workflow Assessments, GAP Analysis, Unit Testing, Integrated Testing, SuperUser and EndUser Training for Radiology, Cath Lab, Physician Portal, HIM and CPOE.  I also supported dozens of golives in multiple areas of the hospitals including Radiology, Cath Lab, Physician Portal, HIM and CPOE."
good,I was able to display all of my leadership and technical abilities on this project. The project demanded expertise dealing with every level of management . Thru leading from the middle I a was able to develop a strong team that would ultimately render a successful project.
good,Looking for a career where I can use my skill set.  Working with CHS was a very good experience and has added to my strengths.
good,Was a very good  position with challenges each day. Huge project with 208 of their hospitals. Completed on time. Would have really like to stay on permanently.
good,"Good Pay, Good balance, bad for internal growth opportunities as they seem to look outward more than inward when new opportunities arise. Know your worth before discussing pay and get hired in at the position that you are ok not growing from."
good,"i have worked for the company for 2 years, while i like the people i work with i dont see advancement. there are people in my department that have been in the same role as i am in for 5+ years and have applied to various positions. there was a significant lay off since i started here that closed 1 of 2 buildings."
good,"Helping the patients get dress in the morning, pick out what they want to wear.  they all be treating the same.  Making every body happy.  Did nobody fell or got hurt."
good,"My department had a great director. I wasn't micromanaged. Come in do your job go home. Not a very lively environment, but you could go to your colleagues for help if needed. Dress code was a little over the top, had to wear tie Mon-Thurs. The travel portion was nice for getting out of the office and seeing new places."
good,"Fast paced environment "
good,Pay was good. Benefits were good. Had no real way to advance forward. PTO was slow to accumulate. Coworkers were great. Management was pretty relaxed.
good,And this is not how a typical day should began or end. Teamwork is most important in order for a company to succeed. Each person focused on their own production requirements.
good,"I love what I do, and I'm given the skills and resources to do the greatest job I can day in and day out. There are tough days but it's worth coming in and having friends and coworkers who care about you."
good,"I would recommend working here! Good place to work and grow, the people you work with are amazing and the environment is great. I just felt it was somewhere I wouldn't spend a lifetime career."
good,"Overall CHS was a great place to work. It was a very fast paced environment and we received constant training to stay up to date. The pay was very good in the beginning but the amount of the raises were enough for coffee in the morning. You are micro-managed but as long as you stay up to what you are supposed to do you don't have to worry about management. Benefits were OKAY if you went to a CHS hospital, but as soon as you went to a regular doctor the insurance didn't cover anything. If you had a procedure done at the facility it was completely written off. I would still be with the company if they wouldn't have sold the hospital that I was working in. The only way that I would have been able to stay in the company is if I was willing to travel 3-5 days a week. This is not traveling with in a reasonable distance you may have had to go to another state."
good,I have enjoyed my time at CHS but due to current financial issues they have been laying employees off. They have also been over working good employees to make up the employees that have left the company due to uncertainty of employment.
good,"Love doing my job, workload changes daily. Get incentives. most holidays off. I do not want to leave company, but too many changes. there are chances to advance."
good,"I did learn a lot but also noticed that for a company of this size, communication was lacking and the different departments within the IT division did not work well together.  Management seems to keep the departments in individual silos and seperated.  This caused a lot of confusing and frustration that I saw on my teammates on a daily basis."
good,"I work as a DTP Analyst.  I am the first to see accounts after overnight cash postings.  Submit adjustments, request corrected claims, return accounts to Collectors that require in depth study."
good,Pleasant and professional work environment. Great team of analysts to work with. I learn something new everyday and job never gets boring.
good,"Contract assignment- Nice work surroundings... Flexible start hours if they were needed."
good,overall company very good to work for. I am looking to transfer to larger hospital
good,"When I first arrive to my desk, I clock in and get ready to begin my day. I access all programs on my computer that I will be needing for my work for the day. I then begin accessing the accounts I will be working on and work on them until I am finished with the task. It is usually pretty quiet all the desk areas are in a closed cubicle. Everyone in the department I work for works at their own pace and only goes to another cublcle whe nsomeone has questions. I do enjoy the people I work with they are all friendly."
good,"I have definitely learned how to  multi-task, time managemnt,  learned how to manage staff and pts. Love my coworker...family!  I love my job, days and hrs."
good,"Every job has their pros and their cons. This is, overall, a great place to work though. They offer you flexible scheduling Monday through Friday anywhere between 6am and 9pm."
good,"In Customer Service we took 50 to 60 calls per day from customers. (patients, hospital business office, Insurance companies, and law offices) We were responsible for taking payments, resending claims, correcting or updating patient information into the system, Insurance verification. "
good,"Satisfactory environment, Some of the people there were nice and some were exeptional. Paid time off for appoitments and PTO.  Salary was a little low considering the type of work I done."
good,Great Culture and Teamwork.  Rewarding to be able to work in healthcare and be part of the talent acquisition that is the front line to a great patient experience.
good,Learned many skills during my employment. Had good supportive team members. My director saw potential in me and provided encouragement. Mutual respect thrived in my department.
good,"I loved my job until changes took place due to financial situation with the Corp.  I don't mind change and will do whatever is given, but unhappy with current situation."
good,Community Health Systems is a wonderful company to work for. The culture is non bias and management has been very flexible in adhering to employee concerns.
good,"There were a lot of changes in the 3-4 years I was at CHS.  The company didn't have a reduction in work force despite the declining stock prices and difficult financial times.  Most of the employees were loyal as a result."
good,"the job is cool "
good,Good place to work - transfer center- transferring patients from one facility to another.  Hardest part of job is working with people who sometimes are not professional.
good,CHS is a good company to work for. I've worked for them for over 10 years. Revenue Cycle is very demanding and takes away from your work/life balance.
good,"Its a great paying job if you are looking to just make a check. However management treats you like a # and you advancement is based on favoritism, but it does pay the bils."
good,"The company provided a great work environment with lots of training and career development. Very supportive and a great team building environment. "
good,A typical day at work would be to complete your assigned task in a timely matter. Each day you expected to meet a certain production level with quality work.
good,I would seek for auto and liability insurance depending on the hospital and state laws in order to file an lien. The most difficult part of the job is trying to make sure you follow the guideline for each facility and state laws.
good,"This is a dynamic company.  People are, overall, good to work with--reliable, sharing their knowledge, working in team environments."
good,"Pleasant co-workers, never boring, large learning curve.  Training could be improved.  Time went very fast because I was constantly busy. A lot of overtime...sometimes too much.  Enjoyable atmosphere. Company did different things for the employees to show appreciation such as bring in a yogurt truck for all employees, provide pizza parties when goals are met and let us off early sometimes on the day prior to a holiday."
good,Nice place to work. Lacking job position competitiveness such as work from home jobs. KSA's should never be compromised to place or promote friends.Nice place to work. Lacking job position competitiveness such as work from home jobs. KSA's should never be compromised to place or promote friends.
good,"I appreciate many aspects of my position at CHS. There is a lot of autonomy and positive reinforcement for your effort. Overall, I am pleased with this experience."
good,"a typical workday consist of restocking meds and mixing iv solutions, I learn a lot of new drugs on a daily and what they are used for. My co workers are a bit slow and I do have to pick up their slack most of the time only reason why I am considering other job opportunities. there is nothing hard about this job other than the paperwork seems neverending."
good,"Given extra days off each year, granted by CEO. Early dismissal the day before some holidays, sometimes. Treated well and work hard."
good,Work from home which allowed for more interaction and stability for my children.
good,Unable to provide this information at this time. I am unable to share while employed here.
good,"A typical day for me would consist of monitoring daily vaulting scripts. Adding tape to physical and virtual libraries for backups. Trouble shooting missed and failed backups of windows, linux, and AIX servers."
good,"Yes, its healthcare and you will work hard, but corporate stays out of your personal life and allows you to function for the local community."
good,I loved working at community. They paid there staff well and treat you well. I worked night and it wore me down 7 on 7 off. Pay was great for the area.
good,Workday was good. A typical workday was making minor repairs. It was a clean working environment. Management was good and working hours was good. Pay could be more competitive.
good,Naples is a great place to live. So I have very happy to work at CHS. I would have stayed forever but they closed the office. Most of the first line management was great. The upper management was unaware of the importance of the work we were doing. After they terminated all of us their stock to a big hit.
good,Enjoyed working with company and most managers were wonderful. Very friendly and help with any issues you have. I left company because my manager was unethical and unprofessional.
good,Enjoyed the overall environment. Very laid back atmosphere and and incentives each month was attainable. Flexible work schedule and could make show time up if you were late for work.
good,"Community Health Systems is one of the best place i had a chance to work, people at management was OK. The children there are amazing and funny. I learned a lot there."
good,"I enjoy working for this company. I have a relatively flexible schedule, and the productivity demands are not unreasonable. I get a long with management, and I feel there are opportunities to grow."

Our management team is strong and fair.  I am a Cash Service Specialist which is Accounts Receivable. I handle Bank Reconciliations, work closely with Accounting Managers on a monthly basis, prepare and post Insurance and Patient payments and assist AR Managers with identifying payments that could reflect bad debt.

OT was offered, sometimes mandated, along with working weekends. Some holidays mandated or voluntary. Benefits were good, PTO, and CEU's offered."
good,The area that I currently work in has a great atmosphere. I believe in the company overall and hope to advance if another opportunity does not come along elsewhere.
good,The people that work at CHS are great.  The dress code is business professional.  Men have to wear ties at only the headquarters location.  All of the other buildings are casual.

They work with the employee in improving skills to perform the job to the best of the employees ability. The company as a whole seems very employee friendly. I enjoy what the company has to offer. The benefits are a little pricey, but affordable. The vacation time increases with employment time, so that's a plus. I would recommend this company  to a friend."
good,Working for CHS was a great life experience. I learned quite a bit about the medical industry and definitely would love to advance further in the medical field.
good,"I don't mean this in a bad way. No company is perfect and no company has all wonderful bosses and happy employees, it's just not a realistic expectation. I find it amusing that all the negative reviews of the company on this site, regardless of how short and uninformative, have lots of ""Yes - this was helpful"" marks, but none of the positive, more informative reviews have those. It just goes to show that, by and large, people who are taking the time to go find places to review their company are more often there to make sure others know how terrible their experience was."
good,"This is an awesome place to work, however the management is not the greatest, It is a call center environment where it consists of sitting down all day receiving inbound and making outbound calls.  I must say with no previous experience in healthcare, I did learn and retained a lot of info.  I would recommend this job for college students pursuing a career in healthcare management."
good,"fair"
good,"One fo the best places I ever worked. Nice, professional atmosphere. Great Benefits, including free healthcare at any CHS facility. Only reason I left was because of some severe family problems at the time, and I lived 2 hours away from the office."

good,"For the first three and half years worked as a mailclerk and took in insurance payments and patient payments.  A typical day would start with the mail being sortedand opened.  It would then be deposited by rote on computer.  This was an all day job.   Then the company decided to outsource our mail up north.  So at that time the job was divided and I was made Receptionist/Assistant to the HR Manager and still did the Patient Payments.  So basically I had two full time jobs by then and with a new HR Manager added I also had two people I was answering to.  I was also in charge of the supply closet for 200 people so I stayed busy.  Until this change I had been working twelve hour days for three and half years and this brought me to eight hour days which was a very good change."
good,Very Good Company to work for and the employees are always respected and appreciated throughout the year with activities and banquets
good,Each day was different.  I was never bored or looking for something to do.  My co-workers were very professional but we also respected each other.  Everyone would help when a deadline needed to be met.

good,company gives very good employee benefits.the Pay is reasonable.
good,Dynamic company with about 209 hospitals at the moment implementing meaningful use compliance relating to new healthcare requirements.
good,Patient focused environment
good,"Love the company and all of the people that I get to interact with on a daily basis. I live to ensure that the facilities daily operations have 100% availability. The downside is that there are no advancement opportunities available for individuals with tenure due to pay scale. No matter how much you go above and beyond, the next level is still out of site because of the salary ranges."
good,Through my past 4 years here at Community Health Systems. I have learned so much. I started as a file clerk in the cash posting department. After I worked by 3 month probationary period. I was promoted to Credit Card Specialist and made a integral part of the cash posting team. I learn a lot about cash posting and then graduated after a year to the collections department. Where I have been located for the past 3 years. I have learned the ins an outs of billing and collections.
good,Great leadership at the executive level. Open to listening to employees and taking suggestions to improve the quality of healthcare for the hospital patients.
good,"I loved my job, I loved what I did. HOWEVER they always made it feel at a moments notice you could be on the chopping block no matter how hard you worked or how much you tried and received notes from corporate saying how great you were doing... one mistake and you could be gone."

good,Productive work place with good employee relations. They often have employee raffles for moral and allow the employee's to have Pot Luck's and food days.
good,I loved my years with this company I would still be there if my hospital wasnt sold I enjoyed my boss she was amazing and caring and very supportive to see me do better
good,"Do not apply if you do not like to work and are only in it for a paycheck. Benefits are good but health insurance could be much better for working for a hospital. Continuous rotation of patients or phone calls could tire you out by the end of the day. Meeting new people is enjoyable. Some coworkers are all about team work while others are all about their seniority and about what everyone else is doing. Management is hard to reach most times and sometimes feels as though the department needs to be reorganized.  If you are looking for advancement and you are not a nurse or a doctor then do not apply here. The raises are very little, for example staff that have been here 30 years are not making much more than someone new."

good,Visit patients room for secondary Insurance. If patient has non I would screen patient to see if they they would qualify for government program. If the patient was diagnosed with a terminally ill condition and was uninsured I was responsible for applying for disability for the patient.
good,"The decision to leave Physicians Regional Hospital after all those years of services has not come easy. I love this Company as part of my own family. This job – the duties of this job, the people I have gotten to know over the years.  However, I had  planned an adventure as an Adult Nurse Practitioner for many months, and the time  arrived to depart. Moving forward with my life after 2 years of successful hard work with my studies. I enjoyed my job and the company."

Working at CHS has been an amazing stepping stone in kicking off my career in the Medical Billing and Coding field.
