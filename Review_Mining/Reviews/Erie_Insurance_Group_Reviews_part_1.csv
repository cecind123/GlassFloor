rating,review
bad,I would not recommend this place to anyone. Very poor working environment.  They give you poor understanding of your job description. If you have an opinion they don't take it at all.
bad,"Managers are superficial,  plays favorites, treats people mean. They constantly push you then reprimand you when you miss a detail from pushing for completing more calls."
bad,I had previously worked for Geico and truly did not realize what a wonderful job I had at Geico until I resigned there and came to ERIE. The training of the new ECC claims system was a disaster! GEICO would have spent a full week which they actually did on the rollout of their new system. The work load was extreme as employees were resigning and the company was very slow to replace them. No one seemed to care!
bad,"This is the worst organization to work for.  The Nepotism is the primary managing doctrine. Mid Level Management and Supervisor Level do not recognize employee expertise.  If you are not in ""Their Clique"" you get assigned all the worst assignments."
bad,"This job is great if you live in erie. You must fit in with their ""in crowd."" I worked there for almost a year under contract."
bad,Erie Insurance would have been a great place to work had it not been for the supervisor on 3rd shift. Absoulutely the worst person to put in charge of others. She wouldn't train you and you were left to your own devices. Beware of 3rd shift jobs there!
bad,"I have never been in a job where they punish you to go to thr bathroom. In other jobs they expect for you to start working at your designated time, not early or not late, on time. At Erie Insurance you have to be there at least 10 minutes in order to have your computer programs running but you mever get paid for that tine at all. When they're system errors, like your phone didn't go off (call center) it is your fault and it counts agains you. They give you some type of paid for sick leave but also if you use it you will get punished, whixh if at the end, if you are sick more than 5 days in a half then uou get a verbal warning, which means you get can't go up position and then you don't get a raise either."
bad,Management let’s people go and refuses to bring in temps or any type of help with existing inventories. Expected to work overtime but can’t get authorization to be paid for overtime. Management has unrealistic expectations and no matter what you do the head manager makes the working environment hostile
bad,"You have to work all the time.  Managers don't care how many hours you work they just want the job done.  You don't get paid any overtime!  All you do is work and when you ask for help the managers get upset with you.  You get the work of 3 people put on 1 person.  If you like to work all the time and not get paid for it then this is the job for you.  If you like to see your family, then don't work for this employer."
bad,"The management wasn't very helpful, the most enjoyable part of my job was learning new stuff. The hardest part was studying and taking the Insurance tests for the state."
bad,"It was an extremely stressful position. You are expected to be yelled at by the customer, which happened frequently. The supervisor was involved in an inappropriate relationship with one of their team members. Very much back stabbing. Most employees did not do their jobs based on lack of support from management. Beware.  Much gossip and infighting. Not typical of a Fortune 500 company at all."
bad,"I worked here for 16 years, the last 5 years was a never ending cycle of lies, sabotage & retaliation from my supervisor. Upper management is a joke, I was never able to express the way I was being treated because I was immediately told I was the one in the wrong. Human Resources & Employee Relations automatically back up supervisors regardless of what I was being put through every single day. It was extremely shocking to me that a company of this stature allowed this happen to one of their employees & not honoring their own Code of Conduct. After dealing with this for so many years it really took a tole on me & I chose to quit. It is still upsetting that this supervisor got away with everything & I was the one that had to walk away to save the last bit of sanity I had left after years & years of bullying."
bad,"The claims environment is ultra stressful, a lot of micro management.  No one is happy with their job. Nepotism runs rampant --- they tell you they want to hire family. Management is secretive and closed minded.  "
bad,The work and tasks are interesting with the potential for high achievement of goals if management were more supportive.  Most of thier management style is hands off mentoring and mostly directive with little room for ideas and suggestions.
bad,"Corporate rhetoric and training stresses 'Above All in sERvIcE' but that ethic has been lost over the last few years.  A great company with great pay & benefits, but expectations are somewhat confusing."
bad,"Work life balane is terrible even though it’s promoted as important. "
bad,"Be on your toes here, while the atmosphere is all smiles, you don't want to get to comfortable.  Managers have lied in the past and attempted to entrap employees into admitting they did something that they actually didn't."
bad,"I cannot speak for the rest of the company but this is an awful place to work in IT. The company uses ITIL standards and they are not implemented correctly. One of the biggest struggles in this place is trying to get your work completed without having to jump through a million hoops. Trying to find a competent resource is harder than finding a needle in a hay stack. In fact I'm pretty sure more than half the IT staff was promoted up from the mail dept."
bad,Worked a temporary position here but getting hired as a full time employee doesn't happen unless you're in with the right crowd. You have to know someone on the inside that your tight with that can get you in or no luck getting hired.
good,This job was great until all the job changes and authority became personal in a professional environment
good,"Hard to create an avenue for a career within the company unless you knew someone.  Constantly was told ""just be lucky to have a job"" for the years I was employed with them."
good,"Full work load shortly after starting. The people working there are great, but procedures, programs, and process are severely dated."
good,"The branch level of management - or lack thereof - is the single most disappointing factor about this employer. They seem to have limitless initiative and resource to spend on outside applicants, but no interest or plan of advancement in place for the internal candidates."
good,"Many differing reviews here but the common theme of where those are not satisfied is claims.  The workloads are high pressure with far too much incoming and no time to do anything but move from one claim to another, including one tedious system-related tasks to the next due to outdated and time-consuming requirements or system limitations.  Too much clerical time is consumed when one could be actually working and analyzing their claims.  You are given no ""breather"" to spend time to work on existing claims load.  Staffing is inadequate to keep up with the company's goal of being Above All in Service.   The company has a great reputation and those working there are people who care, but they need more help, or a change to allow adjusters to have more time to do quality work for their customers and for the company.  Management is a toss-up, you don't know what you get from one to the next.  Co-workers all seem to genuinely care about their work and service, but many voice being under-appreciated with little in terms of praise, and only when you do something wrong are you provided input.  As one other reviewer posted, ""Gotcha""."
good,"Erie Insurance is a fine company to work for.  They have a good amount of upward mobility depending on your department and the work can be mostly satisfying."
good,I am able to work from home.  Most of the time I just work in the yard or watch TV.  I am not sure how long they will allow this but it is great.  My work life balance is the best.  I even get a company car that I can use for vacation without having to pay for my fuel.  I would recommend anyone that wants to not really have to work and get paid to be an at home adjuster.
good,"Woefully understaffed, company is in growth mode and can not staff adequately, hence so many open positions. Great benefits. Local management is under much stress from agency force, home office management, and low employee satisfaction surveys. Pay is low for the amount of stress. No overtime pay. Customer base is difficult. Computer system is difficult to grasp and cumbersome. My advice, switch careers;  in Richmond - Fairfax corridor, the environment for property claims is difficult and the pay is low. Find a more rewarding profession with less aggravation, Erie Insurance, like its competitors in the area, do not pay enough to live well in the area. If still interested, talk to current employees, they will confirm this."
good,Extremely stressful work environment with hard to maintain workload.  Majority of management not really helpful.  Low salary compared to the other larger insurance companies.
good,Ok place to work.  Volume was high.  Management lacked knowledge especially in the area of coverage.  Benefits were good compared to other similar companies.
good,It was not an exceptionally bad place to work. I just found no enjoyment there. It didn't seem like anyone there especially enjoyed there jobs either.
good,"Company is a small to mid-sized company. I was there many many years back and at that time pay was substandard and lots of office politics, favoritism, spying on us literally from behind cubicles by management, constantly too many meetings and expectations for work production still required  regardless of time away from desk, constant phone interuptions"
good,Management prefers younger workers and slights anyone over 40.  Good place to work as long as you fit their ideal age.  Supervisor actually told me that maybe I was too old for the job
good,I work in the claims department. Nothing exciting about the job. Typical work week is part time hours and taking claims. Part timers aren't really included in much that goes on during normal business hours.
good,I was told I would work a mixture of property and liability claims. It ended up being mostly property and little liability. They set unrealistic turn around times where you are stressed out all the time because of the clock. Lots of relatives working there. Pay not that great. Erie needs to streamline and not be so micromanaged.
good,"Job is very interesting but very demanding. Management is average at best. Amount of claims is very demanding and can eat up work/life balance. A property Adjuster works mainly 60-70 hours per week, but only being compensated for 40 hours."
good,"good culture with company, supports work life balance"
good,They give you too much work to do but do not care and want you to speak up if you get swamped. For overtime they got stricter on it and expect you to take hours off the following day after you already have made appointments and cannot get this said time.
good,"Good job, good people to work with and for. The work was a bit mundane at times but we always had a good time. Management was probably the best I've ever had at any job. Work was usually in a cubicle setting."
good,"Employees are generally friendly and helpful. However, the corporate culture does not have a strong sense of consequence and politics appear to be the major motivation."
good,Full-time hours with overtime options during busy season. Family familiar company with many parents supervising their relations. Great opportunity for involvement in the city projects.
good,"As a clerical person, you will spend most of your day on the phone getting talked down to or yelled at because of something someone above you did, the calls come from the agents, medical providers, lawyers, restoration services, body shops, and people insured with Erie. The adjusters are usually not available to take calls and the person on the phone rarely wants to leave a message most likely because they've already left one. When not on the phone you will need to attempt to keep up with you own work, help other clerical workers, and try to explain to adjusters why you can't do what they are asking you to do, then defend yourself to your supervisor as to why you can't do the task. management is generally relaxed and apathetic, they will do what they need to do to get you to go away but that's about it. Erie suffers from a rather bad case of Ivory Tower syndrome, ever event and special happening is held in home office in Erie PA and while they do offer invites to the other branches, neither branch or H.O. is willing to foot the bill for travel expenses."
good,"Workers can be great, but it is always a stressful and fast paced environment. Constant phone calls, barely time to make it to break or lunch. Everyday there are new rules to follow when filing claims. The workplace is always in a constant state of change."
good,"Typical day at work was assisting customers internally and externally."
good,"lots of learning at ERIE."
good,"ERIE Insurance is a well-established insurance company that has a high profile in its home city.  It's enjoyable to work there.  The corporate culture stresses service excellence and strives to reward it.  The drawback to working there are the IT problems, which are many.  It can be frustrating to work there sometimes, because their IT network is old, weak and built like patchwork."
good,Not for an outsider who would like to explore the highest tide in his/her career.
good,My typical day at work was to come in and work on job tickets. Calling clients and setting up times with them to work on thier computer issues. Overnight computers that are in working condition so clients can get back to work with little down time. Fixing computer hardware and installing software per company standards. I learned a lot of new things working here as some of the computers and laptops I have never worked on before. Management and co-workers were always willing to help out on any new situation. The hardest part of my job there was keeping up with so many tickets we were so busy and under staffed it was hard keeping up with everything and properly documenting everything correctly.
good,"I was actually an office assistant to a specific agency. I worked for the Agent, not entirely directly for the company."
good,"I respectfully decline to give my personal views. "
good,Experiencing the position of print operator 1 was fun and supervisor was great. Co-workers was helpful. Hardest of the job is to make sure paper and setting is correct and do not want to waste paper.
good,As a BA at the ERIE my main focus was working with the business units to triage production problems or eliciting requirements for data projects.  I learned at ERIE that it's important to keep growing and give back to your community.  My current work group is very talented we have great synergy and work well together as a team.  The hardest part of the job is slowing down at times since business intelligence is a new and growing field some of our customers aren't ready for the new technology.  The most enjoyable part of being a BA is collaborating with my team and customers to deliver quality reporting solutions.
good,"I was somewhat limited in my career path at Erie due to the fact it was just a small claims office and i was unable to relocate to the home office."
good,Not too organized but great place to be especially to start your career. Great platform. They will support your growth but no travel to IT tech conference.
good,"Currently part of Prod Support Team, you get to work on multiple systems.Has hectic schedule but the day is lightened with the amazing people around. Feels like family."
good,Typical day tends to be very phone extensive. Handle a lot of calls and a lot of claims on a daily basis. As with any insurance type job there are times where you are speaking to individuals on their worst day so it can be tough at times.
good,"The benefits were good as well as pay, management is average and the atmosphere is pleasant. position was monotonous and boring."
good,"Great people, nice company to work for. A little unorganized but they manage to get things done.If you are looking into insurance then this will be probably one of the best companies for you to join."
good,Great place to work.  Consistent hours and good pay.  Positive work force.
good,"As a supervisor in the Material Damage Department, would have to audit uploaded appraisals, handle incoming difficult customer calls and offer positive solutions. Daily coaching and mentoring with assigned staff through 1:1 conversations, performance evaluations and feedback through claims activity.  The job was rewarding as I had the opportunity to offer assistance to customers who needed guidance with their claim.  I also tried to make an impact with my staff and give them positive recommendations where coaching opportunities were detected.  Being in the claims department, it created some difficult incidences at times.  Customers become emotionally involved with their claims and you can only empathize and sympathize with them and help them through the processes. At times, as as supervisor, you too feel the pain of the customer and you too become emotionally involved.  I have learned to handle one issue at a time, give 100% to each matter and always address the customers needs.  The customer must be able to trust you through the entire claim and feel that you have their best interest in mind.  This can only be accomplished through active listening ,responding to their questions and offering positive feedback in the process."
good,"I learned how to communicate with customers and authority, money handling and inventory skills. I enjoyed the customer interactions and co-workers were social and very friendly."
good,The last two years since the new manager took over have seen a lot of employees leave .  It seems like people are being forced to quit or retire.  I am hoping to hang on until retirement but the workload is way too much.  They won't replace people when they leave so we are doing the work of two or three people. Now they are sending a lot of our work to PA office. There are rumors of downsizing and centralizing our jobs.
good,"Erie is a great company, they offer fantastic benefits and life/work balance. They are very focused on their work culture, being very inclusive and family oriented."
good,Erie is a company that is still small enough to value each employee. Benefits are excellent and Erie has a genuine care for the communities that it's offices are located in
good,"ERIE provides you with great compensation, along with great benefits that enable you to grow personally, as well as professionally. The company culture is okay."
good,Long and stressful days with alot of phone calls the people there are good but it can be a difficult environment at times. Management is good and the benefits are good.
good,"I answer many phone calls and emails with questions about claims. "
good,Erie is a good company overall with supportive coworkers. All most all of the company employee's started as temps. However the company currently has a hiring freeze on for temps and they don't offer their temps benefits or raises so becoming an employee is key. The company has a good divide of seasoned employees and the younger generation looking to become seasoned employees. Most employees stay with the company for their entire careers. The most enjoyable part of the job for myself are the coworkers and working with the public. The hardest part is never knowing if you will have a job as the company is going through changes and jobs are up in the air at the moment. Management is always supportive but they also maintain a level of quietness which can cause frustration amongst employees. But overall once you are in you are in for life as they are a very loyal company. I would recommend Erie to anyone looking for a career.
good,Great company to work for out of college and long term. The people there are very friendly and hard working. Management is great and very helpful. Hardest part of the job is maintaining a good schedule at all times.
good,Erie Insurance supports a good work-life balance.  Employees are respected.  Erie promotes innovation and collaboration.  There is a unique culture where everyone does their best to help our customers.  The management opportunities are few and succession planning is poor.
good,"In the 12 years that I worked for Erie Insurance, I learned a great deal about the insurance industry.  In addition, they offer a great benefits package."
good,Good work/life balance
good,"id love to go back there, it's what gives Erie natives without a degree a glimmer of hope for a life beyond poverty and resentment. truthfully."
good,I worked at Erie Insurance Agency in High School as an Internship for my work based learning course. I really enjoyed it there because it furthered my knowledge in the Business field. On a day to day basis I would just answer calls at the front desk and file things in the back. I enjoyed every part of being able to have my internship there.
good,"Nice place to work.  Benefits good, immediate supervisor nice. Some upper management staff nice. Fun activities and company interest in giving back to the community."
good,"The career path, growth opportunities and process for advancement is clearly outlined at Erie. Opportunities included training online and on the job shadowing. The best thing about Erie is their people and the level of commitment to the Company itself. They have low turn-over and a dedicated Team to help you succeed."
good,"People are friendly here and you can make great friends. Management is a little backwards or they reinvent the wheel constantly, they need to stick with what works."
good,"Erie Insurance is a strong company with a family atmosphere, over 90 years of excellent service and growth.  As an industry leader, they to stay very true to their roots and foster a feeling of prideful connection to the vision of the company founders.  There is a reason they are consistently rated of one of the best company's to work for in America."
good,"I scanned medical bills, Injury, checks, and went through it all to see if any had to be put into a pile of investigation. Which putting it into that pile means we would have to call up the customers and see if their claim number matched the number on the bills."
good,"A typical day at Erie Insurance involves multi-tasking – leadership, consulting, decision making, 	time management, interactions, problem solving/resolving issues promoting s compliance and 	enforcement of company policies and procedures, training among other job responsibilities."
good,"Ok company.  Some departments are treated better than others. pay is good, and they promote from within the company.  Stuck in the past as far as technology."
good,Answering phone calls for inbound clients that are looking to pay their billings. Most of the time it was questions about the policies and how they could schedule their payments.
good,It was a nice place to work but there were not full time positions open at the time. The computer system was relatively easy to learn and the system is used at 3 other insurance companies that I am aware of so so that will give me an advantage to locate another position in my field.
good,I work in claims...which should say everything about why there is no work/life balance. All insurance companies are going to this model and Erie has to do what they must to compete. Benefits are great and I love my co-workers but most people in claims are given 1.5 to 2 times the amount of work they can complete.
good,"This company is a highly family oriented company that provides security, education, and very good benefits."
good,Successful company that treats their employees as good as they treat their customers. Competitive rates and very helpful customer service and claims services. Hours are very comfortable to enjoy life also. The most enjoyable part of this job was the interactions with coworkers and clients.
good,The company has great management. This insurance actually cares about it's customers.
good,"Erie is deeply rooted in a family culture. A typical day of work is challenging and rewarding. I learned that by pushing the envelope and never being satisfied it allowed me to grow and pursue all the opportunities I have attained there. I thoroughly enjoy working with all my team members. I love to learn and my team members have always had a wealth of information to attain, and are always willing to teach. I found that no matter how good one team member is the team is what allows us to achieve goals and make the end product. The hardest part of the job is understanding what the business wants and being able to clearly articulate back to them what they will get. Communication and understanding are the key elements for a smooth project.  The best part of my job is working well with my coworkers to produce a high quality IT product that we can all be proud of."
good,Not much to say with this company.  It was my very first insurance company I work with.
good,caring for the children and making sure they were taken care of.
good,"Erie is a 93 year old company that values tradition, but has identified that it needs to innovate its business model to attract younger talent and compete with the top insurance companies in the industry. The work place is an enjoyable environment. All employees are helpful and a typical day can average 7-8 hrs."
good,"Worked amongst a great group of people with an excellent, fair and caring Supervisor. Company has great work culture, great benefits and throughout the year gives employees bonuses."
good,Erie Insurance promotes a extremely friendly atmosphere. Everyone comes to work willing to help others. Erie Insurance also promotes excellent service to its customers. Be prepared to work extremely hard to satisfy a customer's needs.
good,"Helped in transcribing some of the agent notes."
good,"Erie Insurance is pretty selective in their hiring.  It's not just about filling a position, it's also about how you will mesh with their environment.  Everyone cares about everyone else for the most part."
good,"Good job security, most who work there stay for years. It can be hard to move up because of this, and it also leads to having an older workforce. The work wasn't overbearing and management was too overbearing."
good,The company itself is a wonderful place to work for. The company is great to it's employees. With the company being so big it is hard to move to other departments.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with at Erie. The hardest part of the job was how busy the job was as there was never a slow day.
good,Best place I ever worked. Treated you as family and provided a good stable work place. Would have to go a long way to find a better place to work. Very diversified company. Great environment. Hardest part of the work day was the constant phone interruptions for something not pertaining to my  job but those also were some of the best experiences. I was able to help some one and in turn learn more about the workings of our claim department. The management there gave you the training needed to perform your job gave you their guidelines and as long as you followed them and treated both insureds and claimants as they expected you to; they were there to guide not criticize.
good,What I enjoy about this company is that they do not micro-manage. You know your responsibilities and as long as you accomplish those you will be left to do your job.
good,Great place to work with a great culture. Old school values with employees and customers. great benefits and they take an active role in the communities the offices are based out of
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work. Great team work, fast pace but enjoyable. Learned a lot of computer skills and data entry. I wish I could go back and continue my employment due to I enjoyed my position and it was rewarding for me."
good,"Love my job , the hours are great but i do not make enough money to survive on my own. The company itself is great , along with the rates and coverage options you have. Would stay if i could get more money,,,"
good,"A very pleasant environment to work. My manager has been pleased with my work and I am looking for similar opportunities,"
good,"A typical day at work was handling claims in insurance regarding vehicle accidents.  I learned the ins and outs of handling claims in a timely manner. Management was very professional and understanding.  My co-workers were positive and helpful in the work place. The hardest part just maintaining your work load, but the most enjoyable was all the perks that came along with the job itself."
good,great place to work friendly atmosphere.
good,While working for Erie I learned a lot more about insurance and the difference between companies. I learned so much about commercial insurance. It was great working here.
good,Nice to work with all the team. Good working environment. A lot things to learn and grow.
good,"Typical day at work is very fast paced "
good,The management and the supervisors were extremely helpful with assisting any questions or concerns that any of us had. They made a point to review our quarterly status and ask us if there was anything else that they could do to help us grow as an employee.
good,Erie Insurance provides a great internship program. There is plenty of options and flexibility as well as a potential apprenticeship after the internship is completed. The company culture is amazing and it has a very small town feel.
good,If you enjoy the freedom of working from home and making your own schedule than this is where you want to be.  Erie Insurance does a great job of allowing its remote employees the autonomy to be successful in their district and positions but they also keep you accountable.  The only downside is the ability to move up in the field as there are limited positions available.
good,"Erie insurance is one of the most productive companies that I have worked for.  I  have learned many things in my 24 years working for them.  They are a very large company that employs over 3,000 people in the main office in erie.  They also serve over 200 offices in the United states and foreign companies.  It's a very good employer and they treat employees very well.  They stay up to date on all the present It things and other things that are relevant to a large company."
good,"I hesitate to review this or any company I formally worked for as it may hinder my job prospects in the future. Wording that seems fine to me may be taken differently by someone who is currently working for that company or other companies."
good,Great place to work.  Good benefits.  Job advancement is average.  Supportive leadership.  Growing company.  Variety of positions available to employees.
good,"I would recommend Erie Insurance as a great place to cultivate one's career. As with any employer of this size, there are issues that need to be addressed and resolved. Chief among them, in my opinion, is the need to further diversify the workforce as it is sorely lacking in a number of important dimensions of diversity. Overall, I consider it a great workplace."
good,"Everyone works together on a function team. Many employees wives or children work with the company as well.  The work/life balance is unbeatable, get plenty of time off."
good,"Great company to work for, they reward their employees.  Words of recognition mean a lot. Great job, a lot of hours may not be a job for someone with small children as it takes a lot of your time."
good,Once you have been hired into the company management makes it simple to get promoted. Just perform well and utilize the free education and you will go far.
good,"I had good and bad experiences. I learned a lot and like working there. "
good,The Erie Total Rewards program is superb. The quality of life balance is great and the management cares about employees.
good,Loved working here and the team that I worked with.  This company has a great advancement program and promoting within. I only worked for a temporary assignment but I definitely wouldn't mind working for them again.
good,Great place to work. Wonderful people and nice environment.
good,"The culture at Erie Insurance is a very welcoming one indeed. Whenever I came in as an inter, I was accepted as part of the team and allowed to grow with everyone. They taught me invaluable skills both with different software as well as sharpening my soft skills."
good,"The work load would be insane at times - but not unmanageable. "
good,"I loved working at Erie. Good benefits , Nice office with all supplies you need to do your job. Good people all around you.Beautiful cafeteria  great food and reasonable prices, Choice of eating out on patio or inside."
good,I feel honored to be apart of this awesome company. I can't say enough positive things about the people or the environment. I fell the experience has made me a better person.
good,Very good company to work for. Well established and long tenturrd company. I have been at 2 different locations and very happy. Erie is a very person oriented atmosphere to work in
good,I highly recommend ERIE. I was heartbroken when I had to leave it to move for my husband's job.
good,I loved my career with Erie and would love to work with them again if they moved to Texas!
good,"I enjoy coming to work everyday, for the first time in a LONG time. It is fast paced and my job requires a lot of training. I love the environment and my supervisor and coworkers are great. I do feel that the pay could be higher for the level of complexity and amount of information necessary to learn for the position, but it doesn’t require a degree. The job is harder and more fast paced than other positions with the same pay grade. Aside from that, the room for growth and movement is huge and they promote from within and offer many education options and will reimburse and give bonuses for completing insurance courses. They have a pension program and benefits are inexpensive and start day one. Service is the highest priority. I love it there, highly recommend getting a job there and don’t ever plan on leaving until I retire."
good,"Erie Insurance is an A+ employer. Like employment at any company, you will get from it only what you put into it. It is by far the most employee-centric company I've experienced in my career. They really do care about the employees, Agents, and policyholders."
good,Very easy going and I enjoy the 2nd shift hrs. The benefits and pay are great. If I ever need anything my Supervisor will get it. I clean all the cubicles and empty all trash and recycled items and clean bathrooms and clean around the building and do some minor Landscaping.
good,I worked there for 15 years.  Every company has its issues but this one truly did a great job developing it's employees and hiring from within.  They had a great structure when I was there.
good,ERIE was awesome to work for during the summer internship! Everyone was so friendly and open to helping new employees. There are a ton of opportunities to network and meet with leadership throughout the company.
good,"As an employee, you are truly a member of the Erie family. Unfortunately my time there was short (26 months) as I retired and moved out of their footprint. If you ever have the opportunity to work for this company, you need to take it!"
good,Was a really great company to work for. I would go back if I was given the opportunity. Great work environment overall. I would recommend anyone to apply for this company.
good,"It was the best job I've ever had. Awesome company from CEO to clerical. If we hadn't moved, I'd still be there, until I retired. Helping the customer was the first priority. It was nice to actually go to work in the morning and see the smiles of co-workers and supervisors."
good,"very welcoming, family oriented environment. Supervisors are always willing to work with you to make sure your work-life balance is great. They push education a lot.
