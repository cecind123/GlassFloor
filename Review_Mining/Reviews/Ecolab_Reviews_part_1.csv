rating,review
bad,No support or backing for employees in field. Management does not communicate well with employees or customers. Company only cares about profits and not longevity of customer retention. Toxic culture.
bad,No te toman en cuenta para nada y los que encargados de cuentas nunca ven tu trabajo.
bad,"Terrible culture people"
bad,"such a revolving door of upper management that supervisors are corrupt  and crooked, the rules are made as need full of falsifications to suit there needs  at the moment"
bad,It is a bad place to work where the employees make your job hard and they show favoritism towards the workers.the employees that been there a while it’s hard for them to get there raises
bad,"Working for Ecolab takes over your life, they expect you to be available 24/7 even though I had a part time position. Also you will need a spare room to store all of the spare parts that you are expected to repair/replace for a food safety auditing role."
bad,2 kisinin yapmasi gereken işi tek basıma asgari ücretle yaptim
bad,"Ecolab en la ciudad de Los Mochis Sinaloa es deplorable, te contratan con la promesa de un sueldo agradable y después te cae de sorpresa que no es nisiquiera la mitad de lo prometido."
bad,"It was a horrible experience,  and one i am not proud of. The people and backstabbing was unimaginable.  I left because they didnt support field sales at all."
bad,"Terrible place to work."
bad,"Management is unrealistic, drive hundreds of miles a day. Family life doesn’t exist. Do not recommend. Was promised the world but when it comes down to the fire they don’t back it up."
bad,"RUN-- poor management. if your not part of the click, you don't succeed. sneaky managers make promises they never keep. insurance is high. hr does nothing to help"
bad,"First of all it takes about 2-3 months to get hired in. It’s very unorganized. The plant is in Wisconsin but majority of the office workers are in Minnesota so if you have and issue about anything you have to email someone wait 2-3 days to get a response. Also they use intimidating methods to get the rules across not a write up, warning, just force. It’s going into the next month and I haven’t received any funds for the last I had to send emails to people in Wisconsin and in Minnesota when I told my supervisor he said he would get on it but every time I brought it up it was like he had forgotten every time"
bad,"They work you every Friday, 50 hour weeks and endlessly raise the rate, extremely fast paced. No air, and you can’t breath. Everyone is expected to be a trainer and do not receive raises for being trainers. New hires are treated better then employees that have been there for years. Coaches egg on fights and gossip along with assembler workers. Endless drama and clicks. High school  like environment, no  no growth"
bad,Multiple times I’d loose money off my checks because upper management gave away free product so that can have party or just can’t crunch the numbers right.  Just not worth it. I moved on and make way better living with better people
bad,"Wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. You have no life you are always chased when can you go here when can you go there. They want numbers and quality, you can't have both. Look elsewhere best thing I did was leave."
bad,"To many responsibilities, no Support from Management. Keep raising prices  Not for everyone . You will work a lot of hours and do a lot of driving . They also require a GPS driving app"
bad,"You’ll be constantly working, either in the field or at home. It’s never ending, unrealistic budget to make each month. You’ll have extremely needy customers calling you all hours of the day or night."
bad,"Stressful place to work. New Management that has no clue what there doing, shady co-workers that talk bad about other people behind there backs and try to get people they dont get along with fired."
bad,"Everything I was told in my interview was a lie.  They only care about taking business away from competition, not helping existing customers.  They lost Aramark and Compass on a corporate level due to their insane price structure for their products and services so the marching orders became ""take their business"" at very opportunity.  If you can't take business from the competition, they don't want you.  No matter if you are exceeding your budget, hitting sales goals, and taking incredible care of your existing customers, they only care about new business."
bad,"Very poor management, company does not care about their employees. No structure or organization. They will pressure and force you to comply with their business needs"
bad,"The point system is horrible. Don't work here if you have kids, "
bad,The work was all shifts. mainly Monday through Friday. Some weekends. We were always on call. The area was a 100 mile range. We had to help other service technicians when ever they required it. We worked with caustic chemicals.
bad,"As a woman you are treated very poorly. They work you like a dog continually pile the work on.Make tonnes of unfilled promises.All male upper management have it pretty easy. They do not care about employees and have no loyalty, you are a robot not a person. American owned, Canada is constantly scrambling to get updated systems are archaic."
bad,"Awful company to work at, outdated management methods, teamwork skills lacking, overall depressing workplace. No support to technicians, sent off for irrelevant training, waste of time."
bad,Do not get brainwashed by the management. This is a good place to get trained in the corporate sales world. The career part of this company has diminished.
bad,"I had a DM who was a control freak, megalomaniac who was prejudice and an absolute jerk! He lied thru his teeth with everything and always blamed everyone else for his screw-ups!"
bad,"Management is terrible. they constantly Micro-management with out spending time in the departments to try and figure out how things actually work. They preach safety, until it has a production impact."
bad,Ongelooflijk slecht behandeld vanaf het eerste uur. Ze wilden niet dat ik een dame ging vervangen die van dezelfde bureau als ik kwam (mt&v Finance B.V.). De dame zelf zat al 2 jaar daar gedetacheerd en heeft collega's gevraagd om mij ook weg te jagen zoals mijn voorgangers.
bad,"Terrible leadership, worst contract engagement in my 15 year career. No checks and balances for managers/leaders...they can get away with anything; very difficult work environment across all the teams I worked with"
bad,"They have a system of having backup hires ready to go because most Account Managers only last 6 months.   Play games with your ""salary"" and ""commission"".   Assigned a territory, yet you are constantly pulled out to do work in other territories because that account manager quit and it takes 3 months to get the new guy up to speed.  In the mean time you have to service his accounts.   You will be told Account Managers are in ""sales"" in reality you are a service man.  Your job is to repair broken machines, you are dispatched via text messages, there are no real sales involved, yet your total income is affected by company forces beyond your managers control."
bad,"the worst job I've ever had. no time off at all. when you are off, you're not really off. you constantly get emails from managers, your accounts or whoever, and you must respond. the managers expect to you to do your job with no complaints no questions asked, yet we never have the supplies we need to do our jobs. if you ask them for anything, they act like it is a huge inconvenience. terrible terrible job. stay away."
bad,"I was not employed here long enough to render a reliable unbiased opinion. I will therefore bypass this opportunity to render an opinion. "
bad,"Ecolab, wants to rip its employees off and also its clients. They have cut cost to a point that the employee almost pays to work for them. I would never recommend this company for anything."
bad,"not worth it at all ever. They are the most clueless people I have ever been around my entire life. you have to dress like them, act like them and say yes  to everything presented to you."
bad,"Wouldn't go back, new management made you feel like a number rather than an employee. You really know more about your peers than your own family. To stressfull of a place for."
bad,it would of been nice to have a manager that you could lean from not one that has less time with ecolab than you do however the adm is a great manager even though he has less than a year with the company at least he will get dirty with you and learn
bad,"R&D management totally involved with helping their careers at the expense of lab personnel.  Expect objectives to change not only daily but AFTER your performance review has been written and submitted.  Run, don't walk, to somewhere else to work."
bad,management was great to work with. A highly competent team and place to expand your career. I highly recommend this employer. It was a great experience being part of this HR team.
bad,"Ecolab claims to have a culture of safety, but constently has spills and accidents that are all linked to neglect by the current management.  The Safety Department does not take concerns seriously and puts employees at risk."
bad,These people will undercut and use you. They do not take anything into consideration.They will fire you at the drop of a dime and think nothing of it;
bad,"This company is not a company where women excel.  It's a boy's club where not much training is provided.  The work environment is mostly one where even if you work hard, you will not get ahead in your career."
bad,"Would not recommend this job to anyone. Company does not care about employees home life. Only thing they care about is getting the contract volume done for the month, PERIOD!!!"
bad,The Management in this company has no  training and they put people over you that have no Supervisor training. By far the worst company i have ever heard about.
bad,"I'll keep it short. Ecolab is a bad company. There work practises are sketchy, dangerous and unreliable. Because of their severly underpaying salary for technicians they are made up of rebelious bad seeds that were terminated from other jobs and the dangerously, fresh out of school, inexperienced techs that have no business working in commercial kitchens.  There techs overlook safety and quality for time and profit. Their CEO has a car salesman mentality. He believes you are worth his time if Ecolab is profiting at least 6 figures from your business annually. They use the words ""culture and ethical"" an absurd absurd amount of times but ""cult"" would be more accurate and they have no idea what ethical even means.  I know this first hand as I was a part of their cult for over two years until i was terminated for going to restaraunt management about a serious safety concern. It turned out to be another Ecolab tech that caused the issue. That ""senior"" Technician brought more money into the company (this by routinely lying and selling parts and equipment to restaurants that did not need them) so I was terminated. Thats Evilabs ethics."
bad,Management dont handle situations good. People are so judgemental. Its a ok background for a job but its not the best place to work because of management
bad,"Don't waste your time. Management is HORRIBLE. every supervisor thinks they own you so as soon as you mess up once, especially if you're a temp, you're gone! Everybody in the building wants you fired and will snitch on you for anything. it's a he said/she said company, for example if somebody doesn't like you and just randomly say that you said that you didn't like the job or something along the lines to a supervisor then you're gone. All they care about is how much money they make and could care less about their employees. I could write soooo much more. there is a ridiculous amount of drama in the building and everyone trash talks each other behind their backs their including the supervisors. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME"
bad,"Horrible place to work. Supervisors and managers were horrible people. Did not want you to learn anything new. Always talking down to you."
bad,"This company pitches a good sales pitch, but they have no concern for team member happiness or well being. Ecosure is a division of Ecolab and they change their rules as they go to ensure they always profit no matter at what expense their team members suffer. They do not allow you to take vacation time and they do not pay out for accumulated time when you leave."
bad,The job that never ends and doesn't pay. Do you enjoy crawling around on your hands and knees in filthy kitchens all nite long? How about spaying poisonous chemicals constantly? On call 24/7? 60hr plus work weeks all for minimum wage? If you answered yes than this is the job for you. Good luck
bad,"Ecolab is a very top heavy company and the management has lost touch with the people in the field, all they are concerned about are numbers."
bad,"do not ever work for them they are not fair or don't care about your family. they try to fire you for no reasons. look somewhere else to work,"
bad,"Your annual salary is not what you get paid.  It is a guesstimate that no one can explain.  Commission only position that they won't tell you either."
bad,you never know when your going to be working until a few hours before its time to go in
bad,"There was no set schedule, would work 12-15 hours daily some less, so no overtime would be paid for the week.  Manager would call me 1 to10 mins before leaving home to come into work, too see if I would work later time, to cover for someone else.  Covered for others all the time.  The contracted mopping crew would mop in the lab daily with people working and place no sign out on ocasion, therefore I fell and was fired a week and a half later, after pulling my shift and the other lab tech shift due to the fact one was out for family reasons. I constantly worked for others when they wanted off and was only given a day or several hours notice.  Also, I had accured vacation time & personal time in which, they now will not pay for accured vacation time or personal time, HR told me there was a policy change which I told him I had never seen or given a copy. From the first day of work which I sign and agreement given 2 weeks paid vacation, this changed immediately. Is this a way to get people hired and in the door and then change all policies at HR desgression.   Also for the first year I worked every weekend, only getting Monday off , but when people were move around with no dicussion, no one else worked every weekend, it was rotated.  It's weird that they paid for unused personal time at the end of 2013 and one could carry over their vaction time up to 80 hours. I saw everyone that got hurt on the job GOT TERMINATED, and I did not even mention worker's compensation, since I thought keeping a job was more important because I was my family's only support and way to have insurance."
bad,"When I first started I was told it would be Mon-Thur 6am to 4pm, I was there for almost 4 months and never had a Friday off and worked every other Saturday. The Full time people make it their mission to get the temps fired and that's exactly what happened to me, I am a very hard worker, was early to work every day and never missed a day and was terminated because a coworker played a song with one swear word in it off of my iPod without my knowledge and one of the old women heard it and told on me for it and I was terminated that day with no previous infractions. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy!"
bad,"It's hard work for little pay with no life/work balance at all since your personal cell phone is also used as work phone on business card; therefore, you can get calls any time of the day or night and feel obligated to answer even on vacation or holiday.  Lack of support.  Typical day is drive around pounding pavement, lots of cold calls rain or shine.  Than at the end of the day there's data entry and other paperwork to be done so it's overwhelming.   Management is not supportive and there's a lack of communication/support with sales and operations."
bad,"Basically for a company earning billions of dollars a year they paid poorly, management were basically incompetent bullies, I would not recommend working here."
bad,"Ecolab has to be the worst company ever to work for. Management is a joke. It's pathetic when the ""boss"" does not know how to do his own job let alone the jobs of his people he is to be supervising. & how do they expect us to get our job done w/ no product.U have to order the product you incompetent moron. Gee....how many lawsuits will it take before they pull their heads out of their butts. It's all good though....cuz people like me will just continue to bank off of your stupidity. $$$.....thank u!"
bad,"The pest division is high pressure sales, high prices and low quality service. Managers are phony and I have never seen such a toothless, unfit sales organization. The most shady people survive. If you have integrity, morals, compassion, teeth, family, proper BMI and bills, you DO NOT want to work here"
bad,"Bad management an active blame policy when things go wrong, no thanks when its due"
bad,"I worked for this company for exactly one year. I had virtually zero training as a Pest Elimination Specialist and had to learn the job useing chemicals I had no experience with in the past. When I was hired, I was told it was a 40 hour a week job, nights, Sunday through Thursday. You were attached to your job and your accounts by a beeper. When the beeper went off, you were required to respond within 24 hours, but first, responding with a phone call to the customer within one hour. When you have 124 accounts, no training, and poor management there is no way you have any quality family time or time to relax. The icing on the cake is when I had a family emergency and asked for time off without pay to take care of personal business and get affairs in order it was denied. Denied, because my lazy manager didn't want to get off his fat can and from behind his desk to cover for one of his employees. Needless to say, I was fired. I don't recommend anybody works for this company."
bad,"Company management is arrogant and company has gotten so large that it has became complacent in its role. Management is mostly all intimidation and scare tactics and does not care for family being involved. Family not welcome at rewards banquet nor as a ride along guest such as take your child work for a day and you can be fired for taking your spouse whom was unable to drive to the doctor. Most everthing runs backwards here, the hardest workers are recognized the least but leaned on the most and the pay scale is controlled by policy which changes yearly so your salary can go down instead of up and the kick in the crotch is that it will take more hours to earn less money. Territory managers are put on a pedestal and dont have to do much work. They are mostly are dishonest as they profit from it at expense of the route managers whom keep this company alive. Customers and the challenges was the best part of the job."
bad,"Have been here working previously but they have long hours with day and nights every day , long routes and travels with worse management . They can send you anytime any day anywhere . Make false promises . "
bad,"No hay organización , mucho desorden y poco apoyo en los procesos, tienes que poner de tu bolsa para los gastos de viáticos y tardan en reembolsarlos, te cambian la agenda en cualquier momento y los horarios son a altas horas de la noche"
bad,Management was not supportive.  Going through a rough time.  Absenteeism was excused but ultimately ended my job. You are expected to work no matter what is going on in your life at the time.
bad,They hire and/or put managers in place that have no clue what they are doing. Management at the local and regional level only care about their bonus and will regularly remind you how anything you do affects their bonus. A normal week is in excess of 60 hours and management is still asking you to do more. You will have no support and will really be on your own here.
bad,The management wants employees to be micro managed. There is no room to advance unless you’re a part of their click. In the summer you will pass out due to the heat and the chemicals floating in the air. If you report situations that are going on in the plant you are retaliated on and your job is threatened. Don’t let the pay an hour fool you it’s not worth the hassle.
bad,"No hay equilibrio de la vida personal con la vida laboral. "
bad,Bad management & work almost every weekend.   No real chance for advancement unless your right with management.   They will work you to death & then work you some more.
bad,You work 13 weekends out of the year without compensation and only 2 weeks off for a $16/hr job. Fend for yourself as you do not get much if any useful help form the management.
bad,"I've worked for four companies and this one is by far the worst. They own you, will chew you up and spit you out. They pay you just above average but will work you 60 plus hours per week, and get this: the more you work the less that you earn. They have a rediculous pay structure. Do yourself a favor and choose somewhere else."
bad,"If they ony cared about their employees they way they feel about being everywhere... just imagine what they coudl do!"
bad,I worked there for 13 years and was fired for an accident. I was changing a dispenser and splashed acid in my eye under my safety glasses. I didn't miss any time at all.
bad,"bosses ignore you when you need help, when they do help they over apply chemical that violates label law, do jobs they don't have licenses for, work you night and day to the point of nearly wrecking and expect you to keep going or you can get written up, boss will take credit for your work to upper management, co workers with steal commission for jobs"
bad,this job is not worth anyone's time. do not expect a permanent position if you are going to be working in the warehouse.
bad,Same as my Orkin review the big corporate owned companies are all the same
bad,Most disrespectful place I have ever worked. Supervisors are not trained properly. The thinking of these people is that they are above the people that are actually doing the work.
bad,"The majority of people there are family,friends whom married into their friends family and long time friends who they hired so it's kind of a favoritism type environment."
bad,"I gave 110% every day, for them to give me 7.5 hours for the week. They started cutting all of the temporary employee's hours along with full time. They never gave a straight answer as to why there was no work. They handled the whole situation very unprofessionally."
bad,"They promote work like balance but you don't really have one."
bad,"Run for you life do not apply to this place unless you just don't have no other choice! Pay and management are horrible, you will be on your feet all day long constantly walking.  It is very hot during the summer and very cold during the winter, don't do it! You are not rewarded or promoted based on your experience or your knowledge, you only are rewarded or promoted if management like's you period.  Ecolab has a plant in just about every State and city and all of them are not that bad, but the one I worked for was horrible, go there at your own risk!"
bad,"(Winston-Salem Branch)"
bad,Trash company!!!!!! They treat employees like garbage the supervisors play favorites break times are only 10 min not even enough time to walk to the break room
bad,"A empresa tem uma cultura boa, mas peca na gestão de pessoas, alto turn over, rotatividade e por apresentar uma gestão tóxica."
bad,High expectations. Zero benefit! Don't apply to ecolab. They will run you into the ground for their own benefit  and financial gain. Reducing your pay and ensure your own financial failure.
bad,I worked here for about a month. A month was enough for me if you like to be micromanaged and talked to with no respect as if you are a kid then this is the place for you. They talk to you as if you are dumb and not capable of anything. You can't drink water out on the plant. Quick to write you up if your a minute late. If you get a raise its 25 cents. Just an  awful place to work this place is a joke.
bad,"No back up by manger, left to sort out problems on with customers and manger May our may not answer the phone to you. Work load  totally not realistic no Christmas bonus"
bad,I was laid off after 9 weeks of employment due to reduction in workforce. The company was losing money and had to reduce the number of employees.I cannot provide a full review after only 9 weeks of employment.
bad,"The work life balance with ecolab is terrible. The management in AR is great at making promises, but 9 times out of 10 never follow through. I personal was with the company for a little over 3 years and I saw many people come and go because of the struggle that the job throws at you. I would never recommend this company to anyone who lives in AR, but you may find better luck in another state."
bad,Overall time spent working on machines instead of out selling is 95/5%. Not enough money for how many hours you work. Management is not helpful at all. Stay away!
bad,"Very poor management who does not care about employees safety and well being. HR is one sided and all complaints fall on deaf ears. Expected to work long exhausting hours with no appreciation in return. Trainning is lacking but yet you get in trouble if you make a mistake from lack of knowledge."
bad,"No development if you don't play politics. After Ecolab adquired Nalco, our company (Nalco) became a very different work place, and it was not a healthy corporate culture at all."
bad,"Took me on as a trainee technician with NO experience "
bad,"Buena empresa en cuanto a beneficios,mal ambiente laboral,practicas indebidas"
bad,"Long days/nights. All the scheduling was performed daily from my home (1-3 hours). No breaks, no lunch and was not paid for my overtime. I never saw my family while working for this company."
bad,Keep looking and bypass this place! No proper training my coworkers antisocial. People don't come to work and you have to go home early. Don't do it to yourself and your family
bad,Job insecurities brought about the continuous chenges in executive management. The appointment of external people while the internal people who have been contracted for years and have gained massive experiences are still available. Good perfomers resigning with no effort to retain them by teh company.
bad,"Expect to be on call 24/7, including weekends.  However, depending on your district you should be able to only be on weekend coverage every 5 weeks or so.  You will not be getting paid any overtime for being on call, even on the weekend.  The job is 80% service and 20% sales.  You will get a monthly budget, which will increase from year to year.  You will also be responsible for call coverage, probably about 60 or so accounts a month that you will have to have signed in order to get credit for going there.  If you do not get at least 95% call coverage monthly they will speak with you about it.  According to management there are no excuses for not getting proper call coverage.  If you go on vacation you are still responsible to hit your numbers.  You will most likely get at least 1 emergency service call a day which will bring you out of where you were hitting your daily call coverage and then have to make up the ones you missed the next day.  It's a never ending cycle.  You have to know the ins and outs of a commercial dish machine.  Customers will expect the world from you and will not be very appreciative of what you do for them.  Remember it's all about the numbers."
bad,providing solutions to customers on a daily basis while protecting their business and brand.
bad,"I am honest, at first they seem to support you, but this is really so you do not leave the company andthe training is just a game for what you really have to do. IS A GOOD MONEY TO START."
bad,Ecolab’s work model is terribly flawed. Their systems are archaic and useless. They do not have enough reps to cover the territories so they work each rep to death.  The company  pretends to focus on your safety but consistently puts their reps in harms way. Ecolab’s equipment is cheap and frequently malfunctions. From a reps perspective- they exploit their employees and from a customer’s perspective- they dont really care to maintain the overall standard of cleanliness in  the business.
bad,"Ecolab claims safety is our number one priority but it absolutely is not. Very poor management.  No job security. If your plant isn't union, production members are treated like garbage. Terrible morale. Very toxic place to work. At first the pay seems worth it but soon you'll be looking for another job."
bad,"Will work you to death. Managers are jokes. They only care about numbers.  SELL SELL SELL.  screw everyone over. The corporate people in Minnesota and the nationwide field people are totally in two different worlds.  Seriously, don’t apply here.  GARBAGE."
bad,The Management is the worst they have no morals. They leave all the management to you and then when there is a issue that pops up the lay the blame at your feet. They are very inexperienced.
bad,"They sale you a Dream in the Beginning telling you how much your gonna make in Training.. Supervisor only care about numbers in not you as a Employee,in if a customer complains ,they will never have your back  customers call back in you have to go back within 48 hrs you have 120 accounts imagine 30 of them calling back in a weeks time basically your never off ....."
bad,"Brand specialists are the face of the company in their territory; management wants to see reports meeting national averages, not specific to location."
bad,"Good old boys club, it's who you know not what you know. The company has been going down gradually. Not a good place to work. Pay isn't great, bonus structure is weak, work-life balance does not exist."
bad,Plan on spending HOURS every day driving MILES in rural locations to tiny mom and pop facilities that don't make enough in sales to cover the cost of the machine rentals an then expect to sell them  overpriced soaps and cleaning products. all this with NO support from management that lives in another state.
bad,"Required working long hours and not paid overtime.  Not paid for emergency service calls afters hours or on holidays.  I would not work for them again for $200,000.00 a year."
bad,"Morning meeting coordination, numbers calculated . The culture here is not great, but the people in the warehouse work hard, and the others in this location have been there a while and are not as concerned with the warehouse workers. This was not a great fit for me because when the people who actually bring the money in are treated poorly it has a trickle effect."
bad,"The only positive side to this company is pay. I thought the pay would outweigh the daily issues but there is too much. Higher level employees such as leads supervisors and management only care about their agenda. The employees don't matter. Their opinions don't matter even though they are the ones putting in the work day in and day out."
bad,"Need help and let's go the best help. Go figure."
bad,"Como primer empleo se aprende mucho"
bad,"Not a good fit for me, bad management which I believe to be a culture.  Great coworkers and reasonable work days.  Management system is broken and the culture has been driven by the management team."
bad,They don't care about employees. The management sucks! pay is good but they don't want you to have a life! Maintenance dept is in trouble.
bad,"This company expected you to work 60-80 hour weeks with no over time, management is a total joke.  There is always the threat that you are just about to lose your job.  Department mangers are the worst I have ever worked with."
bad,"What a terrible work/life balance.  Working all day, then all night, then all weekend, too.  In CA, they have a Rube Goldberg equation to figure your hourly pay.  That means working yourself to death, and often times off the clock or risk making $10/hr or less.  Or turn a really profitable week and make $18/hr"
bad,"Declining company with terrible management--- RUN! Military culture and many overblown egos running the show. Doors slamming, swearing, breaking things, all normal and part of typical daily management tug-of-wars. Politics is a bloodsport. Promotions based on being yes-men, not based on quality of work. No one seems to understand that the market will not bear prices 3-4x above industry norms just because, ""We're Ecolab!"" Don't be the bearer of bad news because the messenger always gets shot."
bad,"You are on call 24/7/365, so if your phone rings you answer it!  Management is a joke! The managers have no clue as to what they are doing! How are you supposed to be lead by a manager that can not do the job they are managing?  Constantly lying to customers to keep them from going to competitors, or they give them free product to keep them from going to competitors. NO THANKS!  I would never recommend this company to anyone!"
bad,I was a field service tech for this company for over 2 years. The sales department has little knowledge of the mechanical side of the products they are selling. They make promises that are hard to keep and send you away from your family with little notice. The company has had a rash of poorly thought out products with performance issues. Pointing out problems with products is seen as bad mouthing the company. This might be a good place to work for sales but I would not recommend it for any technical jobs.
bad,"Definitely the worst job I've had to date, the supervisors laugh at you when you're off in five mins and tell you that you have to work another four hours. The most ignorant management ever. They couldn't careless about you. Advancement??? Anyone can be the laziest person alive and advance all you have to do is bide your time till you get the seniority you need."
bad,"Every thing you do on a day to day basis is channeled through your phone. "
bad,"You get hired, showed how to do your job in 3 days or so then you are on your own. In the days of training the trainer isn't helpful or caring of the company or the people. Horrible people and they dont care about the job. The logistics department with inventory control sucks.  This place is not welcoming of new employees."
bad,"This company will let you down. If you dont dance to there tune your out. Plus HR is a joke and will dictate and bully you."
bad,"Its a place that if you are favorite of the management you can move up easily or get promoted in no time or no effort at all, no room to grow if you are not favorite by the management and the same with reporting a safety concern that if you report you will be marked as a spy and being told to mind his/her own business."
bad,Nothing but a bunch of snakes I The Laurel area just be ready for lies and backstabbing from managuand HR.management will tell you they have your back and they are fighting for u but they fight agayyou and no advancements
bad,Pre shift meeting every day. It's a productivity driven warehouse. Which on one understands. Too much micro managing from top to bottom. Too much work and expectations and favoritism
bad,"I was a territory representative for 2 years. Ecolab breaks its territory into districts. In my district, we had 11 territory representatives. Of those 11 representatives, all but 3 had been fired or quit by the time I had resigned. When you lose 8/11 team members in 2 years, you know something is wrong. The problem is that this company expects the world of you but provides very little to incentivize those expectations. You are “eligible” for a quarterly bonus but you will rarely receive it. The bonus is a team incentive, and if your team does not pull its weight, you miss the bonus. In one quarter, I reached 138% of my quarterly goal and received no bonus for my effort. This company is extremely slow to hire and integrate new reps in the workforce. Through the continued loss of employees, my territory had expanded from one state when I started to 4 States when I was finished. Because we were short so many men and women, there was an expectation that nobody take a vacation that lasted more than a couple of days. When I left, I had 16 vacation days leftover and the company refused to pay them out. On the plus side, you do get a company vehicle and gas card. I’m assuming this is to make up for the wages that are extremely uncompetitive. If you live in a large city with a high cost of living, be prepared to make it on 38-44K a year. There is absolutely no room to move up unless you are willing to move cross country. "
bad,Management is about favortism. Discrimation. Hostile Work Environment. Horrible. Just horrible. They only care about themselves. The wrong people in the wrong management positions.
bad,Most of the District level Managers are ok but the area manager has a serious God complex and no concern for his workers.  This area had a great culture in the past but it now is completely lost.
bad,"They only care about you completing the work and not knowing how you did it. The benefits is great, but the management sucks in the way of great promises and now followup ."
bad,"This is in no way a sales job. You are 100% a repair man. You work 24/7. Even when you are off you still get called either by your customers or by the person who is on call covering your area. I worked just about every holiday because of emergency calls. The worst was Christmas eve that went into Christmas morning because of a down dish machine. If you want to go home filthy every night, ruin every pair of slacks you own and work roughly 10 to 14 hours a day this is the job for you."
bad,this place is all about who butt you kiss they dont want to hire you if they have to pay you good money and they want you to learn everything for no reason
bad,This company was the worst to work for! There was a lot of harassment from males to females about the way we looked or dressed. The men would whistle constantly at the females like they were dogs or fresh meat. They didn't train the employees correct they were under trained. The leads and supervisors of the departments were very rude and unprofessional.
bad,"My day starts at 4 am because I have to drive to my territory."
bad,"I didn't mind my job until the last year I was there. We actually had bosses that cared about us, and made good decisions for the plant as a whole. Now you work non stop, your opinions and values are overlooked, and it is made very clear that you are replaceable. Many long time employees were let go with no notice, or they quit afterwards. This place is going down the gutter"
bad,"great company to work for if you enjoy never being acknowledged,"
bad,trabalhei 8 mes nela  foi um luta  paga bem  mais  nao tinha gerente capacitado  para nos dar respaudo
bad,No room to grow. Managers are not knowledgeable for the position.  Not enough help.  Very stressful.  Company makes odd decisions and then fails and your blamed.
bad,"Fast paced. Management does not care about you management does not help you train for the test, and doesn’t pay well for the time of work you put in And a very fast-paced environment"
bad,"Ecolab likes to give fancy titles to make you think your someone special. A “Manager” is nothing more than a body in the field. I was given so many unrealistic goals but always spent most of my days fixing broken machines and driving long distances. I was sent to customer locations to repair equipment I knew nothing about. My District Manager grew and smoked pot. I had to pay upfront for all my repair parts. "
bad,"Corporate makes it out to be a professional work environment but its not when you get to your district.  The local mgrs are inexperienced and break company policies constantly.  There is a high turn over of both techs and mgrs (who are basically techs).  Mgrs are unethical and they will use you to manipulate their numbers.  Mgrs use coercion and will throw you under the bus for not meeting their numbers, or to get corporate off their back about their screw ups."
bad,"Very poor management. They don't care about the employees and what they have to say, but they might care if you are one of there favorites though. Let the manager know about issues that need addresses to make it a equal, happier, and less stressful place to work and you immediately are on the do not like list and can guarantee they will be looking for a way to get you out the door. They don't like you telling them about what really goes on out on the floor cause it means they have to come out on the floor and deal with issues which involve doing some work which they are not willing to do.They are just fine with the coordinators covering things up and filling his ear with what he wants to hear. Need to fire all the office people and start over cause they do nothing but create the drama. They love to manipulate how your day goes based on favoritism. Pick one person out the crowd to make there life miserable, piling on the work and making there rate tough to achieve just because they are better at it than others and they don't want to take the time to get everyone up to par though other coworkers are capable of learning it.(favoritism) They Lazy. Place is a joke."
bad,Management and culture are horrible.  Very stressful environment and highly combative.  No loyalty to employees and unfair disciplinary procedures.  Do not apply.
bad,Ecolab treats employees like they are just a number.  No opportunity for advancement and has a very unsafe work environment. The corporate core values are not supported at the plant levels.
bad,Great company with a fair pay rate but difficult to balance work and social life. If you are a geat salesman this is the job for you.
bad,"Busy"
bad,The recent crossroads and combination of jobs you have to provide make this job almost undoable. You have to wear to many hats and sales goals with service and installation goals leave you with little or no home life.
bad,Compensation/benefits--- they are okay not the best
bad,"No  se Respetan los tiempos privados "
bad,Requirements for number of audits done per day only increase regularly. You are limited to what you can coach in many audits making it difficult to prevent potential foodborne illnesses.
bad,all around a horrible experience. the turnover rate is through the roof. the compensation is good as an attempt to trap you in a lifestyle leaving you dependent on them. Training is fun but lasts 8 weeks so by the time you realize the job is not for you it is too late. you are usually asked to relocate and take a huge leap of faith before they throw a lot of work on you without much support. Very demanding and fast paced and the job comes with a guarantee to your customers tethering you to constantly going back without compensation until your customer's impossible expectations have been satisfied.
bad,The management has a tendency to speak to employees inappropriately. They show a lot of favoritism towards their friends at work. The benefits were good but it’s not worth the disrespect that you receive
bad,"Not a good place to work terrible management no support ..women not treated well ....Poor treatment if you have to take off sick , crazy amount of safety cards need to be written up everyday"
bad,"On m'a mentionné a mon embauche que l'emploi comme gérant de territoire serait dans la vente. Mais en réalité j'ai passé les 18 mois de mon association a réparer des lave-vaisselles, des adouciseurs d'eau et de l'equipement sans avoir les compétences ni la formation pour le faire. Ma maison était devenu une véritable entrepot de pièces car je devais avoir en ma possession toute les pieces pour réparer les appareil"
bad,"Refeição precisa ser melhorado e muito, uma troca de restaurante seria bom"
bad,"You are on call 24/7.  Unless you are short, fat and bald it's hard to make it in this company.  Due to my sales achievements for being top producer for several years, I was promoted to Regional Manager.  My manager was so hard to work for he called me a cheerleader and basically if anything was wrong, I felt like I was dragged on the ground  by my hair.  Worst company to work for!"
bad,Don't expect this company to take you seriously or care or remedy the situation if you find yourself being sexually harassed by a coworker.  Expect human resources to basically threaten you and put you in a room with the person responsible for the behavior.
bad,"Great pay,Poor Poor Poor Management and Training is not a option or a concern there when u make a mistake they want too blame and point the finger at the production worker.Not the managers who make the calls..."
bad,"My review about ECOLAB, it was a very fast paced job, everything was done on a time basics. Good computer skills is required and lifting up to 75lbs.Over time wasn""t a PROBLEM, all the overtime you want. Benefit package was very great and they didnt mind paying you for good work , just be to work on time and do what you are told."
bad,"First off, let me say the money is great. What is not great is the work life balance and incompetent management. The only way you will be able to advance is to kiss up to the management. If you like money this is the place for you. If you like having a normal work life balance this place is not for you."
bad,You get to somewhat make your own schedule. They are constantly monitorin you by your location.you have to hit a certain goal and if you don't your hourly rate goes down drastically there where weeks that I would make 30+ per hour and other weeks that I would barely get 12. Pretty much it's a get out what you put in kind of job so if you can deal with butt head managers and consistently exceeding goals that are almost impossible than this is the job for you. I recommend that I'd you get this job don't do it in the south there are way too many bugs and rodents to deal with. And never ever apply for the south alabama positions the  manager is a complete duche.
bad,"I have on comment on this work place, i have been working for just one month and cant say nothing much."
bad,"Having worked for this company in two separate districts, I came to the conclusion that the management is poor, the workload is high and the targets set for technician's are ludicrous."
bad,"Not recommended for GIS development professionals.  "
bad,"If you work for Ecolab, at least in the distribution warehouse then your life as you know it might as well be over.  They are constantly over worked, under staffed, under paid (for the amount expected of you), and you are forced to work weekends when management gets angry.  They get angry when the short handed staff cannot complete enough orders to satisfy their wants and needs.  Instead of hiring more qualified workers they over work the good employees they have until they are mentally and physically worn down.  It is not a great place to work.  i wish i would have never interviewed there honestly. I regret not looking harder for work elsewhere."
bad,"Kept busy on the production line."
bad,You have to be available for work 24/7. They don't pay any overtime either.
bad,"Ecolab focuses so much on meeting and beating wall street's expectations, it creates huge pressure for the company to make sure their results look good on a piece of paper. The reality is they are good in finding ways to meet it and often times, it means cost reduction by laying off hard-working people at bottom. I worked for their energy division (Nalco Champion) and saw first hand how the culture has deteriorated after a few years of integration ( Ecolab, Nalco and Champion).  The majority of the lower management simply doesn't care about the people anymore as they all UP manage and good at play politics to keep their boss happy and their jobs. Bully behavior is across the whole division as people don't trust each other and can only use authority to force obedience. The company has the worst processes and wasted so much money and time trying to improve them with no results as all (in a couple of casese, the process was more broken after revamp!) Stay away if you can!"
bad,You work 60+ hours a week. They don't do overtime for all the travel. Also the pay is horrible for CA its almost below minimum. Advancement is impossible to get because they don't want to pay any one money. Great stock to own.
bad,"Ecolab, in the Northwest, particularly in Spokane, has been miss-managed for a generation.  What, in most parts of the country, is a viable and thriving enterprise, is, in this area, a complete catastrophe.  "
bad,"the company as a whole lacks the upper management knowledge of the business "
bad,"I have been working with Eco Lab for about 5 years and it has been a roller coaster. The last hurtful thing that was done was that they cut our pay down in an extrem way that is so not fair. I have lost over 15K because f the new way that we get paid. They punish you for working overtime and they expect you to spend a certain amount of time at a customer or your pay will go down. I used to do a very intense treatment at my places but now Im rushed so that I can feed my familiy. When Fighting traffic which is always in Houston Tx my Money keeps going down, because the longer your on the clock the less you make. This company surely doesn't care about the people that has been there for them, there is know real seniority."
bad,The job itself is pretty easy and enjoyable. However there is no accountability no rules set in stone. They run it day by day. There is also no room to grow at the plant.
bad,"With so many changes in management, it was hard to keep track of what mattered and what didn’t matter. Continually trying to find out what focal point should be based on, as it changed as much as the weather. "
bad,"My experience was nothing like what I was told in orientation. "
bad,they do not care about people's time. there is no work life balance. Very hard to get promoted. Too much pressure to sell without providing good training for different products. High stress low reward.
bad,"Global exposure"
bad,"standard, courrier..."
bad,"There is no home life.   You need to eat, breath, and live for ecolab.  No one cares about you and are just focused ok bb getting themselves promoted.   Choose of conduct issues and H.R. is there for the managers security."
bad,Not recommended for people to work they don’t care about entry level employees no consideration for opportunities for employees with minority backgrounds
bad,Its always great when new people get hired on making 3 bucks more an hr then you and your asked to show them stuff. Hr backs high management and not the workers. Night shift gets nothing and makes the big batches that days runs. The only way to make a wage your happy with is to demand it or quit. Management is so horrible. 95% are clueless about how the floor is run. And the elders there make  the new employees feel unwelcome
bad,"Just because someone makes budget doesn’t mean they are management material. If someone is struggling, that manager should work with them to figure out how to get them through it, instead of yelling at them and belittling them all the while covering themselves to ensure they look good. "
bad,"If you like working 24/7 on-call from Mon. to Fri. with numerous problems everyday then this is the one for you. District managers are clueless, SSDM's arrogant idiots and you'll work alone to solve all the issues with dilapidated equipment.  ""Call tech service"" is common phrase from boss when asking for help. Needed parts will not arrive due to moratorium - go search for them- good luck gopher. No vacation if you can't get a co-worker to cover."
bad,"Work for ecolab if you want the accounts and management blaming you for issues out of your hands. Then when you attempt to solve the issues its either not good enough or takes too long. Buildings can have holes in them with mouse issues but your traps being smashed and moved are your problem. If you can help it,don't work here."
bad,"When first coming on the company is very impressive and they really get you pumped to come onboard but once your in its a typical big company.If the higher ups like you or your a family member of a big wig your gonna do ok"
bad,"The job is ok if you like to be connected to a phone all day and very little flexibility. I worked as a temporary person and when I was hired, I shared I was looking for full-time work and was told there would be flexibility but there really wasn't.  If you are a parent and have children responsibilities, this job is not for you. There is little give if you have sick children or doctors appointments. You will have a attendance issues and will be let go. I saw the turn over was high because of the structure. It's one of those jobs where it works for some but not for many. The training was ok but when I actually started working live, I found te technology used for customer service was very outdated and not very user friendly."
bad,"Trata-se de uma multinacional americana. Fiquei encantado pelo site da empresa, até chegar no primeiro dia e me deparar com tamanha precariedade. As instalações são velhas, equipamentos do laboratório antigos e ultrapassados. Praticamente 80% dos funcionários são temporários. Dizem que há chance de efetivação mas isso não é verdade . Isso é um ponto negativo pois a empresa perde qualidade, identidade.. acredito que os clientes não saibam disso. O lugar é afastado e então a empresa tem restaurante interno. Um comida horrorosa, mal feita...lugar para descanso não tem ...falta conforto. Não fornece VA  para terceirizados nem Assistência médica."
bad,"EcoLab is a great company, but the revolving door of managers, account reps, and upper management made it hard to do the job. The advancement was pitiful, they brought in upper management from other divisions."
bad,"no work/life balance, unreasonable metrics, great deal of nepotism.  you can work up to 90 hours per week. on call m-th 24 hours and on call every few weeks. no ability to let go of work."
bad,"I was hired by Ecolab's Pest Division meeting the physical strength requirements expected of me. I graduated from Ecolab Unv., obtained certifications/license, attained milestones and received good performance reviews. I really enjoyed the job up until I got injured due to equipment failure."
bad,"the only thing I liked about this job was the money that I made working their, but it came at a heavy price. they always take you away from your family."
bad,"Um empresa seria, porem não existe plano de carreira ."
bad,"If you do the job correctly then you will never have any time to yourself, or your family. If you do the job fast and overlook some things then you can get the job completed by the end of the month. They do not let the overnight crew get any sleep. The phone was constantly ringing and you could not get away from it. They would make you go and help someone else out and would not get paid for it. This is a commission based pay. this resulted in lost money and time off to spend with your family."
bad,"Management always pushing to get more work done, then when production is met they give you free lunch but complain how they're still behind and complain about mistakes and unsafe acts, morale is always low"
bad,"The job is anything but a balance between work and home. Your schedule can be nights, days, bread route starts (4 am) and a combination of that every week. Always on call. Your customers may be 90 minutes away.  The pay is based on revenue per hour you generate. To make 100% you need to equal your hours to revenue generated. You'll work over 200 hours each month but the company only gives you customers worth about 140 hours. Therefore you have to up-sell like crazy or make close to minimum wage. "
bad,"As a former Territory Manager in NYC, I can tell you that if you are the type of person that doesn't care if you have a personal life or not, then go right ahead and apply for this position.  I can only speak for the NYC district with this particular position, it may be very different in other cities Ecolab serves.  The goals and expectations for this position in NYC are totally unrealistic and unattainable, unless you are willing to work 24/7 to meet them...and even then...Additionally, I was mislead when applying for this position as were several other's before me.  The requirements for this position are really a seasoned, polished sales executive with the skills of an experienced plumber, electrician and carpenter. Upon my initial phone interview with HR, I clearly mentioned that I had several years of sales experience but no mechanical or technical experience.  I was told that this wouldn't be a problem as I would receive training.  During my several in person interviews, I reiterated this and was told the same thing, that I would receive classroom and ""In field"" training.  The classroom training is minimal at best and the ""In field"" training is practically non existent since the Territory Manager assigned to be your trainer is overwhelmed with unrealistic goals in his own territory while often having to cover another territory that is open due to the high turn over, which is due to the two extremely different skill sets required for this position.  They claim that this is a sales position and your salary and job security is totally dependent on making sales, however, many"
bad,Trabalhamos com contato direito com o público interagindo e criando novas ideias no mercado de trabalho.
bad,This particular branch says their number one concern is safety. This is a lie. Does not care about their employees. Forced overtime constantly and actively tries to sabotage any employee who questions company motives
bad,"job was good, but manager would pressure workers and "
bad,"Production superintendent lies to everyone and talks behind their back, supervisors expect you to work everyday you suppose to be off. Unsafe work conditions and practices. They don’t care as long as the work gets done. A lot of manual labor. They cater to their favorites"
bad,absence récurrente de mon tuteur de stage pour au final me donner une note de 7/20 rapport de stage corrigé après soutenance va comprendre  rémunération des mois après la fin du stage
bad,loyalty is over rated here. The management here will not be there for you. They will not believe you no matter how hard you work and dedicated you are.
bad,"Team lead has no respect towards people who ask questions, explanations to people were extremely fast and sounded more like talking down to. Management has zero respect for contracted people who also have families and bills.  Gave me 3 day notice that my contract was done and not being renewed."
bad,"Have to be available most of the time, tied to a work phone."
bad,Ecolab is to demanding of its service specialists and i developed extreme stress for being overwhelmed all the time with accounts and never having a utilty associate in the district
bad,Poor training program and the company seeks profit over  employee and customer well being. Long hours and at times very dirty job. Lots of travelling and sometimes you have to return to areas that are out of your travel route.
bad,work practices extremely unsafe. managment did not care. I had issues with the board operator exposing me to unsafe work practices and when I tried to talk to my supervisors they made no effort to work with me.
bad,"Needs to be more progressive including leadership choices.  Good benefits, stock.need to be more forward-thinking.  Need to move out leaders who have worked way up from the ground - they are not forward thinking.  Have brought in new leadership but they are stifled by those who have been there for so long.  Large company so there are opportunities but the development and insight into the talent is limited.  Managers need to spend time and so does HR within the businesses they support and within their own function.  Too siloed.  Hand-pick people too often even if they ""go through the process""."
bad,could be the best in your district but only a select few are treated with the respect a person deserves. pressured to do things that will decrease your pay on a weekly basis and if you refuse your job is put in danger.
bad,"Job is rewarding, however, this is a job, not a career.  Compensation plan is such that the more you work, the less per hour you make/earn, therefore amounts to corporate-driven salary cap.  They will push you to generate more and more income/revenue but your portion is less and less therefore increasing their profit margins.  You will have far more work than you can handle, despite your efforts to complete all accounts.  You will be forced to meet a quota for up-selling accounts on a double-standard; that being that you are expected to provide a pest-free environment, but simultaneously having to sell things to clients to eradicate pests that they aren't supposed to have.  More sales=pests in your accounts to which the sales equate to resolution.  Less sales=more pest free accounts in which you've been doing your job.  Very high stress, lessening compensation, and expectation that you are to ""live the job"" 24/7 with expectation of your availability being constant."
bad,Ecolab is not a bad company but sometimes the people that's in charge can give a company and bad reputation and my experience with ecolab was a hot environment lot of  hazardous chemicals the pay was alright but for the environment could be better the supervisor that a no??? But not all of them the area I worked in there is one little fish that over power the big fish that was a bad out look for me I was with the company for about 3 month started out good but got uncomfortable was full of drama didn't like coming to work because of the drama and the insurance is high if you are look for affordable insurance it's not there and you only get one 30 minute break in a 8 hour shift it took HR 2 month to give me my dollar hazardous increase pay what some of the back payment and that check was not right but like said the company is self is alright it's just the people in the wrong places and that's my experience.
bad,"It is very difficult to be hired onto the actual Ecolab team. I was hired for a new shift that opened by a temp service, and when all of our 90 days came up, there were very few openings available with practically impossible standards for entry with the physical testings. My floor manager was incredible, as were my team members, but our entire shift was unceremoniously cut shortly after New Year's Day, after many of us had been getting calls to not come into work for a week anyway. This is one of the last places I recommend for people to apply to for that personal reason, but if someone needs a higher pay, full-time, I generally still offer Ecolab as an option."
bad,"Even though Ecolab has been proven guilty in my State, they continue to use the same compensation plan which is a scam.  They pay based on your invoicing per hour to customers but if you have to return to a customer with an issue that they are covered for under the service agreement it's free. Yes, free work and it happens all the time. It's the most unfair and unrealistic compensation plan I've ever seen."
bad,current district manager only looks out for himself. does anything in his power once he feels threatened by somebody else who may be recognized for their diligence and will to persevere.
bad,"they have no air conditioning, and hardly any working fans, it was so hot during the summer people started to pass out, management was mean and didnt really care about anything, but atleast ive learnt how to assemble."
bad,"the type of work they had employees do wasn't cutting up to the amount of pay employees should of received. "
bad,"This company is verry stressful. They promote work/life balance, but "
bad,"Long hours and lots of stress.  Never enough for management, they always wanted more."
bad,I am on the fence about this job and who that have as a manager.  It was not that bad to do the work others as well as myself had problems with management.
bad,"This company has a lot of room for growth. The local team engagement scores were 26% due to poor management connection to the employees, lack of effective processes and technology, poor connection to the customers and a culture that fostered competition to the negative degree resulting in blaming and distrust among co-workers. The messaging they use claiming ""your voice matters"" is not aligned with their actions and practices."
bad,"Little support from management in Edmonton market. Coworkers were eager to help as they are in the same boat of being on call 24 hrs a day, Area manager was disconnected as some workers during my tenure there were lazy and their territories were in terrible shape and when i was on call on weekends for the entire Edmonton area (10 times a year 24 hrs a day) you worked your butt off. In the neglected territories no less. Lots of turnover as the company has difficulty retaining people. Money was poor as the start salary is 44K a year. I was Presidents Club twice and was refused a transfer because a lazy boss stood in my way."
bad,"Every division is different. If you work in the sales or Institutional departments be cautious. Ecolab is business as usual run by men for men, and I say that as a man myself."
bad,"Worked as an admin in the FSC office in Manhattan.  I enjoyed assisting the sales managers and their teams,  but corporate accounts was a nightmare.   The admin is responsible and gets the heat from upper management when sales reps do not complete their tasks on schedule"

Work -Family time is horrible,  they expect you to make your life all about Ecolab,  they have been making all types of changes over the last 5 years with no clear direction because of the new upper Management has no clue of what is like to run a  route. This Company is a revolving door in the Dallas area."
bad,Good company turn over ratio is horrible. Those that were hired permanently were immigrants. Management was unprofessional
bad,Very fast paced with advancement opportunity. They will rotate you to various placements to gain product knowledge.
bad,"great company overall, over bearing managers. Overwhelming work load."
bad,"Poor mgt, unrealistic low wages with poor increases, difficult to move ahead, heavy work load, understaffed, takes Lean Six Sigma to extremes & distorts the true benefits in workplace, lots of mgt in place who don't do anything or ignorant of what's going on."
bad,It was a nightmare working for them.  You get stuck with racist district managers that want you to fail.  Even if main office knows they do nothing to resolve issue.  Not a good place to work.
bad,"They worked you like a dog!!! No time for self in this company. There were no sleep, no free weekends, and they didnt pay for the time you went out to help a co-worker. times may have changed now, i dont know."
bad,The hours are overnight and the management in my area is poor. The pay is based on hours worked and contracts serviced so it varies. It is near impossible to make over your base pay.
bad,If you work here you will be working with cancer causing cemicals on the daily basis.  The pay is not worth the risk.  my time there many workers got cancer and some died from it..  stay away. Ecolab is i major risk to the enviroment of the entire world!!!
bad,Good paying job but you work too much. Management only cares about sales and not about your personal time. They would let you work all day and night not caring if you even rest if you are salary.
bad,"They are all about the numbers at Ecolab.  No advancement opportunities.  Office staff is very vindictive and manipulative."
bad,"the management ruins the job they play favorites too much."
bad,Ecolab is a stressful fast paced position where you are going to have to cut corners somewhere to meet demands. In comparison to other positions with competitors you are paid less at Ecolab.
bad,"Very stressful, very demanding  customer and worse than anything the sales rep are  so rude and lazy. Management is  constantly changing their mind  or   one supervisor says one thing the other one  says something else.  all they care about are numbers and more numbers"
bad,To much negativity on this career difficult to please all customers and boss few products available to exterminate pests  the most effective equipment to kill pests is not always available when customer wants immediAtely
bad,"Got new HR and new management and they only cared about #'s. Co-workers pretend to be cool, but when given the chance the will throw you under the bus in a heart beat.  Supervisor's only care to look good and hide behind safety. They all don't follow procedures, only when it's convenient to them. When you do something wrong forget about it, they will throw the book at you if your not one of their boys. They give pay increases based on a system that is biased. If you dont become a supervisor's pet, supervisor's and management will not like you."
bad,"A typical day was hot and most of the time confusing and frustrating."
bad,"Great company to work for as far as giving yourself advancement.  Work life balance is horrible being on call 24 hours a day and working holidays.  Work a 12 day straight shift every month with only three weekends off per month.  When vacancies happen you are expected to work even more.  Promises for advancement never delivered, promises for additional employees added to area never delivered.  High pressure to sell without enough time to do it. Great company if all you want to do is work and do not care about time for yourself.  Would not suggest if you have a family or any type of hobbies/activities you enjoy doing outside of work.  Compensation can be reasonable.  Advertised as a sales job, but lots of dispenser and equipment maintenance involved as well as installing/setting up accounts which leaves less time for the sales end of the job."
bad,"The company - on the face of it they are great, but with the pressure your put under they only care about knocking out routines, little concern for quality or giving staff the time needed to ensure 100% quality."
bad,Very unstable environment due to extreme reactions to global factors. It's head down and bum up with no frills day in and day out. You work hard and produce or you are removed. Typical large internal politics on all fronts.
bad,"Management in the Orlando area are out of touch with to much on their plates, going weeks at a time not  hearing from them, You call/text/email them with no response for days, And when you hear from them it's all about what they want not how are you doing today but it's go here do this forgot what you have planned to do on your own route . Management needs to change Routes are to big for some of us to provide proper customer service """"Wet the baseboards and run"""""
bad,"Terrible work/life balance.  Pureforce employees treated less than Ecolab employees.  Although benefits are equivalent the pay is approximately 20,000 less.  Trying to determine your commission is like trying to find a needle in a haystack and all stacked in their favor."
bad,"They set their budgets extremely high.  If you exceed your budget by a few points you are in the top 20% automatically.  They expect you to be available every day including weekends and they push like no other company.  However, the compensation does not match the demands of the job."
bad,"Ecolab is turning away from their corporate culture in order to chase sales dollars.  Senior management assumes the field associates are both properly trained, and conducting good service to existing customers. Both of these assumptions are not a reality."
bad,Do not recommend employment for this company. Communication from ground up to management very poor and biased. Old mens club with some prejudice issues.....This cannot be proven of course but regardless this was a real issue. Unrealistic sales numbers I was told I had to meet were eliminated after they let me go. New job title created after the fact.
bad,"This company is great for those that do not have much going on outside of work. It is a great company for staying right where you are, if you do not desire advancement, then this is the company for you!"
bad,"they have territories, but let others poach...hard enough working against competition..."
bad,"training good, However the company is really not concerned with anything but part sales.. in fact the more parts sold,whether required or not,( uh huh) the more reward. Moreover in any given location employees that hustle get RUN INTO THE GROUND to make up for other less motivated techs and management doesnt care, they just push push push.. Also having a dispatcher that is friends with wife of Field Service Manager is a conflict of interest that some may find a bit much ..again they find out who is motivated, talented, and hard working and they run them into the pavement all the while letting other techs slide..just as long as their objectives get met.. Overall a very Greedy company.. I feel bad for companies that trust Ecolab for service.. They really don't care about highly trained tech's: conversely I believe they like underqualified techs that will SELL MORE PARTS!!! What the public don't know, costs them dearly..."
bad,Great overall company! Benefits and services they offer are top notch and benefit their employees. Field is highly disconnected from corporate this is why they have high rating awards. Different realities but overall they are great people. If you are in for a challenge and hard work then this is the place for you.
bad,"Unorganized, confusion,   poor leadership, favortism certain people, breakroom air conditioning,  alot walking, radio played too loud,same music everywhere"
bad,"Change for the sake of change.  The managers are rated weekly on performance and must be constantly improving things.  This are changed just to make them ""new and improved"" only to change to something else the following week."
bad,"The energy services division has weak leadership and no processes in most functions. There is very little accountability. "
bad,"This job was supposed to be service job where you made your own schedule as long as all accounts were serviced everything was ok. That was a lie, this a sales job with some service sprinkled in. You are on call 24/7 ,you  will not have a home life what so ever. You do receive lots of vacation/sick time but out of fear of falling behind most techs rarely use it. This is a greedy money hungry company and managers will pressure you to give customers whatever they want depending on how much they pay a month, especially since they overcharge customers. If you do happen to get ahead on your accounts you told to go out and find new accounts,  essentially adding more to your workload. This is not a job for people who value family , if your only goal in life to make as much money as possible ecolab is for. There is opportunities for advancement but be prepared to never be home or have much of life if you do.Other than that stay away"
bad,"Job does not pay enough for what is expected, especially considering you're working with dangerous and potentially cancer causing chemicals. Too much overtime, extreme weather conditions in the summer. Managers are clueless, engineers further complicate job with unreasonable expectations."
bad,"It is not recommended for the persons who don't play politics."
bad,"There was unrealistic expectations on account managers to hit KPIs and Sales without ruining customer relationships. In addition, management was not supportive during customer visits and in essence discrediting their own colleagues in front of the customers stakeholders and decision makers."
bad,"Senior Leadership too far removed from the process. When they visit, they want to take control without knowing or understanding the process. Senior leadership did not trust local leadership."
bad,"Fue una mala experiencia durante el tiempo que trabaje en la división de FSD, la jefe de territorio siempre tenía problemas para administrar los recursos y tenía pésimas habilidades de comunicación, peor dirigiendose hacia los compañeros."
bad,"Very antiquated work style. This was not a progressive experience. Manager was okay, but she lacked people skills and conflict resolution skills. Overall this was not a good experience"
bad,"Pay was Poor compared to the work hours you would put in, no organisation or effort put in to the work environment . People came and went like revolving door."
bad,"Some work require work out in the bitter cold and summer heat. Working in food plants that could be dirty."
bad,"Great Safety Culture, Long hours, No advancement opportunity. Great benefits, company car, and technology. You are just another drone worker however with no growth or advancement opportunities"
bad,Ecolab doesn't treat their employees fairly.  There's a fast turn around on their employees. Their unable to keep their employees that long. I'm in customer service. So it's back to back phone calls. They need to hire more employees so it can even out the work load.
bad,Beginning of the career was good. Suddenly company changed the Payrol plan.  If you don’t have family life and don’t mind company changed your pay cheque whenever they want then go for it. Lack of the management is the biggest issues in the company. No communication between boss and employees. If something happened you will be the guy got blamed.
bad,Probably due in part due to the many acquisitions this company can be hard to navigate as it absorbs other companies and management structures.  This creates a high stress work environment.
bad,"The route sales manager position is a great position if you have minimal life distractions to keep you from leaving the job. The physical strain, business strain, and limited team support can be obstacles to your success."
bad,"This place was not a good fit from day one.  The management was very uptight and are constantly micromanaging.  The general manager is completely absent and has no clue with what really goes on day to day.  A highly caffeinated Pacific (west) Coast manager  was constantly walking around all day looking over shoulders, correcting everything you say and do.  This manager was truly an annoyance and was good about playing favorites.  The people I worked with were for the most part pretty nice and fun. but stressed to the max. If you work the west coast , you will be overloaded with work and reprimanded if one tiny thing is missed.  Also you will be required to work west coast hours 11-8 EST.    Also in regards to your ""coaching"".  If you are liked, they will overlook mistakes that you do.  If you are on their watch list, anything and everything will be caught and you will be written up.  They preach consistency , but don't practice it.  Some days were better than others, I'm just glad I'm out of there.  It was definitely effecting my health both mentally and physically."
bad,I had three district mangers all in 9 months.  That's all I got to say. No clear way on how to get paid with commissions.  Salary was always different each pay check.
bad,It's a nice company to work for.  The company car and benefits are a good perk.  My District Manager was great.  Looking for better opportunity.
bad,This company is in need of a complete overhaul from the top down. The recent merger has left them wandering around in the dark with systems that are archaic and a workforce that is exhausted. The unspoken motto is that you work 24/7 and have no family life or flexible time unless you are in HR.
bad,"For a company that was so steaped in its culture at one point and time, it has gone down dramatically. Work/life balance is unheard of. Management behaves with little integrity and continue to further their careers at the expense of their people. Constant push for more and working within a thankless industry will take its toll."
bad,It really depends on which department you work for and divison..
bad,"If all u want is money it’s a great place but if u have a family u won’t like it there isn’t any Work/Life balance. Management at least in Louisville District is terrible no people skills at all. The Wow factor is there if u get caught up in it. Like the day of hire Brand New F-150, 2 pallets of product, company phone, and they fly u up to Minnesota for 2 1 week training courses to teach 1950’s way of doing Pest Control."
bad,decent company to work for with exceptional benefits and “some” flexibility in work schedules. Leadership roles however become your life rather than your job. No work/life balance
bad,Ecolab McDonough is in the process of revitalizing the workforce. By implementing TPM methodologies and driving the change within the culture we are poised to do great things in the future.
bad,"Ecolab bought out the original company I was working for. Once they did, it was all downhill from there. I’ve been severely underpaid a long time now and doesn’t matter who I talk to or negotiate with, I don’t get compensated."
bad,"Good overall company.  Not all divisions are great.  Do your homework."
bad,"The company has great benefits, but that's about where the good ends.  The management is so out of touch that it does not even bother to push back against upper management when expectations seem too difficult or unrealistic.  Managers lead from an ivory tower instead of out in the field, helping their employees succeed.  They have to be asked for help because they are too clueless to realize on their own when an employee is struggling."
bad,Ecolab is a company going through a lot of change.  There is intense pressure to execute on large scale projects with very little resources.  Most of these projects are generated by Ecolab's lack of processes and poor quality.
bad,"I am  working for Nalco which was bought by ECOLAB however the companies exist independent of each other The cultures are very different."
bad,"Greeted customers entering establishment. "
bad,"If you are under 25, have no financial commitments / just need any job / some experience then it could be ok but if you have real bills to pay, want to be appreciated and progress in your career then steer clear of this company!"
bad,"they make billions and pay pennies  and take advantage of labor cost they tell foreigners be happy with your job because they barely speak english, so sad and they get tell you quit if u want more money to those with skill."
bad,this company is all about image. Expections were to high for the pay scale. Sales were the only thing they cared about not the customers. the tech support for machines was very good.
bad,A typical workday a ECOLAB is hard. You always feel your walking on eggshells. Management belittles and talk to you like your nothing when you can't learn something as fast as they teach. They teach LIVE so you must do it right. there's no real training and meetings called for everything. It is a nightmare. I was presented a management position and im no where near. I left a great job excelling my career to be back under a desk doing NOTHING i was told i was going to do!
bad,"you will have no life, You never have a beer after work again you will live on a leash, and be treated as a kid. Tm Rm are, keep your route clean self organize and you may have a slight chance ."
bad,When I started there it was a great place to work. The past ten years it has gone down hill. All new management. Don't listen to there employees and are only focused on the numbers not the people.
bad,"Very bad job culture. Worked 3 years, multitasking and doing extra work. Was told continuously I will advanced soon. After 3 years, I was told that the truth is that no one in the lab can advance higher and if we want any position outside the lab, we have to quit first."
bad,"The pay and benefits are good, but you'll pay for them. Practically no  time off. If you're a workaholic this may be the place for you. Customers have unreasonable expectations, that are put in place by the bigwigs at Ecolab sitting behind there desk. You are expected to make a $30000.00 a month budget, yet you have to drive two hours a day to get to first call. Driving sometime over 300 miles per day. You will not get paid for the first hour of drive time or the last hour of your drive home. On call a week at a time every other week. Parts inventory on the truck is a joke or almost non existent, requiring multiple calls to the same location. Formal training is pretty much non existent. I've ran service calls all my life, this was the most stressful ever. Almost had a nervous breakdown. So I just quit. That's how desperate I was to get away"
bad,"This company does not compensate fairly, in fact they were forced to back pay Territory Representatives during a three year stretch that was reported to fair labor board. Company tries to sell you on their vehicle reimbursement."
bad,"A work place where the employees can only contact other employees by calling the operator and asking the operator for their extension, if an employee needs maintenance, they have to call the operator and ask the operator to call them. I think that is rediculus that employees don't have direct numbers to each other."
bad,"Direcionar as necessidades do dia-dia para realizações de ações, como: desratização, descupinização e desinsetização conforme a necessidade e ocorrência na avaliação da situação. "
bad,"Watch your back.  The lower level management is very lazy.  And if you ever decide to leave, just go and don't give notice. They won't let you use your PTO if you give notice."
bad,"Boldogan kezdtem el ennél a cégnél dolgozni, ám a Nalco/Ecolab egyesülése és az evvel járó (még jelenleg is élénken érzékelhető) integrációs folyamatok gyorsan megváltoztatták a cégről kialakitott, előzetes véleményemet. A munkahelyi kultúra, az extra(!) juttatások, valamint a munkakörülmények kimagaslónak mondhatóak, ezzel szemben a munkám során bonyolult, sokszor átláthatatlan szabályrendszerekkel, korrupt, önmagukat napi szinten meghazudtoló vezetőkkel, lekezelő, diszkriminativ magatartást tanúsitó nyugat európai kollégákkal szembesültem. Közel 3 év után, hatalmas csalódással, de egy életre szóló leckével távoztam."
bad,The company has major issues with promoting people of color to divisional management or director postions. It is who you know rather than performance and fit.
bad,"Company culture is the personality of a company. It defines the environment in which employees work. Company culture includes a variety of elements, including work environment, company mission, value, ethics, expectations, and goals. ... Other companies have a casual workplace without many rules and regulations."
bad,Great benefits. Good pay and created your route. Needs a good work life balance adjustment. There is a disconnect from HR and managers. Nice coworkers.
bad,"One of the most convoluted places I've ever worked. I don't even know where to start. Productivity could be so easily improved. Very little actual strategy (although so many talks and meeting about it!) and no real focus on campaigns and their ROIs - just continuing the status quo. Business prefers to keep operating as it is, rather than seeking to innovate and improve because it's ""too hard"" and likely to face too much friction."
bad,"The best thing to do is to come to work, do what you suppose to do or they ask you to do, and go home. You have no friends there. People will stab you in the back for no reason at all."
bad,"A typical day is taking back-to-back inbound calls helping people with their dish machine issues, printer issues, placing orders for products needed, and doing credits and rebills and returns for their desired products."
bad,"the job is what you make of it. but be prepared to have a crazy schedule and be on-call all hours of the day. "
bad,"Organization expects you to bleed blue and at the end of the day that requires more of your home time to the point of not seeing your family.  Hard, long hours (which is ok) however not fairly compensated.  With phone and laptop you are expected to respond to everything as if it was a national emergency.  Beholden to share holders at the expense of the hard working, dedicated people at the company.  Upper management not interested in your personal issues for the most part as long as you can meet their goals and targets."
bad,"Proper yourself to go place. You are your own boss most time. But is support. Communication is must having skill. If you are good at sales,  you make good salary."
bad,I am a remote CSR and its crazy busy. Call after call and no time to breathe. Its very stressful with Lots of stuff to learn which is constantly changing.
bad,"Because I was ""on call 24-7"", I was unable to plan anything with my family. I would get calls in the middle of the night any day of the week to service dish machines."
bad,"Everyone wants to transfer to days after serving time on nights. It's a experience working nights. I did it for 4yrs. The best part is that you didn't see many customer's but just the ones that worked nights or 24 stores. Getting sleepy is common and feeling sluggish is also."
bad,"Lack of communication/leadership. Good pay but management has know idea whats going on. Use to be a good place to work but in the last two years really bad. No advancements,not appreciated for what you do,some good workers being fired for dumb reasons.Overall in a nutshell if they would clean house in management and get new and get them familiar with how the plant operates may be better."
bad,"Typical day would be constantly on the go servicing customers. I was mislead in my interview for this position, I was told this job was primarily sales when in fact the job was more or less a maintenance job. (working on dishwasher, washers, and soap dispensers)"
bad,eco-lab for a long time was a great place to work until new mangement came in and changed what they thought would work better for our branch.They where very wrong and we closed down.As for my fellow workers they where great guys to work with.
bad,"Purtroppo il management é molto scarso, poca conoscenza del mercato e senza spirito innovativo. Mi meraviglio perchè un’azienda tale potrebbe essere molto più competitiva."
bad,"The problem with the organisation is management, where by most of the the critical issues raised by the employees are treated with less priority. Salary is not scaled well. you will find people with same experince and qualifications earning different incomes under the same management. the is a lot of racial tensions which the Hr fails to tackle."
bad,"You are just a number to the company, the more they can make the more they expect.  Time off is earned but expected to be made up in numbers.  Work life balance is very low!!!"
bad,"To many people have been here to long and doing the same thing the same way.   Lack of engagement and they could care less.   No employee ""team"" environment."
bad,You have to justify your decisions on a daily basis. There is always a constant change of policies and protocols. You are the fall person for the companies short comings from the upper management group.
bad,"Good benefits and salary."
bad,Typical day is never typical.  Working with kitchens in restaurants hotels and schools each present their own challenge and hours of operation.  In addition the loss of coworkers has lead to sales reps having to take on the additional territories which results in them having to fix the leased dish machines that a tech would usually service
bad,Working with ecolab was very good you learn a lot they teach you well and the pay isn't bad but the management sucks they do you wrong you must watch yourself at all times
bad,They need managers to put more effort into their district they are overseeing or trying to manage. But it's not a a bad place to work. Ecolab has a awesome training facility in Minnesota Minnesota.
bad,The high pressure sales and endless emails. There is no compensation when the company looses corporate business. Its hard to be excited when you are given an unobtainable budget.
bad,"Gas/ phone allowance is not enough although they are slowly raising it, the pay system is not good. The amount of work necessary to gain 100k in new business isn’t even close to fair compensation when you factor in all the time and work being put in to install that new business, losing accounts you have no control of due to corporate not caring. Weekend coverage, suffering from taking time off, its not really a paid vacation as you lose a week in the field and thus lose money in direct sales, very confusing pay system and constantly having to check if you’re being paid fairly, company expects you to fill your entire home with Ecolab equipment, parts being put on freeze every 2-3 months for basically no reason; this puts extreme stress and pressure on you to find the specific part necessary for the fix, customers expect you to work miracles after you repeatedly inform them that a piece of equipment isn’t working right on their customer owned machine, training didn’t prepare me sufficiently to take over. Equipment Ecolab provides often fails immediately and you spend even more time reinstalling lemon equipment. My manager is the best thing about this company and genuinely cares about all of us succeeding and doing well."
bad,You would think u would start your new employees on easier machines first. But no! They dont tell u up front but they do work 6 days a week. 1 half hour lunch break. I have been breaking out in a heat rash every day. Too many chemical changeovers.
bad,You place bottle in boxes off the assembly line. there so many different departments. They have so many different kind of machines. Only been there a month. Its alright.
bad,Management team are puppets. They have the VP hands up their butts making their mouths move. The pay sucks and the management is just as bad. Please look elsewhere.
bad,On call 24/7 and will have to work weekends frequently.  This job would be great if they could figure out a way for employees to have a better work/life balance.
bad,I would only recommend this place for young guys looking for industry experience that's it. This place is not for long term stay.
bad,i made a lot of good contacts when i was in the territory assigned. good business decisions made me a stronger person i am today
bad,"The job itself is interesting and challenging.  The upper management team is helpful and easy to work with.. The company promotes a leadership development program which hires supervisors fresh out of college.  This proves to be a challenge due to constant churn of moving people from department to department every 18 months due to the LDP rotation.  The company is now trying to hire Production Supervisors with experience, however, if you are hired as a Production Supervisor II be prepared for the hostility from the senior supervisors hired in the early 1990's. This is the worst part of the job."
bad,"Basically I was hired as a pick/order and was only with the company for 3 months. I asked for one week off to go overseas to my brother's wedding and I was told there was no problem with that. About several weeks before the wedding I get a letter saying that they did not need me after I came back from the wedding and that I violated the contract. This would have helped If they would have let me know at that time, instead of saying it was ok in the first place. The pay was good at $23.50 hr, but apparently when I was talking with the other employees they said it is a hard company to get into. This one employee told me he was working there for a year and they only kept him because the guy he was replacing had cancer and they did not know when he was coming back, another guy started a week before me and basically was replacing someone who just retired from the company. So it was bad timing on my part. Such was my fate."
bad,"Ecolab is a great company."
bad,"It is a strong company, and a tough one to work for. They gave you a company car, but the amount driving and time spent working for little pay, made it a difficult job to want to do."
bad,"After working here for 20 plus years, the evolution of this company changed tremendously. This is a great company for younger workers...as one ages, though, unless you have a solid connection with a Manager, you may find you are valued less and less. Maintaining the speed and strength of the younger worker is the challenge here...make sure you get some extra  training or education to move into a less physical position in the office or Management...if you don't, your dedication will mean NOTHING here...they  push the older workers out. This could be a great place to work, due to the excellent benefits, if they found a place for their aged, dedicated, workers that bring so much knowledge and patience to the younger ones...they USED to do that here !"
bad,Very bad communication issues with Management and hourly workers. Corporate allows Ecolab supervisors and HR's to destroy its hourly workers with write-ups and intimidation tactics to belittle  the worker and make them the worker feel useless and make the worker at Ecolab walk a tight rope
bad,Safety program needs some work. High turnover of maintenance employees.
bad,no upward mobility long hours low management support don't expect to make alot of money
bad,"Ecolab as a company isn’t bad. My review is based only on my experience here and is very circumstantial. The irregular pay is my biggest issue, next to the shady sales representatives and poor business models. We have what is called an RPH (revenue per hour) pay system which is basically commission converted into an hourly rate, which isn’t so bad by its self. The problem is more so that you are not allowed to charge for some types of pests which in turn hurts your hourly pay when you have to spend 5 hours serving for it for free per Ecolab’s scope of service. Because of this, many employees in the pest department only make minimum wage or close to it. Also it’s hard to move from a night shift (which is what you start off as by default) to days. The night team has historically made significantly less than most day guys. Work life balance is horrible. As a single father, I find it extremely difficult to make time for my child sometimes due to work and customer demands. My first two managers were horrible and were very unreasonable. My last two managers are great and I have no complaints about my team. This job will require you to meet difficult deadlines, quotas, and performances. Unless you have a passion for pest control I wouldn’t recommend working here. Although the 401k and stock options are great. The work itself is pretty easy but the amount of accountability you take on with this position can weigh on a person."
bad,Great place to make a living. Very nice environment to work and possibilities of moving your career forward are applicable. Did I mention how well they pay their employees!
bad,"Always behind despite working yourself into the ground.  The work you do is never enough and more and more is always asked of you despite management saying its your chunk of business to run,"
bad,"working along side work colleagues,grow and develop accounts,"
bad,"They give you the tools to succeed yet expect the world of you. On call 24/7, if a customer calls you jump, if you don't you'll be replaced. It will become your life"
bad,"Had an opportunity to travel all over the midwest and more. "
bad,"correct tres grande entreprise,environnement agreable"
good,es una empresa seria con jornadas largas  de  trabajo lo cual para mi fue buena ya que aprendí a trabajar bajo presión y sobre todo tuve una capacitación buena
good,This is definitely not an easy job. There is no work life balance. Management in certain destricts need alot of improvement
good,"Not great work/life balance.  Toxic culture in IT.  Have spent most of my time here wondering if we'll all just be replaced by outsourcing.  "
good,"Great pay. The supervisor was rude as ever.  "
good,"Tendency to hire and replace employees freely, while having a minimum of 1 part timer doing all the work on periods of low staff."
good,"Long hours at time with very little base pay. It is a productive type pay scale and very difficult to learn if you dont catch on right away. I feel that the managers are all about number instead of employees. Work life balance is very difficult, especially when you have a family with kids. Graveyard shift is extremely difficult and hard to find time to sleep during the day. I recommend this position to someone who is single and has little to no worries about working hard for little pay."
good,When you work in the warehouse there is no chance for advancing your career.  A person is stuck right there.  The job openings that come available are for lower paying jobs at a different plant.
good,"I have heard that in other areas of the country, this is a great company to work for.  It was not my experience, here in Spokane."
good,"Empresa multinacional,grande e boa para se trabalhar,eu aprendir bastante coisa,a direção deixa um pouco a desejar,tive uma boa relação com meus colegas de trabalho, á parte mais difícil do trabalho é trabalhar e ninguém reconhecer, a parte mais agradavél é os companheiros do trabalho."
good,Its tough job with 24/7 accountability. I have learned many people skills and sales tactics to motivate and achieve goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom but lacks support from above. I learned to become self sufficient over the last 8 years and have enjoyed the growth.
good,No work life balance 12 to 15 hour days and you can’t sell enough they always want more and if you don’t make budget in two years you don’t have a job and will not  promote within the company  I don’t recommend this job
good,After 14 years my long term career was cut down after a new work rule NO BEARDS having had a beard for 10 years all techs must look the same. No facial hair. Shave or leave.
good,"Having worked here management, and associates are closely knit community where most are family outside, or have ongoing friendships that last years. The downside to this is when you're in a meeting with a manager stating that you're having a issue with a co-worker and they tell you that this person has been their friend/co-worker for 5 years or more and dismiss you because their friends are the target of concern. This is a good place to work if your friends, or family are already working here there is a bad culture of favoritism where only a select few individuals who are consistently picked for every ""special"" project takes place. When you bring a concern to your supervisors, and their first response is what did you do, or an outright refusal to investigate this is a quick revolving door, and I watched many tenured and short term employees disappear. The safety team would argue against itself over safety issues, and during my time a trainer left the company due to the bullying that was transpiring in the walls. After submitting a report regarding harassment through a hotline that was meant to protect me I was informed later that all investigations were eventually turned over to the company and this caused me to be the target of a very aware, and bitter management."
good,"Great company to work for, even though I gotten two promotions  over the last 9 years, I feel like I am not getting the opportunities or chance to further advance over the last 5 years even with the completion of my MBA this summer."
good,"The company itself is a great company, however, the food safety division, is not. Work life balance is way out of whack. People are leaving in droves."
good,We would receive raw material and put in a reactor controlling it with temperature to make a finish product. Co workers are very helpful with the process.
good,"After going from Microtek to Ecolab it was a hard adjustment. We were used to a company that cared about their employees to a company that focus only on the $$. Constantly worried about if you were going to lose your job when the out of town directors arrived. If you like being bullied, and receiving empty promises, this is the company for you."
good,They pay well but the training and communication suck. They need to listen more to what their employees tell them they would get more production from them.
good,They Classify you as a Salesman but you are actually a Repairman that also does some sales. By Classifying you as a Salesman they don't have to pay you Overtime.
good,The company is fantastic but recent Manager changes made the position dreadful after a while. I regret the changes because I would still be working for the company.
good,"Although I was able to achieve my goals in sales every month, for my 4 year tenure, I was not considered for a promotion."
good,"The culture has changed so much at Ecolab. I use to love going to work daily.  A lot of micromanaging involved, constant roll outs, unpaid weekend coverage that you are required to be a part of once every month, unrealistic sales numbers and expectations and constantly being hassled about them daily. Too much reporting, too much to keep track of when you already have a territory over for 100+ customers to retain and keep happy, only to  be told you must constantly acquire new business! Meanwhile, not reaping the monetary advantages due to such low payouts on the chemical sales. That's what the job of the outside sales specialist should entail, while this role should be focused on customer retention and advocating on a consultative needs-based approach, versus shoving unnecessary products down a customer's throat. "
good,"Ecolab is a strong company."
good,"No work life balance"
good,"Driving to and from location daily.  Once at a location, I would coach and consult management team on best food safety practices throughout and also consulting on daily operations"
good,"Ecolab is a very good company that provides great service to its customers. There is a good framework for their employees with the benefits and compensation they offer at the entry level however the overall culture breeds overwork due to the negative ratio of employees to required workload. If company bonus structure was more defined and better facilitated by upper level management in addition to workload relief for current employees as well as a better promotion strategy, this company would be a desired location of employment for many talented sales reps."
good,"The company has lots of benefits, vehicle, phone, iPad , plenty of resources.  Coworkers are easy to get along with and if under right manager you can work the job not the job work you. But if you get get under a ne manager that's scared of the non common sense dispatcher your screwed. Promotion is based on who they like. They say budgets and CFESA make you but when you do it and stuck where you are, obviously none of that matters.  Starting wage is ok but don't expect a raise. Your an ignored number to them, replaceable. Management is sensitive be careful.  Bonus is you get plenty of rope. Dispatchers think you just wait for them to call for over 12 hours. Most weekends off are good and bonuses not bad, not a lot but it's something.  Not bad if you negotiate at hiring."
good,Great Company but the management in my District was horrible . I never got paid for a lot of work I done because my District Manager would never turn in my commissions. On call rotation was 1 ever 4 weeks and the coverage area was rediculas . Alot of favortism and only certain people in the District got to take vacations . Upper management let it go on and the same managers still work for Ecolab after several complaints. Don't expect to get any kind of praise for your work . Customer demands are through the roof and you won't get any thanks from them. The company doesn't reward you really and every year it gets more demanding . Big Corporate company = Money Money .
good,"The position can take a great deal of your time.  You are on call 24/7 and will have rotating weekend coverage.  Management varies in their way of doing business.  You will be responsible for increasing sales, collections, routine service of equipment, installation and repair of equipment."
good,"I find working for this place was pretty cool, though i can't say names , the person that the reviews usually talk about in HR she is not a bad person ...she just wants the job done professionally and correctly...that's it. for the others some are cool , most are snakes , but hey ! your there to work not make friends ....i did my work i went on about my life outside of work ..point blank ! ."
good,Not impressed. Good sales training but the involved job is less than desirable. If you want a good start in sales and then move on than it's a good starting point.
good,"Excellent company to work for, pays well. "
good,Good place to grow and learn about sales.  Lot of window time.  Long days and not many days off.  Have to have co workers cover for you.  Must be self motivated.
good,"Going though significant change, very bad moral and poor communication from senior leadership .  Work/life balance is not existent and you are expected to more with less"
good,"Always  short on help and having to do your accounts plus 20 to 50 more accounts due to the turnover of licensed employees."
good,"if you have to use the bathroom you better go during your break, they also have managers who dont even know how to do the work themselves. I had to call pl all the time because they suck"
good,"While their training is top knotch, as is their implications."
good,"Lead Generation Team was totally misaligned, management had no clue what to do. Total lack of direction, or support. This led to  a lot of frustration and passive aggression among the team."
good,I think ECO Lab is a good place to work if you have a good route and the don't mind working all the time and being on call 24 hrs. a day with no extra pay. (COMMISSION ONLY)
good,"The products and innovation was great.  The culture was not what they would lead you to believe.  They would talk about work/ life balance, but that was not the case at all."
good,"THis is a company that promotes family unity and one team, but in reality if your are not a favorite or a yes man you will not be given a fair chance."
good,"I worjed a night shift for many years,  had over 160 accounts.  I even had to work the night my wife had our 3rd child. Very stressful job, i lost my mother and am suffering depression and wasnt able to complete everything and I was fired. I feel like they used me up stressed me out so hard and then left me high and dry with 3 kids and a mortgage."
good,"New ""management"" in the CSR department are terrible. There are no consequences to any bad behavior and the good workers are not appreciated. The management lacks serious leadership responsibilities which is completely necessary to have. There is no job security whatsoever. Employees are completely replaceable and under appreciated."
good,"colegas de trabalho bons, aprendi como fazer o atendimento de clientes"
good,"Ero facente parte di un gruppo di engineer unico tra i vari fornitori concorrenti."
good,"If you enjoy good pay and good benifits with little time for your family, then this job is for you. 24/7 on call. No holidays."
good,"Emails, calendar managements, travel, expense reports, document processing, meetings, events, problem solving, projects, video conference calls, annual meetings, greeting visitors, and many other activities."
good,"Ecolab is a well respected company for a reason- quality products that will always have a need in the market. The personnel are great, always got along well individually with both managers and teammates. Benefits are nice and company vehicle was provided with a monthly stipend for fuel. Customers were usually very loyal and nice to work with. Job security is phenomenal once training is complete and you are comfortable with the position a year into it or so. The drawbacks to the Territory Manager (TM) position lie in the number of customers that the TM is responsible for as well as the substance of what the TM is responsible for at each customer location. Often times interviewers and managers will leave out the installation and service aspect of the position which ends up consuming a larger chunk of the work day/week than they are willing to admit."
good,"O dia a dia é muito corrido de muita pressão e trabalho, a equipe interna é muito parceira uns sempre ajudando uns aos outros."
good,Great company. Work life enjoyment depends on the area you work in. Management ideals vary from area to area. You can expect to work long days with many task that weigh down on your ability to meet customer expectations at times.
good,Very little recognition for a job well done. No pay increases except through sales commissions. Does not treat employees appropriately. You are just a number on their personnel roster.
good,Not a lot of training involved. Didn't every really have the right protective equipment or tools. I sometimes had to use my own tools to get the job done. Terrible work/life balance.
good,"Normal day looks like this:"
good,Ecolab is a good co. to work for but I found out there is  no way to grow with this company. they hire outside of the company and does not promote with in the company for advancement.
good,"I enjoyed this job, until we got a new manager. She would tell us one thing in a meeting, but when we were not in a meeting setting she would say something different. Long hours and always on call."
good,"Its ok. You must have good self mgmt skills, you work from home and have very little oversight. Training is terrible and does not prepare you for the field. They promote MGRs based on how well they can sell. Its all about SALES, SALES and SALES!!!!!!"
good,"Pay was average to good.  Very little work life balance.  Constantly changing programs with favor of the month initiatives."
good,It is ok to work at. this company.  If you love to work and not want to see your family.  It is good for a you guy starting out in the business but not a family man.
good,"Route Manger; ensured that clients had service and chemicals for their dishwashers. In charge of installations for new accounts and sales of new accounts. Maintained, repaired, and serviced dishwashers including troubleshooting, reading wiring schematics, and replacing broken components as needed"
good,This company offered many benefits including a pension.  The pay was fair but the balance of work to life was terribly skewed.
good,"Ecolab was my first job in the commercial field. It was a good school as I had no knowledge of business and thanks to the people I met at the company I was able to develop a whole new set of skills, basically thanks to the great managers that led my career and gave me the chance to asume bigger responsibilities."
good,"A tarefa de um Dedicated Account Manager executa em uma linha de produção, vai desde a manutenção mecânica dos sistemas de transportes, realização de análises químicas, controle no gerenciamento de estoque, realização de pedidos de produtos químicos, treinamentos e comunicação com gerência através do cumprimento de relatórios.  "
good,everyday i dealt with customers who could be satisfied or dissatisfied with the store. The hardest part was trying to calm down a upset customer. The most enjoyable part was when customers were satisfied.
good,"Basicamente no setor de projetos da Ecolab temos duas fases de trabalho:"
good,"Send out daily sales numbers to Area Mgr. Provide pricing to sales reps. Create proposals. Follow up with rep on corporate accounts incentives, problems result when rep has not completed the task on the requested due date."
good,agency worker been made redundent worked there 1 year 9 been made redundent from nights closeing nights down
good,"A typical day includes servicing existing customers, making sales calls to attain new business, installing any new customer equipment, handling any emergency calls that may come up, placing customer orders, placing parts and equipment orders for stock and installs. We handle all of these things while focusing on the number one goal of achieving budget every month. I have learned alot about cleaning and sanitation, as well as advancing my chemical knowledge. I have found that our Ecolab group works well together. We have to rely on each other for call coverage, help with installs, and the occasional part. The hardest part of the job in my opinion would be making up sales dollars that were lost due to corporate follies. I especially enjoy helping my customers and teaching them proper procedures to increase their cleaning, sanitation, guest satisfaction, and thus growing their business."
good,Extremely political environment.
good,Self managed and serviced territory with yearly review by area manager.
good,nothing hard about the job just not what i have in mind for where im going to be spending the rest of my working days...management is new so seems like their trying to prove somthing and the people seem to be invovled in everyones personal life
good,I was with this company for just under five years. The culture I encountered was management by intimidation. VP’s had a ‘just do it attitude’ and required total loyalty while providing little support.
good,As a company they seem to be doing things right! They are the leader in commercial chemical sales and expand often. There is just nothing out there in the rural market in advancement for Ecolab.
good,"I worked for Ecolab for 7 years.First 3 years was great. Managers respected you if you did a good job and they had great benefits and work life balance.My last 4 years they made yearly changes resulting in techs working more for less pay, replaced respected DM's with insulting managers who based your performance solely off of paper, standard 1%  yearly pay increases that changed to 1% biannual. Before I left they changed the policies for new hires which included ""No pension.No pay raise of any kind for the first 5 years.If on the 5th year it was an odd numbered year, the 1% raise would be received on year number 6."""
good,"The people you will work with as far as other employees, are generally terrific people. The management the Huntington facility is laughable. They don't care if people have families. They have people in management/supervisor positions that don't know their a** from a hole in the ground simply because they were popular."
good,i enjoyed the freedom the job offers but goals are often unrealistic. Direct managers are very good and coworkers are very good-upper management is out of touch with the field.
good,All in all it isn't a terrible company to work for..but they could work on making it easier especially for female employees that working overnights is not a requirement. Like you can hire people specially for the night work and others for day work. But the management sucks esp here in Ga.
good,"not a good place for black educated woman as a supervisor."
good,"A very good workers in hard-working people to do jobs. In management did not care about the workers. Working hard in the heat"
good,"Wokring conditions are great but the blance of work and life is terrible. Also no benefits working with them really, just discounts to books and magazines. If hired from outside like a temp, dont expect to continue with them any longer, they promote from within to cover your position after they lay you off..."
good,"As I started out, and through training, I was lead to believe my job would be as a route manager. Since training, I've found that on top of that, I would be having to do collections, data mining reports, act iij ng as an inventory specialist, and a spin doctor. And, out of all of those, Spin Doctor is the worst, because I dont like having to lie to my customers when I can't get parts because corporate has decided to shot down the parts supply pipeline because it's the end of the month/quarter/year. I can't count how many times I've had to tell someone ""that part is back ordered"""
good,"Good company and product, great coworkers, needs more communication between departments and countries. International offices should be given more freedom to act according to their market."
good,"cult like culture, many employees not happy with supervisors Irregular hours and hard to get your 40 hours a week. Very little training for this possition, felt like I was left on my own"
good,"Ecolab wants to pay people like 1999 standards, everyone is to be paid around the same with few chances for advancement. As soon as they purchased the company i was working for they lowered everyone's salary."
good,"Lots of benefits and flexibility with this job. Never the same day twice. But you'll find more support in the larger city centers. In rural areas across the country, reps do much more work for the same pay and with much less support. Middle management leaves plenty to be desired. A couple of good sales years appear to be the only qualifications looked at when picking district managers."
good,"on call 24/7 large territories, low salaries, Company Car is a plus but does not pay for fuel. long hours at times. not to friendly with members of the armed services."
good,"Large multinational company that demands growth. Very competitive within the organization as many departments compete with other departments for the same sales dollars."
good,"However, it's a big company and you're just a number.  The pay is mid range for the equivalent in other companies.  The benefits are very good; especially the health benefits."
good,Ecolab was a quick paced environment..lots of cleaning soultions and chemicals. If you are sensitive in any way to chemicals its probably not the place for you
good,Overall a great place to work but at times can be a place where corporate decisions affect work environments negatively. There are many corporate protocols that are needed to be followed and these can have a negative impact on an employee from the standpoint of job security and constraints.
good,"Company is fantastic, growth is there every quarter. CEO is solid and provides great leadership to the company.That being said, mid-level management has a very tactical outlook on things and not strategical. Only thought is making the plant numbers look good even if it costs the company money. As the saying goes, there is the right way to do things, then there is the Ecolab way."
good,"Good place to work if you don't mind being on call and not having a set work schedule. "
good,"You work all the time, basically.  A customer could call at 11pm, you are required to answer and if needed, go there.  This is clouds when you are on vacation."
good,Have been through several buy-outs.  Many new managers that don't always understand the business and seem to just be in seat.  Demanding and not always realistic.
good,"Just a money machine, profits over everthing and everyone. They have all their technicians on a bonus program, the more they sell the more they make. Its just a game of selling customers things they dont need, until they get so sick of it that they stop using Ecolab for their service. Then the sales staff finds new customers. They lose 30% annually."
good,"24/7 schedule- supervisor spend about 14hours at work (lately forced to work additional 6hrs on days off) "
good,"The benefits are outstanding if you can get past the initial deception of what the job truly involves. You must possess a Bachelors degree to be employed and then you spend over 80% of your time NOT being the salesperson you were hired to be but as a technician servicing and installing dispensers. Lasted 2 years and resigning soon as I am tired of crawling around on wet, dirty and greasy floors in some of the nastiest kitchens in the fast food industry"
good,"A Ecolab é uma empresa boa de trabalhar. Sempre treinando e investindo em seus colaboradores. "
good,"I was fast paced. it was an in bound call center in fishers, in. I sat at my desk for 7 hours a day. I was ok to work at. I had to drive 30 min to get there. They worked with Commercial kitchens."
good,"Overworked for the same pay."
good,"not room for much flexibility for a student worker. if you are looking to do the part time student thing I would advise you to look into nights and weekends because they have you all day from 7-4 Monday- Friday. the work was easy, but the management were not ""team friendly"""
good,"a regular day consist of picking parts and counting and organizing them. after i would assemble units for customers. co-workers talk alot and are in everyone business, the hardest part is recognizing smaller parts{look the same but aren't]"
good,"A empresa é excelente em relação ao horário de trabalho. A coordenação da área em que trabalhava sempre dava apoio em todas as ações que iria realizar. A gerencia é um pouco distante, só tinha contato com meu coordenador direto, o que dificultava no aperfeiçoamento do trabalho, a fim de deixar os clientes totalmente satisfeitos. A parte mais agradável é sair do cliente com o mesmo satisfeito pelo trabalho que exercia, apesar da dificuldades."
good,Very diverse company with great management and areas to advance career
good,Cover majority of QSR accounts in Oklahoma. Conducting sales and service in approx 600 accounts.
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, pero se encuentra en reestructuración"
good,"I've really enjoyed my time working with Ecolab's global change management group. It's an interesting company with a bright future, well managed, and great people. Working at Ecolab was an opportunity to get reacquainted with the global business environment and develop expertise in e-learning using uPerform software--which was new to me. I also provided project management for several training deployments and collaborated on a communication plan to support and promote change management. While the work challenged my technical skills, I learned a lot and especially enjoyed working with global stakeholders."
good,"Currently merged with another company and the vision of where they want to go is different than where the company is actually heading. The management is not always communicating with their employees leaving us in the dark on projects and deadlines. Ecolab is a good company, it is just hard at this time to give them a high grade with all the things that are going on."
good,Empresa excelente porem os gestores nao sao pessoas preparadas para os cargos
good,Alright to work for management very unorganised have to constantly chase them to pay your over time. Apart from that is a decent company better than some pest control companies. The no facial hair policy is bit annoying.
good,"Lots of growth equals lost of change... Ecolab is experiencing both, and unequipped to handle both simultaneously. Their past 20 year strategy is biting them in the butt right now... Plants are deteriorated beyond repair in some circumstances...the strategy needs to change towards rebuilding infrastructure, not shareholder returns."
good,"There is no  work but less benefits and less appreciation, there are limited career opportunities and no growth opportunities.The compensation compared the work does not match ."
good,Work remotely if you can. The office has a clinical feel. Freedom is a huge plus. However upward movement is apparently rather limited. Sometimes the upper management appears clueless.
good,The typical day varied depending on the sales.  I learned to manage time to achieve sales goals.  Management was focused on achieving sales goals.  Workplace culture was sales driven.
good,"Pros;I got to go home,Company Van and Fuel Card"
good,Ecolab provides a nice new van and all the tools you will ever need including an iPad. The pay is substandard and any disagreement will get you canned
good,My day at work she be focused on sales and minor account repairs. Instead I spend most of my sales time chasing down lost or incorrect order deliveries and collecting overdue payments.
good,If you can find the key to being in with the bleeding blue crowd and you are the right sex for your division you might have job security for a while. High turnover exists for most and it's not from the lack of trying. Every region is different in how people perceive the company based on its management team. Its common to hear that it is a mess on the inside. It was very clear that I was not welcome in that region and each day was a battle to make it work.Your regions team players and management will dictate your well being and survival within the company. If they don't have time for you you won't see help no matter how much you ask for it. Good luck!
good,"Repair machines that break down , problem solving issues on machines. Repair leaking pipes. Problem solve some plc issues. Replace sensors, bad parts, redesign machinery to meet needs."
good,"Decent company but not a good home for true sales professionals.  They want you to be a mechanic that can sell, not being a sale professional.  Some people love it, but it wasn't a good fit for me."
good,"I started at a lower warehouse job making a decent wage. An employee in a higher position quit and the management allowed me to give the job a try. I excelled beyond their expectation, pointing out flaws in systems the past employee had put in place and improving on other systems but instead of making the salary (or close) the previous employee was making I made about 25% less. I asked for a raise and was given a 5% bump for my efforts. I eventually moved on once I figured out that there was no room to grow there."
good,"It was hard to balance your sleep schedule with my position. There was a lot of traveling involved that never compensated at the time. I'm aware they have changed now. If you're good at planning your time and don't mind the day/night work and always being on call, this role may be good for you. The benefits and insurance were great. You are self managed and most of the time the customers face to the company. Building rapport with them is key to success here. The direct deposit was a plus as well. It was nice to drive the company vehicle home, and not have to worry about driving your personal vehicle to the ""office"" The company has many fields, and I have to say was the best in the industry with relation to the products and field support."
good,"Leadership was constantly changing  (I had six bosses in six years)-  all had different styles, different priorities and different expectations.  Most of the people were good to work with and enjoyable people."
good,"Nice enough company hours are long and you are always on call, which working overnights then getting calls from customers that you have to go back out at 7am is rough.  I routinely worked four day weeks to have more time off"
good,It is a good company to work with.  I enjoyed my time there for 10 years.  I worked as a Sales Executive .  Initially I worked the North Coast area then the areas were open.
good,"Assemble"
good,"Strong emphasis on company culture and history, but was more backward looking than forward thinking.  sales compensation lacked appropriate incentives to motivate high performance"
good,Former employee from several years ago so my experience probably is not relatable to current company. I left Ecolab before the Nalco merger and it's my understanding that there were major changes afterwords.
good,I worked for Ecolab a very long time ago when I lived in North Dakota. It was for the Pest Elimination division in the accounts payable department. I moved back to California.
good,"Overall a good employer, compensation is good but hours are very much excessive, no attention to employee happiness, high pressure and constant requests from management to increase sales."
good,"Expect a lot of callbacks from customers. They can call you back for any reason they want. Work is manageable if management won't take you out of your route to go and help other techs with problems."
good,Management had its ups and downs throughout the facility.  Salary employees were not held accountable for their positions Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
good,Good Job Culture. Limited Job growth in CT branch. Currently there is no stability in the CT branch. Good company benifits is received. 13th cheque also given
good,Ecolab use to the best company to work for but things have drastically changed in the last 5 years. The turnover rate has increased due to current management .
good,just wasn't a good fit for me with this company.work to home life wasn't good. working different shifts as my family.Hard time staying awake on days off
good,Ecolab is good company they need to work on how they train and post there management. I will say the job over all was great and the pay was extent. The hours were 12 hour shifts and a rotating shift so it made it hard to plan a social life or just get in a sleep schedule. That's because I worked nights.
good,"A day in Ecolab:"
good,"To many hats to wear. The main goal is to retain current business, and Gain new business. The problem is 80% of the job requires service. (installation of new equipment, and repairing current equipment. and Corporate roll outs.) The other 20% is actually driving sales. Pretty hard to drive Sales when you are fixing stuff all day, and being on call 24/7"
good,"As a whole Ecolab as a company provides many opportunities. Division of EcoSure still continues to go through growing pains after going to a full time model. Upper management is something that can be improved on. Workplace balance is what you make it. You will work OT despite what they tell you.  I could get paid more elsewhere but  i like what i do, so I stay. With that being said, it is rewarding to see a restaurant improve based on your input. You will need to be independent and not desire micromanagement. Lastly, you will need a strong backbone and not feel the need to be liked by everyone."
good,Company has changed alot in the last 10 years.  Work/life balance is difficult.  Increasing your income very difficult.   Hardest part of the job is balancing service with sales.  Territories cover large areas so alot of time is spent driving.  The best part was a company car.  Used to be a great culture.  Not so much anymore.
good,"great paying job, but management and co workers make it tough to enjoy work. a typical day is getting work assignment and completing it. management changes so much its hard to say. its hard working with people year after year that are miserable and spiteful. the pay  always working forty hours and  your always busy"
good,My only complaint about my role and ultimately why I need to leave is the grueling schedule required of the leadership team.  This is a 24/7 job without doubt
good,"There is lot of work load in this company. Working culture is good."
good,"long days"
good,"New CEO and the management he put in place gradually started to change the overall focus from rewarding great employees for doing great work to forcing more and more work out of the same great employees for less money. Reducing benefits and bonuses and no longer looking to promote the experienced people doing things right, instead filling management positions based on non-relevant college degrees. The new management mentality focused only on the profit margins and stock prices and tried to force company changes without the real world knowledge of how the business works."
good,"Great pay, have to deal with ever increasing sales quota's even though its not really a sales position. I did pest elimination. Great company to work for if your a ""yes"" man or woman."
good,Company is big on safety. Work a lot of overtime. Management needs some improvement. Benefits a incentives packages available.
good,Good career.  Great people and culture.  Difficult advancement without moving regularly.  You will have much autonomy but your phone never shuts off.  Can receive a call any time.
good,"Quando sono stato assunto nel 2002,in questa multinazionale americana che vende detergenti (ECOLAB), pensavo di avere trovato l'azienda che mi avrebbe portato alla pensione, tutto funzionava a dovere. I nuovi programmi presentati dalla stessa, funzionavano bene, si vendevano e gli ottimi rapporti con gli uffici, facevano funzionare il tutto."
good,"I agree with many of the others. "
good,"Ótima empresa para trabalhar, espaços ótimos para trabalho e para descanso, arborizada."
good,"Manager asked me to make deliveries with an expired registration sticker on truck. Told him easy fix, just get renewal problem solved! He came back at me and said go ahead and drive if you get a ticket we'll pay for it. No thank you! Sent home then txt back that he renewed come back tomorrow. Fired after that."
good,This was once a great company.  After the largest competitor left the market it seemed as if there was less caring for employees and customers.
good,"Overall cleaning and sanitation industry is a commodity.  Ecolab stands out as a service driven organization therefore it is a good organization for those who are seeking in the Sales department, maybe also Marketing.   R&D investment is small, less than 1% of Ecolab revenue, showing innovation is not a focus.  Management in R&D acts like marketing and sales roles without indepth understanding of technology."
good,Co-Workers are easy to work with.  Need better resources for optimum job performance.
good,Not a job I would want to write a review about. There was no stability jobs would get changed without notice and papers would get sat aside and then made a priority with in a matter of a few minutes. No organization
good,"Autonomie sur le poste."
good,Os processos são muito descentralizados demandando tempo demasiado para fluidez das ações.
good,Busy days of multi-tasking. The empoyees are great and work very hard.
good,They provide great benefits but the supervision lacks.
good,"Ecolab is a fast-paced dynamic place to work. Things are always changing, moving forward, cost cutting, profit focused."
good,Company is a fast pace place to work. Many different jobs to do through out the day.
good,Good company. Great benefits.  Good opportunity for advancement. Bonuses.  Good salary.  A lot of hours. You need to be dedicated to the job.  It's a full life comitment.
good,Great company overall. Bad work life balance. Depending on location foster a good ole boy mentality . Values safety above all which is great. Difficult to move up in the company
good,"As a contractor under Ecolab umbrella.  They offer a lot of benefits such as all your basics plus life insurance for spouse, kids, extra electives for pet insurance, car, renters, home, group law plan, PPE reimbursement etc. But, I feel the health insurance premium is still quite high.  My manager is great and responsive, no micromanaging. Unfortunately, my salary is a lot lower than likewise positions with another company.  I am bound to what our customer wants to pay.  If sales aren't there and the customer can't budget a pay increase, you will never see one.  There seems to be hardly any room for job growth and no year end bonuses for a contractor.  There is no merit increases even though you do a great job.  I get paid ok hourly, but is well out of the range of a full time employee that the customer would hire.  I don't hate the job by any means but a very stagnant position."
good,"The work life balance is extremely tough. Although pay can be good, at the price of always thinking about work and having things to do. the job never ends."
good,"I have a daily work schedule of 7am to 3 pm. Packed supplies for hospitals. Room is always clean and sanitary.Work with nice, decent coworkers. And not overworked."
good,"They say no snakes,  umm yes snakes. No training for snakes but they want you to handle cooper head nest with babies. "
good,"weak decision making"
good,Chemicals are very dangerous.  Health is of major concern working there. Pay is not enough for dangers of chemical exposure. Management is disconnected from employee needs.
good,"Company expects a lot out of their employees, with not enough compensation. Very Corporate. Very little free time for your own life.  Always on call. Great benefits, 401K"
good,Learned a lot in sales and how to manage work in an independent work environment.  Learned a lot of technical aspects of the job.  Hardest part of the job is the physicality of it.  Work life balance is not conducive for someone who has children.  May spend a lot of time during the day working your route.
good,"Présente l’entreprise comme « familiale », avec des personnes franche, or, à deux semaines de l’arret de mon contrat, après avoir suivi 3 mois de formation, je n’avais aucune idée de mon futur dans l’entreprise, bien dommage..."
good,"I worked for Nalco Champion, which is a wonderful group of people.  I was always less impressed with Ecolab Corporate. Ecolab did not appear to support Energy Services very well."
good,"Drawback is being on call daily and one weekend every two months.  Poor gas reimbursement for my position."
good,"If you are on contract basis you wont enjoy any of the benefits they provide to their staff. "
good,Nobody can compete with an Ecolab chemical program if it is presented correctly. We are not the cheapest but we provide the best results and the best overall value. It has been fun being able to match my excellent customer service skills with the quality of Ecolab's products. It has been the formula for my success
good,I enjoy the freedom and self motivation part of this job. One of the biggest reasons Im looking for more is because of the lack of career advancement in my position.
good,"Sales and service. 75% service 25% sales"
good,"The company is great. You get the opportunity to learn about so many different processes, network with tons of different companies. The only problem is you barely have time to breath. You will wear so many different hats, service tech, Food Safety specialist, Admin, Finance, etc. Also as a female there are no women. Some of the women I have met are amazing and strong, but even when reached out too are to focus on themselves to mentor another young women."
good,"If you like selling, installing, and servicing, while always being on call. This is for you."
good,"Company culture is very rigid and many of the employees have been there for many years.. There isn't much room for creativity or thinking outside the box. The normal workday is 8am-5pm, which is nice if you have a family."
good,Not in today's market keep looking high demands placed on individuals to perform. No overtime for working weekends. Being made to perform work ar nights. More resonsiblities being placed on individuals to keep cost down.
good,"Management does not understand how long it takes the worker to do the repair. Management does not have your back, they fix the blame and not the problem."
good,This is a giant corporation with shareholders.  So you need to be sales driven.  Otherwise this is not the place for you.  They constantly push and rate you by your metrics.
good,"Working with limited supervision, arrive at scheduled appointment', complete troubleshooting and appliance repair. Speaking with manufactures to obtain correct repair parts."
good,It wasn't a bad place to work. You made your own schedule and had a route to take care of. It was the constant calls both day and night that had me working 60 to 80 hours a week and i just couldn't handle it anymore.
good,Please see my review in the summary.  Ecolab is good company. The Institutional Division was the most profitable division at Ecolab. I just worked to much.
good,"Wonderful company, but little to no work/life balance,  expected to wear many hats but no financial benefit.  Management turnover as bad as hourly associates. Many employee resource groups."
good,When I was at Ecolab they were constantly pushing us to take on more work and giving us less free time. We were also under pressure to constantly learn new systems and new ways of doing things all the time which added to the load of new accounts all of the time. They also kept decreasing headcount adding more strain.
good,"great place to start, advancement is limited due to diminishing growth. demanding schedule and customers can make job stressful but overall not a bad job or company."
good,I worked over night shift with exolab which I did not mind. I function best.when allowed to set schedule based from my experience and time on route. However the management  would not allow propper time to establish and build relationships with customers. He.preferred rotation of accounts which in my opinion kills opportunity of establishing outstanding customer relations.
good,"If you like long days and some night work, exposure to dangerous pesticides, walking 3-5 miles a day carrying 10 to 20 pounds of gear for almost a living wage then this job is for you."
good,Ecolab gives you the flexibility to develop your own schedule.  However your role requires a lot of responsibility and sometimes your schedule is overbooked. Sales is the primary focus of all the roles but their is also a lot of physical labor involved.  TMs are responsible for fixing equipment and installing new equipment along with selling new solutions and products.  One major con is
good,A parte mais difícil do trabalho é atender uma indústria sozinho com pouco tempo
good,"Your typical day at work varies. It was one of the hardest, dirtiest  jobs I have ever worked. I enjoyed the camaraderie and the team that supported me. My direct supervisor was awesome. It was hard difficult managing my work life with home life. I luckily have a supporting wife and family. The benefits were good. "
good,A typical day at work for me really varies from day to day. One day I could be picking orders manually and digitally with assigned boxes. Another day I could be Manually manifesting shipping labels for small packed orders such as envelopes or occasionally for a box. Along with doing that I also verify the content labels on that go along with those shipping labels and then put those orders/boxes on the conveyor line that trails into a Fed Ex Freight truck. It can be physically and/or mentally demanding. I always look forward for lunch so I can wind down a bit to regain energy and be ready for the second half of the day.
good,I have found that this place of work was very easy to work for and it was all about safety and making sure that everyone was alright when they worked. Everyone got along with each other. The management was really nice when you had a problem they worked with you to fix it.
good,"Very hard to work, Our Supply Chain deal every week with at least 20 salesman manager."
good,"so.. the culture .. is ..  people are overly sensitive.. about others.. and think twice before clearly stating what they think."
good,"Days started early. Would visit about 7-8 accounts a day, accounts normally being restaurant, hotels, and schools. Worked alone, with contact coming from management only when concerns where raise. Little to no contact with co-workers. Hours were the toughest aspect, with pay and weekends off being the most enjoyable"
good,This company demands many hours and does not have a great work-life balance.  This career is very physical.  You are required to do a lot of electrical and plumbing work with min training.  This is not explained during the interview process.  Be sure that you are willing to use many tools and get very dirty.
good,My co-workers are very reliable and we were working together to get job done. Typically we get a lot of customer's samples to be analyzed  and I give the report to the writer/chemist.
good,"mainly working alone visiting clients to ensure top quality pest control services and organising work over the phone with colleagues. has a heavy but managable workload working with and learning about all variety of pests. most difficult part of job is managing own workload when helping a colleague or after annual leave. most enjoyable part of job is knowing clients have a clean and hygienic, pest free environment."
good,A typical day at work for me was to arrive early to get everything ready to start my day. I would pull my accounts to see if new payments had been applied and what my AR balance was on each account. The management was not supportive nor dependable. They were slow to respond to any problems or to resolve any issues that hindered you from doing your job. Most of my co-workers wanted to do their jobs but there were several that could care less how they did their job even if it affected someone else and prevented them from getting their done. There was a lack of dedication  and work ethic. The hardest part of my job was getting my supervisor to give me the support I needed to get my job done and to make decisions that was essential for me to be successful. The most enjoyable part of my job was being successful in collecting accounts that were in jeopardy without the support I needed but through perseverance and determination.
good,I spent 3 years working for this company I really enjoyed the job it made me feel like I was helping the community.  I made sure that the stores I called on had a understanding about food safety and its imporatnce to the general public
good,your life will be this job even when your off you have to worry about this job with emails and calls from customers and managers
good,"1.- Revisar la agenda"
good,Plenty of work through out the day. Very little supervision from management. Lots of overtime through the month.
good,"Worked thre for 3 years ... Day and night .pay was pretty good compared to others in the industry . The one thing that ticked me off was that I was in a serious automobile accident due to a medical condition . Granted they paid me for 6 months I was out but upon returning to work told me I was fired due to my medical condition which thy found out from accessing medical records w/o my permission . Mot of the techs don't have a clue and they were ,at the time, behind the times as far as pest control goes. Really? ... Should a restaurant continually have cockroaches after some one supposedly spends 2 hours at every week.? ... I could go on and on .....( 25 years in th business , ecolab was the worst 3)"

good,"A typical work day as a territory manager involves being on call for help calls 24 hours and acquiring sales to achieve budget. Everyday is a balancing act between sales and service. The management team is concerned about new account sales although much of your time is spent servicing damaged and malfunctioning equipment at current customer accounts. Some co-workers are really helpful and are willing to reach out helping hands on installs but most could care less about helping another associate. However, I have learned a lot about the sales process and how to provide excellent customer service."
good,"Modest Pay, flexible hours."
good,"solid company, demanding on your time, not a family environment and slow advancement,"
good,"order picking/pulling,packing and shipping,good workers.hardest part of job is no team work,or oranizational skills no room for growth and too much turnover as far as employees.(Kay Chemical plant)."
good,"not a bad job if you dont mind pests.Being on call can be a problem some times."
good,"The management is fair and good, the people that you work with are closed-minded and pick on the ""low man"" and fight amongst either all day and night it gets old quickly."
good,"Ecolab is okay, it seems like they don't have proper training but they care about employees well being and customers. Benefits are good and so is the support"
good,Ecolab is a sales centric company and does not want to invest for long term reliability and manufacturing excellence.  High degree of management turnover is a symptom of this issue.  Lots of opportunity but not a lot of career options long term.
good,The company offers a great retirement benefits package. They definitely try to balance work and family lifestyle. The job culture could use some improvement.
good,Location is very convenient and It is close to home and the most enjoyable part of the job is I have met some nice colleagues and we became good friends.
good,"not as i excepted when i joined its a mess... "
good,"Era uma empresa grande de muito valor , sentíamos segurança em ser funcionário . Porém atualmente foram feitas varias mudanças que interferido no ambiente de trabalho muita insegurança , redução de turnos saídas de pessoas experientes , trazendo insegurança para os funcionários"
good,Hard work. Stretched to achieve goals. Always treated with dignity and respect. Respected by customers for quality of product and service. Sometimes you feel under the gun to get everything done. You need to be able to mange time effectively.
good,Fast paced work place with a focus of safety and quality. Fellow co-workers are supportive and knowledgeable. Management sets you up to succeed and to further you professional development.
good,They have zero diversity and it is really unfortunate that they don’t hire the temporary workers to be full-time employees. Otherwise I really enjoyed working there just wished I had the same benefits as the full-time employees I worked next too.
good,"Productive and fun workplace . Working in wearhouse it was hot at times, I had the opportunity to learn the Lab as Lab assistant and some other areas. I enjoyed my time working there."
good,Some of the managers need to take some delivery courses but your co workers are your resources especially the ones that have 5+ years in the business they want to to see you succeed.
good,"If you work as RSM, or route sales technician be prepared to work horrendous hours."
good,"My role was very narrow and repetitive, leadership was not very supportive of flexible working arrangements."
good,Relaxed work environment the warehouse is very hot in the summer and you must have the proper PPE. They are somewhat disorganized on certain days; however its a relaxed atmosphere
good,Company with a lot of Company veterans which isn’t that bad until you preform better than them . The environment preaches teamwork yet pits individuals against one another. they have rates basically a number you need to hit everyday they post these numbers out in the one . They set up is horrible and the pickers tend to not give a dam where they drop your materials now as the clock ticks you have to go search for your materials moving this to get to that 😖you just spent 20 minutes now you are behind your breaks are paid on the clock so you can’t work you have two ten minute breaks and one twenty minute...you just spent another 20 minutes finding materials at the end of the day you will be asked why didn’t you make rate ..........it’s not healthy to deal with this kind of environment it’s sooo toxic and exhausting you try your best to hit numbers and go home yet everyday you have to explain the difficulties/excuses that you have had thru the day that you have already bought to the comparison attention ..at the end of the day they dnt give a ish about why they just want those stupid soap dispensers....STAT !!!!!p.s: you do get a 500$ bonus!!!!!1st check
good,Ecolab is a solid company. Very focused on customer relations and service. Ecolab is a global organization with many divisions. The business book is extensive which keeps you busy.
good,"wonderful place to work "
good,great opportunity when first starting. learned a lot of new skills to do with insects and pests. confidence and people skills improved. company van provided and work mobile to contact business .
good,"I'm glad I was able to move on from Ecolab. "
good,"- Good company to start at entry level;"
good,"This Company overall is a good company to work for, For me it did not work out because I was very sensitive to the products used.If You are a person that can handle long overnight hours and strong chemicals, this job will work for you."
good,"Responsible for maintaining multi-million-dollar relationships within the Mid-Atlantic and South-Central Region by consulting both the customer and internal sales team.  Role required cross functional relationships across procurement department and Ecolab service members.  Position utilized negotiation, forecasting, and relationship building with goal of protecting profitability, producing new organic business, and building brand within Foodservice, Hospitality, and Long-Term Care markets."
good,"There is no time to have fun at the work area, because we have to work through the shift. The management is not being fair to the contractor and I am a hard worker and I 'd like to be treated equally."
good,"I am uncomfortable answering these questions in this venue.  If they come up in an interview, I will answer them then, but not here.  I do not agree with this format of questioning.  Sorry, just my opinion.  Take care."
good,It was ok to work there but they could have a better training program with employees. It was overall a good place to work but if the training sector could be better and the employees would have a better understanding of the job they are asked to perform
good,"No work life balance, good if you're single and older with not much to do. you are on call 24/7."
good,Great place to work you will have to order inventory your own supplies and stay on top of customer demand. Sales is a great way of earning extra income and when you have dirty quick serve food places this extra income is very easy to take advantage of.
good,"Plan your day out the night before. Wake up early and try to start by going to your customers and checking in on them and making sure they have everything they could need. Fixed and plumbing or electrical issues that are effecting your dispensers for them, and then ask them if they need anything else. If a customer calls you, call them back within an hour and then go and take care of the issue. In your off time prospect new potential customers, and make sure to get done with any PC work that you have left for the day. Once home, finish up your PC work and download your data each night."
good,"I didn't work here for too long to know all the details and their offerings. At the time I needed a job and EcoLab was what I found."
good,"Plenty of opportunities for advancement, some transfer and relocation required at times. Senior management are supportive and interact well with middle management."
good,A fun company with a fair manager the instructions on how do the job was clear the fellow employees were funny and well work orientated. The job was one of the best but it wasn't for me.
good,"I enjoyed working here.   It is just a bit too fast pace for me and I was looking for something different.  Good people good place, but, not for me anymore"
good,Ecolab is a company with great opportunity to grow with the company. The garland plant has associates with long tenor and the plant atmosphere is very family oriented.
good,"Es una empresa buena, preocupada por capacitar al personal, pero muy absorvente en tiempos"
good,"During the time i was employed here i was under poor management. they allowed problems among employees linger on instead of addressing them which made issues grow. Management seemed to lack conflict resolution skill. I enjoyed the challenge but i understand the environment is not for everyone, not everyone wants to feel like they're in a competition so if you cant handle that i wouldn't pick this job. Great news though, the department i was working in is now under new leadership"
good,"If you don't have a family to go home to and have no life, this is the job for you. Good money to be made and great benefits, all at the expense of any free time. "
good,"For me represents a good surrounding for safety life of my son and me till the specific time."
good,"This is a fast paced sales and service company with a focus on Sales.  A typical day is visiting customers, servicing company machines and up-selling products."
good,"Ecolab is very product line oriented.  While the field, in some areas, work together across product lines, internally there seems to be some disconnects. "
good,"it was a good place to work, i made my own hours and got to meet a lot of people each day. the people i worked with helped me out when ever they could.  you got to work out of your home."
good,May opportunities exist within the organisation. There are many diverser job roles and the opportunity for progression is vast. The company works hard to ensure the workers remain positive.
good,I enjoyed my time their and it was a good building block on my engineering skills.  The guys are knowledgeable and hardworking.
good,If you learn well from reading books and going on your own this is the place for you. If you end up with a good team you'll be alright.
good,Company employs a very lean staffing strategy.  Financial performance is solid.  Compensation and benefits are adequate.  Work environment is average.
good,"Empresa dinamica com otimo planejamento financeiro."
good,"É uma boa empresa de trabalhar benefício bons ."
good,"working at Parmalat ive also learn a lot, how to check stock,, off load stock, how to do stock count, management was average, i love working at Parmalat  the guys normally made me feel welcom seeing that we were only 3 ladies working in the Warehouse with guys,"
good,"Ecolab was a great job for the first 3 years of employement. After making budget for 3 consecutive years, I had multipule problems with alocation of sales to my accounts. Management did not help after numerous attempts to rectify the situation by myself. They then used this reason to cut my employement. My 4th year I had 97% sales. During my 5th year I was at 91%, and my missing sales would maybe not have put me at 100%, but very close. "
good,"My job experiance at Ecolabe was one of my best ones due to:"
good,It was OK I loved working for them I wish I could of stayed but it was temporary.We also had pizza parties because we always made our quarters for that month.
good,The management was a tipically multinational area. It had advanteges and disadvanteges. I wanted to continue to develop my skills.
good,"The location was fantastic, being on a busline was extremely helpful.  Not having to drive was great, especially in the winter. "
good,Great place to work. I learned allot form my colleagues and also enjoyed working with them. What I liked was the variety of work we did.
good,fast paced. always moving which helps the day go by. you rotate jobs from day to day so its not repetitive which is nice. you fill bottles and pack them
good,"Ecolab was a good company to work for. The team did a great job and was focused on creating results. Long days were somewhat normal, but you do what you need to do."
good,A good product line and in a good market place. Too big and can be easily lost in the career development. Benefits are above average.
good,High stress environment transitioning to TPM lean processes.  High turnover and lots of overtime.  Communication issues are a constant problem.  Good people trying to solve the same old problems.
good,"Great company, great benefits.  Going in a different direction than originally led to believe.  Work load too much for one person."
good,"empresa boa, sofreu muito com a crise, me desliguei por uma proposta melhor de trabalho."
good,"would not work for them again.Always working. no family life.Constant work , low pay, always increasing sales budgets impossible to meet. Always changing account base."
good,"• Develop and enhance existing relationships with customers while working independently and maintaining your own schedule"
good,"Good work culture"
good,"driving, then service equipment. Hours dependant on customer needs no steady hours., vary daily."
good,Ecolab's pay and benefits are far above the rest. The management team was very supportive.
good,"A typical day at work included many hours of work off the time clock.in order to have enough time to manage customers and setting appointments. I learned a significant deal of management, behaving as a self employed contractor working out of my home. The hardest part of my job was time management. Conducting a repair with a equivalent time quote of is very challenging. "
good,"It was a nice experience work for Ecolab"
good,I felt I got lost in a big company life Ecolab. I found it difficult to find value in role.
good,"My colleagues were very friendly and easy to get along with.  Management had an open door policy, which made bringing matters to their attention when necessary very easy.  I learned about the food and beverage industry and what Ecolab has to offer the world. The hardest part of my job was sometimes having to say ""No"".  I enjoyed booking travel and accommodation and being able to train staff on a new system that was introduced.  A project that was mine from the beginning of the introduction process."
good,I assembled all day small jobs I loved what I did. The co- workers were very understanding. if you need help with anything you could ask anyone in your area. I learned how to use tools and how to fix and put together a lot of different materials
good,"Didn't vibe well with supervisor, pressed for work to get out in a timely manner. Some co-workers seemed to be to themselves.  Like doing the work, but given too much to do in a short time was stressful"
good,I really didn't like this particular job because I was the salesman for one account.
good,"-Gained valuable work experience."
good,"Trabalho nas empresas tanto externa e internas;"
good,I've gained valuable Project Managment skills which allowed me to manage and complete business critical projects. working for this Global company have given me Management here are very accommodating to personal needs. Co-workers are very helpful and fun to work with.
good,The pay is good. The benefits are excellent. some traveling involed.
good,"need to respect time off more, need to support the little man for he is the one who produces the numbers for management."
good,it has been a good learning experience. i have learnt plenty. and im still learning. good co workers. managemanet treat staff well.
good,Good step in career . Hours based on work needed. Interesting salary/commission system.
good,"Busy, family oriented company striving on growth. The co-workers are lovely. I learned how to manage time properly in a fast paced environment. They are working hard to promote Culture and Inclusion."
good,Fast Paced Environment
good,"Job could be what you make of it. Advancement for qualified associates doesn’t happen as often as it should. Also, for leek based sales positions, you will be doing more service then sales."
good,"Need to be handy with a wrench. Aggressive sales. No loyalty between customer and company.  Customers will switch vendors behind your back.  Very physical work. "
good,"Look, here's the REAL DEAL on this company from someone who not only worked for them, but has been in the past control industry for nearly 30 years."
good,"..start at 6am.. ..visit accounts.. ..come home at 5pm.. ..paperwork/emails until 6pm.. ..the most challenging part of the job was being on call 24hours a day.. ..after working 12 hours you are still technically working, you may be called back out into the field at anytime to go repair equipment.."
good,"Boa para iniciar no mercado ,porem plano de carreira limitado ,por ter varios parentes na mesma divisao as escolhas acabam sendo por interesses familiares e nao profissionais.."
good,"Ecolab is far too large and dynamic of a company for a review to totally encapsulate what it will be like working there, but let me share something since I worked for Ecolab Pest Elimination in 2 different states."
good,Not a bad company just the work life balance is tough.  Budgets are for the most part tough to obtain.  Management is a little discounted from the day to day.
good,The pay raises every year are only 3 percent. When I asked for a raise they wouldn't give one. They told me they don't give raises other than the annual one.
good,Great people and wonderful Global corporate culture. Great place to develop and grow under the right management and leadership. Challenging work environment.
good,"*Camaraderie in the workplace and enthusiastic work culture"
good,Ecolab is a place you can be proud to work because of how you help your customers and how the mission of the company is focused on doing good things to help the world.
good,"Ecolab was a great place to work until we bought another company to create a division. The pay was nice as were the benefits package. The healthcare was fantastic. The only, I really do mean only downside was the work/life balance. You truly manage your territory. The downside to that is when something needs fixed or taken care of there is only you to depend on. You are the only one who fixes things. On call 24/7."
good,"Muita política, difícil de ser promovida, benefícios de mercado"
good,"Enjoyed working with the folks there they made the day pass quickly. The work was steady and at times a little more than it should have been when I first started, but Management worked hard to make changes to decrease the overtime hours."
good,"Ecolab is a restaurant replacement warehouse It is very strenuous work having to pick up item that can weigh up to 50 or 60 pounds.  In a normal working day an individual would open boxes that have been stacked on pallets for employees to work from and get the packing slip and enter the po number in the correct field in the computer system that is used (synapse).  Once all that is done, then the employee will receive in what product they have on the packing slip and place it on a cart for put away."
good,"Excellent benefits, 401k match, pension, company car for personal use. Recession proof sales career with plenty of room for growth"
good,"It is common practice to be assigned work outside of what you were hired for.  Leading to Long days, working weekends, and sometimes holidays to deliver."
good,"Great benefits, but the culture needs a change. "
good,"The company goes above and beyond to educate its employees they invest a lot in the employees however the starting wage was really low they entice new employees with sales pitches of bonuses and 100,000 a year in 5 years time however the new managers do everything they can to save the company money by finding excuses not to give bonuses and rises they are constantly changing policy and procedures as a decoy to improve wages bonus and salary advancement."
good,"Uma empresa que oferece grande aprendizado. Apesar da gestão não ser boa, tínhamos um bom rendimento em equipe."
good,A typical day was seeing 5-8 customers.  For the most part management is hands off.  Must be a self starter and organized.  You get to set your own schedule and time commitments.  The job can be lonely with limited interaction with coworkers.  You are on call during the week and on a rotation for weekends and holidays.
good,Com boa localização e ótimo ambiente de trabalho. mas o contrato era temporário.
good,"Knowledgeable management will help you develop skills that carry into your future. Work associates were friendly, and it made for a great work environment. Low pay will force you to find new opportunities."
good,"I clock in when I get into my service vehicle. I drive to my first account which is usually a quick service account. I inspect the building and check all exterior and interior traps. then I go back through in the interior and spray a residual, dust, and bait. I usually have about 6 average accounts a night but you can work ahead. I learned a lot about how to inspect different restaurant buildings and learned how to get rid of unwanted pests. My co-workers are very laid back and will offer to help you. hardest part is we don't get paid what we used to anymore to put up with customers and upper management we put up with. the most enjoyable part is having a service vehicle to go from place to place and having a fuel card."
good,"Elaborar planos estratégicos das áreas de comercialização, marketing e comunicação para empresas alimentícias, executar atividades e reportar suas execuções, assessoria a equipe, setores técnicos e comerciais da empresa, gerenciar recursos humanos, administrar recursos materiais e financeiros e promover condições de segurança, saúde, preservação ambiental e qualidade."
good,"Never know whats going to happen during each day. There are some days I can be done working around 3pm, but then there are some days I wont get done working until 9pm."
good,Ecolab has an excellent training program that invest in the employees Sales and Mechanical knowledge. I enjoyed working with all the different customer I met on a weekly basis.
good,pay to low for the work you do and very fast pace for the pay you receive the pieces was small small I could not grasp them fast enough
good,"enjoy people I work with."
good,"2nd level customer service"
good,"Recoger equipos, llevarlos  a la empresa a trabajar, instalarlos, verificar su adecuado funcionamiento. Tomar muestras de otro tipo segun requerimiento. Al dia siguiente retirar equipos y elaborar informe"
good,As I wasn't permanent I can't comment on much. While I was there I enjoyed my job and kept busy. The employees and management was pleasant
good,"Empresa que proporciona estabilidade de emprego, a direção é bastante acessível para todos os níveis, a equipe é bastante participativa na resolução dos problemas, a parte mais difícil é de atração de novos funcionários devido a localização da empresa, a parte agradável é o clima da empresa onde todos as áreas se comunicam muito bem com as outras."
good,"Job is very strenuous and no time for your personal things . "
good,"Depending on management you will have a good, learning experience or you will have to learn for yourself. COmpensation is limited and not competitive for the job you do although the work you do will be essential to the company."
good,"Working in maintenance I found that the initial plant equipment and routines prevented maintenance training could be better than it is. There are other employees well qualified to do the training, but are not assigned to do it."
good,"trabajar en equipo y buena armonia  saber comunicar en tiempo y forma cualquier desviacion los directores siempre te apoyan en las decisiones que tomas"
good,"Great company and great culture, but in the Pest Division the workload is crazy. Expect to work 10 hour days minimum if you want decent pay and to not fall behind on your route. Call backs and unpredictable hours make it really hard to balance work, life, and sleep."
good,"I enjoy working at Ecolab. They prefer to promote from within, and like to keep their people around. One challenge within EcoSure in particular, is that as you move up in in position and responsibility there is less direct support to help fulfill your responsibilities. High level of turnover makes transitions challenging for customers."
good,The company makes it harder than it needs to be but that corporate america. Good benefits but long days and high pressure budgets to achieve. Can grow and do well if you are placed  in a good territory.
good,"Education system is Well and gives you full description to understand your work and have more knowledge on Pest side,and also give you opportunity on knowing how to interact with Clients"
good,"I've thoroughly been appreciative of my time at Ecolab, but the compensation package, benefits especially, has not kept pace with the rest of the job market in my area.  Hence, I am looking for a higher paying job after having a great deal of time in with the company."
good,"I had 3 different supervisors in the first 60 days of employment. Evaluations were late and vague, with non-specific goals. Focus of management was on minor, insignificant tasks versus more important tasks such as not having pick errors and quality of the product getting shipped to the customer. The HR department (2 people) were busy or out of the office about 75% of the time."
good,"You were on call most of the time. Loved my customers and they took care of me. The benefits and 401k were good. The area i worked in was rural so not a lot of time with my coworkers.However, I did like the people in my district."
good,Im lucky to have got this job when I did. Although my education didn't prepare me for the type of work I would be doing. My School prepared me for residential HVAC/appliances and this job was commercial and larger scaled equipment. The school did present me with confidence to diagnose and repair equipment and with the help of senior associates successfully repaired  equipment
good,"Ecolab is a good company that provides decent pay and benefits. Depending on your department, it can be tough for promotions sometimes. The work/life balance was really good."
good,"Pay is Ok but it all depends on the territory you are assigned to, if you get a dead area, its very difficult to achieve budget or make desired money. Quality of life is not very good, plan on having a call center contact you if there is an issue at anyone of your 150 plus accounts at any point."
good,Having been with ecolab for 4 years I have only had 2 pitiful pay rises. The senior management are only interested in making money for the American owners and not in looking after their staff.
good,"Empresa dinâmica, ambiente agradável, com grandes possibilidades de crescimento profissional,."
good,"Empresa multinacional, ainda sem muitos benefícios para oferecer mas há um grande fluxo de trabalho e com isso, bastante aprendizado."
good,They expect you to use a wide array of skills and applications.  That is an excellent way to increase your value going forward.
good,"I had the privilege of working 15 years for a company that treated me fair. I would often work in excess of 10 hours per day. Sometimes I had to work weekends. I worked the graveyard shift. I had to learn about people, customer service and sales. I had good fair local management throughout my years with this company. Good co-workers. Working graveyards was difficult on one's health. The benefits were good at the company."
good,"My manager offered a flexible schedule.  I was able to work from home if needed.  If I had a doctor's appointment my manager let me work around it no questions ask."
good,"Ecolab is an excellent company in many ways, such as stock options, as well as a company vehicle, and even a pension after 5 years. "
good,"Northern Pipe Line Construction for the time I was employed"
good,I provide service for a route with about 100 customers. I ensure that my customers pass health inspection by maintaining and repairing large dish machines and chemical dispensing systems.
good,"Benefits are good, pay is terrible. Great job if you don't have a life...they want you available 24/7."
good,"Good job to really dial in your technical skills, great training and educational options and advancement.Long hours and sometimes dangerous work, defiantly a shock for those who are not used to working as a service technician."
good,Pay is good. Mandatory overtime during week and weekends. U never know if you are working the weekend so you can't buy tickets to any concert or show ever
good,Very confusing pay system. People could influence type of accounts they received. Easy vs difficult. It seemed some people could do less on accounts to get more pay. Apps go down and make working difficult and slow.
good,Good Company. I would work for them anytime. Management is good and culture is good. enjoyable part of the job is the freedom you get and people you meet along the  way in this job
good,"You can develop the work of the company, opportunities for growth and specialization, as well as having a good work environment. Constant training, and updates, the work is multidisciplinary."
good,"Ecolab has very high expectations of it's employees however it also compensates greatly to offset this. During my time here the stress level of the job may have grown, but the company believes in what it is doing and offers many resources to assist you in achieving this."
good,Ecolab is a good company and will teach you to think for yourself and learn to work with others.  The issue I have is that promotions are not always based on merit...sometimes it appears that promotion is based on gender and who you know.
good,"Every day is different. Employees have the ability to make their own schedule and visit the customers they want to visit each day, which is a nice benefit."
good,"I took early retirement due to wifes health. After making budget almost every year and being the number one SSDM in North America  in 2014 I have no regrets, The wife is healthy now and I am ready to use my talents again."
good,Great culture and education. It has been too many years since my time of employment to give an accurate review of current employment opportunities. I would work with EcoLab again.
good,"Assemble products per specification, manually packaging products into corrugate cases, recording device history records, replenishing raw materials needed on assembly lines, load all necessary products onto machine and provide preventative maintenance on machines. Made medical equipment for every hospital in jacksonville"
good,Es una empresa donde se podía trabajar cómodamente y donde la actividad diaria permitía un buen balance entre vida personal y laboral.
good,Company has great benefits. However their is no work life balance and the amount of work is overwhelming. Their expect to you to work all night and then go back on call at 3 p.m. I have not slept 8 hours a night since excepting this position. I would not recommend this job to anyone who is married as their is no time for family.
good,The most typical day at work was my first day when I joined the organisation as I was not aware of the working culture and other details but somehow I managed to complete my joining details and typical day day turn out be good one when HR manger arranged a dinner for all freshers.
good,There is a lot that comes at you many challenges but if you are a good organizer and enjoy the fast pace style you will do well
good,"Home based role targeting portfolio accounts spending up to 100k, new business target of 500k. Learned about janitorial & distribution markets. Management were very arrogant. Hardest part of job was internal politics. Most enjoyable part of the job were the customers & distribution partners."
good,They will take care of you and give you the tools to perform the job but they will always chose the customer over you! Combination hours are also part of job meaning 1st/2nd/3rd shifts all in the same month
good,Job and coworkers were great managers some were alright to work for others were terrible to deal with. Pay benefits are excellent training and safety very good.
good,It is a typical corporate environment.  Senior leadership is not interested in innovative solutions that deliver real needed value to hospital customers.  The structure and culture is such that they will lose all the people that are valuable to sales groups and customers.  Nice people though I wish them luck.
good,Typical day of work was long and hard.
good,"Ecolab is a safety conscious company for its employees and clients. It has multiple departments that work effectively together as one.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment with the great support structure of coworkers. It provides different challenges everyday, thus there is never a dull moment."
good,"set hours , job security , peek season of over time. pay is steady  typical day of bending production lines, and climate controlled warehouse setting ."
good,"Did not follow through on some of their promises. I did enjoy some parts of the job, the customers were great. Management was good. I did not expect to be working on dish machines in a sales position."
good,"Não consigo mudar meu cargo com uma Graduação e Diploma, local muito bom para trabalho, pessoas incríveis e profissionais, empresa fornece tudo , principalmente para segurança do trabalhador"
good,The day began entering commands into the system serving customers. All customers are corporate accounts. I liked resolve all customer situations and be satisfied
good,"trabalho corrido,pois era resposavel por recebimento, armazenagem e distribuição de equipamentos para todo o Brasil.Alem deinventários, parte de compras e PCP."
good,"Dia a dia de trabalho inclui visita técnica a clientes, na área de utilidades, análise do sistema de geração de vapor e de resfriamento onde é realizado a analise de todo o sistema, com finalidade de obter melhores resultados, economia e qualidade do sistema."
good,"Very good company to  work for just not  in  my district , 3 years working overnight  and was blocked by  managment when I tried to transfer to another division or  to another district"
good,i learned a lot about quality packaging the coworkers some of them who had been there foryears did not take kindly to new hires and found reasons to get them fired very stressful environment but great pay
good,"Ecolab is just a sales company. They don't have any real support for their sales team. Sell, make or exceed budget. or move on."
good,"Managers are not really experienced on team building and communication, especially training. They need to train the managers more and not base advancement on sales alone, just because one an sell doesn't mean their capable of running a team"
good,"This company expects that you will be grateful to work for them and as such they expect you to work 60-80 hours a week to make sales. Sales, every position in this company is sales related and you are expected to make your quota each term or they will fire you."
good,"Work environment is typical of a company that's too big to know its employees. you are employee number ***** "
good,"Daily...Liaise with clients, completing of daily worksheets,"
good,"A great place to work, however the pay structure includes your ""benefits"" 401k match, insurance, stock options etc as part of your pay.  If you are told you will make 50K take 20% out for the 'company paid' portion of your check that you will never see."
good,"Typical Day at Ecolab comprises of socuting new business accounts & at the same time ensuring that the existing ones are serviced well."
good,What Ecolab does is so important to the world. Management in payroll department is poor.  Work/life balance is not very good.  Compensation not competitive.
good,Great wage and benefits however work life balance needs improvement. A typical workday is filled with challenges you have to be mentally prepared to handle. I enjoy working with good people.
good,demanding but pretty good job....you work alot but pay isnt that bad . enjoyable part of the job is meeting all the new customers some really great people out there
good,"long daily schedule of outgoing orders, coworkers were always helpful with product questions, management never present for questions and problems unless required, and I was able to learn about myself and others."
good,"The management needs to work well with thier team, be honest to the people who leave thier family before sunrise and only after sunset. to spend all day don't take lunch break because of the work load that needs to done closing date and the short of staff. Workers needs to be compensated for the time they sacrifice to help the company. Thank you"
good,"Like any other job, management makes all the difference in the world on how well you will like your job. The job in not ""dig a ditch"" hard but your are very active and it is definitely not a desk job."
good,"Stable but challenging work environment. Priorities change very frequently. People are nice and friendly really care for each other. "
good,"A large area was assigned, and it was difficult to find the work/life balance.  Was assigned a new manager that never lived in the Midwest and was not aware of the necessary windshield time to achieve success."
good,"Ecolab provided no work/life balance due to a demanding industry. Commercial kitchens, hospitals, restaurants, and etc. require attention to be sure they are sanitizing properly at all times to avoid illness."
good,the Area Manager where I worked was not the nicest guy to work for. I was called a liar by him and that ruined my experience and limited my advancement with the company.
good,"Moved up fairly quickly, but then wasn't able to advance any futher. Management lacks communication. Co-workers are very friendly."
good,"Flexible hours of working. Very interesting role, i able so many things in one day, begin with with con-call, then meeting with customers, do sales presentation and afternoon doing training in the restaurants. "
good,The company sold industrial cleaning products and we put together the soap dispensers that the cleaning products would go into. They are the ones in stores or even out on farms. We would make sure the equipment would work and packed them up to be shift to different locations.
good,"Unfortunately I am not a salesperson so this career path did not work out for me."
good,"tenso por se tratar de Cemitério;"
good,"In the manufacturing plants the work day is very intense and stressful, but the corporate strategy is excellent, looking at the future and slowly enacting change so that the plants  eventually reach a World Class level.  Unfortunately the pace towards that goal is very slow, so the general feeling is that the company is still very immature in terms of processes, documentation, accountability, and management."
good,"Ecolab's benefits are exceptional. However, the territory sizes on the Eastern Shore of Maryland are too large.  75% of your time is spent driving.  Extremely difficult to see all your customer with emergency calls that seem to come in multiple times per day which makes you zig-zag all across Delmarva."
good,Ecolab as a company and a culture is first rate.  In the Cleveland area the managers are not a team.  They instead spend a lot of their time trying to out flank each other.  You can become a victim in the crosshairs.  Great company lousy Ohio management team.
good,"Great company to work for busy environment good work life balance career opportunities within the company, great easy going culture like a family excellent"
good,"Great Eagan location with a cafeteria and lunchroom, walking paths, and geese to connect you with nature. The people greet you as you walk past them in the hall. That is a good sign."
good,"Empresa que respeita os funcionários, fidedigna com seus compromissos, bem reconhecido no mercado nacional e internacional"
good,"Pros: "
good,The company was a good company to work for. Being around pesticides is a big factor in leaving. Compensation was fair but work life to balance was not.
good,"Empresa com um ritmo de trabalho bem movimentado, acelerado, com bons colegas de trabalho"
good,"Una empresa con muchas facilidades para desarrollar habilidades y crecimientos, no obstante no cuidan el aspecto humano familiar, mucha rotación por las cargas de trabajo repercute en poca sensibilidad por el equilibrio laboral y familiar."
good,"There didn't seem to be a lot of work/life balance within Ecolab. If you wanted to take time off it felt like others on your team would judge you. Many managers that I encountered were just shuffled from one area to another, so they lacked the experience and knowledge of each group. This isn't good for the morale or the support the teams need. "
good,There  is a nice walking path around the building and Ecolab put in ping pong tables and bean bag area to enjoy on lunch hour and breaks.  Hardest part of the job is managing all the different style people you interact with.
good,Good place to work. Benefits are getting too expensive and management is poor. Shift is very workable as they are 12 hours. No training program and 2 tier wage scale
good,"Currently there has been less communication for advancement and follow-up from senior management compared to previous years. The ultimate goal had become less clear and the work load has slowly been increased to the field associates. The work place culture has always been positive and encouraged. The most difficult objective to overcome in recent years has been the unclear requests from senior management to drive the overall goal and success at the field level. A  typical day includes customer interaction, meetings, conflict resolution, time management adjustments for the managed team, specific/strategic sales metrics and  planning for the sales team. Currently I work very closely with Human Resources on talent development and other key initiatives for the field."
good,"Friendly environment to work at, fast paced job, good management and the hardest part of my job is achieving 100% daily. I dislike the late start time for 1st shift hours."
good,"the job of territory manager is very demanding, the pay and benefits are very good, but the organization is extremely big and bureaucratic,  which allows poor managers to stay in position for many years as long as they ""cover their butt"""
good,Rural Route coverage of 146 accounts over 132 square miles.  Constantly driving to and from accounts with little time to spend with the family with no weekend time.
good,Ecolab is a numbers driven organization. They have the process down and the sales reps know exactly what they need to do to meet their daily goals.  The company offers great growth and advancement to sales reps.  There is a clear career path for all sales people to advance within the company and the pay is good.  The product is one I could easily stand behind.   The sales teams are all good guys and gals to work with.  Great personalities.  Managers can be mix - but in every company there are always a couple jerks.  For the most part the managers were easy to work with.   I managed the field support office.  The office environment was pleasant and the job duties were reasonable.   There is no advancement opportunities for office people.  The company culture is strong and positive.  Overall a good place to work.
good,"NO Work Life Balance. Customers call for ridiculous reasons and Management approach is ""your account, your problem"". Ecolab fails to recognize that is an Ecolab customer before it is my account. Management calls and e-mails during off hours and weekends."
good,Good benefits n incentives n used to be able to adjust to your own schedule but with the changes it's More suited for a young single person who can invest their time to make it worthwhile.
good,"My day consisted of maintaining the equipment in the SRT room. Scheduling for contractors to come on site to make warranty repairs. Order parts needed to fix the equipment. Maintain the building systems, plumbing, HVAC, security system, etc... I enjoyed the close relationship that I had with the management staff and the associates."
good,"You work by yourself from your work phone and take home vehicle.  Each month will have accounts on your phone, typically same each month with addition of extra calls/pages."
good,"Lack of moving with the market and adopting with the changes in the market is not their never want to do any thing new."
good,Overall the job and pay was very good.  The new management that was recently put in placed is horrible.  They do take care of all your gas and tool expenses.  My customer base was also amazing; which is why i stayed in the same area for so long
good,"I loved my co-workers. The management was not a good advocate for their teams and employees but overall I learned a lot! I gained a lot of experience with the SAP systems and learned great leadership skills. The customers, reps and district administrators are all fun and positive individuals."
good,I was in customer service taking calls from customers and handling orders that came in from the representative. I enjoy talking to people in person or on the phone. The people I worked with were awesome and I really enjoyed it. I received a promotion to asset leasing where I am currently working within Ecolab.
good,Schedule can be very flexible schedule besides working weekends.  Provided a company car.   Work with a very great team of people.
good,"Um ótimo lugar para trabalhar, supervisão e gerecia aberta a conversar."
good,Loved the sales end of the job.  Traveled locally over 400 miles weekly.  Education about professional cleaning systems and chemicals.
good,"In my line of current work, I honestly do not have a typical day. One service trip I could be changing out RO membranes and the next trip I could be installing a 3DTrasar unit or troubleshooting a system or replacing parts. I learned that you have to be the subject-matter expert and versatile and be able to think and act quickly strategically when you're in the field and the face to the customer. The management when it was just Ecolab was great but recently they acquired another company and their management style isn't fitting my personality. I'm the type of guy that knows what I need to get done and I go do it. An analogy I would use is like a sniper. I'm a team player,  I don't need to be micro-managed and I get the job done. My co-workers are good people but most of the time I'm on-site by myself. There really isn't a hardest part of my job. I've been doing this for 13 years now so there really isn't a situation I run into or a project I get called on that I don't know how to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is the travel."
good,Excessive email work after a 8-10 hour day They promise you the world but in reality they use you . Promotions are not based on your success and exceeding company goals
good,A empresa Ecolab é tem responsabilidade com seu colaborador.
good,Sales and service job requires significant time and dedication. My territory was in western Canada and was very challenging based on the physical geography as well as the territory size.
good,If it wasn't for the managers I had it would have been a more dreadful to work here plus they are outsourcing our department. It was a good first job but not a career.
good,Nice people a lititle boring.  Repetitive lifting and a lot of standing on a stand up forklift driving.  Very clean environment. Also it's a very fast pace job.
good,Fine job. just looking to be closer to home. good hours and good work environment. I recommend this job to young people that aren’t scared to work hard
good,"This is an inbound call center position that requires you to stay on the tip of your toes. Managing on average 150+ calls a day from the United States and Canada from fast food restaurants and grocery stores assisting with basic equipment troubleshooting, product orders, and dispatching territory representatives when necessary."
good,"I did a variety of work there, mainly material handling.  When receiving was slow I pulled orders for jobs for other departments.  I still know almost everyone's names I worked with there, and it's been over 20 years since a worked there.  It was my first real job and I really enjoyed my time there.  They even had a going away party for me when I decided to relocate with my parents."
good,"The company is good. Expectations for what should be done in a day was unrealistic and support to those goals was non-existent."
good,"As a Route Sales manager the typical day is spent driving to various restaurants / hotels servicing dish machines, checking inventory and recommending new products to businesses that range from very busy to just plain slow.  You need to understand the cleaning potential of chemicals you provide and the conditions the machine operators keep the equipment, if the dishwasher is rarely drained and cleaned it's very difficult to keep the glass ware crystal clear."
good,Nice place to work. Employee are hard working and dedicated. Environment is full of enthusiastic workers. I hope I would definitely return there once.
good,You have to be self driven to be successful. It's like having your own business to run but under Ecolab overhead. It can be a lot to handle at times due to business structure. High Stress job but if you're organized you will succeed.
good,"Empresa ótima para desenvolver competências, para quem gosta de ser desafiado a melhorar a cada dia, esta é uma excelente opção."
good,"Laid back, not very flexible about working home, but going home by 5:00 was typical. Management are decent number driven. There is a little bit of clashing between Ecolab and Nalco."
good,"High turnover rate, but good solid work if you try your best. Opportunity for growth within the company, but it's best to have a career goal so they can point you in the correct direction."
good,"Overall it was good work place with friendly staff, a lot of affordable food places and trucks, public transportation is also available the only main issue was the parking"
good,"The Eagan facility has great amenities such as walking paths, fireplace in lunch room , on-site meal service, on-site health club, on site credit union."
good,"Bonne entreprisé, structuer solide et formation intenre"
good,Thankful for the opportunity that i was giving to work within an excellent company. The staff was very helpful in assisting trainee's with the protocol.
good,I learned a lot about the industry . I took advantage of understanding methodology of running a service company an brought it with me to other companies to enhance their profits and work flow.
good,Gteat place yo wotk working with chemicals and placing lids on product. Sit down and slow pace 3 breaks and first shift is smooth would likely return if asked
good,"Great place to work, but poor managers to work with. Don't seem to have a pulse on what the field needs. "
good,Busy days at work. Learned how to work well with other associates from different shifts. Management was ok. Workplace culture was more about safety. hardest part of the job was dealing with certain supervisors who took there role overboard and looked down on employees as if they are better than them. most enjoyable part was working with fellow coworkers.
good,fast pace and a lot to do in not too much time with time requirements.  The community was fairly self contained as in they didn't leave their cube much.
good,"This job is fast paced. And requires a lot of work, cleaning up after technician's messes. The managers are pretty good though. I like the office personnel."
good,"I worked at Ecolab several years ago.  This is a small operation of a large Fortune 500 with excellent benefits, but a small company with a small company feel."
good,"Ecolab is a good company to work for due to its benefits and people.  You will work hard,  a lot of hours but the pay off will be worth it.  I recommend that you look up the Ecolab web site for openings"
good,Learned lots of mechanical and electrical skills. They give you your own vehicle to travel and gas card. Lots of little perks and they truly help out the best they can.
good,"After 20 years of faithful service, a spiteful regional v.p. fired me for inquiring about filling gaps in the routes. All of us were working 50-70 hours a week and we wanted a break. I was there a long time so took on myself to ask at a district meeting where the aforementioned regional v.p. was in attendance. He took offense to my question and sought to dismiss me. A couple months later he did."
good,If you enjoy eliminating pests then you will enjoy the job. You do get a company vehicle and phone which is helpful within the work industry to get ahold of your manager and employees just to stay contacted with them.
good,"Ecolab is a good place to work. People are nice and good to work with, everyone help each other where help is required."
good,Work environment is one were we worked hard and brought a tremendous amount of benefits to the company.   I had a great team that reported up through me.
good,"Its a job for self motivated people willing to put in extra time and work to properly manage their business. Work days can be long, additional admin and comuter work required."
good,"Very disciplined position working out of my home office. I was very dedicated and made positive growth. Enjoyed working with my other team members in the Midwest division. As I did the sales part of the position, I had very close relations with the service team who would complete the install jobs,"
good,"would not suggest to work in the pest elimination side of the company do to the lack of pay unless your okay with learning how to apply great service for your customers and then throwing it out the window in order to better your self and the company you work for, but than you will run your self in to the ground with no help when you need it from your managers and coworkers because you had to cut corners in order to meet the Revenue they want you to meet so you can make a decent living...."
good,"I started at Ecolab as a temp and was hired on as a full time employee.  Without a degree, there is very little room for advancement.  There was no place for me to go within the company without that piece of paper."
good,good. it was nice to have the abiity to create your own work schedule on a monthly basis and be able to build your week around a potentially changing schedule
good,I worked in the law department of a internationally known company.  They had a great corporate culture and I enjoyed my short tenure there.  They even had pet insurance!
good,"It can be challenging in this role finding a way to balance properly servicing your existing customers, where you are responsible for making sure chemical dispensing equipment  is working properly, with the need to always be adding new customers. It can be a lot for some people to juggle."
good,Bonne entreprise pour travailler sérieusement et pour s'améliorer.
good,"I worked in the GCS division of Ecolab.  We dispatched out calls to repairmen for hospitals, prisons, nursing homes, restaurants and  large companies to repair their food equipment.  In the beginning, it was a great work environment but then the company went through a major restructuring and everything changed.  They replaced quite a few of the upper management and I moved out of the job."
good,Safety is a high priority. They hire in front of growth in order to keep workload down for the existing employees as well as maintain great customer service.
good,"Boa empresa, apesar de obter riscos no trabalho, com relação a salário é uma empresa boa."
good,"Great Company, good passionate people who care about the business they work for."
good,"A typical day at Ecolab is fun and interesting. I've learned a lot while working there, the management is not all the way fair but its easy work. Overall I liked the company."
good,"When I started, things were really disorganized and I was able to use my strong computer skills to ensure the monthly statements and analysis were prepared. The hardest part of the position was that there was no procedures documented."
good,"Very. Professional, handlers closing of facility with fair compensatio n, communicetd well with timely notices of steps being taken. going throuAlthough it was difficult going through 3 separate transitions, in the end, everything worked out both financially and benefits wise."
good,"The Campus and Workout rooms plus Cafeteria is my favorite part of the day. Build your own Mac n Cheese is great! Friendly people, competitive pay, room for advancement leaves a lot to be desired though. Its rare to get hired on from a contractor"
good,"I was contracting there. So I wasn't there long enough to make a determination. Beautiful campus, with walking paths, full service cafeteria, and company store to buy products at discounted prices."
good,"A typical day would include operating the cast packaging machine to package cleaning chemicals and products for industrial use for the most part. It was an interesting shift from my career field but provided the right schedule for me to work at nights and go to school during the day time. I was pursing my BBA Accounting Major degree at the time. "
good,"Comfortable workplace, friendly staff, good salary, good location, easy access."
good,Driving a forklift building orders on pallets and getting them ready for shipping. I learned how to use there system and how different it is working in Texas. My coworkers were all very helpful. The hardest part of the job was the very large orders. The most enjoyable part was the overtime.
good,"Great company, good work environment with good people. The opportunity to gain upward mobility though is not present. Compensation was not as rewarding as the time and work demanded. I just want to make more of an impact than Ecolab has available."
good,"All calls are dispatched through an I-pad issued to employees, employees start their day from their home and travel to locations through out the specified area of coverage and in many cases beyond. I didn't learn anything new, company is still making the same mistakes as when I left the first time but it is a great company and I honestly mean that. Very large corporate structure not truly focused on good customer service as much as they portray. Management is ok. The hardest part of the job was juggling time frames and trying to cover your work as well as help younger inexperienced technicians when in trouble as everything was based upon time management and billing. The most enjoyable part of the day was quitting time."
good,"Pontos positivos: "
good,Ecolab is moving toward a organization that needs to provide information to their customers.  In fact that is becoming much more of a differentiator to the customers.  Ecolab used to be (and still is) a sales and marketing organization.  The transition has started but has a long way to go. Technical resources are not valued to the level of business impact they provided.
good,Lots of phone work but I thought the company was very good. My dissatisfaction was not with the company but my work. Being on the phone all day non-stop can be tiresome but they really work to make it the best possible experience.
good,"Remain busy in work all the time."
good,Empresa internacional y con presencia en los 5 continentes
good,"Empresa internacional de origen norte americana, y con presencia en los 5 continentes."
good,"Working at Ecolab gives you a lot of opportunity.  It allows for a lot of free time because you can make your own schedule.  It can be a fun job, where you get to learn everyday."
good,"Ecloab was fine, but I worked (technically) for a subcontractor called Adecco that was pure garbage. Ecolab itself was adequate. Typical work day started at 7am, done around 4:30pm. I was an admin, so that came with the typical lack of recognition or appreciation, but I've found that to be the case at most places of employment. Typical office atmosphere with an old rich white man dictating the rules (most of them cosmetic, but certainly not encouraging individualism, diversity, or personal growth or development). All in all, I have no real complaints other than the fact that that I had no health insurance and no job security."
good,"Always on the go while multi-tasking. 24/7 on call and need to be computer literate."
good,"This is a growing division within Ecolab with lots of upside for professional growth. There are some growing pains, but people with good ethics and initiative and great customer service skills will succeed."
good,Ecolab has sustained through difficult economic times in America and across the world. I have learned a lot and enjoy working here.
good,"The working environment is balanced."
good,"i learned how to work with others and patiently not a bad job, it was great if you are looking forward to working part time. it can be a strenuous job and tough at times"
good,Ecolab is a great company to work for with great benefits. I've been with the company for over two years. I handle all the replenishment for one of the worlds largest retailers.
good,Fast paced and self motavating company. The hours vary from day to day.Driving alot from account to account. I have about 80 accounts i go to a month.
good,"so algumas pessoas que atrapalham um pouco a empresa, nao param para escutar aos subordinados tomam decisões precipitadas, se se preocupar de certa forma com quem esta a baixo delas so importam com sigo mesmos"
good,My typical day as a Territory Sales Representative for Ecolab consisted of visiting my customers to sell them laundry chemicals and service their dispensing equipment.  I had a territory consisting on Georgia/Alabama/South Carolina so I was on the road a lot.
good,Long boring 12 hour shifts filling pails. The management and workers are friendly. Room for advancement.
good,"A Ecolab é uma empresa multinacional, mas a planta do Brasil tem muitos problemas em relação á sua cultura, tendo muita dificuldade com a equipe de TI e RH. Mas, aprendi muito com relação a minha formação."
good,Formation auprès de chaque service pour bien connaître et comprendre chaque domaine de l'entreprise
good,This was a Student Loan company. I worked in the Collections Department.  Great entry level postion for new College Graduates.
good,"I didn't know anything about the business world before starting here.  I have learned a lot here as they are great for taking their time training someone new.  This company has different standards for every group though.  In merging with Ecolab, the company is suppose to be as ""one"", but it is not.  Being a salary employee doesn't necessarily mean you work as a salary employee.  You still have the punch the clock and are punished for being a few minutes late and you better stay to make up the time and not leave early... ever.  The job is busy and you do learn new things just about every day and gain many relationships.  It is enjoyable to help your customers out, but the toughest part is there is constant change and it can be very difficult to remember who does what or how to do something as procedures change a lot.  In my experience here though... unless you are a ""favorite"" you are not getting promoted.  After going to school, taking classes, earning a degree (while working full time) joining clubs and putting myself out there for extra work... I have not gained any respect from any managers in earning a promotion."
good,It's a pretty good company to work for but it was impossible to advance.
good,I have enjoyed my work here and this is shown by my length of employment here
good,"A good job if you don't have a family, or a life. At least in Nevada. The customer is always right, and when you're dealing with high end Casino's they all want you there on one night, Mondays. You can't do them all on Mondays."
good,Large geography and area to cover.  Excellent overall experience and learning opportunity.
good,"This has been a busy job with different directors, managers and departments to work for. Travel, arranging meetings, budgets, and organising departments."

good,Great company to work for. Great people and a competitive work environment. Salary+commission with few limits on how much you can truly earn.
good,Overall a great company. I learned a ton about overall plant operation. The hardest part of my job was learning how to effectively sale in an environment I had never been around.
good,"not much room for advancement, not really much to say about this place it was a temp. job , they seem to not value employees their wouldn't suggest it to anyone looking for a job to retire from"
good,Please pay more attention to each district. My district suffes because if the rph system. Work hard for 12 bucks an hour sometimes. Just pay us a good hourly with revenue so we always make good money. We do have bills and family to take care of. Unfortunately we all dont make a guarenteed high salary like you managers. But we do all the hard work. Other that that i love my job. I love what i do. The benifets are awesome and we ha e a great retire ment plan.
good,"nada a declarar pois fiquei 3 meses, nao senti muita proximidade com os gestores"
good,I really enjoyed working for Ecolab and I think that the next candidates after me will do the same. I've learned alot working for Ecolab and had the opportunity to see how some of our everyday cleaning etc chemicals are produced.
good,"Empresa ótima para se aprender, paga salário em dia as vezes até antes, bons benefícios porém salário muito baixo para técnico."
good,Manager didn't always follow company direction. Corporate culture was good but not enough support in rural areas. like other companies are paying less now than they did 15 years ago.
good,"if one can overlook the poor management team(which is getting better) , stay under the radar you will be fine.if  management treated employees with more respect it would be much better."
good,"Self driven without supervision. Service heavy working with commercial equipment, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical with a focus on sales. Never enough time for everything though between sales calls, installs, emergency maintenance, employee turnover, weekend on call"
good,"Ecolab has fantastic culture and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A lot of flexibility and a lot of travel in rural areas, selling, servicing, and building relationships is the main core items of this job. You must be good with time management and have the ability to sell. Company vehicle."
good,"Ecolab was a very fast, overworked environment and they look at bringing in the younger college kids before having the older veternans that know the business in and handle the extreme work load."
good,My work day is all about the company goal and our target/customer.  I show up ready to be flexible and take on whatever the task or process is at the time.  I work hard and diligently to exceed my company's standards.  My goal is organic vertical growth within the company; I hold high standards for myself. This job is all about team and working together in order to hit our numbers and beyond.

good,long workday that started off with checking you had all the supplies you needed for day. then you schedule your jobs and go out for work.  time is very important scheduling is something that need to be worked on.
good,As working at eco lab I have learned more than what My knowledge was before. I feel appreciated at eco lab than any other job I have worked at. Please to be there everyday.
good,"Very fast-paced environment. There are a good amount of leads that actually look out for their team. Higher management rarely goes out onto the floor. "
good,"Se caracteriza por ser una empresa que da la facilidad para hacer carrera, acompañado con un sólido respaldo de las jefaturas."
good,"I started my career with ecolab in the SAC department and was involved in multiple projects for the span of 4 years. The work culture is good and the working hours are flexible. However, the career path in our department is yet not defined."
good,good to work with other groups that would team up to get the most out of an account.  Corporate sales was a good benefit.  The management climb was a bit cut throat.
good,"The company has a pretty good job culture and has good potential for growth and advancement. Management is quiet supportive. A typical day at work required performing many SAP processes using computer, filing, creating databases and spreadsheets"
good,Great place to start your career but paid less than the market without a bonus structure for associates. There is not much room for career advancement.
good,No issues to report but I would like to grow to new heights career wise and I was unable to do that with this company at this time. The culture is team based and everyone is helpful to one another.
good,"Good job, paid well, just on call all the time and doing installs.  Hard to get people to cover your shifts when you want to take vacation.  Also the customers calling all the time."
good,Decent place to work at. Pay isn't all that great and there is communication problems within the management. Four day work week man's now time with your family.
good,"Great Company to work for. Also had some of the Best Managers. Territories are still too large and workload is impossible to complete in a 40 hr work week. Expected not to get any overtime, however impossible to meet deadlines. Need to pay better base salary. Don't receive Bonus unless everyone meets quarterly deadlines. Completely unfair in a competitive based environment!"
good,"Ecolab is a great Company to work for. The MEA headquarters is a stimulating and challenging place to work. The Ecolab culture is ever present. In addition, there are always high calibre colleagues to reach out to in support of my and the company goals."
good,it's a great company with good benefits and if you keep applying to other positions there is a good chance of getting a chance to work in different departments
good,"Es una empresa con buen clima laboral susceptible a mejorarse, el salario es regular pero cuenta con buenas prestaciones que lo hacen atractivo. "
good,I've had a lot of fun working here. I work with a great team and have a good manager. The only issue is lack of upward mobility unless I'm willing to move. Therefore I am standing still.
good,"Good management team, truly care for their employees, Currently going through some growing pains with the Swisher purchase. Ecolab is serious about employee retention."
good,"No balance between life and work. On call 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Benefits are great. even the management is not so bad. If you do not have a life, this is the job for you."
good,Good strong company however balancing work and personal life was extremely difficult. Great territory and very fun job
good,Awesome people to work with and overall fun job. Would gladly work there again if given the opportunity. Not much job advancement however.
good,"Typical day is consisted of 8-10 location visits throughout assigned territory, that includes review and service of equipment, product use and new account approved product availability. Review meetings with middle and upper level management to enhance program use, as well as training lower level employees on best practice use of products and equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with different people throughout the course of the day and being able to relate to their specific needs in order to achieve the established goal."
good,"The position is challenging, but comes with much potential for personal and financial growth.  It combines service with sales.  It requires adaptability, patience, and motivation."

good,"work with some great people!"
good,"It is a nice place to work. People are nice and friendly, the management is above average, they are a well organized and caring company"
good,"Typical work day consisted of working in the OR with Surgeons and their staffs. I learned how to work in an OR environment and what occurs on a regular basis."
good,Empresa que incentiva o estudo tem vários treinamentos e boa para experiencias profissionais. Benefícios e bonificações salariais boas.
good,"Flexibilidade no horário de trabalho;"
good,"When you went into work, you knew what had to be done. I gained a lot of knowledge about their computer system and how it worked. Didn't really see management to much. My co-workers were great people to work with. Everyone was very friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part was having so much to learn in such a short period of time while training. The most enjoyable part of my job there was the people and atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at work began at 7am with talking to my night shift co-workers to see what problems arose with the printers that would affect my day. Usually I was able to check e-mail first thing. My first priority was creating work tickets for e-mail requests and looking for responses to any e-mails I had sent the previous day regarding work tickets I was assigned to. Then I would check the day's list of terminated employees against our user database and remove or modify any report distributions assigned to such people. This could be complex, involving research in our database and sending e-mails. After that I would help print reports, forms or other print requests and deliver them. Sometimes I would need to break down large reports by recipients. I might take phone calls from the sales field asking for e-mailed copies of their stocking report or handle e-mails looking for reprints of a report at a remote location. Often I had to do mass changes in the databases as part of a project, such as converting reports from paper to a web portal. In the afternoon, I frequently reprinted damaged invoices or other pages from large print jobs. This involved finding a particular page in one of dozens of output files. The printers were prone to developing problems, so it was not unusual to spend the afternoon trying to fix the issue ourselves or calling Xerox for help or to place a repair request."
good,"The territory manager position is a demanding 24/7/365 job. On a typical day, you will perform service/sales to five existing customers and prospect two more. You also need to perform installs, in-service trainings, and emergency calls when needed. There is a tremendous amount of techinal information to learn. The management overall is good. My co-workers were awesome. Very helpful. Hardest part of the job was working weekends without tech service. Also, it is a pain to get time off. It is up to the terrritory managers to find someone to work for them. Management does not help out. I had two five day vacations in five years. Most enjoyable part is building relationships with customers and prospects. The company car is nice, too."
good,"Work directly with head, regional and district manager to sell chemical products used by consumer. Present the feature benefits and cost analysis for management"
good,"Great people , nice place just the pay was not worth the drive. Was always something changing. My job was easy and did not have many issues. The best part of the job were the people."
good,Ecolab is a large company with many different business units.  All are dedicated to solve customer challenges and to do what is right.   Ecolab is  committed to it's values and does a good job communicating them.  Had a great time working at Ecolab and with my colleagues.  The most challenging part of working there was as with any large conglomerate there are understandingly competing priorities which creates challenges when executing projects.
good,It was a good place to work overall.  I would recommend it for a starter job and see where it takes you.  The company culture is good and being strictly a field employee.
good,Benefits are good. Management can be out of touch but they try! Hours and pay doesn’t always seem to match. They say they like to eliminate pests! And give the best training. I would agree the training is great! However the elimination part seems to Be lacking.
good,"Client Services Tech Lounge at Ecolab provide a stimulating and fun environment.  You are expected to do your work, and treated as such.  Work is self paced, with people available to assist if needed."
good,"It's a great company that does so much good work for the worlds environment, water, energy, health.  There are many opportunities for employees to learn and develop themselves."
good,"Ecolab is a fine place to work. They pay very well for the work you do and there benefits are one of the best in Huntington, my opinion. The management, on the other hand, slowly declined as time went on. Management seem to care less and less about the people and more on production costs and output. For instance Ecolab had a cutback a few years ago and let quite a few people go. Instead of coming up with a reasonable solution to this cutback, such as sending some of our product elsewhere; it was expected that every one, who did not get fired, to pick up double the work with the same amount of hours in the week day. Management stopped caring what workers accomplished after awhile. There was no accountability or punishment for careless mess ups so the workers became lazy. "
good,This is a great job if you are single and love making money. But if you have a family then you have to know how to balance life and crazy work schedule but besides that it’s a great job. They do offer promotions with in the company.
good,"Great company to invest in and work with. Unlimited opportunities for advancement. Management could use some tweaking. Training is top notch. After training, you're basically the business owner."
good,"Ecolab always promoted for diversity for different cultures, ethnicity and gender equality. Departments are very close and collaborative. Ecolab nurtures a family-like community for employees."
good,I liked them and wished I had found them as a younger person.  If you wish to provide for your family then this is the place to pursue.  There is literally a large career path available internationally.
good,"A typical day at Ecolab consists of servicing as well as providing new solutions to customer accounts. One major thing I learned in this position is time management skills. Having to go to 100+ accounts in one month takes pre-planning and some days don't always go as planned. The work place culture is somewhat different than most companies due to the fact that we do not have a central office. The hardest part of this job is definitely troubleshooting/maintenance. We work on dish washers, laundry machines, and pools. I did take training classes at Ecolab headquarters but there are so many different issues that can occur. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to walk into an account and sell products or new solutions. However, I only sell products to customers that will truly help them. When my customers are happy, I am happy."
good,A typical day at work was putting together kits and repackaging product(s) per order(s) for customers. Good team work among employees in getting orders completed.
good,"Remain current on changes to employment laws & regulations in order to maintain compliance "
good,Great Learning Experience  I got a lot of good training and got to see some new processes as well as do some travelling along  the way.  It was a great experience.
good,"I worked a 24/7 schedule. Ecolab offered good pay, and excellent benefits, Some mandatory overtime. Union environment was easy to work with. 12 hour night shifts made it difficult for me to adjust my sleep."
good,the job was very helpful. and it allowed me to learn how to run the machine from top to bottom. my co-workers was always helpful and always worked together.
good,"I typical day would be to do about three food safety audits.  The audits are scored ( Green,Yellow or Red) Green is good, Yellow needs improvement is some areas and Red does not meets standards.After completed the audit, I would check all of the dispensing equipment to make sure that they are dispensing properly then take an inventory of all products on hand.  I would then fill out a suggested reorder for products.  Lastly, I would check out with the Store Manager by recapping issued found on the audit, tell them of any repaired that I had done and go over the suggested product reorder sheet with them."
good,unfortunately the job moved to MN I enjoyed the inside and outside customer service. Were always different contests and was always busy. I was in the Daydots division.
good,As going into the position I knew that it was a temporary contract so other than that I knew and expected what I was doing with the company. Was treated as a fellow employee and nothing less.
good,Great assignment. Variety of work locations. Needed to relocate temporarily. Needed to be in area where they hired me but needed job.  Provided everything I needed to do job. Thanks Ecolab!
good,"Limitation of professional growth."
good,"Make your own schedule work with nice people in the industry.  A lot of driving to cover you designated territory.  Paid sick, personal, vacation, and holidays."
good,Good managers but they are over worked. Job is complicated but there is enough resources available so you figure it out. Pay is low but the benefits are pretty good. Lot of corporate red tape holds company back form being a lot better.
good,"Good employer, been here for 24 years. Unfortunately Ecolab has made the decision to use massive amounts of college grads for 2 year internships at my plant and it is a disaster"
good,"Relaxed day, but does have crunch time at the end of the month or during project deadline. Co-workers are really helpful and no micro management. Not that many meetings but do have to manage customer support calls."
good,Believe in promoting within and offers lateral and advancement opportunities. Good company for individual career growth and exploration of career interest.
good,A great place to work if you have strength and stamina. The atmosphere is very collaborative and the days go by quickly. Good work is rewarded however training could be a little more intense.
good,"A lot of  personal changes within management, frequent internal opportunities globally and within UK. Great focus to safety, service and savings that generate project management opportunities."
good,Answer phones and troubleshoot problems for customers.  Send messages to sales representatives.  place orders for customers.  take payments for accounts.  It is a lot of sitting at a desk.
good,Muy buena empresa pero no se puede hacer línea de carrera
good,"Not bad. Very busy. Could be better. Dispatcher and managers try to meet service requirements set by corporate which can be a big pain sometimes, great benefits."
good,"Reliable and well know Company to work for.  Benefits were good and environment was friendly and eager to help.  Worked for several types of managers and all have good and bad points, nothing that would be necessary to list.  The culture of the company is very intent on *providing the best service/product* and always has been.  Most enjoyable about the company is/was the interaction with all departments that fulfilled your job/assignment.  Many friends and great memories."
good,Productive and fun workplace.  Time demanding. Would not have been so bad if I wasn't perusing my Bachelors degree.  Mandated overtime began to affect my grades.
good,"overall is a great place to work, just lot of issues with dispatcher and management, great company great benefits, great opportunities to build a lifetime career"
good,"At Ecolab Pte Ltd, i learn a lot and the task i did which is i need to handle monthly invoices for at least 400 plus customer. I need to assist my boss as acting secretary, doing renewal contract, payment to the vendor, helping with the technician in the paper work."
good,"Buena, es una empresa estable que brinda una oportunidad de desarrollarse en materia de ventas y comercial"
good,Buena empresa con muchos beneficios e oportunidades aunque ultimamente ha crecido mucho y los procesos son complexos para trabajar.
good,Love to work for this place for the reason that if you had an idea. They worked with you in making it happen. This was recognized with an award.
good,"I was there 13 years having 8 Maintenance Managers. I liked working there yet, a dangerous place causing of the chemicals. Safety was a 110% task. Looking out for yourself and others."
good,"everyone on the same level, learning to work together as a team.  the hardest pat is not to make a mistake.management is fair,getting to the issue of the problem ,solving it."
good,"A typical day in the office was anything but typical."
good,"Large corporate company who work in the health, food, cleaning and pest elimination industries "
good,"an abundant amount of useful knowledge prior to field duty. Ecolab university and R and D in St.Paul, MN. hands down one of the best facilities in the country."
good,Good experience. Cool management and you are just required to meet the target and you can work the way you want to get the job done.
good,No relationships across business units.  Limited training; mostly learn-as-you-go environment.  Management within department is exceptional.
good,"The environment is a busy place very productive minded and very crucial for a hard worker."
good,"This was a position where I had to learn procedures by myself; a large part of my position was identifying cost centers and expenses for invoices. In addition, I also had to reconcile the inventory accounts between the costing system and the general ledger."
good,"I come in everyday pull my list of work orders and bill 84 customers in a 8-hr period. I have learned many new things working at Ecolab, mainly how to send out an accurate invoice to the customer.I love the team i work for and also my managers.The hardest part of my job is trying to keep your production rate up while making sure invoices are accurate and error free. I enjoy being able to be a part of such a great team."
good,"Unos de los principales problemas a los que nos enfrentábamos día a día, era que teníamos que realizar la entrega a determinado cliente ya que los productos urgían; tener que coordinar que el almacén (terciarizado) prepare el pedido en calidad de urgente, para que una unidad de transporte (terciarizado) lo cargue y procesa con la entrega se convertía en un verdadero reto donde no había margen de error y el tiempo era vital. Aprender a tomar decisiones es algo de lo mas significativo que aprendí."
good,Once I arrived to work I would first clock- in then I would set my lunch down by my work station and talk to my co-workers until my shift began. Once my shift began my duties would consist of putting together parts of a soap dispenser and passing it down the line. Once we boxed the correct amount of items I would load it and wrap it and have someone come pick it up to be shipped.
good,A normal day like any other is taking calls from customers and reps in the field. I got to learn how to work in a customer service call center and have done well. Co-workers are good. Hardest part of the job is when you are dealing with an upset customer or rep. Most enjoyable part is knowing the fact that you are helping the customers out whether it is placing orders or getting service calls out to the reps.
good,"A experiência proporcionou conhecimentos em boas práticas de fabricação de feltros e telas secadoras, procedimentos de análises em amostras novas e retornadas, ferramenta 5s e legislações envolvidas, 6 Sigma e vivência empresarial."
good,Upper Management was not very helpful. Morale in daily workforce very very low.
good,"Working with over 100 associates in the field doing all of their administration which includes Corporate / Global Account Managers, Senior Managers, District Sales Managers and Territory Managers."
good,Good company to work for. Some positions make work/life balance difficult.
good,"Meu dia de trabalho era bom, buscando sempre imformações dos colegas onde seu setor poderia ter incidências de pragas no qual eu iria vistoriar o local para que quando fosse fazer a dedetização fosse feita a aplicação no equipamento; aprendi que tudo que consumimos,principalmente os alimentos tem que ser feito com qualidade e que quando você vender o produto, o cliente possa ter o produto garantido em suas mãos e que para controlar as pragas devemos aplicar os 4 AS  [acesso,abrigo,alimento e água] tinha bons relacionamentos com os colegas,gerentes.a parte mais difícil e que quando fazia no final do ano a fumigação na Ferrero era complicado porque a máscara que usava não me proteger,o cheiro era forte[fumispore] tussia muito! mais era bom porque viajava muito nas cidades vizinhas de Poços de Caldas,conhecia muitos Clientes e funcionários de outras cidades."
good,"Good work life balance, nice working facility, ability to see a wide variety of the business."
good,"I think Ecolab is a good place to work for overall. Some of the reviews are right, hours can be long, call backs can cause a lot of stress. the benefits a very good. Company vehicle is take home, which is very nice. Everyone that has been around for years makes at least $50,000 or more. Ecolab offers 401k stock purchase plan, retirement, and good health insurance. Some of the service specialist do get tired and frustrated do to long hours. The vacation situation needs to be addressed. Hard to take a vacation our time off.but all things considered, it has provided a good lifestyle for my family. if you don't mind a long hours, and working hard.I would recommend ecolab to a friend or family member."
good,"Very clean factory to work for, everything was kept up to help there workers.  Management would always come by and compliment on a good job you are doing.  You always knew what you were going to be doing the next day if not the entire week.  Never the same thing over and over."
good,A typical day at work is mainly answering inbound calls from our customers to place new service request on their kitchen equipment.
good,I loved working for Ecolab. Fun fast paced work environment with many opportunities for advancement.
good,"On call 24hrs a day. Work is time consuming, but once you have a feel for things the work load lightens up. With exprience in a route you can obtain a certain amount of freedom to work at your pace and vary your schedule. A typical day starts in the am where you go from location to location addressing customer needs and pushing for sales. Take a lunch from noon to one approx. then back to work. expect customer calls needing service scheduled promptly. Must be flexible."
good,"I worked in the IT corporate office at Ecolab for several years. It was a wonderful experience for the most part. At that time the benefits were good, and sr. mgmt did try to recognize people's work. They implemented flex work and talked a lot about work life balance, but then so many people were not allowed to do any telecommuting or do any job sharing..."
good,"I learned the complete sales cycle from start to finish, as well as maintaining the current customer and sometimes regaining lost customers."
good,"Al cierre del mes se vive un ambiente de estrés, Sin embargo los días siguientes suelen ser tranquilos, tiene comedor subsidiado y buenas atenciones por parte de la empresa al trabajador"
good,Good company to work for and has plenty of training and resources. Great benefits. People are nice. Good structure. Well known and good work ethics. Great atmosphere
good,I have been able to have exposure to a lot of different work within the human resource and talent development space in the time I have been with the company. People are always willing to help me learn and grow and care to make sure I am enjoying my work and the workplace.
good,"Great company to work for, but they do not have room for promotions. The workplace culture is fun. The hardest part of the job for me is the lack of promotions and how hard it is to move up within the company."
good,"An enjoyable but challenging environment, working to strict month and year end deadlines, with processes changing frequently. Adapting to change a necessity"
good,"Empresa muito bem estruturada e com ótimos benefícios, porém com uma cultura fortemente orientada a resultados, gerando uma pressão por vezes prejudicial."
good,This job has good location and very good hours the only thing that could change is a little higher pay.Co-workers are friendly and will assist you with any problem.
good,Really loved it and I'd still be working there if it wasn't for a health issue I've experienced.  I need a job where I don't need to drive and can have a regulariity in my hours.  This is a heavy driving job that works you all hours of the day and night dependant on your accounts.  Great training program and fun people to work with!
good,"I enjoyed my time at Ecolab, however I was always on call. My personal time was continuously interrupted responding to customer requests. It was difficult to have a home life and there was a lot of window time."
good,Ótima empresa para se trabalhar. Ótimo clima organizacional.
good,Ecolab has a great work environment. Everyone is very friendly and takes a lot of pride in working for the company. It is very corporate/hierarchical as with most large Fortune 500 companies.
good,slow pace implementation of projects but overall the environment was positive and what was a bonus the healthy food in the cafeteria where you have an excellent chef all week long
good,"Managers did not listen to employees very well They say our voice matters bit it really did not . Favoritism for certain people was in plain sight. Good people to work with but alot of the people were lazy. Excellent benefits but the pay scale was totally out of whack. New hires were paid more than people that had been there awhile only because they had a hard time getting good employees and retaining them. For such a reputable company, they were slowly going down hill."
good,Very good company other than middle of the road compensation.  Great benefits and training.  Ecolab definitely gives you the tools and training to be successful.
good,"Great company to work for. Fantastic pay and benefits, good management and training. Work/Life balance for Institutional Division Route & Territory managers was pretty poor."
good,"overall work day was loaded with repairing commercial kitchen equipment. long days. hard work and makes it known to your family and friends. always working. Very calculated. Very cold management. Your a number and a stat. if by the end of the year of busting your buff, but your stats are low or don't reflect properly they will deny and progress just to keep in budget. tracked by GPS and watched constantly. If numbers need to be made, management will cut employees no questions asked.. If you play the game and keep yourself of the radar its a great place to make money and get your hand on lots of equipment . ."
good,"Good company to work for. People are outstanding. Its hard work, but worth it. If you have a solid work ethic and are able to work remotely with autonomy and integrity, this job is for you."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"decent way to make a living. just wasnt for me anymore."
good,"You work out of your home.  Daily dispatching is done via an ipad and you prioritize your daily work yourself.  Occasionally, your dispatcher will call you to discuss logistical/scheduling issues.  Invoicing, training and the vast majority of communication is done on your ipad.  Ecolab has a partnership with Fastenall stores to send any need parts to  You will visit your Fastenall as needed to restock your van and get parts as needed.  I had fun working here and my fellow techs were great guys.  My district manager was also a great guy that allowed me to do my own thing.  The problem I had was that I live on the MS gulf coast and ended up working every day 1.5 hrs away in New Orleans.  Corporate tracks your van and uses a matrix that expects you to bill a certain number of hours per day.  It's difficult to meet company expectations when your day has a 3 hour travel time out of an 8 hr work day."
good,"Great benifits , training needs improvement. DM does not correlate what our goals and actions should be. Great training in St. Paul Minesota, but DM has no goals works on a day to day basis"
good,"muy buena empresa, capacitación continua, revisión medica cada 3 meses."
good,A typical day would be reviewing data modemed in from the field and entering it and making sure of its accuracy.  I learned the importance of data and its accurate entry and the need for accurately retrieving that data for analysis and for report generation for customers.  The workplace environment was extremely competitive.  The hardest part of the job was staying sharp at the end of a 12 hour day.
good,Es un buen lugar para aprender diferentes areas y con un buen ambiente por parte de los compañeros
good,I worked here for almost five years. During that time I was able to travel extensive in the role I held. This provided me the extraordinary opportunity to see the stark differences and similarities betwen Ecolab coporate and Ecolab field associates.
good,"start your day by home office work,then start your route and plan to see 6 to8 customers a day,sales ,cold call 2 customers a day.hardest part was with tech support with issues and equipment."
good,No micro managing here. Good pay and benefits. Extensive training and tools to complete work assignments. Travel involved-includes corporate car with a corporate credit card for company expenses. You have to be willing to relocate for career advancement in most cases.
good,The job was good and the coworkers inviting. The job is very fast pace and can be extremely stressful. The level of responsibility for the pay was some what off.
good,Not a traditional sales job. You need to know how to fix the dispensers and prepare to get dirty. As in you have to throw your clothes out there is no chance you can wash out whatever it is that is on there. Service can become a much larger part of this job.
good,"See you customers daily, control your income by taking care of your customers."
good,No work/life balance. Hours are somewhat flexible. Compensation is very good including lots of overtime and benefits are very good. Management is helpful and supportive.
good,Worked a lot of hours with very little sleep. I enjoyed working with my fellow employees and other people in the company as a whole. For the type of work I did and previous experience I do believe the company had the best service available in the field I worked in but took a toll on the employees. They definitely make sure you have all the tools and training you need to be prepared for the job role you will slide into. There had to be a better way and for the sake of the employees I do hope that happens in the future. The higher ups genuinely cared for the employees. I do not doubt it in my opinion but might have forgot what it was like to be in the field day in and day out driving with sleep that averaged three hours a day if you were lucky. I left on a notice and would not count out working for the company in the future if things fell into place differently. I enjoyed servicing the accounts I had and miss the interaction I had with the management and staff in all one hundred and forty-two accounts I had.
good,work life balanced and good career. good people to work with. Smart people around. lots of opportunities for career progression. pay is not attractive.
good,There seemed to be a lot of lay offs and changes in upper management. I had seen at least 4 supervisors come and go in my office alone in under 4 years. The hardest part of the job was getting everything that they wanted accomplished in one working day in the 8hr work day.
good,"Normalmente hay un buen ambiente, la ideologia de la empresa se basa en la convivencia de la empresa y el cumplimiento de metas."
good,Ecolab was a great company family to be apart of.  Ecolab allowed an individual to go as far as they may want to go within the company to not ony better themselves but to contribute to the growth of the business.
good,Dependent upon functional area the demands could be unrealistic given some of the antiquated systems.  Collaborative environment to find creative work arounds which made for great teamwork but sometimes not very sustainable.
good,"If you work hard, you can grow in. Help is there when need it. Many divisions within Ecolab, all the tickets to sport events you can have for lesser price."
good,"Spent most of my time on the road, it was great when I was single. Ecolab bought a smaller competitor that I worked for and slowly the changes began..."
good,"Aprendí el valor del trabajo en equipo y la coordinacion del mismo, la importancia de brindar seguimiento diario a las actividades realizadas para ofrecer un excelente atención al cliente."
good,Enjoyed working there very much.  Very collaborative culture.  Work many hours due to stress of outside environment.  Work life balance  is the hardest part but overall great place to work.
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar, que da oportunidades de crecimiento y desarrollo. Es la empresa líder del mercado en Chile, una operación mas pequeña que en Brasil y con proceso mas simples y ordenados."
good,"Ecolab was a good job opportunity. With a very good work environment, I moved around from different lines doing different types of work because I had a very good work ethic everyone wanted me to work on their line."
good,"I was;"
good,"Was ok working for GCS/Ecolab. We serviced commercial kitchen and restaurant equipment. So we were working at different facilities from day to day, and varying equipment. This made the work more fun not doing the same exact thing every day. I learned to work on all kinds of commercial equipment, am a CFESA certified master technician. Sometimes the job was stressful due to complex issues with certain equipment, but almost everything had support from manufacturer."
good,the company itself is very large which means there's plenty of opportunities to advance. in the sales role the hours are flexible but extremely long if you want to be successful. the pay is okay for the amount of hours you work and the benefits are decent.
good,Boa empresa para se trabalhar. Estrutura disponibilizada é adequada.
good,"Good management and friendly staff. Have very nice environment, but too much works. One staff must have multiple job. "
good,"es un lugar muy agradable para trabajar, todas personas con las que estuve en contacto nunca se negaron a apoyarme y explicarme cosas que no conocía."
good,a sales and service company (more service than you would think)  get your foot in the door with sales but be prepared to turn a wrench and fix things.
good,Boa empresa a qual possibilitou adquirir excelente aprendizado e experiências profissionais.
good,"When I first started this company was amazing!! The culture was fantastic and everyone seemed to love the job. Fast forward a year later and things changed. There were still amazing days but the bad outweighed the good. "
good,"muy buena compañia para trabajar por los buenos beneficios.  Entrenamiento continuo era excellente.  Administradores en St. Paul Minnessota podrian ser mas concientes en lo que los empleados necesitan.  Terrritorios Geograficos muy grandes lo cual muchas veces es imposible por el tiempo, hacer todo lo que administracion quiere que uno haga."
good,"Atendia uma região com carteira de clientes ativos e clientes em potencial, fazia meu próprio roteiro de atendimento. "
good,Lots of fun people to work with very understanding and helpful production is fast and demanding cafeterias outstanding lots of areas to work n break so short overall great place to work
good,"Clean water,energy and hygiene supplied to people is always a reason to enjoy the effort put into your work. Leading a team of people from various cultures and all ages can be challenging but yet very rewarding as you achieve as a team. Improvements are an ongoing learning experience for all to be involved with, thus making a stronger team in the long term."
good,"Trato con el cliente, negosiar , oir sus nesecidádes, a trartár a ser mesurado con clientes y situaciones complicadas, el opoyo de mis colegas excelente,lo dificíles traslaárrce varias horas de camino y ataendér al cliente , no ver ami familia en momentos difíciles y especiales- la capacitación constante y  el apoyo de algunas personas"
good,"The money makes life better. I have a great boss. However, senior leadership is not the greatest to work with. But overall, it is a fair place.Definitely can improve."
good,Great opportunity to be face forward with customers and be your own boss by taking charge of your territory and treating your territory as your own personal business.
good,"There is no typical in Ecolab.  Everyday has taught me something new, from how to handle a customer, to manage through processes and/or procedures, to working with co workers and outside divisions.  I've worked at Ecolab for over 13 years and it has taught me a tremendous amount about myself, how to handle adversity and success and helped me understand how to manage a successful business.    My co workers have been wonderful and supportive, management has allowed me to advance through company in different positions, teaching so much about how we go to market.  The hardest part is that its such a big company, that you get lost in the shuffle.  The company itself is so strong and has so many qualified people that moving toward my career goals can be slow moving."
good,"A Ecolab química é uma empresa multinacional de grande porte que tem como principal filosofia (atualmente) o crescimento sustentável e a diminuição de rejeito de resíduos. Lá tive o prazer de trabalhar na área de engenharia de projetos, a que tinha por objetivo melhorar a produção e segurança (tanto dos processos como pessoal) da fábrica."
good,The people were nice to work with.  And this might not necessarily be a comprehensive critique of the company as a whole because it's just from my perspective and my personal situation but it seemed like there wasn't much advancement opportunity there.
good,"Planning my week ahead, to ensure meeting SLA of the contract to visit stores within easy reach to the next store to eliminate time spent on roads. Managing list of jobs, routine visits and follows within the SLA."
good,"Ecolab is a good place to work, but you are working with a lot of chemicals, a very HOT place to work in the summer months, due to all the PPE that you are required to wear. Management needs improving."
good,"Strong training program."
good,"Great training program for entry level employees. Company vehicle, cell phone and expense card to perform job duties."
good,"Ida ate a empresa, transporte fretado, qualidade muito boa."
good,Very high expectations at every level. Some leadership positions are still learning proper protocol with regards to BIG business HR standards.
good,"Une Entreprise intéressante qui présente une réelle offre d'opportunité de part ses divers domaines d'activité présentes."
good,"A Ecolab é uma empresa líder mundial em produtos de higiene, é uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar, porém com pouca oportunidade de crescimento."
good,"With a multitude of customers and responsibilities, every day is different. There is always an opportunity to learn and grow as a manager, person, and professional. I have learned a lot from both my management team and my coworkers and have fostered an environment of teamwork that I had not experienced in the past."
good,"Ecolab is a fine company to work for. The problem is that they expanded into Fort Myers about a year ago..and the competiton is fierce for business,not enough is being done so far to promote business, so it is very slow right now"
good,"Route service."
good,"Ecolab is one of the world's most ethical companies which over 40,000 Associates. Ecolab invests in its Staff and works everyday in improving Culture, cost reduction and Lean initiatives. It is a highly competitive company, provides high quality products and is focused on customer satisfaction. It has earned many different type of awards, and has a professional and ethical senior management team."
good,"Worked 3 states, every week. 10-12 hour work days. Good managers. Excellent co-workers. Travel. Seeing new cities"
good,"-Day starts with email updates and organization for service.  Monthly Service calls are made various small and large businesses.  Service inspections of chemical dispensing equipment and proper application, training where necessary.  Focus on procedures to ensure expected results.  Areas of concentration include Warewashing, Laundry, Housekeeping, Floor Care, Pool/Spa, and Equipment Repair and Safety Solutions"
good,"I enjoyed working for Ecolab on multiple projects geared towards generating different cleaning agents. I worked mainly in assay development and there was a lot of collaboration between the different groups since one assay could be used to test multiple products for different situations. I enjoyed being involved with the different groups running tests for their various cleaners and taking ideas generated in some group projects to improve the assay methods for others. The hardest part of the job for me was juggling the completely different projects i worked on, as some of the assays take quite a bit of time to set up and generate data and some had to be tested at timed intervals. Having 3 assays fall on the same day was quite the challenge but it was worth it as i learned to organize myself very well and work hard to ensure everything was correctly done. The work environment was very friendly and my co-workers and i often helped each other on our different projects."
good,"Responsible for assisting over 100 sales representatives, internal and external customers daily, with placing orders, messages, and quotes. Also, manages caller’s concerns."

good,Ecolab is a good company to work for. I feel at home in my job. My co-workers are pretty great. The pay is competitive with the other companies around the area!
good,"Really enjoyed my time at Ecolab. Great company, great people and I was paid well, only criticism would be the work life balance. Ecolab take a pound of flesh every day."
good,"I am due for a change.  Ecolab is a great company, however I can do more.   Looking for new challenges and possibly a career change.  I have been in credit/collections/AR for 20 plus years."
good,"It is a great company to work for. It is very demanding (customers.) can be flexible at times. Excellent benefits, and savings plans. There is a lot of driving. Safety has to be your number one goal, no exceptions. Customers for the most part are awesome, but you have to build those relationships."
good,"Great culture, I did not like the graveyard schedule or rotating weekend schedule to maintain 24/7 support for customers. typical night starts at home as they provide a vehicle to take home which is a plus. Management is typically hands off as long as your route is being taken care of. great for nurturing entrepreneurial spirit."
good,Ecolab is a great company to work for.  They have helped me to gain great experience and great skills to help me further my career.  The culture is strong with Ecolab and once you have been with the company I believe that you feel that you are part of it forever.
good,"Bottom line with Ecolab Kay Chemical is compensation.  This will be the deciding factor of taking the job and how long you stay .  I started at $38,500, plus annual bonus.  But that bonus turned to quarterly and was dependent on the whole team meeting their goal of visiting all their accounts in a quarter.  If one person missed by one visit, we got $0.  While a piece was based on sales, we were never privy to that number until the results were all in and bonus was already calculated.  "
good,"Training, integrity, and employee assessment are above average. Executive engagement is very good. Working with teammates is very positive. Ecolab products are best-in-class."
good,I have worked here over 4 years and have benefited from a small increase each year along with a flexi benefit scheme  allowing extra holiday days and other benefits. Hours are good however it's the chain reaction is very visible!
good,Was only there for four months.  Was not the right job for me.  Not much more I can say.  I liked my manager.  Very burocratic environment  .  Would work there again.
good,"i've been under the Ecolab umbrella for 8 years now and there are pros and cons, like with any company. but the Pro's outweigh the cons. good benefits, pension, 401K, retirement, health insurance and the pay is good."
good,"Excelente trabajo en equipo, contacto con compañeros de latinoamérica."

I loved the daily interaction with field personnel and customer's and developed many wonderful friendships as a result. Every day was filled with different challenges and allowed me to thrive in a fast paced and challenging environment. Ecolab is a great company to work for."
good,"Every day was a different challenge, leaning everyday I was one of the top performers in the region and won numerous awards for sales and safety also completed New Associate Training with Honors. My district manger was a good boss that cared, the hardest part of the job was weekend coverage that was every 10 weeks, I enjoyed having most weekends off."
good,I lived in Alaska and the work up here was different in the sense that my territory was very large and travel to customers was hard sometimes! i learned a lot but i just missed being a chef!
good,You make you own schedule but there is a dictated on call schedule. Fair amount of freedom in how you plan your day and month as long as you get everything done. Great focus on safety.
good,"...but well worth it if you do."
good,"Maintain and manage route on a daily basis."
good,"good company to work for, good pay friendly atmosphere management was okay.  enjoyed working with the people very friendly easy to get along with ...overall a good place to work.."
good,"Great Company and Products"
good,"Ecolab has a large workforce across the world.  There are so many great people and great teams, and many of the opportunities are remote or in a satellite office."
good,"Empresa padrão com muita organização e gestão."
good,Half of my time i did engineering services and the other half I was an analyst on the site. My manager was a excellent boss. I really enjoyed working for this company. I got married so I needed to move to another country.
good,Good company to work for. Managers are laid and flexible. However the company has a meeting culture that makes it difficult to keep up with day to day. Overall the company is a friendly and enjoyable place to work.
good,"Good work life balance, may work on the weekend if necessary. Co-workers are nice and management was a little messy when I was there but they were understanding."
good,"Ecolab is a great place to work. I am blessed to have the job I have and my teammates and manager are top notch. If you come in to Ecolab with a goal of being successful and understanding that you will get back everything that you put into it, then you're really going to enjoy being a part of this great company. Ecolab expects a lot from each and every person, but thankfully, Ecolab gives back a great deal and if you ever want to really feel like you're part of a family, join Ecolab!"
good,Ecolab believes its employees are is greatest asset. They expect a lot of their employee but ensure the proper training a preparation is provided.  I would return if an appropriate full-time opportunity were available.
good,Ecolab is good place to work in. Has been witness to many HR conducted training. Got o learn so many analytical tools and has developed good communication skills.
good,Ecolab will provide you with all of the necessary tools to provide expert consultation services to implement new technologies and provide routine maintenance to existing systems at a schedule of your preference.
good,This job has been a  blessing as it has offered flexible scheduling and a great benefit package. I am looking to relocate to Central Florida and am not able to transfer.
good,"Not for the meek. Lots of opportunity for those willing to create value. The cunning do well, the measured do okay, while the quiet fall behind. Managing people is the name of the game, service focused, products sell themselves."
good,As a Collection Specialist I had pleasant days. Established customers so my efforts were soft collections. very little phone contact. Most communication done by email.
good,great company to work for. Benefits were great advancement oppurtinty were there. family atmosphere great balance work load.pay scale was great employer showed care toward employee.
good,"La relación es muy cordial entre el negocio y Supply Chain, profesional. El negocio es muy dinámico y hace que se presenten muchos desafíos."
good,"Since the merger with Nalco, there has been bad leaders on board. This is a challenge for real talents to showcase their worth to the company. Also lots of long service employees are asked to leave to make way for newer and cheaper associates."
good,"visiting and servicing accounts throughout the day or night, depending on what shift I am on.  Very simple job, however the documenting can me a little confusing."
good,"Muito aprendizado e novas experiencias, excelente oportunidade de um novo conhecimento."
good,"It is a fun place to work with flexible hours and a management team that listens.  I feel that the pay is on the low end, however, the benefits are on par with industry standard."

good,"El trabajo en equipos interdisciplinarios es bastante bueno, ya que existe interés de todas las áreas involucradas en los procesos de ventas para entregar soluciones eficientes a los clientes internos y externos."

good,Busy (which is a good thing) - a lot of projects going all at one time.  Always learning something new.  The people are great.  Very team oriented environment.
good,"A day at Ecolab is fast paced, detailed oriented, quality ensured, and physical. The company is growing both locally and globally and ensures a job for as long as one is willing to put in the effort."
good,Get to make your own schedule.  Don't ever sit behind a desk.  Traveling from business to business teaching and selling the Ecolab cleaning program.
good,I am a team player with co-workers very responsible in my job duties assigned.I am a very safety orientated worker.I am willing to take on easy task to hard ones.My attendance is great.I am always willing to learn more than my position assigned to be more flexible to handle the company needs.
good,"good products, great people. company needs to realize that if they want to retain and recruit the best sales reps in the healthcare industry, they need to have different awards and trips. Us sales people are motivated by money and rewards."
good,"busy"
good,This is a very good locally owned company. They stay in touch with the staff on a work and personal level. Great group of people!!
good,"busy,challenging never the same thing,feel of accomplishment at days end"
good,Good company to work for - on sales side. It's a big company so you tend to get silo'd within your division.
good,"A empresa é muito boa de se trabalhar, tem uma politica invejavel, todos os funcionarios seguem as normas de segurança, politica. Aprendizado muito bom, gerencia preocupada em mostrar resultados para todos. Infelizmente não há vagas para efetivação de estagiários, pois a empresa ainda está em fase de crescimento."
good,"Conheci excelentes colegas de trabalho, fiz grandes amigos no tem tempo em que passei or lá."
good,Great opportunity for a secure career with very positive avenues for advancement.

good,fun work place great poeple to work with great company yo work for.  flexible work schedule. great supervisor to work for.  learned a lot of sale skills
good,"Es un empresa con buen ambiente laboral, aunque debido a las últimas compras y adquisiiones que se realizaron a nivel mundial estuvo tratando de encontrar un camino."
good,This was a typical company to work for. I learned how to work in a team environment. I was young at the time and only worked there for a little while. This company was sent overseas.
good,Good workplace with good colleagues. Lots of change and challenge and opportunities for those willing to travel. Typical US Multinational environment with strong targets but good recognition for getting there.
good,Good place to work. Agile really worked there. At the time I was there the teams were not scaling. They were a .NET shop when I was there. Good development team and business analysts.

good,Empresa multinacional (líder de mercado a nível mundial) dinâmica e exigente com bom ambiente trabalho.
good,"I enjoyed working at Ecolab and got along well with all of my coworkers. I found the job at Ecolab to be both challenging and rewarding. I liked the fast-paced learning environment and helping to grow a large book of customers with my managers. My biggest challenge was getting my manager to understand my abilities to see beyond the everyday tasks and to truly take a leap of faith and grow the business exponentially. I'm not someone who just works 8-5pm to get a paycheck. I engage in my work and enjoy learning with others various ways to make tasks both efficient and effective for overall profitability and growth. I don't work to be average, I work to be the best for the benefit of all in the company."
good,You set up your on route. I learn to eliminate the pest problem rather than control. Management was lacking in support in my district. Can become stressful due to workload. I enjoyed working with fellow pest control techs
good,Company had excellent training and gave good experience. But had crazy work hours some at night some day hours always seemed there was a call out somewhere. Pay can vary depending on how many jobs you have.
good,"Sales were how you were paid. Service was the way to keep the customers.  By service, I mean fixing their equipment or answering questions that you didn't have the answers they wanted to hear."
good,"I have a great team and decent work schedule."
good,"déjà travaillé chez ECOLAB en logistique."

good,"Un gran empresa donde hay libertad para organizar tu tiempo, siempre y cuando cumplas los objetivos que se asignan."
good,"Avalio como positiva minha passagem por esta empresa pois aprendi muito do ramo químico, tanto com gestores como na área operacional. A troca de informações era muito boa e todos atuavam de forma dinâmica. Apresentei um projeto de melhoria agregando valor a um material que nates seria descartado."
good,Ecolab is a very good company to work for. The benefits are top of the line and are easy to access. The supervisors are very respectful and easy to get along with.
good,Its was great with all the coworkers. It would have been better in management had more contact with the workers and better communication. We should just have to ask our co workers questions.
good,It was great to provide a service for the customers that was in need.  It is important to me to provide great service to customers.  Commercial account were serviced not just during the day and at night.
good,enjoyed qoeforimg with all my associates. enjoy my customers. once a month meetings qnd equipment pickup was sufficient for training and communication.
good,Ecolab gave me an opportunity to demonstrate my leadership skills.  I lead a team of 10 people.  I enjoyed working there.  They closed this division out of this area.
good,"days at work was always different daily based on production"
good,decent company to work for with great benefits...work autonomy...objectives were achievable...nice working culture...needed new opportunity for advancement
good,Good place to work.  Lots of opportunity.  The location was idea.  I enjoyed the work and of the people there.  I would recommend this company to any finance and accounting professional.
good,"The environment is relax and the folks at Ecolab are friendly. I wish I wasn't a contractor I would have like working at Ecolab even more. It was my first IT job, with the exception of the low pay rate (due to being a contractor) I enjoyed working there."
good,Every day was very busy and changing environment.  There were some meetings each day that took place that got off track at times.  Very experienced workforce and knowledgeable maintenance technicians.
good,"empresa que foca na segurança do colaborador, visando sempre o seu bem estar."
good,"it was a great place to work, lots of training. shadowing of senior technicians.They provided a nice work van, with a full inventory plus the company phone and ipad for all work orders"
good,Great Company to work for. Down side is they are growing and upper management is changing every couple of years. I was caught up in a Downsizing of my division and felt that the new management didn't even know what I brought to the company.
good,"Good work life balance. Insurance is not great. 401k match, stock options, pension after 3 years of working for an ecolab company. Paid time off, sick days, paid short term disability."
good,"According to my experience Ecolab is an excellent company, however the balance between work and family time is difficult to handle, calls in the middle of the night, and endless weekends when you are on call, are difficult factors in the day to day, however they are very good company to create a professional career"
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral y equipo de trabajo, Se preocupan por la seguridad de sus empleados."
good,"The best experience I ever had working for a company, great culture and I acquired new skills with this company. I had a manager who did not micromanage and demonstrated great training and patience as I acquired and gained experience."
good,My time with Ecolab was very rewarding. I was exposed to a myriad of challenging and rewarding opportunities. Being able to conduct my business from home with the flexibility to balance work and personal life was quite agreeable. Although due to the demographics advancement became limited.
good,Ecolab were one of the best companies I have worked for .
good,"I truly do enjoy and appreciate this job. I enjoy the flexibility the most - if I want to sleep in, I just check my schedule to ensure I can move audits to later in the day, and then I do. A typical day involves driving to customer locations (restaurants, hospitals, etc.) and conducting customized audits. These audits are not always well-received by managers, etc. Usually, the corporate offices use these audits to ensure all of their locations are maintaining the proper standards.

good,Only doing this because its required. Not interested in blasting the company I currently work for on a public forum. Look at employee ratings on Glass door. It's pretty accurate.
good,Good place to work but need more up to date tech. services. Too much software problems to do you job. *******************************************************
good,"Ecolab is a good place to work, but requires a heavy investment of time, various shifts and weekends.  The compensation is fair, but the work/life balance can be taxing.  Leadership is good, but there is a lot of turnover of leadership and field associates.  "
good,"Ecolab is a great place to work. It lacks the assistance that is needed to get the job completed. Management rely on you to call your fellow team mates, instead of knowing who is available to assist in customer support. "
good,They are very flexible with your work schedule. The overall place is quiet most days. The managers/lead doesn't bother you as much. Loved the cafeteria.
good,"As I only worked here for a couple of months, I really cannot say anything bad except when there was training to be done, one person had mentioned to me that she did not have time to train me."
good,This was a great company but at this time they sold out so this is not an option for anyone else at this point and time I worked when I wanted to and set my own schedule and hours.
good,"There is a great R&D facilitate that really helps with the new product development. "
good,Ecolab was a great place to work if they take me back I would go back. great environment to work in and the employees make is even better..chemical plant
good,Great place to work and a chance to get promoted especially if your willing to relocate. Great training and a place where you can grow. My leadership made it possible to improve skills.
good,"Good place to work. However, expect to start off working as either temporary contract or agency. Majority of the company is made up of individuals who have worked here for 10+ years with benefits. Current processes vary between entities but are gradually becoming streamlined. Expect some manual work to accommodate the older employees who make up the majority. Otherwise, great company with lots of perks, events, etc."
good,"Training second to none,  all the support from management to be successful.  Managers lead by example and work harder than any body.  (Which is Unlike everywhere else I've ever worked) Your efforts will be rewarded.  But it requires commitment at a high level.  Physically demanding.  Requires good problem solving and high attention to detail.  If you put in the work you can grow within the organization.  Not a good fit if you are easily overwhelmed. But it was a fun job I'm glad I worked there, it is like running your own business without having to handle the hard part billing and collections. Good corporate support they invest in you as their best asset.  You control your schedule your route,  you need good time management. I had another educational opportunity come up  otherwise I would have stayed."
good,"The work to life balance is very skewed. The pay however, is great. The benefits were good. The management was a bit weak. The potential for advancement is almost non existent"
good,"There are so many opportunities to learn. The issue is with other employees who refuse to carry their weight. Also, when an associate leaves, they want you to pick up the slack instead of hiring someone new or giving you a raise."
good,"Es una empresa en donde no hay pausas y siempre hay nuevos objetivos que alcanzar, existe mucho movimiento y aprendizaje diario.  En esta empresa me forme desde cero y descubrí todas mis fortalezas trabajando constantemente con mis debilidades para hoy poder considerarme experta en mi área.  La gerencia es rígida y en ocasiones excesiva sin embargo implica un reto para ser mejor en cada paso. Cuenta con una excelente cultura de crecimiento, estabilidad laboral y respeto, el detalle es que no siempre se logra llevar acabo.  Lo más complicado en este trabajo fue el poco tiempo que se tiene para la vida personal, la familia en donde te lleva a hacerla a un lado para continuar.  Me encantó interactuar con mis pares y personas que fueron maestros en mi desarrollo profesional. El poder dar soluciones a los clientes, brindando a las diversas áreas comerciales información clave para aplicar estrategias que sigan demostrando que la empresa es líder en su giro, ha sido mi mayor satisfacción laboral."
good,Nice job but had to travel a lot. Serviced only other businesses. They only way to make more money was to go out and get new customers to add to your monthly total of sales.
good,"If you work for Ecolab you should be prepared. It is not 9 to 5 job."
good,"empresa da um bom suporte , fornece ótimos benefícios"
good,A empresa oferece recursos para crescimento. Salario acima da média do mercado.
good,"this is a career that is fast paced.the culture is one of the best there is "
good,"Boa impresa , mais tem que se dedicar somente a ela , empresa principalmente pra pessoas solteiras!!!"
good,"Dentro  de la empresa  transnacional  gigante como esta , he  aprendido   mucho y he sido  muy valorado , tanto en su esquema de trabajo como la valorizacion que hay    para los trabajadores , estoy situado  en  forma excelente   en el grupo  laboral y  con las demas persona que trabajo, mucha sastifacion y un buen desempeño dentro de estas.Referente  a la valorizacion  de la empresa es  pugante en constante crecimiento y con alto respaldo economico que contribuye    para la en puesta en marcha de su nueva sede,dando mayor giro y amplitud al negocio  como tambien desarrollo sustentable para optar,la parte  dificil es el constante rotacion de personal que no da  mucha garantia  y produce un caos e incertidumbre ya que mayoritariamnet     son  personal externo netamente."
good,"A scheduled route to visit customers, with the potential for emergency visits to other customers having issues."
good,Ecolab is a great company and awesome carreer. The last 10 years have been some of the best years of my life between working and balancing a family life. Unfortunately the last 3 years has been a struggle due to detrimental management being promoted in the area with very little raining and leadership skills. This has in turn affected numerous territories negatively. With a succesfull carreer here with 7.5 million in sales I have decided to explore other options and take my experience to enjoy other avenues.
good,My job with Ecolab offers salary plus commission so there is opportunity for good income. Job demands a lot of time and driving so work life balance gets out of whack pretty often.
good,Ecolab is a great company to work for. Positive people with constant growth. Good carreer building opportunities with a safe clean working environment.
good,An all-around great place to work. Lots of opportunities for learning and professional growth. I would definitely recommend Ecolab to anyone looking to start a career.

good,"Un día típico seria iniciar labor a las 8 am, observar plan de proveedores e ingresarlos al sistema, recibirlos al transcurso de el día realizar RTS de calidad , un método que se implementa con lideres de el proceso para ver que urgencias y que importancias ahí para resolver en el dia. Realice mis practicas en Ecolab en el area de control de calidad y en seis meses aprendí Muchísimo mas de lo que yo iba a ejercer, me enseñaron el análisis físico químicos de todos los producto que ahí se fabrican, aparte de eso aprendí un poco de cromatografia, en cuanto a la Gerencia participe mucho en RTS de liderez de proceso desde la gerencia con preguntas sobre control de calidad. todas las areas complementan un buen equipo y se ayudan mutuamente. La parte mas dificil de el trabajo seria para mi, la capacidad de resolver los problemas que se presentaban diario y que requerían una solución inmediata y colaboración de todos los procesos, lo que me gusto fue todo lo que aprendí, profesionalmente y personalmente me enseñaron mas de lo que yo iba a practicar."
good,"Trabalando na Ecolab adquiri autonomia para aplicar meus conhecimentos nos projetos, conseguindo assim aprender com os erros e acertos, construí uma equipe sólida que consegue seguir com seu trabalho de maneira regular. Os meu dias na Ecolab eram intensos e de muitas reuniões, onde demandavam vários trabalhos extra, mas como tinha uma equipe grande e bem distribuída conseguia com dinamismo dividir os novos desafios, aprendi a ser multi funcional e flexível, pois as necessidades do negocia exigia isso, e particularmente eu adorava.O ambiente de trabalho era ótimo tanto meus pares quando meus liderados trabalhavam com grande harmonia facilitando assim a entrega dos projetos dentro dos prazos. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era quando precisa desligar algum colaborador, pois estamos falando de relação humana que nos remete a nos colocar no lugar do outro, mas como todo trabalho precisamos defender os interesses da empresa.A parte mais agradável do trabalho é quando recebemos uma missão e conseguimos cumpri-lá dentro do prazo e este trabalho é reconhecido como importante e também quando a equipe é favorecida pela a entrega, fazendo assim com que todos fiquem orgulhosos e motivamos a entregar ainda mais."
good,"Empresa com ótimos profissionais, ambiente de trabalho agradável, empresa segura e ética."

good,"to much mental abuse, and people being set up or stabbed in the back, too many lies,{by certain co workers},other than that a very good place to work.People that live in the same city that work and party together have a tendency to side together"
good,"Apart from the heavy workload, i really enjoyed working with Ecolab. The benefits included a company car, cell phone, gas card. It involves some travel out of ones territory sometimes, only if assistance to cover is needed."
good,"Ecolab is a good company to work for but is very demanding with a steep learning curve that is hard to get used to. "
good,"Gestão da vida privada e laboral bastante ruim"
good,"Was always something new each and every day, never boring, always learning. Different approach to every job kept you always thinking sometimes even out loud"
good,very challenging position.  However you need to do all of it on your own.  All positions are remote.  No interaction with your peers  so very little ability to cross reference ideas and seek out help especially in time sensitive situations
good,Great place to work - leading (sometimes bleeding) edge of technology.  Long hours but good benefits. Rank and file is great - Management is a little weak
good,Typical factory job. Hardest part is inserting pumps into the bottles on two specific lines. The management team for the most part is good. they care about the employees and their safety.

good,I worked hard.. very hard; and went on Deployment and was treated good but when returned it was different.
good,The Company is amazing and the benefits are tremendous. My position is on call 24 hours a day 5 days a week. This is very difficult to balance with your work life.
good,Aprendi a lidar com produtos químicos o que era novidade pra mim.
good,"Field Service for the Commercial Food Equipment of Hotels, Hospitals, Schools and other Food and Beverage Customers. Continually Working with new products in Commercial Cooking and Refrigeration Equipment. Great Team of Specialized Technicians with many years of Experience. The Hours can be grueling but the reward of Thankful Customers who appreciate what you do for them makes work easier."
good,"I feel privileged to have spent my entire career (so far) with this fantastic company. I literally started at the bottom and have been able to move to several different roles of increasing levels of responsibility in my time at Ecolab within the Finance community. I think the salary is generally fair, but it is well known within the company that the best way to a significant raise is leave and come back at a higher rate."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa para trabalhar, com segurança e cuidado em primeiro lugar."
good,"Was a great place to work. Benefits was great, New manager at my district was incompetent which make work hard for me. A lot of training and certification in commercial cooking equipment. Had to leave because I needed to complete my training in something else"

With that, it moves slow. Sometimes you feel like you're spinning your wheels in a job, or while looking to advance."

good,I love working here. My line 331 is a very physical and fast paced jug line (we make soap). I've learned a lot more about safety and have been made more aware of on the job risks. The management is very positive and proactive to most issues. My co-workers are fun and are like family. The hardest part of the job was learning all the lines since each one is unique. The most enjoyable part is running record numbers on a line with my team.

good,"One stayed busy from morning to night. Besides daily, weekly and monthly work plans and scheduling the on call 24/7 for service maintenance was a requirement. Monthly budgets and annual budgets were also a requirement. The hardest part of the job was to be interrupted during family time and have to go on an emergency service call. I learned with this company how to manage not only my time but the customers needs. I could only sell what I believe in and my job was to ensure use cost was the important ingredient to save money with this program and products for the customer. The traveling was fun and I managed to enjoy the trips and scenery as I enjoy driving."

good,Company culture is everything with Ecolab. Great for motivated self starters. I am quite sorry I left them.
good,"Ecolab was kind of unique. Because of the type of employees it was a fun place to work. Everybody helped everybody meaning when things wer slow I would go to the production lines and help with the apckaging line. My basic responsibility when work in the lab as a technician was to test samples and make correction for the production dept. I was also placed on all different shifts at a moments notice and was done with a smile because of the company as a whole. My typical day in the lab was to run test on production samples and adjust as needed. When samples were slow during the off shifts I would leave a note for production as to where I was, this was agreed for a way to operate as permission was given by the PM and go to the production packaging line and help out. Thats the way Ecolab workers were help each other and keep production levels up. The other part of my job was when I helped out in the shipping department when help was needed to make shipping invoices for the truckers and warehouse loader / pickers. Take inventory of products as requested. I learned a lot since Ecolab sets safety to a very high standard. I was sorry they closed and went to WV. I guess the hardest part of the job was saying goodbye to my fellow employees when we closed. I still keep in touch with a few of them. I guess the most enjoyable part of the job was the employees. We all had a good time there and a fun place to work."
