bad,The managers were awful to work for. The pay was not great. There was room to become shift manager. The customer service was minimal to sat the least.
bad,Working for ross is a complete waste of time. Dont sell your soul just for the sake of having a job. They suck at everything. They are not understanding to anything even though they claim to be. They all are liars. You are overworked and underpaid.
bad,Doesn't even deserve a one star the  Ross store in Bastrop Tx . Very unprofessional & unorganized environment. Especially with the so called management. Nasty dirty store especially the bathrooms. Don't even waste your time trying to get hired in this store.
bad,"When I worked here, we were not allowed to work a second over 25 hours. They would make us take half an hour lunch to come back for 20 minutes to finish running the freight. After only 5 hours, because Oregon law is 6 hours but they are going off of California law because why? This is not California and it put everyone in a mad mood having to take a half hour lunch to come back for 20 minutes. Raises were rare and extremely low. No one has high wages here. "
bad,There always hiring new people and so you never get enough hours. You get called off on a lot of days that your scheduled. It took a lady four years to finally get full time. Thats way too long.
bad,"Racist, belittling, degrading and incompetent. Everyday I was being treated like trash by management and other employees. Every single person was completely unorganized and unable to preform their full job duties."
bad,"You are not valued as a person, you are seen as a number. Wages are very low and work is not fairly compensated. Employees are overworked, underpaid, and unhappy."
bad,This location had poor leadership in every way. Literally everyone did what they wanted. There were people who took numerous breaks or did no call no shows for weeks and still had a job. Literal chaos
bad,"From Store manager to Upper management and HR will stabbed you .NO ONE IS TRUST WORTHY. The manager will  lie on you to cover themselves.  BACKSTABBER They will have  associates  lie on you, you work yourselves hard with out any appreciation from the manager. I WOULD ADVISE NO ONE TO WORK THERE. NO LOYALTY TO ASSOCIATES THAT GIVES 10 OR MORE YEAR . BETTER YET TO ANYONE."
bad,"Terrible place to work! Pay is too little for the work they want you to do, rude emplyees, supervisor constantly watch you and move you around if they think you are not busy enough and the the break room is so far away that by the time you get there it is time to go back! Was like a prison!"
bad,"Management is never in the same page because their bosses all say different things. District mangers, area Loss preventions mangers, regional LPM’s, zone directors, and all the above will come into the store and all contradict each other’s feedback to management. As a result, management is always going back and forth trying to please all the needs of several higher ups. This company is cheap and does not deliver raises based on work ethic. If you do happen to get a raise, it'll be because you have had to beg for it. When the yearly appraisals come in, for the most part management will mark a lot of people almost meeting the requirements just so that they do not have to give them a raise. This is also why you'll tend to see 2 cashiers and thirty people in line because we prioritize payroll, which we can tend to go over when the stock truck is not completed on time. The salesfloor will always have it hard and the stock team is always favored by higher ups because that's where the merch comes out from (even if they go over payroll). Mangers tend not to have break/meal coverage and overall it is lawsuit after lawsuit waiting to happen. There was a lot of lawsuits going on when I worked there as well. However, with all said, if you need a job...it's not hard to get and keep. You have to be a fast learner and quick. The only reason I stayed was because I was good at merchandising and I loved my coworkers"
bad,The employees at Ross deserve more money than they make for the work they do and what they put up with. They work in inadequate conditions. They are treated like slaves and aren't paid enough. They stay because they need the money. Corporate doesn't care but someone should.
bad,This company is not a good company to work for. They expect you to work very very hard and they say your reward will be the customers smiling at you. There's no incentive to be a hard worker.
bad,I reported harassment to my manager about my supervisors actions and no one in management took it seriously because they were all close friends so I quit after working there for two years.
bad,"Working at Ross always had me fried, over worked understaffed and definitely underpaid. Schedules were always all over the place, employees were always needed and some employees were always over worked."
bad,Managers are manipulated by upper management which causes variety of mistreatment of the employees with lies and just low moral. Low wages and low hours
bad,The Whole Management Team Is Horrible And Untrustworthy. You Also Cant Get Any OverTime. The Building Is Very Small And Messy. They Never Have Any Room For Anything.
bad,They expect you to do literally everything. The managers are extremely lazy and never want to get on the Register to help out but get mad when the line long.
bad,"Would give 0 stars if I could. RUN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION!!! They have the position listed as full time but it only temp. What a waist of time. You only get 4 and half hours a day and only 2 days on the schedule, so a total of 9 hours, really? This is a job for a kid. You can’t support a family on that. They think you are supposed to wait around for some one to call you in , stand by , like you don’t have a life .Smh , just plain stupid. Why hire so many people and not giving them any hours, thinking they are slick so you won’t have to give any benefits."
bad,"the store I worked at was absolutely HORRIBLE. the assistant store manager was harassing me (not getting into specifics) so I went to the store & the district managers and they told me to ""not worry about it"" then it got to the point where I went to HR and they also didn't do anything. so it just got to the point where I didn't feel safe and i quit. I highly recommend not to work here but you can do what you please"
bad,This is a great company to work for but the last year hasn't been so great there.... the store manager isn't a big help at all and the store has alot of messy employees that work there
bad,All they care about is making sales  does not care about keeping employees  treat employees like if they were disposable and pay much of nothing and benefits are a joke
bad,Please have a full time job when applying for a job at Ross. Minimal training. No room for growth . Only expect 10-15 hours per week. This job was very frustrating
bad,Poor management! Work their employees to the bone for minimum wage while management sits in the office on their phones all day. Don't take into consideration the employees opinions. Claim to give good hours then you notice you only get scheduled 8 hours a week if ur lucky.
bad,"The management treat you like you're disposable, you won't get any benefits because you're part time. They have a lot of family members and friends working under the table. I wouldn't recommend anyone you're better off at MC Donalds."
bad,"Management is not respectful of peoples' time that is wasted by being in line hours on end. Under-staffing for profit is a regular problem.They schedule the bare minimum, then someone always calls in."
bad,"Cuando te entrevisran y te hacen la oferta de trabajo todo te lo pintan de maravilla, pasadas 3 semanas sólo te dejan 8 horas  a la semana, es decir ellos deberían de ser honestos con el Alicante y decirles: ""Es un Part time de 16 horas  cada  15 dias""."
bad,I will absolutely never work for this company again. Constant nagging and micromanaging. Over worked and underpaid. I’ve never experienced so much animosity in one work place like I have this one. They talk big against retaliation but you have store managers and district managers doing just that. At times I felt like I was being discriminated against because I was not from that area and didn’t talk the same way the other associates did . My store managers would change my schedule without asking me and expecting me to be okay with that. I was constantly walked over which confused me because my work ethic is the best quality about me and they took it for granted  please never work for this company if you ever want to have good mental health and a life in general
bad,"A lot of management inappropriate behavior with employees.you come in and work in a pod with another person and you tag sort hang anything that comes in a box,its fast paced,it keeps you fit.its not hard at all its actually fun.at times they hire people with criminal records.the hardest part of the job is the bimbos that they put in as leads because they have relationships with the managers."
bad,"It was a very hostile place to work. The managers worked you overtime without any extra pay. The hours were terrible, and they are not flexible for anyone with a second job or school."
bad,Would not reccomend this place. Management is not very flexible and they are unable to accomodate any needs that their employees might have. If you are in school another job might be ideal.
bad,The managers are absolutely judge mental. Horrible work ethic and disgusting leaders. They do not know how to run a store or treat people. I do not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Honestly the worst place to work. The managers treat the associates like they're sweat shop workers. The two female managers discriminate the new workers that come in & also one of them is super racist. Would never recommend working there.
bad,"Is hard to work island a place where you have no help."
bad,"Mala gestion,mal trato,pica educacion por parte de algunos managers."
bad,"This is an okay company to work for to make extra money it is a lot of work and crazy hours,"
bad,Working second shift here you can say goodbye to your personal life. Majority of the time you work every Saturday so no time with friends and family and the pay could be a little higher
bad,"do not work for this company. worst company I have ever worked for, they are extremely cheap and you will close to never get a raise no matter how long you have worked with the company. that also do not recognize your hard work and will basically hire anyone."
bad,Literally classless incompetent bosses who aren’t even qualified for the job treating employees like trash!!! If you don’t literally kiss up to your bosses they won’t schedule you! They will literally pick on you daily and harass you until you quit! I’ve experienced this at several locations! Just a poorly ran company
bad,"Ross is an okay company but however it’s not the best place to work at. Not very flexible, hours are shared with any new hires so some days you’ll have your regular hours other days you may have less or none whatsoever that’s mainly the downside to it. You get a 20% discount to use and 40% that they do every 3-4 months that lasts for 4 days and only one purchase a day which is nice. Their pay rate varies but I worked their for over a year and wasn’t getting paid what I was supposed to be getting paid for supposedly being a trainer and what not."
bad,"I was told that I would be promoted to supervisor, which never happened. I worked my butt off, and nothing came from it. I would always get into fights with my supervisor because I knew more than her about her position. I'm so happy now that I left."
bad,"Low pay, does not offer full-time positions, so you can't get medical benefits. During holidays, you can work overtime, but then they will cut your hours. Good for a first time employment, but not if you have a family"
bad,Don't recommend working there they treat you like nothing starting with managers don't give you what they offer you.cut your hours without your permission they are not professionals
bad,"Not a good job, working there is like working at a prison. Don’t really treat you with respect it’s just overall a bad environment. I would suggest working somewhere else"
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at this store location. The managers there aren't fair when it came to me. Yes I was pregnant and I told them before they hired me and they said they would still hire me and they won't treat me differently but that was a lie..
bad,"The team is the only good thing about the Wentzville location. The area supervisors have ZERO management experience. One of them likes to show up smelling like alcohol for work. Sitting in the office or smoking outside is not the correct way to lead a team. The district manager does not care about his people. You are expected to be on call 24/7 even if you are sick. The human resources department is another nightmare. If you have an issue you call them and leave a message. Good luck getting it resolved once you actually speak to someone.You will be expected to work insane operating hours. This store is open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays. During the holiday season they stay open until 1:30 am. It is the only store open that late in the plaza so you get a lot of rif raff coming in at night.  I highly recommend walking through SEVERAL Ross locations before you consider even applying. They increased the employee wages but expect you to run the store on the same amount of payroll. This was a constant struggle to get things accomplished with not enough staff. The customers would always complain that there wasn't enough people working. They also complained about the self service fitting rooms the company installed. They did that to cut the payroll further which means you won't have a fitting room attendant for certain hours of the day. As the mod, you are constantly running around trying to put the merchandise back and letting customers in the restroom because it is just you and a cashier working. The turnover is extremely high at this company. Only a couple managers in the entire"
bad,"Seasonal employment, work as fast to get job done then send you home. No place for advancement, very rude staff and managment. Would not recommend to anyone"
bad,"Everything was a complete mess. Nothing was by the book. Everyone assumed they were in charge because they were close to managers. Never allowed to move up to a new position, had a lot of favorites. So much drama with associates and managers. One manager was so rude she will tell you, she doesn't like you or if you are wearing something she would make rude comments to your face!"
bad,Didn’t like it  I just had to deal with it didn’t like it at all it was a bad job I quit because they won’t let me leave for a medical emergency for my animal
bad,The Customers especially around the holidays destroy the store no matter what store you work at it’s gonna be a mess and that’s not the way smart the management is even worse so I advise you if you want to work here ask for more money and get up though.
bad,Literally just don’t do it. This was by far the absolute worst job I have ever had. I always loved shopping at Ross and thought it would be a great place to work but it’s not. Everything that you could imagine wrong with the job possible is what you will experience while working at Ross.
bad,"This was one of the most unorganized companies I've ever had to work for. I was called in every day off, but only for about 2 hours. the managers were not on the same page, employees were such a high turnover."
bad,"Opened a brand new store in Sherwood. Was available to work full time but only got part time hours. Was not enough for many of us, half the employees quit or got fired. Most got a second part time job just to make a living. They have so many rules, and things ""you must act this way, you must say this to customers all the time, ect"". You did not pay me enough to stick to some script at the register. Not only that, we had 13 registers stands in the store and only 1-2 cashiers working at a time. Caused long lines and mad customers. Not to mention, they played favorites and didn't offer full time to everyone so they didn't have to fork out for anyone's benefits. I constantly covered shifts as much as I was able to when they were short handed. I was pregnant at the time and when I needed a day off for my ultrasound, they pretty much told me to switch a shift with someone or else I couldn't have the day off. The time off calendar online I missed by a day.. no one could trade me. It was stressful working for them when managers weren't that great, and I had to work with huge complainers. Just come to work on time, be positive, do the best you can, and go home. That simple. I got cross-trained too!!! So I could work in any department they needed me to. I even trained to help out our main stockroom leader when she didn't want to work on weekends... so I worked weekends bringing in the trucks. It was a lot of hard work back there. And you never felt appreciated. They only focus on what was going wrong. Not a lot of help for the fast-pace they want you to work. Not a great retail experience"
bad,Cooperate does not care about the customer. Associates are timed while customer is at checkout and they try to get you out as fast as possible. They are required to call next customer up before your transaction is even finished. They work the associates with the bare minimum of staff and expect miracles in their stock room with only a few associates running truck. Horrible place to work.
bad,"If I could give this company zero stars, I would. The managers don't know how to communicate with each other and they also make up their own rules instead of following the employee handbook. They schedule 3 cashiers during busy hours during the week, knowing that the line would eventually get long, while they do nothing but sit in the office. Over work you but do not want to pay you more money. Also no opportunities to move up in the company. They show favoritism to certain employees, meaning some rules do not apply to them only to others. Some employees can take longer breaks, but they will time other employees or give them different rules. Management also does not give enough hours, they ask other employees to stay longer, they also give other employees almost 30 hours even though they were part-time (meaning 20-25 hours). While I would get low hours, or managers taking me off the schedule without notifying me. If the managers have a problem with you, they will take hours away. Work experience here and with the company as a whole, is horrible. I would not suggest working here to anyone."
bad,Ross always says that they care about there employees safety and from what I learned they do not because what happened to me Ross did nothing about it. So as far as that it is not true
bad,"Like many companies, Ross's bottom-line is their number 1 priority. Even if one is searching for a throwaway part-time gig, don't go to Ross; the company, their policies and practices, are outdated, subpar, and unprofessional. However, their number 1 problem is their negligence towards their employees."
bad,This place is all about favoritism. Management is bad. They truly don't care about most employees unless you kiss their behinds. Hours are iffy. You could be scheduled 5 days but only work 2 due to payroll always being cut daily. To keep it short and clear don't waste your time.
bad,"Rude associates and worst managers, unqualified. Favoritism all over the store. exploit workers to worker had with low to no benefits of promotion or increase in payment."
bad,Not a good company to work for. Rude. Randomly follow rules. Dont ever work closing shifts because due to customers you could be there anywhere from 15 min after closing to almost 3 hours.
bad,Very micro managerial. Not a good place for straight males. LOTS of drama and knee jerk reactions. Company is great and resources are sufficient to get job done. DM visits are constant and disruptive to getting any work done.
bad,"Used to work here a year ago. The Company would give you little to no hours, managers were full of themselves, and horribly understaffed store. The managers would also blame you for everything while they sit in the back office and returns over $50 would require authorization, which needs a higher ups user and pass-code. When required, they management would take up to 5-10 minutes to come up and enter it. When leaving after your shift, they would keep you there almost half an hour after wards to clean up everything you had no time to clean up due to their horrible management and under staffing. When you are with the company for a long time, they will find a reason to get rid of you, including threatening to sue you like you're a criminal. Don't waste your time on this joke of a company."
bad,They don’t appreciate their employees. Management only worries about themselves while they treat their employees with the minimum respect. They don’t respect availabilities and they don’t pay the minimum they pay less than minimum wage. Managers are just sitting in office that’s why employees don’t work as hard anymore because they don’t get treated with respect. All the bonuses go to the managers.
bad,Manager is bad. she dont have hours to work. Only for his fríends  she only give 2 days to work in the week or 10 hours for week. If you want to talk with she. She said I dont have time.
bad,"dont recommend working here worst place the pay is horrible our manager was rude,  never wanted to anything never let us do over time and was racist person"
bad,"Bad company to work for ...poor Management..unfairness .hard work low pay ."
bad,I work in one in Memphis Tennessee I wouldnt not recommended this job to no one the mangers are super messy they pick and choose who they wanna give hours to all they do is sit up and gossip I wouldn't work there I'm current seeking employment somewhere they have cut my hours for no reason
bad,"After working there for a few months, you can carry your own weight."
bad,"I was not a fan of this Job at all. "
bad,"There was only one manager at Ross that was the best. He is the only one from original team at Cityplace thats still there the store manager she should be fired, along with the new managersshe is in an area she is underestimating for how dangerous it is for her attitude towards locals of the neighborhood she profiles and teaches LP to do so as well she's going to get someone hurt they need real police officers reapoliceofficers"
bad,"Ross Distribution works you like a dog and alot of stress as they want to to be competitive to your fellow workers ,instead of together.And if not doing it enough ,you chance loss of employment."
bad,"Forced to work 6 day weeks on the same hours as 5 days for months, even with trained backups for my role. Asked to lie about productivity of my team, even while management was counting boxes to verify productivity totals. Made to work in unsafe conditions of stacked trash, not allowed to send trash down the compactor unless done by a manager, manager refused to do the work."
bad,"Ross Stores did not give me the hours I intended to have. Working 12 hours a week wasn't what I signed up for. It was devastating, I did not want to resign but it wasn't beneficial for me."
bad,it was a temp job to get me by i don't Recommend working at ross pay was bad hours were bad nothing about the job was good the people there were horrible to work with
bad,I barely got any hours and they got mad if I stayed over the time. I was thrown in the fitting room for the first time without the proper training. I was only scheduled to work either once or twice out of the week for only 4 hrs and 30 mins a day. They never have enough cashiers. I was put on the register by myself plenty of times and had long lines and management tried to blame me and say I need to work faster. They always claim that it's a turn over so they can't hire enough people. DON'T WORK AT ROSS AT ALL!!!!
bad,Ross Dress for Less is a very crooked company. I’ve worked 4 years at this company with a spotless record and I was terminated on false allegations. I was not warned and I was caught by surprise with termination. Never warned or given any documentation prior to my termination. This was a case of retaliation. I would not recommend this company for anyone that is looking for a long term career.
bad,this ia a very popr company to work for. i   will never refer anyone to this company and no compassion .  ipper management has poor communication skills
bad,"Ross like many other retail jobs is stressful and full of turnover, miscommunication, laziness, and weak pay. It seemed like nobody knew what they were doing and we were constantly understaffed."
bad,"Management was horrible, they promised promotions and then withdrew them. They work people too hard. They wrote up half the employees for not unpacking boxes to their inhuman standards. I was never allowed a lunch break when I worked 14 hours every day. They misrepresented the schedule. The hours I worked did not reflect what I was scheduled."
bad,"Bad place to work , management sucks , certain employees do what they want and no one abides by the policy, it is not a good place to work, they over work people"
bad,"This place would not be a nightmare if it did'nt have the most disrespectful store manager; ever, with no regard to people whatsoever- even her longtime staff. Disgrace! Even if youre the best worker, on top of it all, respectful, and avoid all drama--she will come for you. Hollers at staff. The store manager and assistant manager will instruct two different things and only you will lose. Hours are measly. Training not there but you literally will get yelled at for not knowing and that's typical."
bad,They paid very low for a lot of work. The work in store is very tired. I have to work on more than one department. It is hard  work and break time is very short.
bad,Manager does not give rate increases poor manager does not give full time work need to update personal manager had favored people .....................
bad,"Just awful, the stress made me physically ill. I would never suggest anyone work there. They took money out for insurance for when I wasn't signed up for insurance"
bad,"Stressfull, poor leadership/management, poor resource management (hours, bags, receipt paper: simple things), forced to do work outside job description (security, bathroom cleanup), forced in positions of leadership without proper compensation (no payraise to do supervisor work), take hours away constantly, promote employees with no experience to leadership positions, constantly forced to work past shift, breaks/lunches skipped all the time, days.hours not properly portrayed on paycheck"
bad,WOULD NEVER WPRK HERE AGAIN. management is sloppy and the store is constantly dirty. Scheduling was a disaster and do not care about their employees..
bad,I worked at ROSS for many years.  They treat management awful.  The only good thing I could say about ROSS is I have met so many great friends working there.
bad,This is not a company you want to even consider working for. The management is ignorant and confronted me for a mistake I made as a new employee in front of customers. They also called me all of the time to work extra but offered no extra pay or benefits. I had to perform many long and impossible tasks due to the stores inability to stay organized. DO NOT WORK HERE. RUN. YOU CAN DO BETTER.
bad,"Always short of staff. No management follow through when something is brought to their attention. Stressful work environment and poor morale.  No recognition for a job well done   just criticism"
bad,"no training no respect lots of he say,"
bad,"Working at Ross is not a good place to work at. You worked hard and you’re underpaid. The company does not appreciate their employees. No Christmas bonuses, no awards, no Cash calls, nothing!"
bad,"Ross has one of the most toxic work environments that i have ever experienced. Employees are treated with little to no respect by management and corporate. When processing inventory for the shelves you are given quotas to hit, in my case this is extremely difficult due to the fact that Managements corrosive attitude leads to employees quitting within a few weeks. For example we did not have enough employees on hand with experience to complete our quota and we needed help, after informing management of this the course of action was to get a stopwatch stand over us and yell that we should just move faster. if you have a choice i would seek employment somewhere else where you are treated with some dignity."
bad,"For management I wish I could put 00000. Working at Ross was good until the store got a new store manager!! The store went down hill from there, the store manager is the worst. She’s never there to help out and want to blame the store being a mess on everyone else. She will fuss at employees on the floor where other employees & customers can hear. She doesn’t know how to talk to people at all. All of the good employees are gonna leave because of her."
bad,lazy management you dont get all ur brakes on time if at all really bad training not hard to move up but it only become stressful when all management doesn't do there job or follow the rules
bad,"I worked for ROSS for a good 6 months, I was loyal, and always far earlier than usual, I had a few scheduling conflicts, though I was made to believe that they wouldn’t be turned into points, somehow they did, and I was terminated wrongly for these times I made sure I have called with a valid excuse. The management could care less about the worker, in fact if they can get rid of you they will. The only good thing was my coworkers! I still think about them, they made life bearable."
bad,They pay minimum wage but they push you to manage multiple departments with 30 cent raises yearly with poor management. Management is not trained properly and it shows.
bad,Management suck at this place. If you don't kiss thier behinds then you don't go anywhere in this place. Assistant manager and store manager make your life miserable if you try to stand up for anything that is right. Assistant manager  always talks about her personal life. Also they only promote you if you listen to them and ASC talks bad  about everyone behind thier backs. Store manager is the hugest snake alive. You always have to watch your back if you ever want to work in this place. You also get fired for the dumbest reason
bad,"Not a great place to work, horrible company and a horrible store manager, store is junky now and not enough hours, lots of nepotism and fake people are present."
bad,They give teenagers roles of management and overlook the more mature ones.  The roles of supervisor goes to the teenagers head and they don't make good management.  They keep you busy all the time.  Which I did not mind.  But it was hard to get your break and they timed you out right away so you barely have time to go to the bathroom.  No time for a snack.  Just 10 minute breaks.  They had a Department manager harassing me that was in a different Department then me.  She just did not like me.  So I finally stood up for myself and she complained to management that I was rude.  I should of told management that she had been giving me a hard time.  I had been excited to get a job at Ross but it was not what I expected.  Then they have this clean thing at closing.  You have to go around and pick up stray items and put them back in the right spot.  You can't plan on doing anything afterwards because you don't know how long it would take to clean the store.  Depends on how messy the customers were that day.
bad,"This job would be alright for a high school student, if this was the last job on earth. This was the absolute worst job I ever had in my life. If you are an adult, don't even waste your time applying. I wish someone would have warned me. The girls in the stockroom are juvenile, loud and ignorant. I felt like I was in high school in the hood. DO NOT APPLY TO THIS JOB."
bad,"Terrible Managers they taught you the job and then basically forgot about you once they felt like you know what you were doing, The Bathrooms were terrible, And for the extreme hardwork we were doing the pay was extremely low."
bad,"The store manager cussed out another employee in front of customers, would change the schedule without informing the person, then call them asking why they didn’t show for their shift. Held meetings where some would be told they would be getting a promotion then never followed through, hired externally to fill higher positions."
bad,It's not a good place to work. The managers don't care about there employees just themselves. They don't work with your schedule at all to accommodate
bad,"A Typical day involved unloading a truck of items. You lift heavy boxes until the load is finished, this was done in the snow as well as during heat waves. After you cut the boxes open and begin sorting all while the snow is blowing in on you with the door open or the heat with no steady AC. Once items are sorted you must begin hard tagging and alarming items to prepare them for sales floor on correct racks. This process took hours and is very physical, taking much out if your body. You must be fast to meet quotas. I learned how the back scenes of retail work. The hardest part of the job is the unprofessionalism amongst employees, having conversations through out shifts that are very personal and contain much profanity being thrown around the room. Also the toll it takes on your body, lifting and bending for hours every shift. The most enjoyable part was laughs with a few good coworkers."
bad,Sometimes it's hard to get 40 hours a week because they will send you home early due to there being no work. Around Christmas time they expect for you to work OT and 6 days a week.
bad,"I would not reccomend this place to even my worst enemy. If you like to be over worked and under paid with little to no training then this is the job for you. I was extremely under staffed, was treated like I was not even part of the management team half the time and had no support from the mangement team."
bad,I worked at ross for 4 months. The hours were super inconsistent one week I would have 25 hours the next I would have 5 🤷🏾‍♀️. The employees would talk about customers & other employees in front of their face . It was NO training . And they would get upset at you for not having a quick enough cash and tender when you aren’t even at work enough . You can’t expect my check out time to be consistent if I’m gone for 1/2 weeks at a time. Also they over work you . They expect you to hop on and off register a organize work fitting room it’s just a mess.
bad,full of drama the old Mexicans ladies have no life and start trouble.it was just a horrible experience and horrible management .they dont care there they just want to work you like slaves
bad,"Completely rude and stuck up management. Lies about dress code, neglects new employees and then punishes them for messing up when they weren't even trained properly in the first place. All in all crummy work environment"
bad,This job will literally work you to the point where it will get you agitated. Management needs to be replaced. Unfair treatment of employees. I believe working here was not one of my best places to work.
bad,"Some mangers think they are better and if you follow what they say you get in trouble with management for doing the job wrong. Their are some who are okay and understand that the job takes toll on some people more than others. Management was so disfunctional the higher ups had to come down and fire one of the managers from stealing money. The head manager got fed up and decided to retire from a job that gave her a store that had so much crime going through it. Do not get this job if your in school, thinking of going to school. If your on welfare, this is a great job to get some money to live pay check to pay check, but you will need a second job for other bills and expenses."
bad,"Te Dan proyectos hacer cuando eres nuevo no te ponen ayuda De una persona con experiencia,al mismo tiempo te mandan a cubrir brakes,lounchs, te llaman a mostrar joyeria,y aparte no te quieren dar brakes hasta q termines lo q ellos les importe mas,le Dan prioridad a sus proyectos no a Los trabajadores,tienes q terminar tu trabajo y aparte el proyecto q te ddieron,es muy estresante"
bad,The manager was always very critical of everything I did and said. She didn't like me and treated me different than everyone else. She made it so I had no recourse but to quit.
bad,"If you want to see the most blood, urine and feces you’ve ever seen at a retail establishment, look no further because ross has that for you. If it wasn’t for the horrible customers, the company itself does not care about its employees. I’ve worked in two different locations in two separate states and it’s all the same. Everyone is always stressed out. cooperate is always changing rules, and blame you for not following them. Also the customers treat you like your a robot and have absolutely no dignity or respect when talking to you."
bad,I really liked the job and would probably still be working there if the manager would have been half the manager that she says she is. If you aren’t lucky enough to be one of her favorites you might as well forget it.
bad,This is by far the worst job I have ever had. The hours are horrible (late nights till 1:00 am). The work hurst your back (picking clothes up off the flor). The people are total jerks. Management is a joke.
bad,"You will be told to work hard and you'll be rewarded with a raise and promotion that will never happen. Ross does not give raises! They do not care about their employees! They care even less about customer service.  The most important thing to ross is that you process customers as fast as possible, not caring if you are short and unfriendly."
bad,"They have no respect for their employees. Managers alert their security as soon as a black person walks in the store. They’re known racists, please stay away from them."
bad,management was never around very sloppy the way the store was managed and handled. people would come in and steal or mess up store and no actions were taken to help employees with anything
bad,"Ross is a fast paced retail store that doesn't have enough support for the amount of customers that they have. Management is in charge of scheduling but they don't schedule enough people for the day. On a slow day there may be 2 or 3 cashiers but there is only one cashier at the front at all times. It is very stressful since the store does fill up frequently and back up cashiers are not only in charge of being back ups but they have to clean their area too. Management doesn't care about the organization of the store, they only care about getting out of the store 30 minutes- 1 hour after closing."
bad,Floor managers are barely paid over minimum wage and are given a huge workload. They make it impossible to receive a bonus until you become a store manager. It Also takes forever to advance higher than a floor manager.
bad,This is by far the worst job I've ever had. Their hours are inconsistent and management is HORRIBLE. You never have the supplies you need. It's not worth the stress. Don't do it.
bad,Promotes young immature teenagers to management while there are others that work there have been with the company longer that deserve it more. It's all about favoritism and who you know and who's behind your up the most.
bad,This place stucks. No advancement. Management is not the sharpest. Dress code not followed. No rules just favoritism. Pay is below average. Procedures need to be improve for efficiency. I would not recommend any one to come work here. Not a fun place to work. No perks. Their time recording system is ancient.
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years. Terrible management, no communication, advancement based on friendships. Everyone is lazy the store is a hot mess and nobody seems to care. I would not recommend this place to anyone!!! Low pay!!! After 5 years I made under $12 an hour!"
bad,I hated to even give it a 1 star. I been here for 3 years i still make what people who walk in make. Management sucks and its ran by a bunch of clowns who dont know what they are doing. Im moving on to better things
bad,Ross dress for less is a terrible company to work for. The management and upper management is all about who you know. They do not care about their employees. I would never recommend working for this company.
bad,I was always stressed working at Ross. There was so much to do and we were always understaffed. The managers at Ross weren't helpful at all they mainly just told you what to do and then would go sit in the office.
bad,"This was a very stressful job with alot of turn over in management at store level and above"
bad,"For how much money this company makes they run their stores on 3 people at a time, that’s including management. Don’t bother trying to work your way up once you make it to ASM they will hire a complete outsider to fill an SM role with absolutely no product or company knowledge. Also don’t get pregnant if you wanna work at Ross, you’ll be unloading trucks and slinging boxes at 9 months pregnant with no guaranteed pumping breaks. Only made a few dollars more than a seasonal part time associate walking in off the street when I was an ASM. They expected too much from the part timers in regards to loss prevention and company initiatives and honestly if the SM that came in and took my promotion never got hired I would probably still be there because I adored my associates....but the company still sucks and I am so happy to not have to set foot in that awful place again. Would never shop there. If I did I would just put stuff where it doesn’t belong because I hate that place. (Sorry guys.) Palm Coast store has gone so downhill with the change in management and the DM is a nightmare. Good luck to that sinking ship."
bad,"Worked at Ross for more then 10 years. I left Ross after to much stress and the company stealing money from your blue chip funds. Blue chip is a bonus that you get for your percentage on how fast you work but you have to know how to cheat and lie the system in order to get the extra $200.00 or $300.00 per check and if you dont cheat or lie they well fire you, So you have to catch on quick this is not a honest work place supervisor and management and all others are in it too because the more you make on your blue chip the more they get on there bonuses. They don't care for employees they fired allot from company and hire nothing but threw agencies. I also see them hired and fired agencies workers every day. If you try to live a honest life and you dont want to steal from the company buy cheating on your blue chip then you well get treated like trash and you wont be the favorite ones so they send you to do the work no one wants to do. And seniority dies not apply."
bad,"Trained me for an advancing position, but they were not proactive about getting me this position so i eventually found another position for another company. After hearing this i was training another associate to take the position they were training me for which i didn't know at the time. After training was done I was taken off the schedule."
bad,"Management was terrible my first day they threw me in the fitting room alone and expected me to work like a regular employee. The manager was working in the front with the other new hires and got an attitude when i asked for help? Worked only two days and never received a call back, never did any orientation, management was terrible and the employees working there looked extremely miserable the pay is not worth what you have to deal with."
bad,"Horrible place to work at. Management, such as assistant store managers and store managers are just there to be in the back, relax and never come to check up on you. You have to do everything yourself. If you ask for help, assistant and store managers give you attitude or try to say passive aggressive comments towards your work ethic. Constant changes from corporate that don’t help, they actually make everything worse for the sales floor employees, cashiers or the front end supervisors."
bad,"Pay compensated for the overbearing work."
bad,Poor management. Favoritism is a problem at all Ross stores. Privacy requests are ignored. Gossip and drama with all managers. Managers are hired pretty much off the street rather than given to people who have worked there for years.
bad,They do not care about workers. They just push to get the work out. Will give you points even if you have a doctor note why you are out. Work every Saturday.
bad,"Worst job I have ever had."
bad,Can't expect to move up in this company. Long hours into the night restocking things that immediately get unorganized so it is very pointless and repetitive.
bad,"One really good manager. Everyone else seemed to be in the mind set of an immature high school student. Managers would purposely only schedule 3 employees on the most busy days, so if you ever wonder why a Ross store is so dirty it's because 1 person is on the floor recovering. The bad managers would stay in the managers office the whole shift and you wouldn't see them until about an hour until closing. they would ""forget"" breaks and instead of giving you your break or lunch you would just leave early. At the end of the night the manager that stayed in the office would make you run around like a headless chicken to get things cleaned up on time and if you don't well hope you aren't sleepy because you probably wont be getting off work until 3 in the morning. Friendship was the most important thing in my store and the managers would take vacations together so we would be short handed and will leave an untrained person in charge. oh and 1 manager would literally take a vacation just about twice every 3 months. If you get sick and a certain manager was working, congratulations you just got everyone else sick because you're definitely not going home; even if you're throwing up all over the place. Managers don't care if you just had both of your grandparents die in the same week you'll have to work on the day of the funeral. managers will lie and manipulate people just to start drama for the fun of it. Also A specific manager would give family and friends a discount especially on double discount days but will tell on another employee for doing the same thing. If you  make a manager"
bad,I am so sadden by the treatment that Ross management give to there employees. They don’t value the work that employees sacrifice to work there. They bully their employees when calling in sick. They are rude and demeaning to their employees
bad,"i don't like it it sucks there the management . The manager is a bad mean unfair person who only cares about himself, he is always  in the office talking on his phone about his next vacation time off."
bad,"Not the best job but if you are in need a job that give minimum hours go for it . Customers are realyt rude and impatience a lot of thieves , poor management , Shady coworkers and basically no hours , Company doesn't really care they will overwork you but not pay enough"
bad,"Over-worked, understaffed, under-appreciated and under-paid. The assistant manager had a perfect fake smile for those above her. Would consistently show up 30 minutes to an hour late if the manager wasn't there, would verbally attack the best employees if she felt threatened. Within two weeks, 4 of the most reliable and hardworking employees had quit because of it. I was actually told not to ask for my legally required breaks. The job was stressful and nobody wanted to do anything about it because they were always short staffed and over budget. This is only one location but I will never work at another Ross Store."
bad,10/10 would never recommend. This is the most unprofessional place that i have ever worked. All the staff gossip even the mangers. They never help you with anything and never have enough cashiers.
bad,Never work here ever ever ever.             Worst place ever poor management and advancement opportunities moral is low nobody likes it here at ross nobody
bad,"Management goes after favoritism. You always have to kiss up. Customers here are ghetto and most have no consideration for you. Low hours with not enough pay. Never ask or work on frontend/customer service desk because it will ruin you. You will always be there and never leave. Many customers are nice but many are terrible too. Beware of 40% discount days for ross employees only and holidays, both are the worst days to work and senior disocuntday. Seniors get mad all the time and will ask for them even not on a tuesday"
bad,"Came in at 10 am right when the truck came, unloaded 25 boxes usually. tagged merchandise and stocked shelves and helped Customers find what they needed."
bad,Was all about who you knew. Felt like I was in high school again and the stress was absolutely not worth it. I enjoyed the job just not the people. I miss the discounts.
bad,"In the interview, she mentioned  my race. I am a white woman and she was a white  woman. She literally said "" I am excited that we finally have a white person applying. I want more diversity in the store."" This really bothered me. "
bad,"When I began working here the hours were good. I would work a whole week. "
bad,The job is fairly easy but the way they do things and how they do it it has to be exact way they want it which makes the job even that much harder you have to be timed on how to get the merchandise from the back to the front and when it comes to putting security tags on certain things there is a way it has to be done you can't just do it anyway and it just the way they do things his way too difficult and my time there I noticed that everybody's best friends with each other and a lot of the associates at that store ignore customers
bad,"No one who's there wants to be there, and it shows. The management was unenthusiastic, nonchalant about work, and hypocritical. None of their management decisions make sense, and they will lie right to your face about things they themselves have done or said."
bad,Between employees and management no organization or training whatsoever plus LP runs the joint and watches employees on camera the maint manager is micro managed by the east cost management  and he constantly falls asleep while talking to him and has no back bone doesnt help or protect team.
bad,"First day"
bad,"This place is a joke I spent 4 years of my life here I've been through 4 store managers each time thinking things would change but no they over work the good workers untill they burn out then shame them when they start to get fed up.they never schedule enough cashier's every stock manager that I've seen here gets set up for failure. They base this place on growth and teamwork but that is a lie, having this job is more stressful then anything, if you like high school drama amongst old adults then yes this is the place for you. They will work you till you break and throw you to the side. Wrong place to give them your hard work they don't deserve it.have witnessed discrimination against race, have no compassion to physical, or family matters."
bad,"Summary of my review: If you are considering workint for the Ross Dress for Less in Christiansburg VA, don’t do it. They make the job sound great during your interview, then lie about everything to get you hired. I’ve worked retail for 3+ years as a manager, and nothing compares to the nightmare that is this store."
bad,"This is the worst company to work for honestly. They do not care about you as an employee most of the time you are seen as someone who can potentionally steal their property. There are barely any hours given because of no payroll yet new people are hired constantly. The schedules always change and you will have no idea, sometimes you start later or earlier or you might be cut all together. Management is uncooperative they dont ever agree on some thing. One person says something next manager is some thing different. Employee's are to the point where they just go in for a paycheck and barely want to even do their job and if so they do it's with attitude. The good people ALWAYS end up leaving."
bad,l unloaded trucks with just a couple other women at times. It would be extremely cold in the warehouse in the winter I had numb hands and unloaded trucks in the snow. In the summer I was drenched in sweat while the door would stay open for the truck. I had to endure listening to the associates speak of inappropriate topics and cursing each other out on a daily basis. Everyone was constantly pressured by management to be faster and faster at getting boxes finished. It was so painfully physical to push yourself that after a few years I began suffering chronic pain and was diagnosed with an incurable condition. The doctors feel all of the stress on my body that took place there is a big influence on my illness activating when it did. For 7.40 hr the pain was not worth it. I resigned for health reasons and ended up taking a part time office job for double the pay and no physical stress.
bad,"Its not very good as you have too many responsibilities with a set time and are timed as if it were a race, quality didnt matter here. The pay was awful for someone who needed money."
bad,Working for Ross has taught me never to settle for less  Management is very unprofessional unorganized and honestly from own experience of being a manager they need new reinforcement store looks very messy and they hire a lot of people just to have them work one or two days out of the week when they could use all the help they have it’s unfortunate to see a messy store when it has so much potential
bad,"Working the evening shift was the best for my home schedule. It was awful. Evening workers had no set time off. Would clock out anywhere between 11pm-2am. Not everyone carries their own weight, but they get by being close with management. This seems to be encouraged."
bad,Ross Dress for Less is your typical clothing retailer. Offered little to no training. Decent place to work as a starter job. Most days you are given duties that can change.
bad,"I would not recommended working here! Such a negative place to work at due to poor management. Horrible manager, who does not listen to what you have to say. If you call out (usually I’d call out for family emergencies) they do not care whatsoever. Their behavior at Ross is bad, just because you have “power” does not give you the right to put others down. ALSO, the manager likes to blast your conversation in front of others. Not a good person, super fake."
bad,Nothing to say about Ross it was okay working here but I just didn’t like being takin advantage of and they didn’t really care if I was sick or not they wanted me to still come in while I’m pain
bad,"It can be fun to work here, but it gets crazy. Managment isnt the best, communication is needed but if youre just looking for a part time job, this is a good start."
bad,"Working with Ross has its ups and downs, but not to work all your life, it’s ok until you move on to a permanent career. Good perks that was offered by this employer, was receiving a 20% discount to shop at the different locations in San Antonio, or even to receive every now and then 40% discount."
bad,I hate this job I dread going to work every day I went through h***l to help this company open that was the worst job experience in my life I would not recommend this job to anybody
bad,"This is a horrible company to work for. They overwork their people and do not compensate them for the time they put in. Don't waste your time with this company you will severely regret the time spent. Ross is a cancerous environment and does not do anything to reward their hard working employees. Senior management is inconsistent and doesn't know how to keep aligned. They have anger issues and blow up at a moments notice; they do not know how to talk to people when they blow up, unless they have the each other as a security blanket. They like to play like they don't know what is going on when they know exactly what is going on and sweep things under the rug. They seem to understand where you are coming from but have no idea on how to run a store with day to day operations, recruiting, people and time management. Their lack of knowledge of people and Ross' operations are laughable. How can you grow with a company when Senior Leadership is constantly changing policies and procedures and chooses which ones to pursue and enforce. This company is a complete joke. Stay as far away as possible."
bad,Not a good place to work. It was stressful and you are expected to get way to much done in a short amount of time. The employers tend to be really gruff and uncaring. I would not reccomend
bad,"Too much work , if you play politics management your chances of getting promoted increases by 1000 . If you play politics you will survive. You have to have someone to help you get promoted. "
bad,"The store I trained at was amazing, team aspect followed company policies."
bad,"I understand that upper management controls most policies in a ""box"" store.   However, the store that I worked in had a lot more problems than just upper management wanting them to herd people through like cattle because they will only allow so many ""hours"" to be used.    I could write a book about the comical situations the store management has gotten themselves into, but I won't.  I'll just warn you; like I wish someone had warned me.   I feel as though their safety, cleanliness, and customer service will only attract the thieves that they are trying so hard to deter."
bad,The management was awful but what was worse were the customers! Absolutely rude and vile people! They ask for discounts on items that are meant to LOOk distressed! Get mad you don't have anything in the back or that you've never heard or know much of an off brand the company sporadically  if ever carries!
bad,The stocks for Ross are great to make money they also offer 401k after a while and they also give us every Sunday and Saturday off if there is anything left
bad,"Management is lazy. Everyday when working the staff is always have a short. . Management does not always provide the weeks following schedule on time. As a full time employee you are not allowed to work a full 40 hours per week, rather you are supposed to work  37.5 per week. The stockroom is always short staffed. I can't say this for all Ross Stores but Evergreen Park this is a problem and more. I would go further but I will keep it here."
bad,"I can not say enough about how bad the management was, they would gossip about other employees, take several smoke breaks on the clock, never around to help with large lines, going to other surrounding stores to shop on the clock, bad hours, no career advancement if you’re not willing to kiss a** and make friends with management,always training new people because people would quit monthly, and with barely being trained in the first place, overall if you want to be treated like trash this is the place for you!!!"
bad,"Very stressful environment. When you get picked on , it’s only you starting with managers. There’s no way to get through to them. If you upset them, they cut your hours without even letting you know.  Very long shifts without breaks. Specially if your in customer service or fitting room. During meetings they don’t let you know new rules until you break one. Your year raise will always be a few cents."
bad,"Ross is so cheap and will cheat you out of hours. The boss is rude and doesnt follow protocol, and he will try to pit the entire team against each other. You could do everything right and he will still belittle you and tell you it's wrong. On the other hand, other employees who dont do anything get all oc the praise. The pay isn't very good for the amount of stuff you put up with. Highly DO NOT recommend working here. If you like to see your family, love your job & want to keep your self esteem. Do not work here."
bad,"If you want drama and to be put down by management every day then this is the place for you!  In my role I was lied to constantly by my store manager and most of the management team! I loved the associates that I worked with but our store had a high turn over rate due to management and corporate didn't care or try to find out why. Corporate is just as bad, they provide ""tools"" for an open door policy but it always bites you in the butt and they do nothing about things reported."
bad,If you looking for part time or full time go elsewhere. This place is a joke management is poor and they expect you to dress like you make good money when they don't pay anything.
bad,The mangers are rude they never help they just stand around and talk about the customers and workers like they was still in high school it was horrible to work there
bad,it wasn't a good job it was to much drama hours was cut n taken from us  horrible working envirment worst job short breaks hours cut poor management I give it no stars
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance very hard work and no pay. "
bad,"I don't know how the other stores management is but I do know that the one in Hillside, IL is horrible. The manager we have now don't know how to do anything. She is the most racist person I've ever meant, she'll talk bad behind your back about you, other coworkers, and customers, and she doesn't know how to manage the store which is a simple store to do. Her scheduling is everywhere and she spends most of her time in the office then in the field. She have her minions to do her job for her and she have her favorite person. She don't care about your breaks and lunches. She just got the job from her best friend who is district manager for our store. Like I said before every store is different but I do know is the one in Hillside needs new management quick. I'm currently trying to transfer but apparently my store manager needs to talk to the other store because different district, she still haven't done it yet so I'm going to see if I can just transfer and quit this job or just start all over."
bad,"As a former Area Supervisor for store 1845, my GM was as bad as they come. Terrible communication and a lack of respect for anyone. Most importantly very unprofessional for someone in her position."
bad,Poor management. Disrespectful managers. They expect a lot from you but will never give you a raise or a praise for your job. It’s a very stressful work environment for SPS when they are supposed to keep a safe and secure environment but are hands off. I saw people who worked there for more than 15 years get fired for absolutely no valid reason. I witnessed employees being ridiculed by managers on the floor and janitors being yelled at by racist managers.
bad,"Lack of professional from the managers , they promote you but dont want to pay you, i was promoted to fron End Supervisor but since i was not full time i didnt get paid as a front End Supervisor, i was paid as a cashier!!!!!"
bad,"The hours were awful, the place was terrible, and the management was worse. Nothing worked well in terms of a leader for the back room. The employees were shady and so were the higher ups."
bad,Worst experience I have ever had in retail or customer service industry in over 30 years. This company is more like a cult than a retail experience. Look up the Stepford Wives
bad,Call outs are the worst because they expect you to stay and fill shifts. Hours are lonfg. Work load from others responsibilities become your responsibility. Not far at all.
bad,"I was employed at Ross Waikiki. As you may know, it can get a little crazy at Ross, especially the one in Waikiki. There was a lot of work to be done, but not enough people. The pay was horrible."
bad,"They get mad if you don't work fast enough, but you can't get your work done too fast otherwise they will send you home early and won't reschedule you to work your hours. They are more concerned with internal theft than they care about their employees. Unprofessional management and a complete waste of time and energy. The discount isn't even worth it. Minimum wage is NOT a living wage, especially when they continue to cut your hours. I will never work for Ross ever again."
bad,"Store was very disorganized. Poor management. My typical shift was the morning. The store was not as busy as it can get. The managers neglected to finish files and papers in needed in order to continue working because he ""forgot"". It was unprofessional."
bad,Depending on what you are looking for this job could be for you. As an adult with a life to live I would not go back. I didn't appreciate the way I was treated sometimes.
bad,Started working there during the holiday season. Horrible customers and very poor management even after previous ones were replaced. Employees are very needed but not respected enough.
bad,"It sucked really bad. The whole operation was very unorganized, and the managers did not care about anything in terms of the store but did care about penalizing the workers."
bad,I would ask to have specific days off and they would not approve of them. An when they finally did my hours would be cut. How was i supposed to pay for bills on that income.
bad,in my opinion theirs so many things that need to be changes over their at ross we have some good staff but the management team is horrible and they need to pay more.
bad,"The customers were awful , the staff was all gossip, and the job was a never ending crisis.  There is not much backup when stuck with an angry customer and often the employees had terrible customer service skill."
bad,"I remember I was excited to take this job right when I got out of high school. $9 an hour seemed great to me. I first started out in the stock room, which was not too bad, it did get pretty hot at times and figuring out what went in the bins and where to take them was pretty simple. Eventually I got moved to the fitting room, which was absolutely terrible. So many people come up to you at once and some people were great and fantastic and treated me with respect. Others, however, seemed to lack common decency.  I would explain they could only take a certain amount of items back into the fitting room and they did not listen one bit, and then get mad at me when I told them that they could not. I liked all of my coworkers and even a few of the managers. The other managers however seemed like they were God's great gift to this Earth. I mean I get that it is a job and they are high up but, there is no need to take a job so seriously they did. They acted like we were protecting government secrets. I did not enjoy working here one bit."
bad,"If you can avoid shopping here then you need to avoid working there as well. Don't get me wrong for a part-time job it may be tolerable, but I've noticed that they put a lot of these stores in areas of the city where there are mostly low income families, which means DRAMA"
bad,I had this job temporarily while in nursing school. I made only minimum wage while working at this company. I recommend this to a young person living with their parents with no responsibilities.
bad,"This job was so bad. Since the day I started working here I did not get a single day of training. I was asked to work a 8 hour shift on the day or orientation where I was told that I would not have to work that day. I was put to work without any training. I ran the cash register without knowing how to properly work it. And I was falsely accused of theft without the “evidence” that they claimed to have. They said they had footage of me “stealing”, but when asked to show me the “evidence” they refused and fired me with the false accusation of theft. I would never steal or give away free products to people especially those that I don’t even know!"
bad,When i was working there we were overworked for little pay i did like 3-4 jobs every 6-8 hours shifts it wasn't for me. I was also given very little opportunity to move up in the company there was only 5 full time sales associate workers no room for more unless someone quit.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here. The management team sucks. They have poor communication skills. The worst job I ever worked for. I will never work their again.
bad,"The problem with the store, at least the one I worked, did not have a very good management system, they lie a lot, if you were not apart of the 'click"", you are not going to be working there very long. Most of the managers and area supervisors lack people skills and good customers service. Ross really need to pay more attention to the management team. They will soon learn why people constantly walk off the job or don't stay very long. Managers have been known to talk about employees to other employees. There is no practice of confidentiality"
bad,"No matter where you go they will like you but its not cute the way your treated its a retail job. . "
bad,"If you ever wondered what a sweat shop in a 3rd world county would be like, take a job at ROSS! (Poor pay, overtime part of the month forced to use vacation the end of the month)"
bad,"Always short on workers, stressful, manager was rude: made workers cry. Doesn't hire if someone has kids. There was a lot of upkeep and the store was always a mess"
bad,"No compliments on how well you do your job ever . Constant criticizing  Manager not friendly Manager very unprofessional No thorough training They just throw you to the wolves. "
bad,"They work you full time hours without the benefits. I worked there for two years, trained people with no experience only for them to recover positions."
bad,"I check people in and out of fitting room. Some customers are pleasant, some are very rude. Several people every day try to steal garments thru the fitting room. A lot of homeless and druggies will get in your face. It's rather frightening at times."
bad,"The Store was very dirty, location was a major factor in the amount of theft and loss."
bad,"The company is sabotaging itself, and cannot be rescued in the long-term due to bad micromanagement.  Second, if the head is bad the whole body will be sick.  The store manager is completely dishonest and weak, and gossips about the employees throughout the district so that even the trucking company employees had heard much of this gossip and were sharing it with each store on the route.  This led to the loss of many good staff because of poor leadership as well as employing two or three key people who are allowed to manipulate the staff and sabotage any team building.  It is a disorganized mess, and is a district-wide problem."
bad,Ross is not for everybody but if you like retail and you really enjoy clothes and nice affordable clothes Ross would be great for you but Ross is the greatest place
bad,Relaxed workplace. Great starting out job/part time job. No long working hours. No room for advancement. Short shifts. Typical Day at work was helping customers. Customers easy to help.
bad,The worst job I've ever had. Never had good hours. Manager was very racist an rude.  Never gave us a full lunch break or any breaks.  I will never work at ross again.
bad,"Started as a seasonal part time stock room associate then was asked to stay after the holidays. At first I was getting at least 3 to 4 days a week and only getting called in maybe once every other week. Then I only started getting scheduled only once or twice every 2 weeks. There were several weeks when I wasn’t even scheduled! I had to find a 2nd job just so I could have hours. Then when I would work and they would ask me to stay late, I would tell them I couldn’t because of my other job and they would get annoyed with me,or they get mad because I didn’t answer when they’d call me to come in because I was at my other job and couldn’t answer the phone. It was the final straw when I hadn’t been scheduled  for 3 weeks in a row and I get a voicemail from the stockroom manager asking why I hadn’t been around? Well how about because I’m never scheduled! And then she had the nerve to say that if she hadn’t heard back from me that they would have to fire me for job abandonment! At that point I was so beyond done with them that I didn’t even care to argue with her about it. They are always understaffed and will continue to be that way if they keep scheduling the way they do. You fix that and maybe they’ll be able to keep employees"
bad,"Hated it"
bad,"My daughter was trying to get a Job At Ross she put in an application it was lost, then she talked to the hiring manager and was told to call back numerous times, the staff is rude on the phone managers loose paper work. Daughter was told to resubmit her app again she did and once again managers could not find it. She called again to ask and was told she needed to resubmit."
bad,There is so much work to be done and not enough staff to do it. The store in Alameda is always a mess!! Time limits that were set were not realistic..
bad,Ross is a place to work to get through school. the pay is not good but and it will take a lot  of your energy. It is ok for part time employment.  The management seemed extremely stressed and had a lot of demand on them for little pay.
bad,"Cut throat no regard for human values,there is no respect or values managers cut throat and are two face,a place full of adulteryand gossip,not a good place to work if you have moral values people are like snakes bitting and talking about each other,its modern day slavery wages are very low"
bad,"New supervisors are created every day! This leads to the newly created supervisor picking friends with the staff and over working those who are out of favor. Constantly changing of hours and shifts. They will change your schedule over night and you will not be notified. When you arrive at your previously scheduled hours, they tell you to go home, despite showing up for your scheduled hours. On several different occasions employees quit only to be hired again the next day, due to the constantly revolving door. Management seems to exist in a bubble and simply ignores the poor retention."
bad,The management is very narrow minded. The policies are not considerate of employee volume needed to fulfill the need of service or time management. The goals of the stock team are not realistic with the amount of employees allowed to work.
bad,"SM is the only salaried individual in the building, unless you're in a high volume store"
bad,"This place is dirty and the pay is ridiculous. Wouldn't waste your time with this application. Definitely look else where. Inconsistent hours, cut hours if they need to."
bad,It was hard for me to manage school time at that time. It's a great company for those who willing tworking part time job and go school in the evenings
bad,Company is difficult management is horrible and the store itself is awful.  Needs work need proper group skills and training skills for everyone in the company
bad,"My orientation was a horrific mess where I waited for an hour after informing store personnel of my presence - I was ignored for an hour on the first day. Later, the store manager (who I had no idea who she was) yelled at me for being patient with their unorganized personnel. From the get-go I was treated with disrespect and yelled at at every turn for being new. I called about 10 times to learn about my schedule after my horrific uninformative orientation. I was called back finally and told to go in two hours later, that same day! I was excited to finally go in to work after two months from the application date and about two weeks from the interview and job offer date so I was eager to go in even on such short notice. My first day was a complete disaster, and served to highlight the massive inorganization that plagues the management at ROSS. I was belittled and made to feel worthless on my very first day. No one knew I was new which serves to show how uninformed the whole management was. The break room was a pig sty. The supervisors were horrible and condescending. I was unaware what ""working till closing"" meant and so I assumed that meant until 11pm when the store closed, and so when my break was scheduled for 11pm I questioned the supervisor and let him know that since I was not informed of staying until 12 am and later that I could not because I had a family emergency that night. I was met with the most condescending and rude supervisor who yelled at me and told me to finish my duties. THIS WAS ONLY MY FIRST DAY. I hate Ross and everything about working here. 0 out of 5"
bad,this place is not very good to there employees. overall its nice for shopping not for working. you never get breaks on item. they over load you with so much work.
bad,I have learned that the management at any Ross is under-qualified. Employees are found working harder for small amount of pay for low quality environments.
bad,I enjoy working with my co workers. They are friendly and helpful. I enjoy doing markdowns and helping customers find what they are looking for. I don’t like the hours of work they give me. They would cut my hours from 20 hours a week to only 8 hours a week.  They would hire a lot of employees and let them work only a few days or less. Then they would quit because of this.
bad,You have to end a transaction as soon as possible and even going as fast as I could they would write me up on my receipts. Also they would always give me the messiest section and not help at all and the next day give another person the same section and help them.
bad,human resource and the background checks are mentally ill and have no clue as to what they are doing  i worked for ross for almost 2 yrs and had to move then re applied and they couldn't verify my employment lol what a joke cost me my job
bad,worst company ever the management sucks they have nasty attitudes they show favoritism
bad,the management was so messy and batty. One minute they can be laughing and cutting up with you and the next talking about that same person behind there back.
bad,"I thought Walmart was bad, Ross takes the cake. They claim to be proactive with their employees but it's not true in the store where I was. They expect way too much out of the night staff that they hire as the team is small, there's only 1 manager on staff for maybe 15 employees after 5 PM. They pay minimum and expect you to wear the hats of 5 different departments. Not worth the time as there really is no advancement beyond floor manager; I noticed the people who work here long term have to rely on social assistance so clearly no raises or not enough to get by."
bad,"Low Pay"
bad,There was too much drama it was not professional work environment at all. The main manager was a guy and he was a very rude man towards woman. Every one was out for themselves
bad,area supervisors were VERY unprofessional and rude. store manager didn’t know how to handle situations. shows major favoritism and only gave certain workers hours
bad,I dont enjoy the job they give less hours and I didnt really learning anything and the management there is alright but the hardest part of the job is getting things done when the managers want you too but they add more things on your list
bad,"The work days are not good because the store manager does not know how to schedule the workers.  The culture of the store has change since the new store manager started working there, it's horrible and the employees are effected by the lack of structure he has in running the day to day assignments"
bad,"Ross Dress for Less is a fast paced environment. They expect you to do a lot for little pay."
bad,This was a typical retail store with varying days and hours and staff that could care less about the appearance of the store or the treatment of the customers.
bad,The hours ae poor be glad if you get one day out of a week and the store management takes people off the work schedule daily. The team members are rude and the store isn't always nice and clean the store manager  is very rude and unprofessional
bad,I  wasn't particularly fond of working there.  The management was inconsistent and I was passed over for a potential promotion because I wasn't scheduled on the day an area supervisor was on site.
bad,My direct supervisor had been reported for stealing so many times without repercussion that it became a known and accepted fact that product would be missing instead of an addressed issue.
bad,As an overnight stocker the manager would change your schedule without your knowledge forcing you to become a no call no show..  the schedule was very inconsistent and the managers did not respect us.
bad,They don’t teach you how to work and people are very negative to work with. They are disorganized when you ask for hour and forget to put your sick pay
bad,"Basically the only thing great about this life (""life"" in this context is synonym to ""job"") were the coworkers and customers. Management (from the general manager and up) was a nightmare of falsifying company reports such as the freight truck numbers to maintain store profit, to intentionally inputting 1 hour and also 30 minute lunches into PeopleSoft that employees did not take, to not following the current company pay rate of $11 and instead telling the employees that it only applies to new full-time hires, to discounting items that were not damaged and then buying said items at break. If I could go back, I would have never accepted the position."
bad,A good job for kids out of highschool waiting for school (college) classes to start. For the little they pay they over work you like a slave. So happy I moved out of Florida the pay sucks!
bad,"I didn't enjoy working here either not only were the customers hard to deal with, there were also certain managers that made the job harder as well. We would have to stay in the store till almost three in the morning having to clean up the sore because of how under staffed we were."
bad,there is so many different items at the store that sometimes it's hard at the end of the day to be able to clean up the store/ other than it's just helping the guests with their purchases
bad,"This job maybe ideal for high school students or recent high school graduates, but definitely not sufficient for the working adults with a family. This company does not value their employees and management is terrible. Worked for the company for 9 years and my ending pay was $9.89. I would never return to this company."
bad,There is a 30-day performance review once you start. Onboarding and training lack for a new hire. There is a ROSS culture and manage really needs to learn to listen to their employees. Favoritism does happen in some depart. There is a high turn over.
bad,"I did not enjoy working here. No one was  team player as you would expect them to be; especially because it is retail. I did not like their customer service policy because I believe that we should be able to help customers out instead of just letting them fend for themselves. They also timed us on our register skills and would post them making it competitive for people. I think it is dumb to time us on register, when our top priority should be to service our customers and make sure they enjoyed their time in our store....at least that's how it was when I worked for DEB shops before they closed down."
bad,"Ross was always very busy but kept you always doing something. there was never nay down time and toy always had something to do. It was fun at times but stressful at others, Over all it was an okay place to work"
bad,"This job had set hours because we would unload the truck everynight. We could not be late because the store would lock up for the night and it made it very difficult to get in if you were not on time. Also, the truck arrived by a certain time and the store opened by a certain time so we had to be done and have everything away by the time the doors opened in the morning. The hours to work this shift were not flexible and neither was the pay. Most people who worked this job/ shift hated it and there was drama with the manager. (However, I believe he is no longer with the company) This job was not enjoyable and the tasks expected of us was a bit much, no one ever reached the goals."
bad,My first time as a Retail Associate member. Terrible place to work. Little to no training and your expected to know everything already. You were thrown to positions you didn't apply for. We we're robbed the first night I was placed on security and later found out if I did anything to stop them I would have been let go which I had no intention of doing because I wasn't going to put my life at risk for this job. Every shift has a different manager. 2 were okay and the other 2 your just wondering how they got the position because they look down on you and order you around like slaves. Not to mention during closing time after the doors were locked and gated some walkby people refused to realize that we are closed and bang on the doors because they see us inside cleaning up. They bang until we literally came out and set the alarm and everything. The worst experience for me ever. This will be the first and last time for me as a retail associate
bad,"The pay is really bad, store is always a mess, management is horrible no matter what store you go to. The hours are also really bad. But hey, what can you expect from working retail."
bad,You will like your coworkers . Since I’ve been at Ross for the past five years I’ve met really good people and really awesome people who am I still talk to .most of them wereCollege students as well as I was different majors different backgrounds we all wore the blue shirt and we got along
bad,"honestly this had to be the worst job i have ever had. i left on good terms with everyone, but this was the most unorganized place ever. they never went by your availability, if you work stock they never let you know when the truck was canceled so you would just be sitting up there from 4 in the morning and the at 7am they would tell you there was no truck. And they give you a raise just to give you one day a week."
bad,"your expected to know what do do as soon as you arrive,"
bad,Poor management. Will not work with schedule. I am currently working 4 hours every Saturday and they still manage to send me home early every week. Managers will see you are struggling and will not help.
bad,"notmuch to say about this company they don't care about their employees. there is not much room for advancement, management is very poor. would not recommend"
bad,"This is a company that throws you in , like sink or swim mentality. You are responsible for running the whole store, front to back while earning the same as a sales floor associate with no responsibilities.Time spent with family is  not allowed as they  frequently deny time off request. Example A, I  have two children graduating in May24th and one May 25th in two different states. They cancelled my vacation that was approved Two moths ahead of time. So needless to say my family comes before this job."
bad,For the month and an a half I worked there they did not have the money to pay me so i either got called out of my shift or they sent me home early. I did not enjoy working there
bad,Most days I had fitting room duty because no one else liked it. Even on days I was supposed to be on the register they still gave me fitting room duty. Which was stressful and overwhelming because I hardly received breaks and had to clean the restrooms as well which was not what I signed up for at all!
bad,"They don’t explain well for training, they don’t give enough hours not a fun plce to work. they expect you to learn everything fast, They are not professional when you give your two week notice. They don’t listen one of the manger sucks"
bad,"I gave two weeks notice. After I requested back vacation pay, they sent me a bill for vacation buys. Unbelievable. No wonder 3 managers quit. Bad business!"
bad,"The absolute worst company possible to work for, regardless of age, race, or physical ability. The paycheck isn't near worth it. I wasted too much of life working here and I didn't even make it 24 months. Just go apply to a TJX company and save yourself the headache. Don't believe me? Look at any employee on a Tuesday Club Tuesday."
bad,Management was terrible. Store was always a mess in mornings. Hardest part of the job was keeping store picked up neat and tidy. Learned how to stock shelves.
bad,"I worked there for 3 years and I never got a raise, never got hours. Many weeks I would only work 4 hours a week and i had completely open availability."
bad,In the truest sense of the word. Coworkers would share memos to staff written in poor English and containing grammatical errors. Arbitrary managers and high turnover. Within 1 year we had 3 different managers
bad,typical day at work included training and lookout for activity.what I learned was greta customer service.managment was ok. workplace culture could be better.
bad,"It does not make sense that if you have a reliable and hard working employee that is willing to work extra hours to help fill in when you have ""call outs"" or ""no shows"", the employee can not be called in if it means they will go over 25 hours per week.  Yet the store as a whole suffers from it.  Employees who have just started make more than those who have been there longer, plus they get more hours.  I am not sure if these issues are just at the store I was at or at any Ross.  Either way, these issues need to be addressed. Not too mention, the safety of both the customers and employees are not top priority."
bad,It sucks. The pay is ridiculous. The hours are low. Associates aren't that helpful nor is the manager. The job is not worth it. And neither is the hours or pay.
bad,"Ross was a lot of work for little too no hours. your title is ""sales associate"" so you do every position. they are on a strict budget so you get maybe 15 hours or less a week."
bad,i would never recommend this job for the life of me or at least this location. they are thieves and not professional at all. do not work for them they will take advantage of you
bad,"high school environment, poor management, poor pay wouldnt recommend working here if this was the last jjob on earth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"In the time I worked at Ross, the store i worked for had changed managers 3 times. They have so many issues when it comes to treating their employees right. The max amount of hours I was ever able to get was about 25 in one week. That was only during the holidays. Any other time of the year, expect no more than 15. My pay started at $7.50 an hour at the end of 2013. When I was given an evaluation I excelled in all categories giving me a grade of about a 90. My actual raise ended up being $0.18, bringing my pay to $7.68. When I asked management if I did something wrong. I was told that the highest raise is only $0.20. As if that wasn't insulting enough, later that year, new hires were brought on making $8.50. In the meantime I was still making $7.68. I brought this up to management, which when they proceeded to take their time. I decided I needed to look for employment elsewhere."
bad,"When I started, they were doing 8 1/2 hour shifts, with a 30 min break. Then they switched to a 4 1/2 hour shift with a 10 min break, thereby making it extremely difficult to go get another job."
bad,Management were liars and didn't do their jobs. People stole all the time and didn't get reprimanded. But if you're sick you get fired. After calling and having doctor's notes for everything.
bad,the play was so low i couldnt pay my bills so i didnt like it at all so i had to find another job just to get by all the low pay i was getting from the job
bad,"I was hired fulltime, put the Kihei store together."
bad,"Worst manager you can find, super inappropriate gestures, conversations to female associates. Terrible manager overall. Didn’t even train me once, had to learn from other SPS and retail associates"
bad,"Poor pay"
bad,Very clique like and fellow staff were unfriendly to friends of people they didn't like. Felt like I was back in high school and it wasn't what I expected from people 2x my age.
bad,The store was not ran very well the managers were not team players and very disrespectful. The store theft was unbelievable and there was not advancement.
bad,"Ross stores does not value the worth of their employees. They are unfair and give hours accordingly to their needs. I love the environment, but there is no structure. There are way too many inconsistencies. They should be more open to suggestions."
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. No job advancements, started at 7.25 an hour and in the almost two years I worked there only got a raise to 7.64 an hour. Went to Nordstom right after and started at 10.50. Huge difference."
bad,I have no review. This was a terrible experience for me. I got very few hours. I didn't get paid enough to cover my rent and subsequently lost my apartment.
bad,"Not well organized, causing everyone to be stressed.  Breaks and lunches were out of order and took several hours to get. Always short staffed, causing the employee to be in charge of too many things.  Made me learn how to take on several things at once and be fast paced."
bad,"I Just wasn't happy there, I wanted benefits and they didn't provide that. If you want a part time job just to have something to do, this job for you."
bad,"I applied for area supervisor they brought me in for a interview, hired me only to fine out it was for cash office. I was told 32 to 35 hours a week only to be lied to and only work 12-15 hours a week and drive 40 mins one way. I asked for more hours but couldn't get them at the time. but they hired like 4 more people after me. Financially not worth my time."
bad,"I do not have much to say, overall I loved the job at first. But with poor management and inconsistency in management it became very stressful. Long work hours and not much support"
bad,"The store manager is not reliable. I do not like working there at all. The store is always a mess, the processes are not followed. The other Area Supervisors are not on process either."
bad,"I worked overnight shift and it was horrible. Management are women who act  like middle school girls. they will favor and befriend the more attractive looking employees, give them a pass on attendance,let them show up late, and gossip with them till the early morning  and give them a chance to advance.If you are not attractive to these women you are just out of luck. Warnings and write ups coming your way."
bad,"working at ross stores is like working in a sweat shop. They dont treat their employees well. All they care about is the numbers. Every ross that I have walked into, the employees are miserable."
bad,"They work you without decent pay and main focus is to keep union out.  Outdated resources for doing your job and little to no training.  At the time, management did not know the jobs so they could not instruct, only criticize."
bad,"I started off as a cashier/sales associate, by the time i had left this job i was working in the stockroom, which i loved. however management was rude and always unkind to their associates."
bad,"Unfair unethical place to work, needs major changes in Management does not follow laws regarding breaks and etc., needs undercover management to go into stores and see operations"
bad,Very bad paid. Very few people to work with. they expect to much from just 2 or 3 sales associates  for really big locations. Dress code is terrible and unprofessional.
bad,I had intended on being very relaxed and it was so rushed for all the employees to the point people were forgetting their items at the register. Customers are accused stealing when it's really the staff and I had a manager try to ring up items on my first week under my name and then they would make you at fault of a low Cpr
bad,Promotions aren't based off of merit. Stressful place to work. Management uses schedule as a weapon. Managers are rude and uncaring to associates. I would suggest working anywhere else.
bad,"I have worked here for over a year the manager constantly talks bad about associates and doesn’t give the required breaks, promised raises don’t always go through and constant over working the workers."
bad,"Its a easy work, great co workers, like to be in the stock, but the managers don't have management skills, they talk in a rude way to the employees, you can not call out if you are sick or have a family emergency because the managers will take days or hours of you schedule they only give you one or two days a weeks. Very bad attitude from the managers."
bad,Management is horrible. Lack of structure. No job advancement opportunities. Store is very unorganized. Hours switch every few month which messes with your work/personal life.
bad,"that job is not one to stay in, if ur working and going to school its fine but expect low hours. the advancements in training are terrible due the lack there of,"
bad,"unfortunately, it was a very bad work environment. they didn't give enough hours sometimes i worked only 4 hours a week. and the management was so bad."
bad,The management was terrible and consistently rude to their employees. Constant issues with management and workers. Overall that particular store was terrible to work for.
bad,"Ross is the most unprofessional company I have worked for in years. They want to pay everybody the same whether you only do one thing or all of them. Assistant managers make less than $11 an hour and store managers make profit but work less than 40 hours a week. It is absolutely absurd. They let management discriminate and choose favorites on who they will allow to pull no call no shows, etc. Stay far away from this company. The only thing that could be seen as a benefit is the small discount you get for working there."
bad,Management had no work ethic at all. Discrimination was another perk. If you had an accent you couldn't ask for a leading position. Worst experience!.
bad,I had to work as fast as possible on every task they gave me and they expected me to do ten jobs in four hours and they never gave me more than 12 hours per week.
bad,Too many things they want you to do at once the management sucks . store management barely ever there all she does is talk on the phone and walk around.
bad,"Very poor training. Very poor management skills. I learned a lot, but it was never good enough. No recognition was ever served. The least enjoyable part was my store manager. She and I did not get along. Hardest part of the job was satisfying her."
bad,They want you to fast and hard for what they pay you it not faver the manager push you to go over your limits for they got get blue ship and they talk you bad
bad,"What this company advertise, is false. Corporate will expect  8 hour  work in four hours.  The managers sit around and don't help out. They have horrible attitudes."
bad,"My manager was always lost during time when we needed her, she will never post our breaks on time. Store was always dirty and would have to re clean while she was off somewhere else. Never distribute hours fairly to all employees. Ignored when we asked for help."
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful at times. You have to deal with all kinds of customer everyday and its not really enjoyable at all. You're just always have to put on a no stress kind of face on in front of the customers and try to help them the best possible way you can and at the end of the day, you're always happy to get back home to your family."
bad,"You are nothing more than a number and can be replaced by the next number in line. Not only not fun, too demanding for the pay scale. The managers only care if you make the quota and nothing else matters."
bad,"After working there for two years, I was Bullied and Harassed in front of Customers. My work was never valued. I never felt part of the Company. Sad To say."
bad,"Worse company to work for. Not enough hours, poor management and some of the staff. This job is for high school students. Salary is bare minimum. Not a good workplace"
bad,"This is definitely a job for high school ,maybe college kids or a second job but to have this as a main source of income it is absolutely not worth it."
bad,"There is not one single thing worthy of note about this company. It is definitely a dead end, minimum wage job. 3 or 4 times a year there will be a sharp discount for associates but honestly not worth it."
bad,"This place was horrible, management sucks. You cant promote, they have way too many employees for anyone who get full 8 hour shifts and because of this there is always callouts that cannot be replaced on time."
bad,"Terrible place with terrible management, a day at work starts around 4:40 in the morning. the only good thing about it is that you were off on weekends and if you worked graveyard shift you went home right when the store opened."
bad,"This place was awful. The management is a joke. They treat you poorly and are very rude. Every morning I would absolutely dread going into work. They didnt care about your personal life, they didnt care about you. They work you like a dog and treat you like garbage. Never again will I EVER work there."
bad,"The management where I worked was more concerned with their time off and giving themselves great hours than their workers. I was, without notice, swapped from a closing shift to an opening shift with no training except for the day of. As much as I loved shopping there, working there was the worst."
bad,Reminds me of high school.Too much gossiping even from managers. The store stays open way too late should close by 9:30. Internal is definitely a problem.
bad,"Poor management, low pay rate, not a place for a job advancement, not organized work team, poor employee culture, unfair job rules and unprofessional store manager"
bad,"Very poor Management, Constantly changing positions, short/meal breaks untimely, Constant pressure with tremendous lines of customers, lack of assistance and got sick several times due to uncleanliness . Working there is depressing."
bad,"Management is very poor in this workplace , the store manger goes and tells everyone , everybodies business. She doesn't keep anything confidential like one should."
bad,Too stressful. They expect you to run around without catching your like you are some kind of robot who never needs a break. They scream at you when you try to do the right thing and make you look stupid. Terrible place to work at.
bad,overworked and underpaid. management was a revolving door. was in one of the more busy stores in the city and was sorely underpaid. no advancement opportunities.
bad,My hours were constantly being cut and my pay wasn't consistent.The management gave more hours to certain employees and very few amount of hours to others like myself. I wouldnt recommend working here.
bad,The managers I worked with were difficult and petty. They would withhold hours from employees what weren't part of the favorite circle. They went of their way to make your shift as miserable as possible.
bad,This job is very cut-throat with associates conspiring against other workers for their own advancement. When I first started working there I was drilled in my head of team work. But no one did the team work.
bad,Great place to shop... Wish my experience was different but everybody has a different outlook to being employed here. maybe things could've been better at a different location Who knows!
bad,"Will never recommend anyone to work for this company. I work there for a year and took maybe 5 lunch breaks, never enough staff, management is very rude, unpaid time off, benefits suck its covered nothing really. Staying late just to clean, 4am cleaning shoes and clothes it brutal especially when your manager hires their friends that don't want to work"
bad,The DM AND SM only look out for them selfs and never help or Concern themselves with sales associates or area managers. And don’t protect you from rude or horrible customers
bad,"Dont even bother applying for a job at ross, half the time its slow so your bored out of your mind, secondly they always have one person on register, one person in fitting room and one person on the sales floor so that means you won't get alot of hours. Working at ross was a huge waste of time."
bad,a typical day isn't too bad. it is mostly cashier and walking around the store and cleaning up the work area that you are in charge of on that day and time.
bad,Worst employment experience i have ever had. Discriminatory. Lack of ethic. Conflicts of interest. Management changes your reschedule without informing you intentionally to have a reason to fire you.
bad,"Low Wages, Horrible District Manager, Nothing is ever good enough. They take long time to hire ASM, SM jobs to save payroll then except you to clean up the mess."
bad,this job required me to unload 500 pieces of clothes and hang them on a hanger all in 30 minutes they were to unrealistic about that 30 minutes it could be done in a hour selflessly
bad,"Typical day at work was cashier, cleaning, setting displays. What I learned, nothing. Management was poor. There was nothing enjoyable about this job it was not the job as much as management created a unhappy, stressful environment. In return, they have a high turn over of employees."
bad,"The loss prevention job is the worst,  you stand your whole shift,  they are short staffed and the store looks like a flea market.  The store manger is in way over her head, the stock roomis full while the stock room is packed. They promise 20-25 hours, yet give you 35 plus"
bad,"I have worked for Ross for 4 years. Management is poor. Customers are awful. If you’re part-time, you get no hours. If you’re full-time,  they make you do Manager jobs with no pay raise. They do no care about their workers, nor their customers. We are always understaffed and expected to get everything done."
bad,"No advancement, Poor Management on all levels. Freight flow was poorly executed. No overtime was allowed and no one was allowed over 20 hours per week to prevent from pay for benefits."
bad,"Working at Ross did not only waste my time but also lowered my self esteem! The Manager was more of a child than anything! Constant rumor starting, people talking behind your back , it was high school all over again! Not only did they talk bad about the employees but the customers as well! Very unprofessional!"
bad,stressful over worked understaffed. horrible management. the only thing enjoyable was the 20 percent discount that would increase to 40 every so often. I learned nothing
bad,"Rude and overworked. The management was unprofessional. They would change your schedule without notification. Then, they would cut your hours without even letting you know."
bad,in the little time I worked there I had 3 different managers so you can guess how it is to work there rules changed faster than they could incorporate them
bad,horrible company and management. inexperienced management. very conservative mindset. no work life balance. backstabbing culture. racesim is to its extreme and high performing jerks rule . hr is management puppet.
bad,The work environment at the Ross Distribution center was very fast pace and was unorganized with there employees. And the safety of others was not taken into consideration.
bad,"first day on the job, received little to no training, immediately got thrown onto a register with no one to turn to for help, register was also broken"
bad,Poor management at the Ross Store in Towson Maryland. Managers are big headed over their position. They write up employees for speaking their mind and giving their opinions when asked. The people that should be written up aren't. Rude managers to employees and customers. Numerous complaints about this one manager about her loudness and rude interaction with customers and nothing has been done about it. People are getting promoted based on their friendship with store manager. So many wrong doings at this store. It should be investigated.
bad,the company lacks of career growth . Management is not understanding. Director is rude and undermining. not a good company to work for. there is no loyalty.
bad,Bad company to work for. Not honest about anything. Store manager was very dishonest. Receiving supervisor was always late. We were timed like if we are robots. They were not every helpful to new employees. Horrible company to work for.
bad,They are not fair. Managers bring their private life into Ross work and take it out on the  associates. Barely get any others. They literally rushes you off your 15 minuet breaks.
bad,"I got hired for a new store opening, the supervisors and mangers were horrible, they expect so much of you, yet dont give the proper training and have the nerve to get annoyed when you ask for help, you are timed on everything and they will 'write you up' if you don't do everything in a timely manner, pay was horrible and so were the hours"
bad,"I enjoyed working at Ross but... Theft was a major issue. I didn't feel safe.Constantly hireing new management.never got full time hours only part time. Only during holiday seasons full time hours were available. I wanted to work in stock room but was never properly trained on how to tag merchandise such as shoes, pocket books ect. Clothing was pretty easy. Breaks were never on time because management was always on the register.alarms constantly goin off from theft but management never did anything about it."
bad,"Ross was a nice job. I miss it and if I had the chance to go back I would but not as long as the big manager is there. I stocked clothing, stocked, cleaned"
bad,"Employees treated poorly."
bad,The amount of work and stress the company and managers place on you is not equivalent to the compensation that is awarded to the employee. The are not a good company to work for .
bad,"People there acted like just because they work there that they run the place, they acted like if they never had a first day there.i wouldn't recommend this company to anyone"
bad,I did not enjoy working at ross. the work environment was very unprofessional. The co workers were very loud and used expletives all the time. The manager was helpful
bad,"Management wasn't great they treat you like your beneath them"
bad,This was a job with set hours and supervisors will call last minute to fill in a shift. Poor management and there is no room for advancement. Did not really receive any training aside from store protocols.
bad,We were discourage from taking meals when policy dictated we take them.  The ran us ragged and closed later than normal for retail.  Management just wanted us to go faster and none of them were on the same page.
bad,Management belittles associates. Management talks poorly about other management to associates. Management hides in office on cell phones. Manager schedules other supervisors nights and weekends so it's unfair scheduling.
bad,Don't work there unless your ready to give your time away for nothing and be treated less then a doormat unreliable management and if your not in the gossip youll be the gossip
bad,"I did not like working at ross. They would make me stay longer and write me up for doing so. They would also schedule me days I was not able to work and give me no call no shows when I didn't come in, even if my shift was covered."
bad,"when i first started working here it was a great to work in... "
bad,"It was horribly managed, never had enough people working. I didn't like the way the people treat the employees. They barely give you hours, or put you to work on days they KNOW you cannot."
bad,"You dont get paid for all the hardwork you do, I use to go home with back problems every day, I would not recommend working here to anyone and if you do either be a manager or work for only a few months, not worth all the stress."
bad,I had given Ross dress for less two... TWO YEARS of my life and only to receive a 40 cent increase. I could not imagine why the lovely ladies I worked with stayed for as long as they did. Know your worth people.
bad,This store was so unsanitary. The managers at the time were ruthless and were two faced. Worst work place... ever. Little to no training. I didn't really know anyone's name either.
bad,"Limitations when it came to innovation,  being able to dive change within the established process – NO outside the BOX , the one thing you can really focus on was people development to drive change and increase  adversity was consistent from staffing, and started by establishing expectations, staff training ,  enforcing the"
bad,Stressful and fast pased work environment.There was never enough cashier's on shift per customer's making the lines always long. We always had to stay 2-3 hour's after store closing to clean the store up because it was in such disarray.
bad,I tried to make a career out of ross but the politics and horrible management proved to be to much. When I complained about promotion opportunities I was thrown to the wolves with no proper feedback or training.
bad,This job just plain out sucks. Management won't give you the coverage you need to run the store correctly and complain when things aren't being done. Absolutely theeee worst company I've ever worked for.
bad,the supervisors loved to talk bad about their employees play favorites and i personally felt uncomfortable but i loved working with customers not much training time and one of the supervisors wasn't professional at all and she was rude all the time
bad,No employee there cares about their job. New management would not help when the store was crowded. The stock leader was a joke. No promotions or raises given.
bad,"During the work day you were not able to depend on managers giving you money when your drawer was low. They were not organized, someone was always late to their shift causing you to have to stay over, no matter what you had to do after you were supposed to get off."
bad,"Don't work here, they treat u like like nothing, Bad communication. No management, don't get paid enough for what they ask of u. VERY DIRTY. If u call out 1 time they act like ur asking for a year off from work"
bad,it was cashiering and it was not always easy with the people you worked with trying to cover everyone management was very rough to work with just it was not what I really wanted to do
bad,Being a Cashier gave me valuable learning experiences but working with people who didn't care about their job really bothered me. In the end I decided it wasn't the place for me to be.
bad,"This was the most unprofessional and rude jobs I have ever had. The store manager played favorites, her assistant store manager harassed and bullied employees that did not brown nose her. Worst job ever. Slave labor and they rarely give full-time even when they promise it. You work extra hard just to be treated poorly."
bad,"management wasnt there misssing in action, many questions unasnwered, work load was hard due to management missing and work load was always in high demand"
bad,big political game stay away upper management are a bunch of uneducated idiots. all they care about is themselves and their bonus. Do yourself a favor and stay away
bad,typical day at work was stressful sometimes we wouldn't know what to do because the manager wouldn't show up. Really bad management manager wouldn't show up for 3+ months to work. Hardest part of the job was to stay calm and just do as much as you could . I dont really have anything enjoyable about that job
bad,I worked for Ross in South Dakota and I loved it but then got transferred to a store in Denver... the minute I got here people were nothing but rude  and management was telling other associates my wage treating me like dirt...
bad,"I gave them 7 years of my life.I volunteered for holidays worked late, changed my schedule when needed for business needs and in the end I got treated horribly.Corporate visits to the store I transferred to for the last 5 months were brutal.They would always make sure to comment on practices, make suggestions and then next visit they would ask why we would do such a thing. You asked us to that's why. I have never felt so beaten down, abused and unappreciated in all of my years of work.It wasn't just me that felt this way the whole management team felt the same way.I went from work being my getaway from home to dreading getting up in the morning. Corporate needs to realize the little people are the ones who keep their stores going."
bad,"management is horrible, i did not get trained properly"
bad,I didn't like it. Wasn't treated fairly. Too many people from other departments came to ours when we didn't have much work ourselves. It pretty much sucked to me.
bad,"Worked two years never missed a day, but was rewarded by being terminated for trying to protect employees in a drug, gang infested store!!! Management had me do everything but my job!!!! Nothing but a big back stabbing place!!!!"
bad,"A typical day usually starts off on a high note but as the day goes on, all I can think about is wanting to go home. I've learned that no matter how hard you work, favoritism plays a big role in who gets promoted. Management does not value its employees."
bad,"I'd work for Walmart before I work for this company, and Walmart is pretty bad. You will be lucky to get in full-time and make a decent living. Very high turnover rate."
bad,"never got breaks, the store manager repeatedly made inappropriate racist remarks to employees and would try to threaten them with firing them and giving them less hours. they forced me to take on a supervisor position when the old one quit. they didn't give me a raise or anything and the work was really really exhausting. do not work here."
bad,Bad workplace to work at. Rude Associates They treat you so unfairly i do not recommend working here at all. Low Pay And Cut Hours. Mangers Really Didn't Focus On whats needs to be done.
bad,"While working at Ross I never had enough money or hours, I did enjoy some of my coworker friends and my boss was very supportive of me. However this job did not support enough of those needs."
bad,"ok company to work for, long hours as I worked in the corporate offices, with a mean district manager, don't think I would go back to this company in the future.  Worked Part time"
bad,The job is a good job for people who want to start off. The benefits arent the best and the pay is not all worth it. Ross over works you for little recognition.
bad,"messy rude customers, managements a joke, expect 5 people on staff to do the work of 10, always short staffed yet has 70+ employees want full time availability to work 3 shifts 5 days a week and expect you to be on call 24/7."
bad,Every shift that i came into start my job all the employees made me feel at home. They would greet me as i was clocking in the start my shift. The head cashier would notify me of what my duties of the day were and I would get started right away. Anything i needed they were usually able to provide that to me.I enjoyed all the my managers they were very helpful and nice. I never really had a hard time at my job i adapted to everything very well.
bad,"Ross is a horrible establishment to work. Their is no proper management. They don't care about their workers. Working for them has been a nightmare, and has destroyed my mental health."
bad,Store manager played favorites. Late nights. We would sometimes get out of the store after 1am. The store was always a mess because employees were never held accountable for anything.
bad,"they do not train you "
bad,This job especially management treated me like dirt!!!!! I didn't get hours and they take you off the schedule for weeks if you have to be out. The managers treat employees like they are incompetent slaves.
bad,"Ross Dress for less is a joke. Unless you were sleeping with management, or friends with different managers, you did not get any working hours. In addition to that you were given all the crummy tasks."
bad,A typical day at Ross is very confusing and you don't learn much besides tolerance. Management is terrible with order and communication. The workplace culture is selfish and the hardest part of the job is consistency. There is no enjoyable part of the job.
bad,"90% of the job is standing up front saying, ""hello, welcome to Ross"" in an 'authoritative, but friendly' tone. The other 10%of your hour is a 6 minute walk around the store to pick up all the tags and alarms that your manager thinks you're preventing"
bad,Working for ross for the little time that i have i seen more mangers come and go their never true to what they say and treat employees like unfair there never understanding of days you need off and never really directly on what they want you to work on for the day they lack of management is ridiculous and they are very unprofessional on handling employees and customers
bad,"I wouldn't work for this company at all. Poor pay, the staff always have an attitude, and some areas only give you overtime most do not. I would not recommend this job too anyone."
bad,Horrible turnover rate and customers were rude on a consistent basis. Management did nothing to support representatives and the pay and hours were not matching.
bad,"Ross would have been a great place to work, but they expect to much out of a person. They treat people unfairly as far as I'm concern. I wasn't fast enough for them. But I busted my butt off to get everything done the right way. Like I said unfair, but everyone is fast. everyone works at their own pace."
bad,always hiring but never have enough hires for part time . they well always call you on your days off to come in because some eles didn't go or called out .
bad,not worth it. dont apply. too much work and you will want to find another job as soon as possible. employees are frequently overworked and sometimes dont even get breaks.
bad,very low pay. no benefits. large amount of work. too stressful. I felt like I was underpaid and overworked. I would not recommend this place to anyone I care for.
bad,"Not a good source of primary income, great for a student who doesn't mind working minimal hours, or a Ross enthusiast who will make use of the discount for working there. If you do not match either of those descriptions, only pursue a job listing as a temporary source of income; the long haul is not worth the effort."
bad,"I worked here about 2 months and every day was torture, almost giving my notice every day but caved to the compliments that they needed me and please don't leave felt obligated"
bad,"I would walk around and fold clothes, help with customers, and set out stock. This was a very slow paced job.  I would mainly work at night doing a 5 hour shift,"
bad,This job is ok. Offers flexible schedule. Lots of work to be done. Very busy work environment. Shift goes by very quickly. I prefer closing and weekend shifts.
bad,"Unload truck unbox items sort home kitchen and bed and bath items, sort and size apparel and shoes, process purses and lingerie. Work with a sense of urgency."
bad,The company overall is not good at communication.  Not enough staff to due what was expected in a day.  Management was always stressed. Bad company...
bad,"You start part time, the job is easily learned, semi training is given.. This place is a god starter job for teenagers , shows you  what working hard for minimum pay really is without an education. You are not only cashier you are also go backs, security and stock person. The place is a mess , managers are about 19- 21 years old and that's it, there is no more... The part time schedules are very random they change each week."
bad,"I worked as a receiver and stock person. By far of all of the work I have ever done, this place really took advantage of my skills and helped me to find skills I did not know I possessed. Here I found solace in my fellow associates but did not enjoy working to compensate for lack of understaffing. Eventually I was moved up to the Cash Office but ironically I was scheduled for less hours and fewer days. It was difficult to have a workplace environment where every aspect of my presence there required attention to detail."
bad,Very harsh and hateful staff that were not willing to help me when I needed there help . I managed to work through it but had many issues with manager whom apparently didn't like me .
bad,"The hiring process took longer than most. They approved hiring then didnt start for a month. Once you started working, the morale of your co-workers seem to dissipate, seemingly fast. The friendly smiles, turned to empty eyes in the break room. They continued to hire more seasonal associates, up until after January 1st. The part time and full-time employees never came in or called out frequently and left the seasonal to pick up slack. The last week of Holiday season, they didnt notify anyone of empty schedules. Most of us showed up to find we were completely removed from the schedule. The assistant managers had zero voice in keeping anyone, and the over all store manager was rude, disrespectful, and didnt care that so many people were upset or had questions. Phone calls went unanswered. Even after trying to shop, as a customer, they still give attitude. Made no sense to get rid of those willing to put in hours and a smile on their face, than to keep the employees who were not reliable or considerate."
bad,"Ross stores was a great environment to work in, but it had horrible management. Unfortunately Ross Stores has a very bad atmosphere"
bad,Rude customer service rude management the stockroom is not the place to work take it from me the hours don't add up there always over on payroll giving hours away to people that don't need it.. Its a lot of racial things happening there they pass there dirty work over. To the next manager while their looking confused I hate the workers there if they replaced everyone even managers it would run well
bad,"When I started working for Ross back in July of 2015 it was already a new store so that means new people new management new everything... I worked there almost two years and I only received a 29 cents, I begged for two transfers and was denied and then end up getting fired because in confidentiality I expressed how I felt about another associate that not only continuously disrespectful me and other associates and managers. Don't work at store number 1674 Hialeah Gardens"
bad,unstable work eniroment alot of fight emotional arguing bickering because management upper management want things done fast so no pay.
bad,Lack of communication low rate of pay no hours given to the part time associate no  room to move up customer are nasty store junky mangment discuss personal business with other associates
bad,"Terrible job, terrible pay, terrible management aside from myself. They claim when they hire you on that they offer flexible schedules but they do not allow for any kind of flexibility. They expect people to work way too hard, then do not give credit for actual work being done. I learned that this was a horrible place to work, they do not treat employees well at all by any means at all. The workplace culture is hostile and you are not allowed to say that you don't like how things are being done. The hardest part of the job was trying to do everything in so little time without having enough employees to cover the entire store. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I resigned to return to school. I do not recommend this company to anyone. I rated one star because that's the lowest rating but really it shouldn't even be rated so much as 1/4 of a star."
bad,"take time and get this place in order , focus on being better and not just numbers , then it could be a better place to work , always sending people home because they are over on hours"
bad,The store feels like your life is Ross. They want you to do it all and will not pay you anything because that's the way life goes
bad,Ross needs to do a lot better the management is horrible the store is very disorganized  very dirty andts slot of drama between team members and management
bad,"Worst place iv ever worked at, no one cares about work and just goes there for fast cash. everyone does not talk to one another and the store is all over the place."
bad,"Like I said before the place is great but the higher management never saw the real picture or of the environment the store needed to really enjoy working for Ross,"
bad,"Had baby and company does not like managers that have babies they started finding things to talk to me about. Things really changed when I told them I was pregnant....before I told them everything was great,...."
bad,The store is dirty. The pay is terrible especially for the work you do. The management is bad. Too many turn overs. Most of the employees were kind. A lot of Hispanics work there. No room for advancements.
bad,"They put all their energy and hours into the people working stock, and neglect the rest of the store.  Lazy people are rewarded with working the fitting room, so they can lean against the wall the whole shift while everyone else is running around picking up and putting away."
bad,They've created a culture with their customer like Wieners or Fallas Paderes. Customers are the worst second to upper management whom expect unrealistic goals.
bad,Too much drama and stress in the work environment. Not enough staff. Expectations way to high. Management/HR's do not like to listen to you. Very poor company.
bad,"Tried pushing a promotion I didn't want on me, to top it off, they weren't going to give me the raise that was supposed to go along with it."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work their. They don't give breaks or lunches, they always short staffed, and the management team is horrible."
bad,Management created horrible work environment. Never respected breaks and in fact gave me very few breaks during my years of working with the company. They definitely knew how to abuse and unappreciated workers. I give them the thanks for teaching me basics in customer service but definitely management needs to be worked on asap.
bad,"You never really knew if you were working when you came in, let alone if you were staying the full shift. Hardly ever worked in your in designated department. Everything was done on a percentage scale. Co-workers and supervisors made it a lot easier to make it through the day."
bad,"Lack of training, lack of employee knowledge, and lack of management organization. Store hours were not good and they couldn't handle a small rush without all kinds of help. I was never able to truly do my job as a sales associate as they would always ""need"" help on registers."
bad,Every aspects of the company is awful. Never work here unless you plan on throwing co-workers under the bus to get ahead in the company. They treat you terribly and never appreciate a hard worker.
bad,"bad place to work , worst management no hours good coworkers ... rude costumers during the peak season .................../////////////././././/.././//./"
bad,"When i first started working here the place was a mess. Everybody did there own thing and kept it far from professional,  no body followed dress code or regulations"
bad,We worked less hours because we were constantly unable to afford help because of the payroll constanly being over. Sometimes we would work a total of 4 hours.Too inconsistent.
bad,I only had 2 ross stores in FWB FL so advancement opportunities did not have often and when it did they would hire out side the company. people who had no idea how to do the basics to the job.
bad,"As a former employee of Ross Stores this company is not the best choice if you are trying to make a career. There is promotion the DM I worked under always had a excuse on why one can't get promoted even though you qualify for the position. The store stays open to late, a lot of the men in management are single with no kids and don't understand family values. They had no respect for women who had families with small children. The pay does not equal up to the work load especially as a supervisor. The turnover rate is very high, the management does not support their team they just sit in office and talk on their cell phones. Saw management turn their back on associates multiple time when a customer attack an associate the management run and hide and let that associate get called all kinds of hurtful names."
bad,I had to work really long hours for minimum pay. My managers werent giving me enough hours also I was attending highschool and had to work under these conditions
bad,Get any other job if u can. The management is a joke and will throw anyone under the bus to cover their own buttes. Was asked to fake lunch breaks and 10s so I wouldn't get a labor violation
bad,"All i have to say is i did not have a good experience while i worked at Ross.Great place to shop but that will be all i'm doing there. Management was terrible, store was messy, employees were not very nice, and very low hours."
bad,"3 year experience working at Ross I can tell you you’re better off working anywhere else.  Describing this particular store 15 hour weeks maybe, low pay/1 dollar raises, dealing with idiotic Mexican tourists/winter Texans, female drama, answering to 4 or more bosses and LP, being micromanaged moronic managers often spread their employees too thin so you’re going to be all over the place, having unrealistic work goals a clean store or a long line you can’t have both.  As for the higher ups collusion, corruption, incompetence, and favoritism to describe the managers.  I wouldn’t even recommend seasonal work at this particular store.  Dead-end job avoid it, your worth more than that.  PS the favorable comments might be over zealous managers trying to do damage control just a thought."
bad,"These people doesn't appreciate good workers, they are petty ,unorganized and will fire with no good reason.  They can do that in south Carolina.they seem to have some of most incompetent people in charge. This is  a club. Nothing more."
bad,"I have to stand up front and greet people, I can't stop anyone from stealing, I have to let them walk out of the door and that's it. I've learned literally nothing, I've had to wing everything I know, No one is giving me any feedback. The management sucks, all our managers is do, is sit in the office. My co workers are amazing and they get no hours a week, they work with little pay. The hardest part of the job is not being able to stop anyone from stealing. The most enjoyable part is being able to work with some of my friends."
bad,"This is the worst place on planet earth to be employed by.  The management(The tall, blonde manager is awesome. However, the tiny Pilipino lady is an absolute nightmare) is unorganized. Practices are extremely inconsistent. Employees often have different ways of completing tasks, which can cause friction. This work environment is extremely hostile, and I would advise people to avoid employment here at all costs."
bad,"The absolute worst kind of customres: rude, cheap, poor, disrespectful, agressive, threatening, crazy, drugged up, thieving, and ignorant."
bad,"a lot of unfairness when it comes to the  skin complexion. Manager dating employee,,Manager giving employee they like more hour over hardworker"
bad,"I WILL NEVER WORK HERE AGAIN!!! The management sucks, the hours suck, and they just flat out don't trust their employees. They've fired people for the dumbest reasons and I am pretty sure a lot of the time, their reasoning is illegal. I'm surprised the manager is still working there considering some pretty disturbing facts about his previous job."
bad,"I love being around people and helping them, my co workers were great. Hardest part of my job was when I had to give someone bad news and also the difficult customer and the best part was to help people have better vision. A typical day was sales and interacting with customers.Most enjoyable aspect of the job is the return customers that enjoyed the service from beginning to end. I will miss them all, as the company strived to be very involved with our community."
bad,"Terrible place to work, avoid at all costs.Most people who are there have been so for years because they have built up enough tolerance to deal with management and Cooperate operations."
bad,"A typical day at Ross was... in a word, hectic. I acquired a lot of customer service skills however management was very very poor, co-workers acted unprofessionally toward each other, and not only was the job physically taxing but it was mentally and emotionally difficultl. What I enjoyed most about the job was the discount that was given to the employees."
bad,Working here was a waste of my time. Assistant store manager is very lazy and edits the schedule so she/he can have the most employees on shift and likes to go on cig breaks. Very inconsiderate. Store manager is not trained in promoting correctly. The store is a mess no one ever stays.  The district manager needs to question these questionable lazy managers. I learned nothing. Sometimes management would watch me on the camera when I'm shopping like I am a criminal.
bad,"Lack of hours, will transfer associates from other locations oppose to giving their own employees hours. Extremely rude managers. Your lucky if you get a four hour work week. They consistently call you off."
bad,"They were very rude and liked to gossip and criticize employees in the stockroom, very poor work ethics among managers and leads"
bad,"Too many Supervisors, Too many Managers And so little help."
bad,i have learned a lot of working in retail that i know i would be very comfortable to work any retail job. the hardest part of the job was that sometimes there was good days and really bad days but you learn to deal with the rough patches the right way.
bad,I didn't enjoy the experience at all. I wasn't trained properly and my manager was careless. My manager for that week of training act like I didn't exist. So after a year I was laid off. It wasn't even worth working there. Crosstimbers Area.
bad,the worst company to work for.  unprofessional staff and management.  one of the biggest mistakes coming and working here.  glad I'm out and working for a GREAT company  Now I see why there is logo is Dress for Less; that's the moto and attitude of the entire staff for the Corp office in Dublin and I hear nothing has changed since!
bad,Management showed clear favoritism to most aesthetically pleasing employees. As far as some people even advancing due to what they looked like or the amount of time they spent outside of work with said management personally. Scheduling was sporadic and subject to change with out contacting employees.Other discrepancies occurred while on the clock that I am unable to disclose for the protection of identities. the easiest part of my job was my departure.
bad,"If you're black, you'll do well in the company. You can be a MANAGER in a matter of MONTHS! And anything you do just slides. If you are any other ethnicity, Management is overly critical, and you are viewed as lazy and not included in the TEAM. I would NEVER go back and I will NEVER spend another dime in that store."
bad,"I hated working here. Ross will do anything to benefit and they do not care if they are overworking the employees. "
bad,"Ross I care not to remark on thank you!"
bad,"The workplace isn't that great. The some of the managers are rather rude to the employees. The workers in the fitting rooms are often forgotten about, or just ignored in general."
bad,"My typical day at work would be out on the sales floor and cash wrap. I have had situations where I had no hours a week. They claim they had ""payroll"" issues but they have been giving me that excuse for weeks so I had to quit. At the time, I had a newborn and bills to pay so I had to leave. There are different locations that give hours but if you work at a location and they do not give you hours, LEAVE! The hardest part about the job was just the hours and very very very poor management. This store opened in july 2015 but has been very unorganized since i left in October It may just be THIS location. I am not talking all locations... but i want people to succeed."
bad,"management there took advantage of me because i was the youngest one, it was my first job so i didnt know any better. everyone there was rude, always made me do their job when i was busy doing mine. I'd get in trouble for not finishing most things when i couldnt do it all myself."
bad,completely disorganized management. management was totally unprofessional. co-workers were okay. I would never work at that location again nor would I recommend it to any one else. Too much to deal with for minimum wage.
bad,I stayed with this company for 5 years. I did everything and more than they asked of me and never once was I promoted or even given a raise. All the Manager cared about what how much money the store made so she could look good to her superiors. They never cared about the employees. I actually ended up having no morale and gave up entirely and eventually quit. Promotion of friends and not people who deserved it was the absolute wrong way to be doing things.
bad,"It was a horrible company that promised position after position, management was very unprofessional and still is to this day. If you go to them with a problem they ignore it."
bad,"Very slow the customers can very rude. The management is very lazy no sense of ergncy and very inconsistent, co-workers are lazy and bad attendance but they can be very fun. best thing about that place is the discount and having double discount days"
bad,A typical day here requires much hard work and determination to meet job standards. The management here does not help educate their employees on protocol.
bad,Answer questions.  Answer questions regarding the store and its merchandise.Greet customers and ascertain what each customer wants or needs.
bad,"The managers mix their personal life wit their work life. You can all when they have a bad day, because they bring it out on their employees. The stock room is always a mess, sometimes you have to climb on fragile boxes to keep working, because the store manger is always watching you on the camera. She gets paid just to sit in the office watching employees on the camera. And everything there is a safety hazard to employees and customers."
bad,"Soon as I get to work I would start to clean up the store; pick clothes up off the floor, hang them on hangers and fold them neatly. Me work here show me how to work them customers to help them find what best fit them. The hardest part was trying to finish cleaning up before it was time to go home. The best part was the discount they gave up for working there. 40% off was great."
bad,"If you are anywhere an Florida and want to work at Ross, DON'T. It's the worst place to ever work. Management act like children, you are basically slaving for minimum wage, they don't give hours, and they expect the most when they dint even appreciate you. During the interview process of your are part time they will guarantee 25 hours a week which is a lie. You will be lucky if you make 12 hours that week. If you have personal reasons for leaving work, you might as well except that write up because that's what you are going to get. Store manager at the one I worked at had her period and she went home an associate had a family memeber in the hospital and if she left she would have been fired."
bad,"I was hired as a cashier, and yet was not trained. I was not getting paid enough to being working as a cashier. Customer were rude, no benefits."
bad,"this is not a job I would not want to work at again... management was poor they didn't care about the associates, the only postitve thing about the job was the lunch breaks"
bad,for a big time company making a lot of money they dont appreciate or values their employees they cut hours trastically people are force to get 2nd job
bad,"Ross was not my favorite job in my perspective they were all over the place very rude to customers, and didn't really carry good customer service to customers or employees, management at ross is not good management , the hardest part of the job is when you just started and they think you rememberized everything within just a few days and leave alone and don't help you when you need help. the most enjoyable part of working their is knowing that I had good customer service did my best and gong home, I don't like ross in the fact because they rate your speed and it shouldn't be how fast you can go but how many customers you bring back to the company"
bad,"My number one priority was customer service ,  sales, monitored budgets for increased profits. I learned team building and good morale are very important in managing a large staff. Effective communication with district manager , assistant managers, merchandise managers and associates are valuable as a manager."
bad,"At Ross therte is a high employee turn over rate so most employees do not care about the job. Ross makes you sign an agreement that they will only get one 15min break if they work less than 6 hours so must employees work short shift with one break. There is alot of work, and mess at the end of the day. Staffing is cut to save money often and leave a few employees overworked and under paid."
bad,The hours you worked was horrendous and the pay was a joke. In order to live you have to take on a second job but their scheduling method made it impossible to take on a second job. Hours were scarce.
bad,"Liked the people I worked with but I had no hours, Management refused to work with me on hours and moving me so I could get more hours."
bad,"awful management, awful place to work even though your a retail associate ultimately you end up becoming a waiter and r on call to clean up the mess of people who go in there make a mess and dont purchase anything... and o yea you get harrased because some people insist since they are buying a few dollars  of items in there that they can do whatever they want, talk to you how ever you want and get treated awful. on top of that their loss prevention is a joke and they dont really have a good loss prevention system"
bad,"Horrible place to work in, the environment is horrible. management staff are also terrible. inequality. Horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't work here!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Nevada Commerce Bank went out of Business!!!! Need I say more..........................?"
bad,"Customers are the least of worries at this place; yes they are rude, arrogant, obnoxious, and tend to leave their children all over the place; but who you should really look out for is the corporate office and the management (store manager). "
bad,"- A typical day at work is chaotic. Not enough employees throughout the day at a very high volume store. Management schedules 2 cashiers when the line has 20 customers, but instead of helping, they lock themselves in the office to play on their phones or eat vending machine snacks."
bad,"Yeah, I can start work Monday through Friday everlyday weekdays it was so Five days part-time job 9 hour. My position stocks Associate. Hoiday Saturday and Sunday two days. I am deaf and English. Do you contract to me morning or evening time any."
bad,"Where do I even start? I was hired as a seasonal employee and was excited to start another part time job that was literally a 5 minute drive from my house. My first day i came in and it was literally a disaster. Communication is terrible. I was ""trained"" for about 15-20 minutes and then pretty much just thrown into the mix and had to figure out how stuff worked as i went along. I was told by a manager to work on a certain department with a ""training buddy"" who showed me how to do recovery, (basically fixing up my section and making it look as neat as possible) she left after like 5 minutes never to be found again so I did what I could on my own. Keeping the place neat is impossible, by the way. Customers are pigs. I couldn't believe that I would turn my back and as soon as I turned back, customers had left piles of clothes and unwanted items on top of the racks or just laying on the floor. Customers have no respect for your work and many times they just don't know how hard it is to spend 20-30 minutes fixing up an aisle only for it to be trashed by customers in like 2 minutes. It's so frustrating. "
bad,"pay sucks hours suck, full time employee with part time hours just a bad experience with management. no one pulls their weight in their departments"
bad,"Work was very hectic, I learned patience, Management was terrible , my co workers were immature , hardest part was dealing with and uncomfortable work enviornment, i enjoyed clock out time"
bad,"I did not really enjoy working at the Ross in California. They did not properly train anyone and had to figure out things on my own without being trained or shown what to do. Management was not available when I had questions and when asking other employees they said they did not know half the time and just ""do it like this"" or ""just make it look ok"" They were not willing to work around my school schedule even though when hiring me they said they would."
bad,"Don't appreciate management communication skills, Very hard to advance and when you ask questions about it management above tells lies to keep you where you are because no one can replace you"
bad,I didn't like working there at all because on my first day some money got stolen from me. The people there were okay and it was kind of relaxing a little.
bad,"Staff did not look like they wanted to be there. There were lots of theft problems. No discipline what so ever. New staff in and out every day, no one ever stayed."
bad,"don't be a stocker"
bad,the management was not organized. They did not keep up with the paper work and their was confusion of scheduling. The hours were not stretched properly.
bad,"management was not the best"
bad,need better management and staff. definitely under staffed need more workers. the customers are horrible they get mad at you when you follow the company guidelines.
bad,Ross provides an unkempt store along with paying unlivable wages and a team of unruly management that couldn't care less.
bad,"When the schedule comes out, I will have 3 or 4 days a week. Then management will call you to tell you that the schedule has changed and now you only have 1 day that is a 4 hour shift. Not worth the time to start your car!"
bad,"annoying management, always on their phones, sloppy store, rude co workers, learned not to work retail, enjoyed leaving"
bad,"I've worked here from late Feb. till today July 9th, due to the fact of management having no communication and seem to diss like eachother, never a day where work was smooth... also having a incident where they messed up on my Check and still have not received my money, its going on 5 weeks... not to mention, they don't allow you to have more then 25 hours. you'll be lucky if you get 20 hr. "
bad,"This was a time when most companies were thinking of creative ways to reduce benefit expenses in order to gain more profits for the share holder and to use computer statistics,  investments to there advantage. The Idea was to take this computer model based on the number of staff needed for each location every hour, day and week, and reduce payroll to meet the labor and customer count/receipts. a Lot of people lost their jobs and benefits."
bad,"My experience working here was not a good one at all. There was to much drama, gossip, they didn't work with my hours, never paid me my travel pay for traveling over 1000 miles in a week, Didn't get proper training, management did not have a professional appearance, they also fired military members while on deployment."
bad,"Working at Ross is probably the worst experience I have had for my first job. The whole environment of the store (Managers, co-workers) was not what I had hoped to experience for a first job."
bad,"Management sucks, low pay, no hours. There is no structure at all, and always short people. Working for this company is truly awful"
bad,"Managed store all shifts. Supervised all employees, transferred money to safe. Opened, closed, cashiered when needed. Supervised merchandise delivery and stocking. "
bad,"working here is the worst thing ever, i will not advise anyone to work here at all the management needs to be replaced the pay was nothing to write home about, it was too stressful i was just not worth it"
bad,"I only lasted 4 months before quitting. Completely unorganized, rude management, ridiculous goal expectation and would not recommend."
bad,"stock tag clip click run "
bad,The sales floor teams were limited and you would have to perform other people's duties constantly. The way things would work was never organized properly. People would constantly call in. There was never enough hours for the store. Transfers took multiple weeks to be completed.
bad,"Verbally abusive managers who like to micromanage every breath the employees take. The District Managers are just as bad, if not worse."
bad,Warehouse wise it was a good experiment. Very under paid for the work we did. Too top it off i was only hired for seasonal and had to work mandatory six days a week.
bad,I was hired on as a packer but my first week they had me moving around doing random jobs. The second week They trained me for about 20 minutes then I was left to do my job. At the end of the second week I thought I was doing good because they never talked to me about my rate but they fired me.
bad,"Horrible Management, does not know how to treat people. Will not leave you work by yourself, only picks on you."
bad,I liked working at Ross because of my co- workers and our customers. We all got along with each other and we treated our customers very well.
bad,I personally didnt like working there. The pay was horrible and they are not very flexible. It is definitely meant for high school or college students that just want money in their pockets
bad,"A ""typical"" work day at Ross in Moses Lake, WA when I worked there was overall a tragedy. I would come in one to two days a week for two hours after other employees let the areas get trashed by customers without picking up anything. The work schedule seemed to be played with and changed so much at my time there, about up to three times a week without being notified and wouldn't find out about when I have to work until I was either already late or not even contacted to come in and told when I came in for the previously scheduled time to just go home. Plus I didn't find two hours, stress, poorly structured environment provided by corporate sleazes worth the $10 in gas to get there and back for the $20 dollar work day."
bad,you are very over worked and not well paid enough for what is expected out of you. you either have to be a cashier which is standing in a very small register area and dealing with lots of rude people
bad,I was lied to about the job that I was accepting and was talked down to and disrespected  many times. I know now why they can not keep any employees in the stock room. The turnover rate was crazy.
bad,you work at night stock up shelves it was a good experience but the pay would be short and they would put it in a next pay check
bad,This was the worst job I every had and I over stayed my welcome.
bad,I have so many complaints about this job. It was complete chaos. I worked overtime and never got paid for it as well.
bad,"A typical day at Ross consists of constant movement but typically only working for about 4 hours per shift. Generally I would be on the register and ensuring that customers have a fast and accurate transaction process; I would also be working on the sales floor in the men's and kid's department (where it was the most messiest) picking up all clothes and other items from off of the floor. The thing that was the worst about working for Ross was the management, they were so unorganized as a unit and for a few months we didn't even have a store manager! Some members of management would communicate a specific change in something then when I would talk with the other members of management I would hear something completely opposite about the same thing. It was exhausting to have adhere to all the several changes that they had then didn't have and then had again. The worst part of the job was that they would continue to cut our hours more and more each week, Eventually I had just gotten sick of getting such puny checks. The best part of the job was my co-workers because they were generally around the same age as I was and we all felt the same way about the company."
bad,"This place was terrible to work at! Managers were rude, other employees were too, everyone looked miserable here which resulted in poor customer service and horrendous performance as a store. They don't try to work with your schedule even if you're a mom or a student. They refused to offer more than 20 hours a week."
bad,didn't really feel welcomed anymore after two years i am personally a hard worker and i expect promotions for the work i do and this pace isn't a spot to be recognized
bad,"Seriously, just don't. Management picks favorites and only cares about themselves, not the associates."
bad,already did this one. The customer and my co-workers were the best thing in the store
bad,Extremely terrible place to work. I wont step foot back into that establishment.
bad,"I was hirer for 90 days, it turn into a 6 months of waiting to be transferred to Ross. But I did got the running around, other that come  at the same time I was hired .Was moved into a permanent position. It was a lot of brown noose and discrimination. I was the first to be hirer and six months later, continuing to wait. I kept pressing supervisor and manager but no answers. What I saw in this work place, was too much competition for everything among Loss Prevention. No trainee is provided, after five months, I was assigned to a computer links to go to testing and other courses. Day in and day out you are left alone with no instruction."
bad,"Responsible for all phases of the stores’ operations. Manages and controls the operations of the store to ensure that company standards and expectations are consistently met. Executes business plan and associated programs that will deliver the desired sales and profit results, while maintaining good quality customer service. Recruits, hires, trains and develops Assistant Managers and non-exempt Associates."
bad,It sucks big time the management stinks we had four different store managers in one year...No room for advancement....only get like 10-15 hours per week
bad,Hard labor and bad pay. Management did not communicate well.
bad,"When i first went to Ross I was told that the pay was horrible, that it was long hours. But they claimed to be fair and just, well not even they did the favorites and those who stood up for them selves were in the naughty list. I was injured at work and informed my manager just like I was told to do, the manager just looked concerned. She never made the report or anything, I had to pay out of pocket for my x-rays and doctor visits, when i went back i was told the manager was going around talking about my injury and making comments that were not nice at all along with name calling. So if you would like to be a slave and do not care about your health then please come down to Ross."
bad,"If you're not of the Hispanic orientation, you will not move up in this company. Management can barely comprehend English. Disorganized and cluttered"
bad,"dealt with customers, really a bad paying job that was not feasible for me at all."
bad,I needed a career change was not for me you could not stop I was always feeling like I was not appreciated just talked down to I am glad that I am no longer with this company
bad,"Start with check all the store make sure was everything in place."
bad,"I helped open a new store and was a customer service employee. They gave me about ten hours a week even though I made it through the wipeout of most of the employees that started and was praised for being a great employee. I had to get a second job and was forced to quit because they told me if I didn't have weekend availability, they didn't need me (which made no sense because they never used me on weekends) so I quit. Terrible management, and overall horrible experience for the amount of effort I put into working there."
bad,"Working At Ross was the most horrible experience ever. The store was always dusty and dirty. None of the toilets worked in the women's restroom so we had to use the male restroom. My manger was a pain and kept asking me to work an extra minutes. Also they would never give me a set schedule they call me the day of 10 mins before they want me to come in. I was working seasonal. they asked me to come back as full time, i agreed. I explained to my manger that i will be having surgery and will be out for 2 weeks. He said it was fine and to give him a call when i can come back to work. so about 2 weeks after my surgery i called and they gave me the run around. I talked to every manger that worked there and showed them my doctors note. they was suppose to give me a number to call so i can go back to work but they would never give me the number. So basically they fired me due to missing 2 weeks due to surgery."
bad,"As loss prevention, all you do Is stand at the front door and great people.  Supervisors tell you otherwise, but that's what you do.  If you see someone stealing, you are supposed to tell a manager.  But, it you decide to say something to them, you are aggressive and get threatened with termination.  There is almost no room to advance.  Boredom is the hardest part of this job.  The only good thing is the people who you work with have to work twice as hard for less money, but at least you become friends due to the unsavory working conditions"
bad,"This was the worst place I ever had the displeasure of working.  I hate to give a bad review, especially in the application process, but it seems required, and I have nothing good to say about my experience at Ross.  A typical day at work included performing the incomplete duties of the prior shift, acting as management while the team leader engaged in cell phone activity locked away in the office, and consistent racial harassment.  The only thing I learned here was how to clean up after incompetent, lazy managers and their friends.  The hardest part of the job was trying to compensate for a lack of staff members due to consistent call outs, which were never addressed.  The company itself offers little to no incentive for advancement.  They only allow 2 full time employees, leaving the rest of a staff consisting of 20 or more members to beg for and fight over a ridiculous 15 hours a week at a minimum wage.  This leaves a staff with no benefits, and no incentive to care, as they all have another job that is their real concern.  Apparently, this is the desire of corporate, because suggestions, solutions, or downright complaints are ignored, even by the District Manager, and Loss prevention entities."
bad,"very low end entry level job.  no possiblity of making a career, use only as a stepping stone to a better company."
bad,the job was very easy but had poor management lack of hours and availability to work
bad,It wasn't the greatest job. I did not enjoy working there. Everyone was rude and seemed the employess didn't want to be there
bad,they want you to work 3 times harder than what they are paying you
bad,even at Christmas time we didnt get more that 15 hrs and it was always work faster faster it was not good place to be.managment made promises and did not follow through on them
bad,run all any go backs cashier and ensure store is recovered customer service
bad,Working there was very nerve wrecking customers were really nice but the staff was not up to part meaning management.
bad,"This is the less place I would return to.Primary duties consist of providing great customer service, answering multi-line phones, completing reports/forms, and handling large amounts of cash. Assist with human resource assignment, cash office and store manager weekly planner’s assignments"
bad,"im a hardworking employer ,im enjoy learning new things,great customer service love meeting new people."
bad,It was bad pay it just was long hour too long never had a day ooff
bad,"I thought working at Ross Dress for Less would be a fun job, unfortunately  was wrong. The management staff didn't teach you anything about the store, they just sat you down and gave you paperwork to fill out and you were on your own. "
bad,good for students.management is extremely lazy. lots of gossip.
bad,"8 hour shift "
bad,when i was there i had to help set up the store..which was fun. the boss when i was there he was unethical.
bad,ross is a horrible place to work because they have rude customers and employee
bad,"This has to be one of the worst companies I have worked for, management is always getting people in trouble or firing you for reasons they cannot prove. Lot's of my ex co workers have sued Ross & WON because of how they handle things. The pay is horrible for everything you do there. I was a supervisor only making 8.50 an hour. Would only get about 25 hours a week."
bad,A typical day at work is always busy. I learned how to operate a cashe register and to manage co-workers with me being a frontend supervisor.The hardest part of my job was nothing and I enjoy  some of my co-workers.
bad,"This was the worst place I have ever worked. The management was ridiculous, I wasn't even put into the system for 3 days after I started, my TRAINER was rude and yelled at me in front of customers because I was unsure of how to do a certain transaction because it was my first time using a cash register. It's a mess. They don't size or arrange. just throw random things wherever. No organization. They leave trash on the ground. All in all this was the worst job experience of my life and I was only there a month."
bad,"It was extra busy all the  time, hardly any hours, bad scheduling"
bad,This was not a good place to work. If you want to work somewhere that will fit any life style this is not the place to work.
bad,"Hours were horrible and work place ethic was a shame, but the management was the worse!"
bad,"Not at all what I thought it would be, This company dose not care about its workers just the revenue.The policys for LP is a JOKE!"
bad,Worst part of  this company are the managers. They have favorites and if your  not one you are not important and you wont move up in this company. I'm currently in school and as a full-time they will not work with me and I only go two days out the week.
bad,"ive never gotten the chance to move up in this company, manager favors people, shes immature, doesn't pay much attention to associates, and is always complaining about her associates bothering her. come on now step up and do your job!!!"
bad,Over all Working at Ross was a learning experience I learned how to be more patient with customers.  I Established close bonds with certain individuals that worked in the store. As far as management working with different personalities me being part of management myself was very trying at times. The hardest part of the job was being assigned projects and trying to run the store with little to no help.
bad,the team at ross is not a team at all while employed at ross they were constantly hiring due to the way they treat their employees the schedule would be up one day and down the next with no notification the managers are very rude and do not care about their employees family or outside life if it doesnt affect ross they could care less
bad,"Ross has great employees. Very helpful people works with you until you get the hang of things. Great Staff who are always there when you need them"
bad,"a day at work was filled with cleaning out the dressing rooms and watch the dressing rooms"
bad,"no room for advancement"
bad,"It is impossible to work here and be able to provide for a family. Then they will always talk about making you full time so that you are not limited to 25 hrs a week, but they never promote."
bad,at ross dress for less i learned to work fast pace and work as a retail associate.  The co workers are welcoming and very helpful . i enjoy meeting new people and its a pretty easy job but i do work very hard to get the store cleaned up and stocked. 
bad,Ross was a stressful work enviornment . they wanted you to do everything that wasnt in your job description.
bad,Not very friendly people working at this company which made working days not so well. Management always worked with your home life schedule if the needed.
bad,"A typical day at workk included poor guidance from management. There is a lot of drama present within the company and unfortunately it showed. I've learned that I still enjoy providing top-notch customer service and interacting with people of diverse backgrounds. My co-workers were all very friendly and we worked very well together. We also helped one another out and kept a very positive attitude throughout the work day. The hardest part of the job was figuring out how to deal with management and the lack of tact. They seemed to be loud, rude and overall mean to potential custoners and employees alike. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with others that enjoyed working with customers as much as I did, and the commrotary that comes along with the position."
bad,"This company tries to hire managers that have experience, pay them very little and work them like drones. No one wants to hear your input and every single job related task is micromanaged at the highest level. A District Manager cannot even hire his own store managers or assistant managers with out getting Zone director approval, so imagine what store managers go through! While they claim to seek qualified managers, what they really want is drones that ask no questions. Don't even try to ask about some mysterious numbers that showed up in your profit and loss statements because that will be your end!!! When looking for other jobs I have been told several times that being employed at this company did not look good on my Resume and it actually downgraded me as a candidate (No lie, three different recruiters told me the same thing!). If you need a job, they have one for you. If you want a career that allows you to fully reach your potential and allows you to understand the ins and outs of business for your intellectual and professional growth then stay away from Ross and dd's Discounts.  "
bad,"You'll never get full time, very low pay, and very hard to get a job advancement."
bad,"I've been working here for almost 2 yrs and I've only received 1 raise since being employed with this company (15¢). They show favoritism here, what's good for 1 isn't good for the next. Also, they sometimes do not acknowledge requests to be off and put you on schedule anyways even though you requested off 2 weeks in advance."
bad,"Ross Dress for Less is hands down one of the worst places I have worked. Needless to say, the will not rehire me even though I put up with their horrible employment for upwards of 1 year."
bad,"It was a good place to work, good people, discounts, fast paced"
bad,"seasonal job, that paid well..I achieved and made goals to earn my paycheck"
bad,the assistant manager called me fat and when i told the manager she said she would say the same thing
bad,"They always under schedule. You will learn multiple areas, but the hands on training isn't something you should expect. Management is awful. The coworkers are wonderful to work with. Hardest part of the job is the rude customers, and the lack of knowledge that the management has. There is no room for advancement so do not expect to move up unless you plan to transfer. I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. There is a reason they are on the top 5 worst retail jobs list."
bad,"I love working with the customers and the other workers, but the management team is so unorganized, they never know whats happening on the salesfloor. They are usually to busy chatting with other associate and bringing up items they're going to purchase when they get off. Sometimes when one manager tells you how to do something, you end up getting in trouble by another manager because they expect it to be done another way. Don't get me wrong there are a few managers that make sure things are done right and they make sure we know what we are doing. I really feel that the coporate office has know idea how things are being ran at the store because everytime someone from corporate comes, thats the only time things are on point and being done right. Basically it was irritating waiting for assistance from a manager while they are talking about the night before."
bad,in a year of working you only get a 0.13 raise. they expect for you to come in all the time. management is horrible. cant keep managers at all.
bad,"All associates are grossly underpaid. Seniority is not appreciated at all. There was a lot of revenge type behavior and lies especially with the management. The raises are an insult to say the least. They are calculated by how long you've been there and the sales for the previous year. So it's possible to get a 10 cent raise which in my opinion isn't even worth accepting. Accruing vacation time takes a life time. Unless you're full time you're hours will be cut almost all year with the exception around Christmas of course. The HR department is ridiculous. There is no communication between management at all. In summary, one of the worst places I've ever worked at."
bad,"Ross is an absolute fantastic place to shot, great deals and bargains but an awful place to work. The management is a joke, the staff is rude to employees and the pay and hours suck."
bad,"Management is really bad, they show a lot of favortisim and that determines who gets the hours."
bad,It was a good place to work for until they started cutting hours down to when a person was working one day a week.
bad,"I was an Ast. Manager for a year with ross. At first it was great i enjoyed work for ross. when we got a new store manager thing start going down hill. Store Manager at Ross in Casper Wyo. start Sexual harassment me when i report him, he change the schedule giving me night shift and mid day shift. he also took away my weekend off. Then he when as far as to change the hours I clocked in and out. The store manager also go throw your personal item in your locker and found him going throw my purse and other. he also throw out all my personal item i had in my desk. the 1-800 would not do any thing about it nore would the DM. also there whee many time i would have to work 10 hour with out a lunch or break. this is the worst best to work don't apply for this job. my last day I had over 15 employees walk out with me because of the way the DM and store manager treat people here at Ross."
bad,Being a ross associate requires alot of energy. The store is always busy especially during the holidays.
bad,This has to be one of the worst jobs ever!!!schedule changes when ever management feels meaning if your off for 3 days you might get a call on the second or third day telling you that you were suppose to be at work and then be put down telling you that you must not had read correctly. Not worth the time and it wouldn't surprise me of all of Ross minimal wage works just walked off the job one day. This may be on of the stores that needs a overall redo.
bad,not well managed and the manager did not seen to care about the employees
bad,"After jumping through all the hoops of applying, interviewing, providing all the required documents and work tests, they leave you hanging and don't have the courtesy to tell you they're not hiring you. The corporate staff in Pleasanton are the worst. Avoid working at Ross - very unprofessional environment."
bad,No communication pay rate is terrible job too much never enough help.
bad,"Ross used to be very racist, did not support employees lot of discrimination."
bad,"This company could be a great place to work if operated correctly and employees were treated fairly, I am saying this because of things I wittnessed and happened to me. I had been hired as Loss Prevention but ended up a door agent (door greeter). I had to take it apon myselfe to learn the duties of loss prevention by asking questions and communicating with managment and loss prevention district manager, even then no one was consistent."
bad,"Everything to from the pay i earned, the customers and management was less than satisfactory."
bad,A typical day @ ross warehouse come to work obtain all the tools required to do my job which was HAD/Marker tagging all items unpacking and packing the items into boxs lifting at lest 500 to1000 boxes a nite
bad,"During my employment I was assaulted by a fellow employee. I was forced to continue working with employee badgering me and making harassing comments. It was a very unsafe work environment and although I expressed to management the severity of the harassment, the issue was not addressed as promised. I resigned giving my 2 weeks notice. I was asked to stay working and agreed under the condition that the issue be addressed. After 2 weeks and no action I left."
bad,I have worked for this company for years. This is my second job and I have received most of my work experience from here. Management does not support their workers in promotion or raises. There are several employees who have worked for Ross for over 5 years and have not moved up in the company. There are no disciplinary actions taken for employees and therefore they do what they want. I enjoy my customers and working with my coworkers. I love what I do but management makes it hard to work for this company.
bad,Horrible company to work for. They hire 3 times the people they need and after opening the store just quit putting you on the schedule. I worked in Colorado and the managers treated us like slaves. I moved to Missouri and they refused to mail me my checks even thought I sent them stamps. I had to contact the main office in California 4 different times before I got someone to help me.
bad,"Don't get me wrong the people I work with are good, decent, hardworking people. However the corporate level people that come in there are oblivious to what it is like to work inside their stores. I have never seen or been with a company that paid so little and demanded so much from their employees, and they will do whatever they have to, including keeping you labeled as part time even though you are working full time hours, to have you not receive your hard earned benefits. If you are considering a job here do yourself a favor and think again. And if anyone in corporate is reading this then you should be ashamed of yourselves."
bad,Needs to update their systems to run more efficiently and keep up with their rapid growth. Employees are extremely overworked and underpaid both in the field and at corporate.
bad,I had a rough time working in the back cause I didnt know Spanish. I was the only one who knew English. My boss didnt even know English
bad,The hardest part of my job was ticketing items and sticking myself with a needle. It was also hard to make production because the department before us that had the work would have the pay variables on the tickets wrong. Management wouldn't take the time to listen to the problems that were going on. It seem to me that they didn't care how the employees felt.
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the Customers
bad,If you have the right manager its great. But when you have a manager that spys on you and gets others to spy on you its very annoying. The manager tried every way to get an employee fired or asst managers in trouble. All this manager was trying to do is get other people that she used to work with from a different store in there instead of making the place better with the great people this manager had.
bad,"Worked at the cash register, helped clean the store, security at the store, and organize store shelves."
bad,"Being a merchandiser was a good position, you got to see all the new that came in the store before anyone. i loved working with me team they were great."
bad,"Ross is absolutely the worst company to work for period! The management team treats their employees like modern day slaves! The starting pay is $7.50. You work long, hot hours and are forced to complete task that you were not properly trained for and are constantly being yelled at because the job you weren't trained for wasn't done properly. The co-workers were okay, but most of the co-workers behavior were very inappropriate for the work place! The hours were short (maybe 13 minimum and 20 maximum)."
bad,this job is alot of younger people so it seems like people come and go alot it is not a forever job.
bad,Very poor management. underpaid for the volume of work and responsibility.
bad,"Horrible experience, hated every moment of it. Management mediocre and they treat you badly ad unfair.."
bad,"Run from Ross. I work for this company and trust me you don't want to work for them. I was a store manager. This is the worst company i have ever worked for in my life. the pay is horrible, the upper management is rude they will fire you for no reason at all! The RVP's, District Manager's, Zone managers are all selfish and like to play the blame game. if they don't like you they will use LP to dig up problems until they find a reason to get rid of you. If you don't believe me, find an ex Ross associate and ask them, or better yet, go into a store and ask any sales associate. You can even pretend like you are recruiting from another company and watch how fast every associate is interested in leaving Ross. They are all currently recruiting old Target employees to get rid of all the long term Ross managers. How's that for job security?!?!?1"
bad,Some of the management really don't appreciate the hard work that you do there at all.
bad,"Every workplace have both its pros and cons but being the newest member in my position I had to endure favoritism, ignorance, late employees, and always wanted to take off from work. The position did not have any benefits and only offered part time hours. This position is only good for those whom are willing to kiss up to members of management instead of just doing the job. Don't expect to be acknowledge for doing whats right you will only get acknowledge if they like you."
bad,"Ross is probably one of the easiest places I have worked at . When I start a job, I try to over exceed in all areas , so my team know I am a team player. It is very hard to be one when the “leader” won’t help or encourage everyone that what they are doing is a great job. Instead she is very demanding and rude. I normally work through my breaks to make sure everything gets done and I notice how many breaks management takes and it’s really sad."
bad,"I was wrongly fire for miscommunication "
bad,Not enough people to get the job done so it becomes stressful. Management is often nasty and dismissive. It’s not like any other place I’ve worked. We’ve got apparel that has been sitting since grand opening in October. It’s never been put out because we don’t have enough workers to push it out so they fault the entire backroom
bad,"Managers won’t hire more people like they should, or when they should. They say there’s room for advancement yet no one ever talked about it. No flexible hours."
bad,This was the biggest waste of time ever I woke up at 4:30 every day just to go to work and every week I would get less and less hours. No benefits except discounts on merchandise.  Also the manager is a straight up weirdo and makes you feel uncomfortable to the point that you don’t even wanna come up to him.  I felt like I was racially discriminated against. I wouldn’t recommend the ross on gosford road for anyone. And
bad,"-Favoritism"
bad,Don't work here unless don't mind being talked down to by rude supervisors. And don't mind improper training. And don't mind working hard for little pay and hours.
bad,"Mgmt does not support the staff. HR and Mgmt uses law to support lies, as if they are the only ones who can read. Female mgmt engages in he said she said. Threats and Micromanaging is common and no protection from abusive buyers. Spoken to like I was less than a dog during a touch base. Not a nice place to work. Sadly"
bad,"Dont give so many hours they change the schedule every week. They dont give same hrs when they hire you and keep saying they dont have enough money in pay roll.Very poor management "
bad,"The experience here depends entirely on your own life situation."
bad,"Really poor management like I put my availability and they schedule me on the wrong days that I did not put. Fair amount hours until winter time, you don’t get as much you would’ve want it. Also, sometimes it’s really stressful when your the only one running front end taking purchase and returns whereas customers complain of you being slow."
bad,There is a lot of politics in this work. The hardest part of the job is that you always get hurt at the job because they work you like a dog sometimes It feels that they violated OSHA regulations at this place everyday.
bad,"Very unprofessional. Every body gossips and starts drama, even management. You’re treated like a joke and you aren’t valued. 10/10 would not recommend."
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend staff are always calling out no benefits unless full time and not many hours to work , be careful at cashier management will try to get you in trouble"
bad,"Honestly, if you are single and don’t have family, then this is a the place for you.  If you have a personal life and anything can pop up; do not waste your time."
bad,The job is mainly about who can cover the shift. Not motiving the employee to want to come to work. The hours are poor. Who can live off of 10 hours per week? If you're a fulltime employee your good but part time is for people in school who can't dedicate too much time. They had me working in stock when I was pregnant and didnt care about the risk. They said they would move me to salesfloor but didnt until after I came back from maternity leave. Does that show care to the employee? No. Poor management.
bad,There was a lot of favoritism. Managers had certain people they'd do favors for because of their nationality. Managers were rude and did not know how to talk to the employees or customers.
bad,"If you need a little extra cash then go for it. Otherwise run the other direction. My managers promised to move me up to front end supervisor but kept giving me the run around. I was a hard worker, I filled in for extra shifts and I did what I was told. Even then they treated me like a delinquent. Everything I did was wrong. They would constantly talk down to me. I even heard them talk poorly about me to my other coworkers. Management can't order products properly. We were constantly running out of bags and tissue paper to wrap the breakables in. The hours there sucked. I went from 35 to 20 hours and I could barely make ends meet. Run the other direction and don't look back. The job isn't worth it."
bad,"Ross store management turn over was the highest I had ever experienced, e.g. 50% . When I joined the company my job required 50% of time recruiting, hiring, training  & development of management. I also required 25%  of time on retaining talent, as many individuals were resigning due to overall company conditions. "
bad,My first day at work the store manager keyon pulled off her wig  while talking too me . How unprofessional like my 2nd week at ross the manager reven lied on me and i didnt even know her and she had her family come too the job where they sat in the break room while she braided hair and keyon the store manager didnt say anything she actually was okay with it .
bad,"bad enuf you have to wait until Wed usually to get schedule, but once you get your schedule on a Wed, then day before, they take them away consistently"
bad,"Ross requires you to be crossed trained in all areas of the store which would be a good thing but you need to have at least 5 clones to get all the work done they want you to do during a shift.  Upper management does not care as long as the store makes the sales, Store management is full of back stabbers & have their little pets, will find any reason not to give you hours or to even fire you.  You are under constant observation by both in store management & outside management.   Ross claims to have open communications with their employees and uses an Alertline calling system which the report goes straight to store management so risk is run of you being fired if you complain about management treatment or complain about a manager pet employee.  Write ups are done to keep you at the store you are at & you can not transfer to another Ross if you wanted too.  On the job injures happen daily (small cuts, minor bruising ect) but major ones are reported to an oncall nurse and once it becomes where medical care is needed be aware of the company doing everything in their power to denied the claim.   Plus company states it does not discriminate but it does.Any restrictions are a death sentence .  Some weeks you may get 4 hours on the schedule others 20 hours depending on business needs.  You can have great customers and horrible customers each day & depending on the District mangers is to if the customer service policy is followed or not.   For the most part you may think you have great co worker but for the most part they are spies for management & back stabbers "
bad,"Very disappointing, they promise the moon and stars, insane, robotic, cyclical, redundant processes. Poor critical thinking management. Cutthroat, Warpath Management. Favoritism, arbitrary, biased and sexist views. It took me two and a half months to get hired, was hired for one position with pay rate and employment, only to be robbed of this position and sidelined due to biased management attempting to deter me from being hired."
bad,Working at Ross is very stressful with all the overloaded work. I only work part time and I am super exhausted by the end of my shift. The pay is low and the annul raise is very low.
bad,"I worked stock and unfortunately it started at 5 AM and ended between 9-10. The managers never wanted you to work for more than a certain amount of hours, otherwise they'd have to give you a lunch break. Honestly, they work the stock associates like mules. You are timed for every task that you do (10 min max) and the managers seem like they don't communicate often. I always got scolded for doing one thing that one manager wanted that the other didn't."
bad,The job is more for younger generation the work is good fair and most of the people are great there. Not enough hours for a single working mom. The new manager was ok but didnt listen to anyone's compliant
bad,Good company but daily organization out of control.Everything that i learn was on my own.Too many manager and lot of different decision makers.The work culture  is not follow.The hardest part of the job was last minute plans changing and not enough time to execute the goals.Nothing it was just  a place just to hope that you will not come one day and realize that my work  hours has being change or on  Friday getting last minutes notice that we will be working on Saturday.
bad,"Ross has very poor management, and does not treat employers fairly.  They also do not pay employers when pay is due, you have to go through district manger to get paycheck"
bad,"I worked for Ross and learned the store within the two and a half years I was there.  I knew how to run the frontend smoothly and many times it was just myself, a manager and someone working the fitting room.  The call outs is something to expect.  They hire just about anybody but mainly children who don’t value coming to work when scheduled.  I started off with an awesome manager who had to relocate.  After she left the store went through so many managers, about 4 in a year.  It really started to be a case of the blind leading the blind.  I took sick and was not able to return to work for about a month.  When I tried returning they gave me the run around but I had already been replaced.  The Area Supervisors ran the store because management didn’t have a clue of what to do.  The manager that let me go ended up getting fired a couple weeks after for stealing.  It could be a  decent place to work if management actually cared about the job and employees.  They now have a great manager.  So wishing the store the best moving forward"
bad,"Working at this company required me to use less of my customer service skills & use the skills they teach whitch is keep a high cpr score which to them is calling the next person before the person in front of you has even put their wallet away. They don’t really encourage u to be polite at all, management was terrible, along with scheduling & communication, nothing i could do for long"
bad,"No future within this company, no room for advancement. Very jealous co-workers and some mangers attitudes are the worlds worse. No customer service/management skills whatsoever."
bad,"Seemed none of the managers knew what they were doing, I was always being called off because of the payroll. The theft at our store was so bad, they couldn't afford to pay their employees, and management did nothing about it. I dealt with transphobic coworkers that management did nothing about. The store was completely disorganised. They weren't able to understand my needs with my stomach problems and always rushed me when I needed to use the restroom or wouldn't let me use the restroom."
bad,"They force you to work under a lot of pressure. There is no courtesy between employees and you have to learn for yourself since there is no type of training. Apart from the salary there is no other benefit and the supervisors have no knowledge of labor laws or human resources. Definitely, it is not a place of work for a professional."
bad,"Honestly, starting out didn't seem to bad. Assigned to one area and was expected to do everything in the store. Managers never came when called for, and also hated it when asked for help. Also expected you to be fast when checking out people like a competition. This store isn't the type that needs to be rushing cashiers when the place can't even stay clean. Definitely would not recommend anybody to work here."
bad,"0 opportunity to move up , low hours , hard to provide through this job . you barely get help , manager has special treatment .The pay is decent but not when you cant even get close to 23 hours a week"
bad,they promise a lot and no follow through. no communication. their trainers dont want to train. you will get really frustrated. i wanted to advance and learn more.
bad,"Management is terrible. Inconsistent and rude. Customers are terrible as well.  Easy to move up within the company however, this means they will promote anyone even without appropriate experience."
bad,Like high school with cliques especially with managers. (they have favorite employees) Never gives promotions to deserving people. Revolving door of new employees. Constantly changing how to do things before even learning how to do it when they changed it the first time. No communication between managers and employees. Only two full time employees are allowed. The rest are only part time and manage to have 8 to 15 hours a week and don't expect benefits.
bad,Horrible place to work. Every time I walked in that place I got a headache. This place lack's in integrity. Most of the employee's are back stabber's and very unprofessional.
bad,"Yet another money-first, people-last corporate juggernaut unwilling to properly staff its stores or train its staff. Skeleton crews get run ragged in an efficiency-oriented environment to squeeze every penny out of the bottom line."
bad,"Unsanitary workplace, low compensation, unrealistic expectations. corporate is not about working with the employees to make a good environment. Expected blood sweat and tears for pennies."
bad,The company does not pay enough for what they expect of the employee. They do not treat their reliable employees with respect. Poor management. I liked the flexibility of the job and the hours were a good fit for me but that's the only good thing I could say about the company.
bad,They give you crazy schedules. And a little hours to work in the week. I work in Customer Service they make you do work for 3 people they make you work to much.
bad,"I still haven't figured out if it is to Rosses credit that they make no pretense of caring or not.  There are a ton of programs that would be great to work with if there was adequate staffing, but you are under constant pressure to cut payroll (if you have someone close or who has hit OT, expect a phone call), the associates are paid minimum wage and often have other jobs which are given higher priority, so call outs and no shows are rampant."
bad,Managers are racist and chooses new ppl with no experience to become manager over some one with experience they just care about them selves and there pay checks
bad,"This place has got to be the most unnecessarily stressful retail jobs I have ever done. As a cashier, they expect you to call up your next customer as soon as you hit the total button (while still processing your current customer's payment). If you aren't able to do that in .05 seconds, you're getting yelled at from across the store in front of everybody in the room. The managers will scold you if you make mistakes, but never praise you when you do your job correctly."
bad,"Very stressful job environment being that good is never good enough. For what you are paid you have a store manager whom makes great salary barking at you all the time about Cashier Performance, greeting every single customer, walking a shortage highway, memorizing the top 5 areasof theft, remembering an entire report and percentage of shrink, and doing paper work every week on store improvement. If you are an area supervisor never depend on leaving on time because it is your job to get the entire store cleaned for the next morning including bathrooms if someone had a blowout. Too much to do and worry about with not enough pay. I could go on and on about the horrible experience I had being employed there"
bad,"Ross Stores, Inc. is very old school.  Management is not open to suggestions.  Too much office politics.  We are expected to just do the job with no questions asked even if it is deviating from standard procedures.  We are also expected to not question any decision.  Too many finger pointing; no one wants to take responsibility for their mistakes."
bad,"Working for Ross was(in my experience) horrible. No hours at all, pay sucked(minimum wage), stay there for a almost a year then I found a better job with way better hours and obviously better pay."
bad,"This job pays minimum wage with no benefits available to their employees, they expect you to work like a dog and fast so they can get you to get everything out to the floor so you will clock out sooner because they don’t want to pay you anymore than they should. The only good thing is the employee discount to the store. I might recommend this job to a teenager but that’s unlikely. Hardly any hours and horrible pay/management"
bad,Extremely exhausting with no room for growth. Micromanaging. Customer were often rude. Hours run extremely late. Very unpleasant experience. Night shifts were the worse.
bad,switched management and it went down hill. store manager makes customers feel small and like idiots and give employees a hard time about MANDATORY breaks. NOTHING IS PRIVELAGED or confidential.
bad,The management at Tulsa hills are horrible a lot of favoritism. They will take days from you to give to someone else. Store manager is almost never there.
bad,"Started as a seasonal employee and was promoted to stock room supervisor within 6 months. "
bad,"Having gain all the Knowledge , I'am able to work  according  to the rules and the best of my ability."
bad,no respect for employees with disabilities. no compassion for the workers and they never send you to break on time even when youre about to pass out and need to take your medication
bad,They dont care about there employees .the supervisor are mean they dont try to help u out all the managers are not good all they care about is there money they are cheep
bad,"Co-workers are great to get along with, but management is not concerned with customer service. Management will do something else, even with a customer waiting, saying ""they can wait."" A good company needs good customer service, disregarding customers and their time is far from good customer service. Constantly short staffed despite constant requests from employees."
bad,Workers are rude. Only worked 3-4 hours. The night supervisor on the strip has a horrible attitude.She never gave us our 30 min break (that your entitled to) even if you are there for more than 6 hours.They rush you to finish to get off the clock.
bad,"Management and staff are nice, but they only schedule you for 1 or 2 days a week for 4 1/2 hours. I don't see the point of starting work at 5:30 in the morning and only being there for 4 hours"
bad,"It's a very stressful work environment. The management there is very one sided and there is a lot of favoritism. The workplace is very fast-paced which I didn't mind, but they really squeeze that $10 an hour out of you any chance they get. I've learned wonderful customer service skills and how to maintain things well on my own without help from others. I enjoyed toward the end of my shift the most because a lot of the time it was my ""calm down"" time , and by that I mean I cleaned my station and was able to leave after putting away returns and etc."
bad,"Store manager blows smoke up employees ""bottoms"", pay and hours are extremely low and the worst you perform the better you are treated. Only pro is the employee discount"
bad,The work is very stressful and too low pay for the amount of work i was doing. The managers also didnt take their positions serious enough and were constantly slacking off.
bad,Ross was a place i thought you can grow but comes to find out its not. The management only cared about themselves they would over work there workers for basically Minimum wage.
bad,"I would only recommend it as a place of employ for a high school student or someone just beginning college. Otherwise, I would not advise anyone who is looking for a career to apply."
bad,"Do not go work at the Ross Store in Draper. The store manager is racist, sexist, liar and has no issue belittling you. No matter how many times you call HR or the hotline they do nothing about it. If you want to be treated poorly this is the store for you!"
bad,It was okay mainly greet customers sometimes cashier also did stock we where always hiring because workers stayed quitting or didn't get hours like that
bad,I have been working here for a while now and honestly hate every second of it. Everyone is required to keep their departent clean 100% and thats hard with so many customers nonstop but call you up to customer service every 10 minutes to ne a cashier ( stay there for over a hour ..while your departent is getting all dirty..and right when you think your done amd can go fix yoir department they call you right up again for something else . Its terrible here only good thing is the discount you get.
bad,"The way this company handles things is absolutely appalling. With as long as I've worked there, the number of times they've changed things and just expected us to somehow *know* without being told is absurd. They promote people who either don't know how to treat others, or don't *do* anything and take credit for work other people have done."
bad,My daily duties consisted of managing all the employees on the cash register making sure that they received all of their breaks on time and that they had what they needed in order to preform their job quickly and efficiently. My duties also included handling customer complaints and ensuring each customer had a pleasant shopping experience.
bad,"Ross only pays minimum wage, and it is so hard to receive a raise.  You never have a set schedule.  Some days you may get off on time other days you may work 12 hours that day."
bad,"low salary, not enough time to learn anything. Management just wants you to stand there and not have fun. It was good to meet new people. co workers were ok. just upset like I was."
bad,Working at Ross was not a pleasant experience for me. If it wasn't for some of the nice co workers I had it would have been even worse. Management had their favorites and chose to pay attention to them over anyone even if others were doing a good job. There was a lot of politics going on. Pay was low especially since we were not allowed to take off for 2 months during the holidays! Not only was I unable to visit my family out of state but I also didn't get paid any extra at all. There was very little work/life balance. I also had school and would sometimes get called while I was IN my classes asking me to come in because someone yet again called out. I also felt like they treated me as a body there to work. I had experience with customers and cashiering but yet I placed in the fitting room 99% of the time. It was very boring back there and they did not care how I felt as long as they had a body there to work.I was told upon hiring that I was going to be at the front end but that rarely happened. And if you want to get off work ON TIME when your shift is over DONT count on it. There were many times where someone didn't show up so I had to stay after and pick up their slack. I could go on and on about how bad it was there. Just do yourself a favor and avoid them at all costs.
bad,"Hours not guarenteed weekly, management not confidential about personal nor work related grievances, raises and advancement come once a year and are not rated fairly."
bad,"It's a good job as a first job. You learn a lot ""skills"" like how to work a register, process transactions, recover a sales floor, etc. After a month of working here, the managers weren't as helpful or nice, they would yell at me for no reason & give me attitude. I could be working my butt off & they would still have something to complain about."
bad,a typical day at work would be helping customers find what they need I learn good customer service. fast environment
bad,No comment on this job. I learned a lot but did not like the way the store was run.
bad,"Terrible company to work for and even worse management, it is nothing but a drama filled store. it is disgusting they don't care about cleanliness. The entire place is very unprofessional I would never work for the company again let alone shop their and support them."
bad,This place has some things to work on. My co workers are great. Management needs to work on communicating with their employees. Overall I like working here.
bad,This store was torn up by the customers daily and there was not enough payroll to keep associates cleaning up all day. Had to stay late at night to put the store back together. There were never enough cashiers regardless how you leveraged payroll and the customers were always irate. D.M. screaming about payroll and had no regard for customers. Saw the D.M. lie to upper management because she was so stressed. So many managers were promised potential promotions if they work harder but they never saw these come to fruition.
bad,"I'm the assistant manager and spend 70-80% of my time cashiering since we never have payroll to have cashiers.  Rest of my time is spent scrambling to try and pencil whip a bunch of checklists and forms that need to be filled out everyday.  I thought it was just my store but I've called around to other stores in the area and it's the same their too, managers all run registers.  If you don't believe me, walk into a Ross some afternoon and look for the store or assistant manager.....9 out of 10 times they will be on a register.  Or better yet just call some store and ask for the assistant or store manager and when they pick up you will hear in the background that they are checking people out.  "
bad,If you don't have anything good to say then keep it to yourself. That was how I was I raised and strive to be.
bad,"This job sucked. The turnover was high so we constantly had new faces in that didn't know how to run the registers, which led to frustrated customers (although they were usually bitter old women to begin with) and the management was usually nowhere to be found when you needed assistance (read: in the back room chilling) . The store manager himself was a complete smug micromanaging tool. "
bad,Always understaffed at the Palm Harbor Store. Learned how much work is involved in retail sales. Management varied depending on who was the manager at the time. Coworkers were helpful. Hardest part of the job was getting hours to work - it's all based on sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 40% off merchandise weekend twice a year. And 20% throughout the year.
bad,No employee can please district level and above and management is expected to pass on this 'value'
bad,"Not a good place to work the company welcome favortism,buddy system and is not consistant in policy and procedure. Company welcome turn over throught it work ethic overall pay is base on goverment guideline $7.25 and ratio on full time and part time support no benefit in health field,sick pay ,vacation for associate.Staff is 80-90% part time.Room for advance is at a stand still,This company is just a job until something better come along which is any other company."
bad,You help customers and clean the store all day long. The management doesn't support their staff or care about the overall morale of their employees. Your co-workers generally dont care about their job performance because no one in management cares to discuss progress or when the employee is doing a good job. There really wasn't anything enjoyable about this job
bad,"Only thing good about working at Ross (CHERRYDALE) was working with my co workers and interacting with the customers they made the day go by quicker. The manager is a liar and only cares about HIS SELF. You work way too hard for little pay. The hours oh man 5 hr shifts and about 20 hrs a week at the most. The managers dont treat you fair its their word or nothing at all. I hated working there and im glad im gone and now have a way better job than that place. I would have to give myself a pep talk before walking in the store SERIOUSLY.! The atmosphere was just unpleasant. Overall i just liked the customers and my co workers i was cool with everybody. I would still be there if the manager and supervisors i had was still there when i first started working there they were the best, I used to love to come to work. Had great hours. Anywho i wouldnt recommend anybody to work there unless they can deal with all the drama and chaos. And i was told that they have gotten real strict since i left. I promise its not worth it."
bad,"It was very difficult, the management is always very busy, and 100 percent of the time customers would wait at least 10 min to pay. The atmosphere at Ross is hard, the building is really old and dirty."
bad,"The job itself is easy, however, Management are irresponsible, for example, they were constantly late in the morning to open the store, sometimes up to an hour late. The co-workers are the same as any other place, some are nice, some are not."
bad,"I not sure if all Hawaii stores are the same as waikiki, I quit there few weeks ago, negative angry fake manager, managers that care more about thim smoking thin our breaks. I tried all hours opening the manger was meanest and gossip she always in the store and everyone was sad when she was there, other managers not care and upper managers not do anything we complain and complain but no one help. store manager yel at me one day only because I not smile at woman who just yel at me about return, after that day I never went back I liked working for ross, but I can not work for bad people, here it harder because of island I tell everyone not to shop at that one ross no locals go der only tourist now cause everyone say how bad managers is"
bad,"When you first meet everyone, they try to sell you the job of course. But once you start, you basically have to fend for yourself. Only visiting managers and maybe one store manager taught me the things I needed to know. And it's crazy because if you don't know (remember they don't teach you) you get in major trouble. Their expectations are ridiculous and want you to work like machines and without breaks sometimes. I worked over a 12 hour shift one day in the warehouse with one other person and we got scolded for not having hundreds of boxes finished by ourselves. Managers left and didn't help. and they ALWAYS ask you to put in more hours and call you in. You could work 9 days in a row with 9 or ten hour shifts and it still isn't enough to them. "
bad,"I've never felt more under valued working for a company. They only call out what they don't like of your actions, I don't ever hear good good job thanks for coming and cover shift after shift."
bad,This company at this particular location treated people based on how management felt about you on a personal level. You had to be in the CLICK. I liked my job but the way that I was treated was not something I felt I deserved so I finally quit after 4 years. Things were not getting better and I hung in there long enough.
bad,Management is the worst! Not fair at all and are extremely fake!! They make promises they cant and wont keep. Lots and lots of favoritism. Steer clear from this place or you will most definitely regret it!
bad,"Upper management is a complete joke, you can ask questions all day and they brush you off and tell you everything is good, and then when their boss is around, all you hear is this isnt right or that you don't know what youre doing. They are fast to throw you under the bus to save their own skin. I'd gladly go back to Walmart over Ross if I thought about going back into retail. You only will get promotions if you're part of the inner circle, performance has nothing to do with it. Prepare to see tons of people hired above you from outside the company"
bad,"Unqualified upper management, store manager is rarely present in the work place. Minimal training before/during/after promotion. Consistently understaffed. Compensation is not adequate for work load of Front End Supervisors. Raises are rare and inconsistent even for long term employees."
bad,Ross Stores New York Buying Office is not diverse.  Management is not fair.  You re more likely to be allowed to work from home or get get promoted and if you share your personal business with management.  Management  worked to sabotage 25+ year career.
bad,"Do not work here stay away!!!! "
bad,"They allow people to walk in and steal putting e everyone at risk for drama due to employees witnessing it. Only allow you to work 25 hrs a week unless your management and then your always at work no balance!!! No good discounts, management sucks!! Messy messy place to work"
bad,"Ross sets you up to fail and when you do they want to blame it on you. There is no development, adequate training or support for new management. My store did really well while I was there but because I took a LOA for family issues I was set up and run off from my position."
bad,"Lack of training, full of gossipers, lack of support."
bad,"Store and Assistant managers are only trying to stick to scheduled hours and even cut them as much as possible to pad their bonuses. They don't care for the customers and they are last in the priority, even above doing  ""manager"" things that can wait ((CUSTOMERS SHOULD COME FIRST!!!))). Schedules are changed last minute and people aren't notified of the cuts or add ons at all. You have to be lucky enough to check your schedule every day and sometimes it's changed when you are off and you don't know until they try and get onto you for being absent or late, when they changed it and didn't tell you to begin with. If you have a problem with upper management and you say something outside them, you will be retaliated against. They will tell you a rule has changed and for you to implement the new one, only for you to find out that it's only been changed for you, because they don't like you and are trying to make your job harder. They will call you out for an infraction in front of customers and ask inappropriate, personal questions. This is not about all Ross stores, just one in particular and it's Store Manager Store 1060 in Conroe, Texas."
bad,"I have worked here for several years and am currently looking for another job.  I and my co-workers have had absolutely enough with this terrible company.  The customers treat you like garbage when you are just following corporate policies and then corporate rewards the customers with gift cards to get them to stop complaining.  Managers get absolutely no pay roll to work with, even during peak season, and customers blame the employees for the mess when there is no one to clean the floor.  If you are considering a job here.....don't."
bad,The management is supposed to set the tone for the entire team. This manager did nothing but show favoritism and nit pick at people they didnt care for
bad,"I worked for the company for 4 1/2 years, it started out great and fun but after a year it sucked and corporate was rude and hateful and didn’t care about you. I started out part time then went to stock room lead then up to area supervisor then assistant manager. You have so much responsibility for little pay."
bad,"Important experience to attain. However, not the right company for me. Advanced rapidly but management was not open to new ideas or more efficient ways of doing things."
bad,"I filed a complaint about the way the new SM speaks to people especially me,  to the DM and to the ZD.  No one reached out and it led to me feeling like this company does not appreciate the 5 years of service I have and I was a great worker.  Because my issues went unresolved,  it led me to resign."
bad,It was awesome at first till the gm didn’t keep her word and they talk bad on all of their employees and the gm will yell at u in front of everyone or she will text you and be very mean and curse you out
bad,Not the best place to work at. Especially lately when we had a miserable mnagment team that are rude to associates Abd the customers as well. I glad I am out of there
bad,I have worked for Ross for over 2 years and stuck it out because I valued my coworkers but the management is unprofessional and angry most of the time and I'm tired of working my butt off to be treated as if I don't matter
bad,I was initially told the job would be about 20 hours a week. But at least once a week since working there a truck has been canceled cutting my hours down. And even after I am asked to stay late by management I feel like I am then penalized by management for staying late. I'm only staying there till i find something better.
bad,This is by far the worst job I've ever had. I never felt like we had enough help and managnet would always be stressed because of corporate. I just made for the worst work environment.
bad,"Very poor management, worked for a manager who gossiped about her employees, was undermining, not to mention insecure. No doubt there are corporate games in every company, but this is by far the worst.  Discrimination, bullying and harrasment part of the culture."
bad,"Where do I start. This is a monster of a company. They carry “Christian” merchandise, maybe they are rumored or claim to be a Christian company? Who knows, they sure don’t act like one. It’s a discount store, so all of there decisions on how they treat their employees are affected by this. Even though they probably are making a stupid amount of money everyday from all this stock they receive almost everyday that isn’t even tracked or under a list of inventory. Yes all of their merchandise is randomly sent in! Trying to answer customers questions about if we have another specific item? Good Luck! It might get sent the next day or never. Anyways, the trucks are not on a set inventory list, so they have no way of knowing how much of one thing to send. You get the picture? Stuff gets overwhelming. You have full cardboard boxes of JUST clothes sitting on the stockroom floor for days, weeks? Or shoes? That’s a big part of money lost right there, and one example of how horribly the whole company is setup. Oh, and don’t forget they have an SPS they just made the job position recently, but they can’t even stop shoplifting. So, there paying a SPS for security that doesn’t secure their own store. There’s just money lost all around, and they usually blame it on employees, and there’s safety meeting over it and yadda yadda. There’s benefits yes, but full time jobs are like urban myths throughout almost every Ross establishment. They put papers up in the break room saying they give all these wonderful benefits, and again I asked my manager about this they said there’s is hardly any full time"
bad,As a manager I feel as if there needs to be more of a standard across all stores. There is supposed to be one but the DM and Corporate allow each store to do things differently. Good store managers are hit and miss I had multiple in my 5 years at Ross. They constantly are cutting payroll then surprised that managers are on the cash registers instead of completing projects. I understand that it is retail but if the customer should come first then you can't expect to have a bare bones crew and get the customers taken care of as well as outside projects that need to be taken care of every week or two.
bad,"I worked for the company for 5 years went thru 5 store managers. I respect the company but there cooperate managers are clueless on how to manage a store. Lets see them work with only 2 cashiers because we cant be in red for labor, and still expect employees to size and recover all depts. store is always a disaster and I would not want to return to be overworked  just for 1 dollar more! but I do miss my co workers its was like a work family there. r"
bad,"manager lied about my job title i was never on schedule they will me saying i missed days they had my email and phones number they would call with an nasty attitude i never was trained very awful this is the ross at 1424 N Expy Ste 148, Griffin, GA 30223"
bad,Ross isnt interested in fostering a good relationship with associates. They would rather fill positions with temporary workers than to keep Ross ones. You should know that you can't plan a career with them.
bad,Everything was great at first...until I transferred locations...I felt like I was back in high school with all the drama...I was promised a raise and promotion when I transferred but after months of being there I realized I was lied to...management was TERRIBLE...not a good place to work AT ALL
bad,"Management is ridiculous and only cares about themselves. Employees are dispensible. Fair pay but not enough which is why its good fit for high school graduates. Expect you to do ALOT for minimum wage and never give any praise or ""good job"""
bad,"Ross is perfect for a high school kid who's parents made them get a job because they will not have to work very often and can basically call out as much as they would like with no penalty. They hire and hire but never seem to have enough hours for their current employees. There were times I would get 1 day/5 hours for the whole week. This company is a joke. If you're looking for a few bucks, this is the job for you! & The discounts are pretty great but that's about it."
bad,Worst management I've ever encountered.. The hours given doesn't make any sense a week and the hiring manager is utterly rude. Do not expect a walk in the park when you go and I can't find a reason to recommend.
bad,If you’re a college student trying to get a job don’t apply here they don’t work with your hours and they tell you that they can’t move forward with your role in the store because of your hours
bad,Do not work here if you want a manager that cares about you and your success in the job. I have NEVER worked anywhere that made me feel so alone and pushed aside than this ross. It is a joke. There was zero contact between employees and management. When I was getting bluntly ignored by management I knew I had enough. 10/10 would never recommend working here.
bad,"Management was terrible, and it was an extremely negative work environment. They didn't care about your schedule outside of work- I was a full time student, and was yelled at for not coming in to work while I had class. I also was yelled at for needing the day off for my roommate's funeral, because ""it was inconvenient"". Leaving was one of the best things I ever did."
bad,"Hired new managers from different companies instead of promoting from within. Part time, on schedule one week and not the other. Very few hours unless it's around the holidays. Management was very difficult to work with. Returned back to school, and managers refused to accommodate my school schedule and fired me for not coming to work even though they never updated my schedule or put me on the schedule. The day after I told them about my new schedule( I was barely on the schedule anyway and was a great employee) the manager purposely put me on schedule for a full week with out me knowing and then said I had several no call no shows, after changing my schedule without me knowing. Called several days in advance and even went in the store to update my schedule personally and Manager refused to accommodate my class schedule which wasn't even a permanent thing( was just for a few weeks) supervisor constantly would come up behind me and accuse me of not knowing what I was doing, or picking, (I was there for nearly 7 months and never missed any days.) Very childish low life management. Not worth the time of day or head aches"
bad,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. The rule sent down by corporate have unrealistic expectations for its employees and set the managers up to fail for the most part. Turn over is high.
bad,"If you want a good job i'd suggest looking some where else. I worked at Ross for 8 months and the only thing I got was yelled at by the store manager. You can complain about him to HR but he'll only find out you did and fire you for some poor reason like a punk. I worked there for 8 months was told i could get a raise after 6 never got a raise. And half the time if you brought it up he'd tell you to go away or bring it up at a later date. Not to mention he didn't want any money to come from  his bonus so he'd under staff the store for two months and get mad because he'd go in and it would be a mess. If you want to work at Ross for the co workers then it might be worth it, but everything else is absolute garbage. Layton, UT Ross would have been so much better if they didn't have the store manager they have right now. he doesn't care about his employees, just his pay checks. I do not recommend working at a Ross in general. Not to mention he never worked the weekend, and only showed up three days a week but complained about how HIS work wasn't finished because he'd leave it to the assistant store manager, who was expected to do everything for him."
bad,They offer flexible hours to there employees. Sometimes the managers get very angry when an employee can't work certain hours but the company is known for there flexible hours. The company has very high expectations that are impossible to meet sometimes. Management needs major improving. Over all not such a bad company to work for but needs revamping in a lot of areas.
bad,The company seemed like they had promising values and even the manager had a good story about how well she ran the store. I found out in my first week from every single employee that the manager was disrespectful and mental. The manager would change our schedules for the next day regularly the evening before and not ask and/or tell us and then get after us for showing up at the wrong time. The manager also would bully us into staying late or coming in and if you told her no she would want a reason and then whatever reason you had she’d tell you she didn’t accept it as an excuse. She also didn’t track hours correctly or fix punch errors either (the system would always be messing up) so my hours would just disappear from my paycheck. Worst management I’ve ever dealt with and I’ve been a manager myself so I know things can get crazy but there is no excuse for how terribly she treated myself and my co-workers.
bad,"Doesnt value their employees , we dont get to have a life outside of work no set shifts & hard to get a second job because of the inconsistent hours. Bad payroll always giving the employees time off when they cant afford payroll, working us like a dog ! management does not care if we have an issue with anything either deal with it or leave. Too much favortism as well. High turnover job people are always quitting and someone else gets hired within a week.Wouldnt recommend working at Ross unless youre willing to put up with anything."
bad,The worst job ever. I worked here for 2/3 years always promised promotions that were never gave. Had to do more work than I was hired to. Management would leave you with a line of 30+ while taking personal calls and they never answer back on headsets and then get mad when you call stock room cashiers for help. I've been forced to stay to help closing (would lock me in and only managers have keys to open doors.) I've also been threaten by customers while management and security were two feet next to me and they did nothing to protect me. I could go on but if this doesn't help you then I wish you all the luck.
bad,"Anytime they raise the starting pay at ROSS they always raise the ""goal"" of production or goals as a cashier. Everything is timed. Including the cashier's. Customer service suffers because of that as well. It's a fear based company. I do not recommend it for anyone."
bad,A typical day a Ross in waukesha is you clocking in and complete your work while rush to comple your job.The best part about this job is being able to clock out.
bad,"some Managers support bad behavior of some associates such as gossip and bully against people they don’t like beside these unethical issues they reward  these associates with favors for they behavior, creating a toxic environment for the rest of the associates and to make things worst you can heard them (managers and bad associates), laughing and gossiping about this behavior on the aisles of the store"
bad,The company has no value for their associates.They push their associates to the fullest. Expect them to complete so many task within a small amount as well as being on register and not enough time to work on their task.
bad,"it not a bad place . its just unclear direction from upper management. "
bad,"It’s a great place to start, if you have no prior work experience. However it’s hard ro keep up with the expectations they have comparing to the hours ans the benefits they provide."
bad,"No work/life balance. Favoritism.  Management are not flexible.  They hav free lunch for high performers.  Company es not flexible on peak season, even if there is an emergency"
bad,District manager does not support store managers. District manager always refers store manager to another store manager when help is needed. District manager is lazy!
bad,"Leadership never follow the state or federal rules unless it is absolutely needed. This in not a Veteran friendly location, they offer no discounts but the do for seniors on Tuesdays only."
bad,"Allowed me to learn to quickly punch the key pad for inputting code. Can now punch code without looking most of the time. "
bad,Everything is timed and on top of that not even long time workers know how to do things correctly. Everyone is scared of management and no other retailer I've worked for was as strict as Ross.  You make one mistake or someone didn't teach you correctly? Too bad you're getting written up for it. Cant even correctly time lunches because of the systems but yet you're always to blame for time. I signed up for part- time hours because of my transportation problems but yet I was working 40+ hours a week! You never leave on time and if someone who is favored leaves a mess for you guess what? you have to clean up after them.
bad,Management listens to much to the he said she said drama.  Spent all their time in the office and when needed they take 5 to 10 minutes to get to you. Over all the only good thing is their 20% discount and every 6 months a 40% .
bad,"Store Managers are overworked - not paid overtime for working 50-60 hours a week. Do not receive the necessary support to be successful. SMs are held accountable for poor training and resources, along with hiring for  all positions within the store - without any support from company recruiters."
bad,"Poor management, lack and inconsistency of hours and any kind of benefits for part time employees. "
bad,"In my experience with Ross you are extremely disposable. Calling out sick will get your hours reduced for the next few weeks, and you will be provided with additional work. For example if you are scheduled in the Fitting Room you will then be brought stock to run, mark downs will be your responsibility now, while answering the phone when it rings, and maintaining bathroom cleanliness, and being there for every customer that wants to use the fitting room. At the same time. Ross has an extremely high turnover, and hires constantly. Most associates get 15 hours a week or less."
bad,"Management need to treat employee better. Starting pay should improve. More shirt and dress. More hour and advancements. Paid lunches, paid vacation, pay sick day"
bad,You have to move quickly to make production and the better your production the better your check will be. They start you off at $9.00 which is impossible to live on
bad,"Ross is based on a ""on standard time"" system  You are timed on everything you do.  In order to get their ""bonus"" you practically have to kill yourself.  You can't work at moderate pace or you get ""coached"".  This leads to many employees trying to steal work from each other  And when overtime is required it isn't fair how management isn't held to the same standard meaning they don't have to come on a saturday while all other employees do or risk my being fired."
bad,"vary unprofessional , the store manager is rude to the associates and think that she is better than everyone else.  store manager also talks to associates like they are children."
bad,Ross was very discriminatory and did not want the best for their employees. I was hurt on the job by a clothing tag and needed medical attention. The manager on duty tried to force me to work when I could not use my foot that was injured by the clothing tag.
bad,"Ross Warehouse is worse place to work you only get one 30 minute break for working 9/10 hours a day. You have to work very fast paced to earn production, very low pay for the work your doing and the communication within the company sucks. Ross is just a job to work to pay bills until your able to find something else i would not look into making a career.."
bad,It’s good please for work as apart time but they don’t give more than 15 hours in week  and the mangers it good they heloyou for trening they call you some time for more hours and l don’t know and also they give the employees discount cards  you can use it if you buy something from the store
bad,"In my experience the employees are fun and decent workers."
bad,"Low wages, very fake regional managers. Would compliment you on site visits then nick you on their store reports for the randomest items. Bad store reviews meant bad raises. Once they actually gave me 10cents and told me I was lucky, as others had gotten less."
bad,"Nothing good came out of it, it was a bad work place.  Management wasn't very good at there job. I wouldn't ever recommend to ever have any one work at a Ross"
bad,If you want hours and descent pay than don't work here because you won't get it
bad,A strenuous and overall undesirable/underpaid job for those who like to overwork and get paid little for it. I recommend a job where you the associate would be valued more by a manager/supervisor.
bad,i had this job in college an it was very one sided an poorly managed. Management only acted when someone higher than them was coming for a visit. They didn't care about their associates at all.
bad,"Management is rude and not helpful at all. Being a manager there, most employees felt like they could only talk to me when there became a new store manager since the new store manager was too rude to talk to. Most employees always felt mistreated by some managers and did not like working there. The job (and any job there) was beyond stressful and not worth the pay. I was underpaid for a manager with all the things I personally had to deal with."
bad,its a good place to work if your not intending on staying long and they don't care if you have a home life so if you have kids they don't care. Everyone is constantly stressed and Rosses expectations from management is in reachable and in reasonable.
bad,"Why are we locking up fake jewelry when everything in the store is at a discounted price?  It shouldn't take the manager an extra 40 minutes to close the store because they wanna know what's happening on Love and Hip Hop.  The store closes at 10pm, we should be out in 30 minutes, not leaving out at 11:15pm."
bad,"ross is not that great to work for there is no room to develop nor is the management team eager to help the development of there associates. the hardest part of the job would have to be getting large projects done in the grace period,. I love to help the team in daily activities and love all our customers."
bad,"Really bad company,bad management and really bad pay ,I tried giving it time just not the company for me .but if you survive here u can work anywhere ."
bad,"Not a good place to have a career most of them are closing so don't expect a huge career path, the management is a mess nobody's knows what happening."
bad,Typical day to day work consists of picking up half empty Starbucks cups. I would constantly see people tossing clothing over or under racks. Others would try to switch tags or demand discounts for a loose thread on a shirt. I know that the store is more or less a thrift store but at least have some common courtesy. The store manager at the time had a abrasive personality. Causing them to not get along well with any of the other employees. Apply at your own risk.
bad,"I worked part time busting my butt and working 6 days a week, honestly not worth the pay. And when I asked to have a second day off during the week, they just about had a tantrum. They expect you to finish everybody else's work on top of your own, I'm all for working as a team, but this place was ridiculous. I worked the night shift, and the main supervisor in charge treated everybody like dogs. Yelling at them when they did a small thing incorrectly and never recognizes the great work you do. I honestly tried to just go to work and mind my own business, but there was so much unnecessary drama I quit after my first two weeks. Worst job I ever had."
bad,"No management skills at all in the warehouse I worked. Horrifying experience with co workers."
bad,Poor management policy. Not enough hours. You have to be a favorite to be happy. The manager May beg you to come in and an hour later when you get there they say you are not needed now so you can go home or if your socks do not match the dress code you may be sent home too.
bad,"HR doesn't care about any complaints, the managers use pity and threaten you with losing hours to force you to work. You are expected to work as if you love you're job even if you are treated horribly. The only real upside are your coworkers."
bad,"Hard to move up in the company. Hours are great; in at 6:30am out by 3:30pm. Supervisors are great to work with. Stressful, Challenging, rewarding."
bad,not much hours it very rare for u to ever grow in the company. Always expecting everything to get done they send you to do three or five other things.Never care about u its about ross not the employees. I am a hard worker work for 3 yrs no raise or promotion. For example someone that only had a 1 or 2 month with no experience became manager well I was stuck still training
bad,"Cashier helping customers customer assisance "
bad,"The job offered in the interview was definitely not the job I was given.  It took 3 months to get all my access and computer.  Also, every 2 weeks I had to locate my payroll check because they never processed my direct deposit and never told me what store it would be delivered to.  I had to go out of my way to find it then drive while off the clock and waste my gas to pick up my check.  Lack of communication and consideration are a strong suite in this company. "
bad,"Co workers are great people, Management are not great communicators.and working conditions are poor for regular associates,"
bad,Go In and price thing and put on shelfs.and to many in one room.and when you said something about someones odor the get mad at you
bad,I think part of my soul died every day I worked there. Management is aweful! Scheduling was constantly messed up and the pay is terrible as well.
bad,"Culture needs help, low pay, and very little training for associates. You are not adequately trained, your schedules are not reliable, your pay is low, and the culture involves a lot of gossip."
bad,"Long story short, They picked favorites, didn't recognize hard work, and was laid off for no reason. PLus, the pay was horrible and no hours. The only thing i liked about working here was the discount."
bad,Turn around in management during the course of my employment decreased tremendously. No security for employees at night time or during the busy seasons.
bad,Ross is probably a good company but the group in Fort Mill is sourced from very small towns and are small minded. No diversity.
bad,Ross was an interesting company to work for. I worked there for a total of 7 months. I enjoyed the customer interaction and my co workers.
bad,Open/close store while ensuring that I did my job in a fun environment. I learned how to be an effective manager while training/coaching all associates. The hardest part of the job was there was no organization and limited communication. I enjoyed my associates.
bad,This company does not pay well. I have done all positions. They treat their employee's horrible. Mo life work balance. No perks. Bonus is 750 a year for supervisors. Waste of 3 years.
bad,"Could be better, could be worse."
bad,"I don't like working at Ross because the managers don't care about you and you do twice as work and minimum pay. I'm looking for another job. They just make you work your but off,  and you have to remind them about giving your brakes. Definitely would not recommend to a friend."
bad,"manger didnt care for anything but herself, had to work a job that pays more a lot and they never paid me for the job i was doing"
bad,"It is a fun place to work. the only drawback is that it is not the field i am interested in and as for advancement there is a lot of decsrimination among the management and some workers. Advancement is kind of none existent"
bad,"I worked for this company for almost three years and it was one of the worst jobs ever! They start you at minimum no matter how much experience you have and after a year you'll get less then 20cents raise each year your there. I worked in the customer service desk and you have to do everything from check out, returns, sizing, recovering, putting back go backs, cleaning up nubs, censors, and hangers, markdowns, putting out jewelry/sunglasses/perfume and reticking/pricing, repacking torn underwear packages,socks, and other stuff. By the end of your shift your still doing these things and will NEVER go home less then 1hr after your shift because management will provide you with no help no matter if your drowning with put backs. They will make you take a 15 after only working for 1hr just to get it out the way or make you take a lunch after 3hrs on a 8hr shift and leave you starving the rest of the day. Someone is also always calling out or getting fired so the employees that do show up are overworked and asked to do EVERYTHING. Management are always worried about getting audited,the secret shopper, district popping up, and how fast your timing is at checkout that they create a more stress environment on top of an already stressful job. And they time you on how fast the customer gives you their payment, and have other unfair evaluations of speed. It takes years before your promoted and youll be lucky if it comes with a raise."
bad,Not a good place to work. Management was uncooperative. Wages were low and hours were constantly changes. 
bad,working at ross is great for someone just starting out. you work with great people and the customer are awsome. its not to much room for advancement its tough to break through
bad,"If you like working in fear for your job on a daily basis and being lied to daily, this is the place for you."
bad,"Checked in with management and reviewed safety and security concerns from the previous day. Maintaining a commanding presence and engaged customers. Supervised associates on spotting theft indicators, fraud returns and purchases. Trained new associates on how to participate in the companies loss prevention program. Recorded and documented all safety and security concerns. Learned great communication skills written and verbal in this environmental. Management lacked education and experience. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management and their lack of effort to schedule their staff efficiently and correctly. The most enjoyable part the job was interacting with and making a difference in the community by preventing and stopping theft."
bad,"A typical day consits of unloading merchandise from truck, proocessing goods to company standard, and stocking shelves. Management is shorhanded so duties get handed down to those who have little to no experience. Co-workers have good morale as long as tasks get done properly. hardest part of the job is dealing dealing with the unprofessionalism. The most enjoyable part of job is our customers."
bad,"Start the day at 8am and leave the office at 8pm, with NO breaks. You are expected to work like a robot, with no personality. They only care about the bottom line $, not their employees."
bad,the circus was in town evryday i had to go to work. i was part of management. but with the store manager or should i say conductor around it is hard to do your job. she always favored people who did her dirty work for her. she had work relationships with half the store. and did favors for people who called in several times a week. i have never worked with a circus conductor before then. and they even brought in a new manager who gave me my review high as a kite. talk about low and unprofessional. the hardest part working there was reporting all the idiots and trying to report the leakiest person of all who was promoted to conductor who also had relationships with half the store. i did enjoy interviewing and hiring honest people for a change and reporting to human resources when needed. well at least i left the circus because it was never leaving town.
bad,No real hours unless it's Christmas and no advancement unless you go through a bunch of hurdles and become supervisor which isn't with any major perks other than full time hours
bad,Kept scheduling what was not on my availability. Seems like a lot of family members were working together. Which intimidated some employees while working
bad,"I was a FES. Work part time it was okay. No one listens, it’s a gossip infested job. People are stealing everyday and they expect you to keep an eye out on thieves. My break is often late or I have to sacrifice taking one to help work th floor:Management was trash, they never helped clean up, always stayed hours after closing, too must expectations for so little pay, they always scheduled me out side of my availability. They refuse to follow company policy and always give the customers what they want even when I’m following proper instructions."
bad,"I do not like this job because were I worked they not explain or do training well,they didn't let me finish the rest of the videos or quiz that I needed to do to learn about the store and what they do and what I needed to learn."
bad,"Over worked under paid "
bad,"Working for Ross is not for everyone. Very fast paced. Ross is the only job I have ever worked for that allows an extreme high volume of call outs among associates. When you constantly have associates calling out, it hurts management because we can't get anything done in our own departments. When the associates do come to work, they are lazy and incompetent. Other members of management come off as fake, being that they will smile and talk to you about any and everything, but then talk down on you behind your back. I feel like the store manager rewards bad behavior. Why would you constantly bring food for a group of people who refuse to work and talk about how much they hate their job? They eat more than they work. Customers are rude and self entitled. I hate that Ross will let customers return used body shape wear because they are very smelly and I dread touching used under garments. The only thing I like about working for Ross is when it's time to go home."
bad,"The culture of Ross is brown nose.... Always watch your back because someone will lie to you and throw you under the bus with a quickness, especially management to their supervisors."
bad,"I set down an absolute max of 20 hrs a week in the interview as I'm in college and was working on some class projects. For the first two weeks, this is how it was, but then they were regularly scheduling me for nearly 30 hrs and I had to call in one day just so I could catch up with a project as I simply didn't have the time to finish it if I worked that day. Ross mgmt will happily overwork you and won't give it a second thought. Other employees were saying they were working full shifts 7 days a week."
bad,All the company cares about is making money. The work environment is toxic and as long as you are making good numbers the company does not care what is going on within. The company pays as little as possible and runs on a skeleton crew at all times that is the hardest part of working for Ross. Building and employees are not safe for as late as they stay open and does not give you tools or resources to help you in case of emergencies. They let management treat you disrespectfully and does nothing but promote them further up the ladder. The most enjoyable part of the job is the regular associates that you get to work for.
bad,"Let me start with at one time Ross was actually requesting reviews be posted from their associates and had made in store marketing materials for the break room, if that is not a red flag, I don’t know what is. The reason there are constant store manager positions being posted is due to the turn and burn style of Ross. I understand that Ross is off price retail, however there is little to no support for store managers. DM’s and ALPM’s turn in to bus drivers and only care when they become aware of corporate visits in their areas. They will cover a quarters worth of information on a conference call on a Monday and expect you to nail the corporate visit Tuesday. Instead of developing the team, they try to cram everything they should of been teaching you into a call. Even though you turn in a business focus plan weekly, the district manager and ALPM have never provided direct feedback, then act flabbergasted during a corporate visit with the items on the business focus plan that you have been sending them religiously with NO FEEDBACK. Definite favoritism across the organization at all levels. Store Managers are glorified fitting room attendants, cashiers, salesfloor associates, and maintenance. Senior and field leadership will tell you that you should be managing and not be doing these positions, however the payroll model for the stores does not allow for this. The stores are open extreme hours with as little as four key holders (when fully staffed). That does not account for when your hourly managers quit with no notice and you are stuck trying to figure out how to cover the store."
bad,"Working at Ross isn't great, honestly it's terrible. After a group interview of ten you should really consider walking away. I didn't but I regret taking the job. I work graveyard shift and my social life is suffering. We have to wait till the end of the week before knowing our schedule. If you aren't scheduled on the day it's posted good luck not missing a day. Work somewhere else. Trust me. Look elsewhere"
bad,"Certain clothing is easier to tag, and if you are white or black you probably won't ever see much of the gravy work. Took me 26 header tickets to tag 1700 pcs. Another Hispanic girl did double what I did 3400 but she had only 6  header tickets. I did far more writing than clicking."
bad,"The work load is over the top , the most enjoyable was customer ,the management team do not take the time to make sure you no your job.you are train by your fellow associates go to Walmart .They watch there works more then the customers ,that are stealing ever day ,and you can not say anything to the customers , unless five a day not a good company to work for."
bad,"I worked at Ross for over a year and I quit because we had a manager who would add more work to our busy shifts than needed, also favoritism was always shown, someone who slacked off was always being put before those who actually worked hard, made cool friends some what freedom while working, rude clientele just because it’s ross"
bad,This place is very disorganized & have really  unprofessional managers. They don't respect there employees at all. They set you up to fail with little training.
bad,"Very poorly managed. These managers were pretty much given their positions due to the lack of not having anyone else to fill the positions other than the existing employees.  One was constantly moody, one always talked down the the employees, and one was very rude, like everyone should cater to her. There was only one decent manager there. There was absolutely no help. (I could never do my actual job). They may have been able retain employees if the management wasn't so bad."
bad,"An uncoordinated company that does not care about its employees. I tell people to avoid working here if they can. The management is terrible at communicating and the training is lacking; I had to teach myself most things, which is awful because everyone did everything differently. I guess it’s not that big of a deal to the leadership, as long as the company keeps making a profit."
bad,Very unorganized and unprofessional. Hated the culture. Felt like I was getting picked on. And the manager tried making a pass at my wife. Not efficient work place.
bad,"they only give you a 30 min break out of the 8 hours. You are working and moving all day long, You must have on the correct footwear if not your feet will hurt"
bad,They don't  care for the ppl employees  They only care about revenues  and the way they rate YOU is as low as possible  lowshitBeen there 4 yrs and less than 40centd I gotwhich is all about money
bad,"Way to much overtime, hard work and little pay. They have no concept of an outside life.  Occurrences Are to easy to get and hard to work off. Only one 30 minute break"
bad,The assistant manager and one of the team leads were awful. Very bipolar. Would get mad about everything. No overtime for anyone. Most hours given were for management and even that was 33 hours a week.
bad,"I didn’t like the job , the customers were horrible and management being worse made this job intolerable. The discounts were nice especially the 40% a couple times a year."
bad,They do not want to pay insurance I guess. Every summer they hire a new crowd and want everyone to work once a week. Sometimes they won't even put you on schedule saying they over payroll but they get there 32 hours while we get 0-10 a week
bad,"I worked at Ross on Cottman Ave for Three years.  I was miserable there.  My hiring manager left and it went down hill from there. The only reason I recieved the one raised was because the minimum wage went up. Breaks are fast, if you arent back exactly at the time you're supposed to be, you'll hear co workers screaming your name over loud speaker. Management at the time were unfair.  I would sometimes be scheduled for only 4 hours a week but people who would just be hired, would be scheduled 40 hours plus.  Seniority meant nothing to management. Certain managers were also very, very unprofessional. Store is very fast paced. Lines are really long most times. The store would be a mess everyday, Clothes, towels and toys everywhere. They had no janitor, so the restroom, which the workers shared with the public,  was almost, always nasty. Puddles of urine on the floor and smeared feces on the walls and toilet. It was horrific!"
bad,"as a manager, your work schedule sucks, And be careful complaining, because the district manager will come to you and ensure to make you seem like YOU are the problem."
bad,It’s not a place I’d recommend for anyone. The customers are awful most of the time. The company doesn’t provide enough associates in the store to maintain it. Hence the motto. They are constantly short in payroll. No matter what time of the year. All their stores close more late than whatever store is in the plaza like 12:30 to 1am on weekdays. They encourage you to share concerns but absolutely will not do anything. It truly is the most selfish company I’ve known. The managements varies with each person but even as a manager you are taken advantage of and transferred less than a days notice.
bad,"I worked there only for a few weeks because they're computers had some kind of problem and kicked a bunch of people out of the system, taking away hours scheduled, access codes, and discount codes from all affected. I waited weeks to be put back in but they never fixed it. Before that still the management to very weird. They were nice but everything was up in the air and TBD all the time. I was never sure of anything until the moment it was relevant so I couldn't prepare for anything."
bad,i liked it in the beginning and hated it after 8 months. i loved working stock but there were completely unrealistic expectations on how fast we were supposed to get daily trucks finished and stock leads would lose their jobs over it when they would send 200+ boxes in a truck. the sales floor was fast paced and could be fun but the level of theft they let people get away with was rediculous and they often blamed staff even though we werent alloud to do anything about it but stand by the theif. in the beginning i loved my manager but she was replaced and managemnet quickly turned into a nightmare. when store managers are friends with people in HR it becomes messy for every other employee.
bad,"You do not get paid for the amount of work load and expectation that you are expected to meet daily. You get water and they expect fire, They do not set you up for success in any way."
bad,"I did customer service at Ross, "
bad,People at Ross that's on the production floor work very hard to keep their jobs.  Ross do encourage promotion from within first and objectively. People working at  Ross are awesome from various backgrounds.
bad,The company has unrealistic standards for their associates. My manager has a great work ethic but has completely destroyed morale. One day they tell you you've done a great job and the next that you're not working hard enough when the associates are working as hard as they do everyday. Not enough hours. Never enough payroll.
bad,"My days at Ross were always stressful, constantly having to clean up after people and got pushed around into doing things that weren't"
bad,"Work wasx Fast paced and competitive. I learned ghow to do my jobs quickly and was one of the best employees on my team. Everyday the managers of store would do a speech about how all temp employees would be fired if not productive at the end of temp season, and how everyone has to follow the impossible company standards. I was let go as temporary since they put me in so many hours I got overtime and because I was too expensive I got let go."
bad,"I worked are the Ross in Del Rio TX for about 3 months, at first it seemed promising but I quickly realized why everyone was understaffed and grumpy. The paycheck is a joke. The management is very nice but she was basically tossed in there and expected to keep it afloat, the coworkers are all older women competing for hours with each other waiting out retirement. The hours they expect you to work are no less than 7, NEVER more than 18 A WEEK! How someone is expected to make a decent living off that, I have no idea. I would show up for work, walk to the computer to clock in and realize that they took me off the schedule and failed to call me. this happened at least 5 times during my stay and was unacceptable. the hours are open like a bar, 1am??? "
bad,The whole hiring process was a joke. I ended up being hired as an fes and still got minimum wage. No real training ever happened you just got thrownin
bad,"If you need as part time job, this is the place. Some of the managers are RUDE, don't care about your life. "
bad,"The Allocation Department at Ross is fast-paced and productive but stuck in old habits. It offers a classic corporate work environment. "
bad,"I like the job, was easy but didn’t like the fact when I took a leave of absence which I had been doing for 4years considering I was only partime, came back to No job."
bad,From my first day I knew i made a huge mistake. Everybody was so rude and very unhelpful.The management treats you like child. They do not want to change there processes like newer companies are doing which untimely is costing them money. Horrible experience. STAY AWAY.
bad,A typical day at Ross is having very rude customers and having a lot of patients to deal with them. working at Ross for 5 an half years we gone threw 6 different managers with different work ethics. the only reason why i stayed that long was they worked with my availability.
bad,"In a general week most people averaged around 5 to 10 hours of work.  No online way to check your hours so you'd have to come into work twice a week once to work and once to check next weeks hours.  When I was let go the Manager didn't say anything to me, just removed me from the schedule."
bad,I like work  and shopping there but Wages very low and much work. Not a great place to work or building a career. Benefits before was ok but not now. Most people work only part time and so don't have any benefits.Maybe just as temporary job..
bad,"Never have I had such an awful experience with an employer.  Human resources there is a joke.  It's pretty pathetic when you approach a member of HR Management about an issue with a superior and they basically tell you to hash it out with the person you have an issue with.  If I wanted to do that, why would I have gone to HR in the first place?"
bad,Management takes frequent smoke breaks in groups.  Some employees work hard to be included during the smoke break and bash other people to make themselves look better.  New employees are scared off by rude managers so turnover is high.  Employee atmosphere is really bad at this store because everyone is trying to put someone else down.
bad,"Micromanagement in all levels, there is always wrong with your doing. Little to nothing advancement or salary increase. Powertrip all the way, managers think they rule your life. It would be better not to work there."
bad,"There flexible, but if you ask for time off they get mad and cut your hours. If your going to school they try to get you to work more than you can.  I hardly ever work. I told them I was in school , and could work two days a week and they only give me one day for like 4 hours"
bad,"The store managers are not the best. Many people have had a lot of issues with the store managers. If management was better, it may be a better place to work. They are constantly hiring new people and cutting hours from their long term employees."
bad,They don't schedule enough people in one night to do all the work that needs to be done. The scheduling is all messed up where one person will only get 8 hours a week. The pick favorites and some managers are not professional at all. I learned you have to figure everything out on your own. The hardest part about the job is having to do so much in just a little amount of time. Most enjoyable is helping a customer out and them happy about their visit.
bad,Receiving/unloading trucks early in the morning and not being able to go home until job was done. Sometimes you'd get to work at 5 a.m. and not go home until 6-p.m.
bad,The only thing that the store manager cares about is herself and this hurts the store. Workers are treated unprofessionaly on a daily basis while managers are never proud of their work. Best thing about this place is the pay.
bad,Very inconsistent and unstable high expectations for low pay as a supervisor you can't even do your job duties because picking up slack in other areas...payroll is always getting cut leading to lack of employees on floor angry customers cursing you out because of Ross lack of needs in high volume stores it's ridiculous worst store I've ever worked in been in management 15 plus years it's a fricking discount store people not Macys...just saying
bad,"There a difficult access to a manager, nothing management, any consideration for your rest (never) six or 7 hours before have your (30min.) lanch, sometimes, after 2 hours they send you to lanch but after that you have more 7 hours to be stand up! Horrible! You get overwhelmed all the time! At fitting room it's worse, you need: clean the bathrooms, answer the phone, open the bathroom, count the garments when costumer go try, and come back, processed those clothes in the appropriate place and in the end of the evening (2 o'clock of the morning put in the right place in the store! Super stressful, some times they live in the fitting room a employee who have no experience, for put you in the register, and when you come back, there's clothes all the place! Mess all around! I'm taking anti ansiolíticos prescription by my doctor!!!"
bad,"Yes it is a retail store, but with what the employees have to deal with is nonsense. They do no offer benefits and are always cutting hours. With as many stores there is in the United States they should be able to pay their employees better. Teach management how to respect employees. They are not robots!"
bad,"As an  an ASM you are responsible for every metric in the store, There is so much pressure on you to achieve all these goals while SM is the one being compensated for your work. As a SM this is a great position because you do nothing but apply all pressure on your ASM to plan and obtain and achieve goals."
bad,"It sucks!!!! Management is a joke, they dont listen to you, they are ruthless,and dont focus on bettering the store, its just a drama infested place. I would advise everyone to make this your last choice for employment."
bad,"Benefits not good ,employees not so helpful, pays is okay if you are working at normal paiste ."
bad,"When I first started here, I loved it because we had a great group of employees and managers, in the year and a half I have been here, most of the managers and employees have left and been replaced with incompetent people. The managers do not train their new employees and so the few of us who have been there a while are expected to do all the work for everyone without so much as a thank you. Ross is not a terrible company, but the location in Waterford Lakes is."
bad,"The management seems to have trouble understanding time management - in the month I'be been there, I have had issues with my avaliability being ignored 3 times...and this is availability I gave before accepting the job. Some of the more seasoned co-workers treat new workers like dirt, unless you treat them like your superiors"
bad,"A typical day at work would be opening the truck to unload then open  the boxes and placing them in the hummer carts. What i learned was that you can talk and work at the same time, as longest thing are getting done. The management when I first started working there was good then as time went by then management started to get out of hand and started having their favorites. My co-worker were a great team helped out and if i had a question they would answer.The hardest part of the job was when the holiday trucks came because we had to manage to process everything by the same day. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing when the holidays were coming."
bad,good place if in serious need of a job but horrible working conditions especially if in stock team. Also pay is minimum for what they expect you to do
bad,"Not at liberty to say at this time being that I still am employed there. Ross Dress For Less is not what I expected when I was first looking for employment and I felt that the Job was under sold as to what my duties would actually be,"
bad,This job is great for students because you get very little hours 4 to 12 a week with tons of part timers. The company works the heck out of you for minimum wage wouldnt recommend this job unless you were up for the very few hours or absolutely needed a job
bad,The store was always busy and management was ok.  They were not giving me enough hours basically that's why I left.  It was fine because I was in college at the time.
bad,It's irrelevant. I none feel comfortable sharing my feeling towards Ross. I know it will be held against me. Why is this necessary?
bad,"Lack of leadership"
bad,"My experience working at ross was very nice and fun , seeing and meeting new people day and helping assisting customer with anything. the most part I loved about working at ross was knowing the customer left feeling good."
bad,It has been great getting to meet all of the people working there; for the most part everyone works well together. There are a lot of conflicts in management which make communication very difficult.
bad,"The managers are all rude, the store is filthy all the time and always smells so. There is so much drama amongst the coworkers if feels more like middle school than work. They don't drug test so you get to work with some pretty shady people. The managers only care about themselves and getting bonuses for themselves based off of the work ""the little people"" do. The whole place is a joke ."
bad,"Worked there for 2 years and never missed a day. "
bad,Its too much work there. Not enough pay. they do not work with your hours.
bad,"* cashier, customer service, stocking, recovery, and clean up "
bad,"Picked up clothes off the floor"
bad,"managers acting like kids, being petty and gossiping"
bad,I also had issues with management at this job. Pay was horrible! Never had a set schedule here as well.
bad,they make you work your butt off just for a $100 every two weeks. they dont give you hours when you ask for it.
bad,A typical day at work would involve a lot of stress . The managers did a poor job of communicating with everyone. My co workers were nice everyone just did whatever they thought they should do. the hardest part of the job was leaving when i was supposed to . There was not any enjoyable par of the job
bad,"to much work little pay they require a lot from and not flexible with"
bad,While working in stock room something made me break out to the point i was sent home early. Later that week the stock room manager informed me that the store manager said i was to be without a job because i was needed nowhere else if i could not work in the stock room.
bad,"Management then, sucked but dont know it is now. Customers bad kids break items everyday and suppose to pay"
bad,"Its a job, But the pay was not competitive and the management was horrible"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and co-workers.
bad,Not a good place to work. Management does not back employees.
bad,"It is a traditional retail environment. The expectation that you live to work is alive and well at this company, especially at the higher levels within the organization. The company takes the discount retailer to heart and you are treated that way. Are there opportunities? Yes, but are you willing to sell your soul and dumb your self down to be successful? Those are 2 questions I would answer, before taking a job here."
bad,"Store managers are obtuse brown-nosers, the company itself is all about the bottom line. It cares little ablaut its customers and less about its employees. All stores are under staffed with overworked minimum wage employees, corporate always on managers to cut payroll, and customer service pays the price. Customers will put up with anything if the prices are low."
bad,"Horrible management from the top down and I was a manager. Every employee is a measured process. They would schedule employees to work until 11 PM and require them to stay until the store was recovered, typically 1 am sometimes 230 am. That left many of the employees with out rides. They would not let you leave the building for you 15 min break unless you smoked. Old school managers rule by intimidation. Glad to see (; Maxx taking over market share."
bad,Can be a very stressing work environment. Associates can be hard to work with. Customers tend to give negative attitude to associate. Merchandiser position is the most stressful pressuring position at ross. Not everyone can handle stock. Im very good with handling stress and pressure but if you cant this is not the job for you.
bad,"No room for advancement. Sometimes they don't pay you for your hours, and you have to fight with them. Management is really bad, and I once reported a creepy guy. They gave the creepy guy a manager position."
bad,The management is horrible at any Ross  most of the managers have bad attitude they think they own the stores they treat the sale associates  sorry as slaves that why you see most of Ross stores are very messy and the clothes and most of the items in the floor  big fat zero organization will never work  there
bad,"It's ok but it's not something that I want to keep on doing. I did learn a lot from the workers. I am a better leader for the team. Working there is hard, the customer just is tossing stuff around or dropping stuff on the floor. The customers are rude for no reason. I tried my best to make them happy but they don't like the store rules. I used to enjoy my job but now I don't."
bad,"Working in retail is always hard especially at Ross. Very stressful job. I feel that customers think that the store can just be trashed, not only the store I work in but in every Ross I have been in. The employees are pretty good. Having multiple projects that are expected to be done when working as MOD by yourself is stressful. When the projects get done it won’t stay like that for long. Pay is not good for the amount of work that is done."
bad,The store manager would write up the ones she didn’t like and the ones who should be written up for violating policy that kissed her feet would slide by unscathed. The management team is a joke and not team players. The turnover for the location I worked was high because the store manager can’t do her job properly. I was dismissed from my duties because I stood up to her and so she collaborated with Human Resources to find a way to fire me. I would not recommend Ross they don’t take care of the hard workers just feet kissers and slackers.
bad,"Let me start off by saying that, the company it’s self is an okay company to work for, and my team was for the most part amazing EXCEPT one person. Our district manager is the absolute worst! I do not recommend ANYONE working here or working for him. He does not care about his team, he cares about himself and his paycheck. I have never worked for someone as bad as him."
bad,"But the management politics causes high turnover..if u don't open your availibilty.they work you fulltime and list u as partime to keep u from getting better employee benefits..someone really need to do a sweep.assist mgr mom works for hr..please do.a  managing people training in austin for some mgrs.ive experienced racial deprivation several time mgrs knew and nothing was done"
bad,"Your over worked and don’t even get the proper training , on your first day they just put you next to someone and you watch them the next day you come in they’ll just throw you on to a register"
bad,I worked at this store for one whole year and there has been too many mangers in and out to keep track. They don't care about the store policy unless corporate is there. And they also know when corporate is coming so they'll make you and/or some other unfortunate employees stay late to clean and organize the store. They are some good people who work there but there too many lazy people.
bad,"Stressful environment. No credit is ever given, usually store manager would take all the credit even though SM was gone all the time on vacation. I ended up leaving the company after unfair treatment from higher ups, after years of working there. Great place to gain experience but the moment you speak up about something you don’t agree with then you’re no longer allowed to advance."
bad,"As an off price retailer, stores get destroyed, massive amounts of freight comes daily, you are given enough payroll to have 2-3 cashiers PER DAY and 2-3 associates on the floor PER DAY, excluding Stock team. As a member of management you are expected to sit back and manage the store and to avoid tasks, however, staffing and payroll prevents you from that with constantly having to be on a register, covering breaks, and helping unload freight daily. The turnover within the company is extremely high due to the workload staff has to deal with and i don't blame them. Part of your metrics in a store is Internal Promotion and is such a ""huge stress"" in the companies goals, however, field leadership always prefers to hire from outside. Supervisory role pay is AWFUL for what they have to do, and Management pay is only good if you are hired from outside such as myself but is still not worth it. IF you manage to get promoted into a management role, as an assistant, you will make at most $16/hr vs. the outsource staff make $20+, and enjoy your no weekends off and mandatory 45 hour work week."
bad,"Very stressful, dirty, bad management, bad atmosphere, very negative vibes working here. Well st least the Ross I work at is this way. Dont recommend."
bad,"This place taught me you can devote your heart and soul to a company and still be treated like absolute dirt, never work for ross dress for less unless you plan on throwing that time of your life down the toilet"
bad,"The store in Everett WA is the worse. The management team picks on certain associates, not for being a bad worker but just for not liking you at all. The store got a new Assistant Manager who decides who gets to break rules and who has to follow them. They don’t allow there cashiers to have water bottles up at the front cause they say it makes the front end look messy. However other associates can have energy drinks and soda in other areas of the store. The assistant manager ridiculed there loss prevention for helping a cashier when no one else would. Telling him to “don’t try and do a job that’s not your job anymore.” Don’t go in the store during the day or afternoon if you want to speak to a manager. They won’t come out if the office to help there cashiers with angry customers and horrifically long lines that start to end up in isles. They never have enough cashiers and sales floor people scheduled. And no one likes to help the elderly out when they buy heavy items, when the carts are unavailable to even go outside. Worse place ever. No support at all."
bad,"I’ve worked at Ross for about 2 years and the main thing I learned is regardless of how hard you work if your not friends with your management you will never advance "
bad,"Management was terrible, the store manager gave no guidance or showed responsibility. i was also not paid the amount i was supposed to for the entire time i worked there, They allowed people with a felony to work there when they weren't supposed to, the store manager hid the information. The schedule was never created on time and the hours were based on favoritism."
bad,I was a fitting room assistant at Ross for 2 months I checked customers in and out of rooms while monitoring amount of merchandise the customer has I the fitting room
bad,if your wanting to make a career out of retail or wanting to be moved to higher standards ross is not the place to work. poor everything there. too mant promises and not enough actions. the pay ($11.00) isn't worth the work they have the employees do or the late nights they have during the holidays.
bad,"They shouldn't have the hours based off of payroll. They do not appreciate the employees that are working hard. Management from the higher ups is unsatisfying when it comes to filing a complaint. Ironically there is an overall positive vibe within the work environment. "
bad,"So unorganized, the store was a mess and never cleaned. The worst training ever. They did not take time to actually show you what you were responsible for and how to handle certain situations."
bad,The new manager isn’t someone you want to work for she’s ungrateful of her employees and she doesn’t work as a manager should. Working here made me realize why I don’t like people
bad,I was hired on as a seasonal employee at Ross.  I found out today that my last day was tomorrow after looking at the schedule which had the tendency of changing constantly.  I noticed that the one day that I had for next week was taken off my schedule.   I just came to work and was informed that tomorrow is my last day.  Never have I worked for such a dysfunctional company where they changed your hours without your knowledge constantly or cancel your work shifts.  I don’t know how anyone expects anyone to live on one working day a week.  Lucky for me I have another job so this wasn’t a huge loss.  I am really relieved that tomorrow is the last day for me and I am not going back.  They don’t offer much in the way of hours and wages.
bad,"Always set up for failure. They always looking for more even if you are #1 in district. They have outside HR department for complaints, If someone calls they can lie about you and you have no way of proving they lied and they do not have to back up their statements it is a lose lose situation"
bad,"I'ts very fast paced, there is room for advancement, however it's determined by the demographics of that particular location, how well acquainted you are wit management. No hours to give out so you couldn't make enough to make ends meet"
bad,"Go in very early in the morning clock in go to the stock room and be assigned your job for the day. I usually stocked the sales floor. Stocked until all the product was put away if they needed you in other depts. Then Management would put you where your needed."
bad,"My brother-in-law died and I didn’t have two weeks to request the day off for his funeral. I was scheduled to work that day, no one could pick up or switch the shift and management told me if I called out, I would be fired."
bad,"the first manager was disrespectful, but the store that I work at now I like my manager but she isn't giving me enough hours,so that is why I need a second job."
bad,"Leadership Skills: Keeping employees motivated, resolve conflicts."
bad,"Don't work here. No room for advancement and management will use you to further themselves at employee expense. "
bad,While very blessed I had the opportunity to work with this business I was disappointed at what came from working there. There was not any steady management there was a new manager every week if not twice a week. Wasn’t scheduled enough hours
bad,"I worked here for about a year and a half and received nothing but disrespect from management. There is a ridiculous amount of drama and no respect for employees, even if you work your butt off they always want more."
bad,"Customers = Terrible"
bad,I enjoy Ross as a company and appreciate all that I have learned working there. My experience isn't the greatest only because of poor management the last year of working there.
bad,"Ross dress for less is okay to work when the hours are going good, but when they are not then it is not so good. If working in the stock room is what you would like to do then that is where the hours are coming from."
bad,It was alright. I was basically given freedom to do my job. Very very very relaxed. But at the same time unreasonable. They kept me past my scheduled hours.
bad,"a typical day at work was cleaning every minute to make sure the store is at a 100%. I learned that sometimes hard work is not necessary to succeed. Management was very poor. Workplace Culture within coworkers was very solid. The hardest part of the job was cleaning at the end of the night, and as Loss Prevention, it was very tough to prevent theft."
bad,"Customer service is not a priority although you will be told it is. In fact, you are TIMED for everything from how quickly you check a customer out to how quick you bag items and call the next customer. After each customer you are told on the screen if you did a good job or if you need to go faster! It doesn't matter if you are a hard worker, never call out, come in to cover call-offs, etc, if you don't have a fast check out time (called CPR, which is expected to be at 96% or higher), you will NEVER advance with this company. Well that's the excuse they will use anyway. You are told NOT to fold clothes, to just kind of ""roll"" them which will annoy some customers bc you appear to be rude and careless."
bad,"regular cashier duties"
bad,"A typical day at Ross consisted of continually picking up customers' mess (clothes, toys, electronics, etc.) that always seemed to be strewn all over the sales floor and, not to mention, working the fitting rooms was ALWAYS a major hassle that every employee, including myself, dreaded. Management there was the absolute WORST, because it seemed as though the managers always had something to say behind an employee's back, but they would just keep whatever they wanted to say, concealed and talk about it and gossip amongst themselves. I despised dealing with customers' bad attitudes here and there, and they would always call back and complain to our unprofessional management and wrongfully accuse an employee for not doing their job correctly. The emloyee discount was not really much, being that it was only 15% off and you would really have to buy a lot to notice the difference it made."
bad,Ross is a mess that can never get cleaned. The company does not give stores enough money for payroll which causes extremely long lines and upset customers.
bad,Ross is fun as far as working with the public but has managerial issues. Care for employees is non existent from upper management on down. There are some great store managers but for the most part bad management.
bad,"The Work Experience at Ross was 50/50 the employees are the only redeeming qualities of working there, the management is poor and at times not even apparent, they would direct you how to do your job and then reprimand you for doing it, it was a terrible place to work, all employees i knew at the time quit in mass shortly after i left"
bad,"This is the most horrible place to work. Managment suxs, nothing you ever do is good enough. Such a negative environment. False promises.. They cheat you out of your money and you are talked down to and treated as if you are less than... They can't keep staff a lot of favoritism. If managers like someone else better you are treated like garbage. The more stressful environment you will ever work. Its like walking on egg shells everyday.."
bad,"I love the people here and enjoyed working here for the most part. We got to work and have fun at the same time.  However, I'm not sure how the store manager ever got the title. There have been so many complaints about the store manager. The SM has no respect for associates, puts no effort into training associates and never assigns a buddy trainer, and lacks the overall skills of leadership. Also likes to cause drama. The other people that I worked with were great. I do not recommend working at this location."
bad,"Working at Ross Dress for Less was an extremely negative experience for me. At the location I worked at the managers were rude not only to the employees but to the customers as well. I had  quite a few customers come up to me, a sales associate, to complain about how one of the managers treated them poorly. Also, the managers never let me leave on time. They would keep me often for an hour after my shift was over and refused to let me leave even though it was completely within my rights to leave. I was often given more than one task at a time (that would pretty much require me to be in more than one place at a time) and they would complain when I wasn't able to finish everything quickly. Most times there were only two people on the register, even on the weekends when Ross is at their busiest, and we would often get yelled at by both the customers and the managers for the long lines even though it would be impossibly to get the long lines down quickly with just two people on the registers. Overall, working for Ross Dress for Less was a horrific work experience that still haunts me to this day."
bad,"Job was interesting, around customers, but with very low possibility for full time. Part time was getting minimum amount hours, no benefits. Job possibilities for full time was not available for the public."
bad,I do security and I did registers.I started as a register than I promoted to be a frond end supervisor. than I become security
bad,"This job is great if you want to work one day a week. Management is horrible, singles out employees. They definitely pick favorites even if they don't do any work. Work environment is too hot and they won't let you have water while working."
bad,"Horrible negative working environment. Lack of leadership as well. Did not like the environment what's so ever. Also rude to costumers."
bad,Dead end job with inconsistent hours and low pay. Physically taxing. Tends to cause workplace injuries. Belligerent management.
bad,"Its not a place where I would find a career. Its just a location that is in the neighborhood to make a little extra money. They offer benefits to full time employees only, and those are management. Everyone is Part time."
bad,"management is horrible, they only work you 4 hours a week and they dont care about anything and dont train properly, they refuse to work with your schedule"
bad,"Pocas horas"
bad,"Ross is a very tough place to enjoy working at. Upper leadership treats the employees like second class citizens. Not enjoyable, terrible work life balance and very unhappy employees. Very depressing place to work"
bad,"When I was working there as an area supervisor, I let them know up front that I had obligations pertaining to military service. The district supervisor favored service members, and I got the job because of both his preference and my experience thru the military, aND consequently i was paid more than every other area supervisor day 1. Shortly after, I reviewed their policies, and they were in violation of the NLRA of 1935 section 7. Meanwhile when I brought this up, my supervisor allegedly spoke ill of me while I was training. Later she also said that 'she didn't know how to take me'. Low and behold, my register conveniently ended up inconsistent three times and I was out of the store that minute. "
bad,"The Management team at the Hilo Hi Store do not work well with other associates and belittle them they also are not willing to help when you need it, they have their full timers and high potential part timers run the store while they all hide in there offices and also bully people till you feel horrible about yourself and want to quit. I highly recommend not working at this location."
bad,"Worked for ross for almost a year coming in on time for work and when called to cover shifts. During my time there i went through 3 store managers which never completed my work papers (which i did not know about and was never informed),but i still worked there for over a year and when finally told about the problem, i did everything they told me to fix my papers and was still fired. Never working here again"
bad,"Horrible pay, horrible company policies, horrible management. Customers yell at you on a regular basis for calling the next customer and for the store being a mess, and management doesn't allow you to say it's policy or that we're understaffed. We're supposed to take the complaints while they blame us."
bad,"Working in the Austin area, I've seen very poor management all around. After a year of coming in when people call in sick or whatever reasons just when they needed me, they've yet to give me a raise or even a full time status. "
bad,"I worked at Ross for a year and the job was easy and fun because of my fellow coworkers but the real downer about working at this ross is the management because they have huge preferences towards curtain employees and they spend most of their time in the office with other employees on their social medias. The minute our previous manager Kelly Hernandez got promoted and left to another store, the area supervisors found a little excuse to terminate me and it was complete discrimination because a week before i was encouraged by one of the supervisors to apply for full time and then one of the other area supervisor did not like me so she threw away the application, I felt completely discriminated against but there was nothing i could do because it was basically their word against mine. I was so commited to Ross that once i gave birth a week later i went back to work and worked harder than any employee.They defend their own when they mess up and they get away with physical and verbal abuse towards the stock room. The pay was not worth it either $9.00/hr."
bad,"Management is terrible.  Morale is very low.  Expectations put on hourly associates are very high, and pay is miserable (Minimum wage for most employees, managers make minimum wage +$2 or so).  The customers are often low income and not very kind."
bad,Ross was very hands on everyday was something new. It had a very welcoming environment from the customers to co-workers.
bad,"Job started out wonderful and I worked for a manager whom treated everyone working under him with respect and dignity, along with providing customers with outstanding service. My manager ended up with cancer and between surgeries and chemotherapy could no longer work and management was left with incompetent employees."
bad,"Truck crew has consistent hours M-F 8-5ish. The culture in the building was terrible when I was there, but there is a high turnover rate. The co-workers were rude, loud, and disrespectful to almost everyone. "
bad,They are ok to work for. They refuse to give anyone more that 25 hours a week. It was something I can not live off of. I enjoyed some of the people I worked with
bad,"lots of back to back shifts made it rather exhausting. balance between work and like was very hit and miss.  I did like the fast pace environment and upbeat coworkers."
bad,Non professional environment. Employees were rude and unfriendly. Manager was rude.
bad,"As a store manager, you are salaried and they fully expect you to be there at least 50 hours per week. Management expects you to be available at any given moment for meetings and visits they could have scheduled in advanced. Rather than paying an hourly manager to cover a shift, they would rather you do it since it doesn't use payroll hours! The hardest part of the job is running a store, which customers come in and trash with very little payroll dollars. The associates get paid minimum wage and are expected to work like their life depends on it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 15th and 30th payday! Store manager jobs are for those people who have no outside life and would love to be ""forced"" to work every day all day for a company that does NOT value hard work. I often worked 18 hour days while only putting a small dent in the work to be completed."
bad,"Very busy with high-in customers on a daily basic. Management was great, co-workers are true team players, and the hardest part of my job was being in four places at one time. last but not least the enjoyable moment was clocking out."
bad,"management was horrible. work place was nasty, fitting room was smelly."
bad,This company is very stingy with it's work hours. There is a lot of Corruption in management and in the company
bad,"My typical day was clock in and start from the fitting room and move around to different parts of the store to make sure it's all going well, or to help the associates who are not sure what to do. I learned from working at Ross that talking to my store manager did not help me at all. I was the leader in all projects and moves."
bad,A..Ordinary retail's job like bieng cashier or recover floors and organizing.
bad,I hate it. The managers are rude and talk o you any kind of way.
bad,"Time management is poor, pay is not suitable for job postion, opportunities are slim. Unorganized and confustion in managment."
bad,I loved this job when I first started. Until I realized it was all like high school. The managers had their favorites and if you didn't fit in all the employees hated you. The managers would have you do the work and they took credit for it. Don't even get me started on the District manager!
bad,"it was an fairly simple jobs some days were more fast paced than others, the company strives to put customers first in their everyday operation. The staff is very friendly"
bad,"My manager at DDs would offer her group's services whenever upper management needed something ridiculous. Then she would neglect to get us the proper resources to complete the task. The systems were woefully behind compared to Ross. Every department's reports had to be touched which was largely unnecessary. The manager had a particular way of seeing everything and most of her workers felt as if she would do better to just get the work done herself, as much as she micromanaged. Her way of thinking was illogical and led to many long evenings of missed busses home and having to take a ferry instead. Traffic into New York City was abysmal but the manager would not listen to the fact that it would make most people late. It was never a problem at Ross but the manager made it an issue at DDs. Most of her workers eventually left when she was promoted."
bad,"For the fifteen months that I worked at Ross, there were five different managers from the time that I started until I left.  Cashiering positions had numerous turnover, some new hires leaving within days of starting."
bad,"Always short staffed, when we weren't on register we were on the floor cleaning up after the customers and organizate the store the way it is supposed to look but it felt impossible"
bad,I met some semi decent people while working there. Decent discounts and dibs on buying new clothes or other items before we put them out on the sales floor.
bad,Working at Ross Dress For Less was enjoyable for me . Mostly the things I enjoyed working there was greeting the customers & helping them find what they were looking for .
bad,"Each store is different based upon the management the first store I worked at was great, all the employees took pride in their jobs and seemed happy to be there. The second store was very different; management almost seemed mad that they were there and took it out on the employees and customers which in turn showed in every facet of the store from the cashiers who seemed annoyed to be there to the sales floor which was littered with our merchandise."
bad,"I am currently an employee at Ross, but I will decide to leave this job because it was too stressful and demanding. If you apply for cashier only, they will put you through cashier, sales floor, fitting room etc. It's not a great place to work at, but I recommend it's a great place to work at as part-time, not full time."
bad,Es un trabajo donde exigen mas de lo que tienes que trabajar
bad,"Working was really stressful."
bad,workers would say if you needed help to ask and when it got busy id ask for help they'd complain cause they had to help me managers would be very late with putting up the schedule for the next weeks and then when i was sick for two weeks and told a manager she didn't tell anyone else and then when i was better i called back and was told i abandoned my job but i have been sick and called in and told them so now i am glad i don't work there anymore
bad,"Ross Dress For Less for the most part is a good company but from District, Regional and Corporate level the expectation's are unrealistic. Ross operates on a very low operating cost, which means more on the managers in the building. The store could be beating last year and comp sales but still are asked to cut payroll to save other stores that are blowing it out of pocket. There is definitely no HR support for management, the company would support the employee knowing that polices and procedures were not being followed, when a manager tries to hold the employee accountable. "
bad,Over worked and stressed employees. company was more focused on filling out paper forms then people being on register or cleaning up the sales floor. District managers were from outside companies and didn't know the ins and outs of a daily shift.
bad,"Ross dress for less in miami FL was one of the worst jobs I've ever worked. horrible hours, horrible costumers, and not the greatest pay. I would dread going into work everyday."
bad,never work here cuz i never did indeed got the name wrong so I dont know any about this company. Company I work for was Ross and Assioctes and it was a good company
bad,"pulling reports, having morning meeting, The hardest part of the job is the shop lifting that takes place all day long. and the long hours. You can never be at ease , They are always calling, something has to be done all during the day that they can see themselves."
bad,"Very stressful and not enough support in management.  If the company had more management to help build the stores,  Ross would be successful.  Overall not a bad company."
bad,There is no work life balance as a manager for Ross. Their expectations for scheduling are unreal. Your expected to close at 11:30pm or 12:30am and then open the store at 7 or 7:30am the next day. They are always the last store to close in a shopping center because they are a greedy company that goes through employees like crazy because of these expectations and low salaries.
bad,"Busy locations"
bad,"Not worth it.  "
bad,"Huge gaps in communication with DM. At times communication can be aggressive when results did not come in."
bad,"Ross runs very lean and there is not enough people to support the growth so everyone is overworked.  There is working hard and being worked ragged - at Ross you will be worked ragged.  There is no work/life balance because of the workload and telecommuting is not an option.  The systems and processes are very antiquated so you end up working harder not smarter.  "
bad,I enjoy the job i did in the stockroom. I could work at my own pace and get the job done. The employees i worked with were also wonderful people. We know what to do with no supervision. The sales floor people were also knowledgeable about their job and everyone was always ready to help each other in making sure the store looked good..
bad,An average shift is 4 to 5 hours. An average week is 10 hours. Anything more than that and expect to be called out. And pay is minimum wage... But if you're a guy you're in luck. You'll make .50 cents more than your female coworkers. If you're in stock and get called up to do register for an hour you're still expected to finish all the work you would of done if not for being on register. Which is 2 boxes an hour of apparel or 20 hardlines. I loved my managers. Even they tell me to get the heck out of Ross  but the company itself is horrible and sexist. Only girls can do apparel and guys do hardlines. You will get written up for calling out. Even if they schedule you for a day you put you couldn't work on your availability. Save yourself. Don't do it. Also. Raises only go out to their favorites. They can only give out a couple 75 cent raises which go to like three people. Four people get .50 cent and 5 get .10 cent. The rest of us are out of luck and stuck on minimum wage. Work anywhere else. Also when someone calls out they throw you in their position like supervisor but don't expect to be thanked or even paid supervisor pay. This company does not care about their employees. There are no benefits and cut pay and hours to make sure they don't have to pay you correctly
bad,"ROSS is the reason I lost my family, friends and self respect. The store managers are abusive and corrupt, the higher ups are liars. Everybody leaves nearly 3 months after they start. Don't work here unless you plan on killing yourself soon."
bad,"Very productive work place, business picks up and slows down. Management doesn't do what they're supposed to do. Management doesn't take control over associates when issues happen they go unnoticed even when told."
bad,The worst company so far that i have ever worked for!!! They are not fair at all.. they over work you for little pay!!
bad,"Boring, but standing around .nothing to tell, diidnt have good managers that's all"
bad,"a typical day at work----open store, prepare employee schedule, conduct morning meeting, work in specific departments, run register, get change for registers, handle customers problems on phone and in person, send e-mails to cooperate, make sure stock room is moving smoothly and getting cleaned out, make sure everyone is doing their job and if not help."
bad,"Ross is a great place to work, with the friendly managers and fun co workers its fun. My only problem with Ross is that our hours of  20 hour a week had just gotten cut. It is a great place to work if you have a full time job not just solely Ross income."
bad,"The company is very healthy if you pay attention to wall street.  I have to say my experience here is like being a manager at a garage sale.  Clothing and other goods end up all over the floor at all hours of the day.  If you are looking for a management job, then do not look at Ross unless you just really enjoy picking up off of the floor.  This was the single most horrific management job I have had in my life.  I would not recommend this to anyone unless you were in dire need of a job."
bad,"I was treated very poorly since I had started. I didn't receive recognition for anything I did well, only criticism for things I didn't do ""the Ross way."" Even when I did things how they trained me it somehow still wasn't ""the Ross way."" Managers would blame me for things I didn't do that other employees admitted to doing. I was talked to and treated like I was an incompetent child when I was coming in on days off and working longer shifts and making goals."
bad,"Very busy story, but needs more cashiers. Also, need higher pay."
bad,"The location I worked at was very disorganized. The managers/assistant managers had no sense of how to treat their employees. They were really rude and unapproachable. I applied for this job as a sales floor associate but would occasionally be called as a cashier and security guard. Both of these positions were against my agreement with the hiring manager because I had an injury at the time and couldn’t stand in same positions for too long. I found myself constantly having to explain this to supervisors and other managers. A few months in, one manager told me I was no longer needed as a regular employee since the store was losing customers and I would just be on call. A week went by and I never received any calls and eventually found out I was fired by a different manager for not coming into work. Those are examples of the type of disorganization that happens and nothing is done about it. The only pros I have are that hours were pretty flexible and if you’re on the floor it’s pretty simple and laidback."
bad,Great job for a starting job. A good place to work and would be a good place to begin a management career but due to the customers and the nature of people thats not too possible if passion and moral driven.
bad,This place is an awful place to work at first it was amazing to work here. But then we had mangers leave and new ones came in and everything we where doing was wrong and they started doing write ups and cutting back everyone's hours so like. This job is fine if your a busy person only 4 hours shifts a day so recommend going to work somewhere else
bad,"You will feel overworked but underpaid. "
bad,Good place to make money. The atmosphere in this workplace was not good for me but to other people it could be great.  The only bad thing about my job was dealing with people that didn’t want to work.
bad,"Was unable to do any training due to computers not working properly. The store was filthy. Expected to confront any suspected shoplifter at own risk in a high transient area. Sorry, not interested in risking my safety for minimum wage."
bad,In was a Store protection Specialist. Under paid for too much work. No hours. Supervisors were nice but Upper Management was rude and mean. Pay was horrible.
bad,favortism to the max. Extremely toxic workplace if the supervisors don't like you. The supervisors don't listen to concerns at alall. you always have to go to the directors or HR yourself.
bad,"Managers are incompetent and have no clue how to properly use people. They cut your hours when you ask for days off, and give you less than 25 hours on the regular anyways. They're also lazy when it comes to giving cashiers back up on the register, and purposely leave their walkies in the office. You're better off applying for Walmart."
bad,Low morale. Toxic company culture. Disorganized. Poor management. Easy to bond over how unhappy everyone is. Constant shift in business direction. Plus side is competitive salary and bonus.
bad,I had a problem with one of the ASM since I started. I was never disrespectful to her but she always had an issue with me. She is why I quit. Also in the middle of a shift our store manager quit so the quality is going down. I loved my coworkers. I worked with some amazing people. They were great but Heidi was a horrible manager.
bad,"Terrible place to work.  For every employee they hire, the expect the work of three.  Work here until you can find something else, if not then you will feel underpaid and unappreciated as time goes on."
bad,"Pros "
bad,Retail jobs are a pain and this job is like that working in clothes sucks and to look for a different job because all the people that coem leave it a mess and they close so late
bad,"i usually work 2 days a week, sometimes i get cut off for the day because of the payroll. Also very tiring, dealing with all kinds of people. and consistantly being everywhere in the store."
bad,You’re never gonna get a day off. Make sure you sleep a lot and that you’re ready for the work shift. Will work till 12:30-1:30 A.M. if you’re not wanting that then I don’t know what to tell you.
bad,Its a lot of time to put the right labels pricing and tags on clothes due to a fast paced environment. And the restrooms are not up to date its always out of order or just lain disgusting and its not just the one ive worked at!
bad,The store manager shows none of her employee respect. She has no idea what she doing she made a good work environment miserable.the store manager does not care what the store looks like.
bad,"Needs a new management turnover. Everyday is overtime, the turn over rate is rough, most associates speak Spanish and its hard for management to communicate to them. We work every Saturday."
bad,Ross is a great place to shop but I wouldn't be quick to reccomend them for employment . the people are nice make you feel like a family but the mangers are very rude and the hours aren't so good.
bad,If Ross had more standard and was more professional how they handle things and how they handle people it will be well I worked there for a long period of time another $500 was stolen out of my purse in a locker that only a manager can get in with a security key I never got the money replaced and I reported it I was pregnant the managers was stealing nobody else had a security key so they are very unprofessional
bad,"I have only worked there for not even three months and they have changed my job description multiple times. They don't know what they want. A lot of what they say contradicts other things they say and if you question something, they brush you off to the side. It is a boring job and you have to deal with rude people all day. You also aren't allowed to sit down or walk around. You stay in the same spot your whole shift. They also never give breaks and lunches on time.... If they even give them at all."
bad,Horrible customers.Lazy employees that do nothing but complain. Cheap with pay and an extremely stressful work enviroment.. They also love to only use one cashier in the weekends.
bad,"Ross is not a good company to work for. They do not care about the employees at all. No benefits, the only good benefits is 20% off on merchandise in the store, and 40% often when they had double discount days. I would not recommend working for this company to my worst enemy!"
bad,The store manager isn't cut out to be there for my honest opinion she cant make a set schedule. My schedule is always changing and we are losing employees left and right due to her not wanting to work with anyone. She relies on 5 people mainly to pickup and cover the employees that quit shifts. It is a good work environment and learning experience
bad,"depending on scheduled job will start with markdown ,cashier or stockroom start work right away. learn new things everyday every 2 hours is 15 min break coworkers and management team great to work with."
bad,they promise you one thing and do another. you get about 2 days a week
bad,"This job does not offer great genuine training, Ive seen a new women on her second day treated extreamly rude and disrespected, all the women complain and gossip about employers there including the manager gossips as well, negativity, the worst supervisor I ever had in all my days of work, the supervisor does not do proper training for you to be ready when told to do something and finish a specific time which will led you to be sent home right away, bad chemisty, in all, the worst retail job I ever had, I had great expectations to move up to sps by the manager, great let down."
bad,We had to set up the department we would do markdowns in for the week.Working in retail is hard work. Management was fair and helpful.My co workers were the best we would even see each other after work.The hardest part was finding some one stealing from the store.The best thing was when we had good scores for markdowns and customer service .
bad,Very Fast Paced Job with a lot of responsibilities
bad,"I was told to go faster by another manager as I quickly tried to complete my job while staying on the same pace as my cohort. It was mandatory that I completed the entire floor and four go backs. I resigned due to manager not being able to help her employees with physical pain, customer harassment/security and team place issues. Left immediately to the hospital."
bad,"1. They don't properly train you leaving you confused the whole time."
bad,"Bad management, horrible customers dirty store, not enough breaks, and the store has no standards when it comes to what they take back as a return. I dont miss this place!!!"
bad,"the work is good, feel lucky to walk away with my paycheck. nothing else is in it for us employees! morale is super low. higher management is doing a poor job. they worry about their bonuses. not their employees. hate working here these days. didn't use to be like this!"
bad,"I have worked in Retail before so rude customers are to be expected. But when the people you work with are the same, it does not make a positive work environment. Customers would feel uncomfortable when my manager would talk to me in a condescending manner. They would tell me things like, ""Well, that wasn't very nice of her."" So I knew I was not over exaggerating when I felt unwelcomed and not given proper training."
bad,"Someone bound to get hurt being in that store when people stealing,running and bring weapons  and they expect you to walk up on customers in the store"
bad,"The managers are rude to customers and to associates. They overreact to small issues that could easily be handled and underreact to serious problems. As a worker, you are not treated as though you matter much to them other than just showing up to do the job. They nit-pick and speak to adult workers like drill sergeants. The job requirements are easy to learn but do not expect to get any recognition for good work. Customers can be stressful but management is much worse. The pay is great for an associate job. You must abide by the dress codes. That includes covering all tattoos and piercings and wearing the colors and types of pants or shirts they request. The hours are flexible and you can adjust them to your needs. 30 minute lunches but the location is near lots of resturants. The workers are great but the managers are evil. Once you learn to ignore their rude attitudes, the job is fine."
bad,"Work was easy. Hours were cut from 37 a week to 18 after I mentioned I couldn’t pay for my home on $11 an hour, and that I’d have to find another job."
bad,"Management is a joke, inappropriate relationships between management and associates. Favoritism when making out the schedule. You would think this was a Fortune 500 company, the way people stab one another in the back, talking about people behind their back. I used to be friendly with the people I work with, now I barely speak to any of them. Just clock in, do my shift, and clock out. It’s a very tense and hostile work environment at times."
bad,needs new head management if they will change the manager over the store the store would run 100 times better and be cleaner but the district manager somehow dont see whats going on or she really dont care.common sense will tell you if your floor worker are quitting 99% of the time its the manager.. but it is a fast work place at times and fun when head manager is not around you can get things done.
bad,At the Ross I worked at the management was very tough and demanding.Speaking to employees like little children.Expecting much more from an employee than one can do.
bad,its really hard to work there too much work for little pay . and most of the time they send you home because theres no work . if you have a family its not the place to work at since you hardly see a 40hr pay check
bad,"Messy, Short staff, Stressful at times, the typical clothing store. If you've shopped at ross before, You can probably expect the same working there. You're overworked and underpaid and the hours are constantly up and down. You would pretty much always need a second job."
bad,Training employees should be more prioritized and more hours should be available for employees........................................................
bad,"A typical day at Ross was to help customers find their size in clothes, and shoes. The hardest part of the day was to stand for 8 to 9 hours a day while stocking the store and being at the checkout counter."
bad,"Stocking, rotating products on shelves and inventory "
bad,"• Opening the store, preparing the store for business •Keeping the store neat at all times."
bad,Clock in go into the stock room help unload boxes and put the materials in the correct blue ben or hummer after unloading the boxes and putting the materials in the correct spot each stock member take a blue been or a hummer and put the materials on the shevles after that you can clock out . They pay you 9 in hour
bad,"This business expose me to vendors, customer and other associates. It also expose me  to inventories and other important business  relations."
bad,"Just a regular typical day at Ross you always have to move at fast pace and be a fast thinker at certain situations. I have learned a lot of things working for Ross for the last 6 years how to operate machinery ( Cash Registers), Answering telephones in a productively mannered way, Greeting Customers in a very professionally manner, Trouble shooting team challenges. I would say the hardest part of  my Job every day was the Business Rush because it was always busy and at the time you were always fixing problems and making sure that every customer left the store pleased. My most enjoyable part of my day was helping the customers.  I love to help people and make them feel at ease."
bad,"Working in a guardshack assisting truck drivers, logging incoming trucks, assisting visitors,monitor cctv, direct traiffic, conducted safety audits."
bad,My complaints are that they do not give me enough hours. I get one day a week for 4 hrs at the most. Making $8 an hour. Which is why i am looking for some new employment.
bad,"I worked the night shifts, I typically came into work at 5 and would leave work around 12am-2am. I mostly worked in the dressing room area, working at ross was good for the moment but I had just had a new born baby and they would not work with me with my schedule so I had to quit. at the time I had a 2 month old baby and I could not work long grave shifts at Ross but they refused to work with me."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of a fun enviroment depending on who the manager is, there are many pros and cons to this job it honestly just depnds on what location you work at."
bad,A typical day at ross is proactive. It helps with great customer service .And great customer communication ethics. They great customer service relationships. It helps one know and understand great customer relationship and also great communication ethics
bad,"the job was very easy my favorite thing was fitting room... the people who have been there longer get paid more so they think they are better then the new people.job was very easy, straight forward,good clothing for all sizes."
bad,"Ross is a good store if your looking for a second job or attending school. Management was great, best managers I've worked with, very understanding and patient. If I could change something in the company it will be the hours (they are only aloud to schedule you 13 hours a week) which makes a lot of associates quit since they can't survive on hundred something dollars every other week."
bad,Ross was a good learning experience for me in the customer service aspect. I thank them for hiring me when I lacked retail experience and for working with me and molding me.
bad,"This company will promote their employees quickly, train them poorly for a few hours for their new position, then throw them under the bus later. They have their employees work through their lunch break without pay. I would never recommend working for them."
bad,It was okay. If you like standing for 8 hours with a mechanical smile on your face greeting rude people who don't care about you. It's the perfect on for you.
bad,I’ve worked there for a good year and some months and the hours are horrible!! There are people who have been working here for years with only 13 hours at the most. They are constantly making payroll cuts! And they only give hours to the ones who kiss their butts. The managers are lazy and the store manager and DM are too!!
bad,"They gave me just 4 hours A WEEK.They won't give you hours so you don't have benefits."
bad,"Literally my worst nightmare come true I swear to GOD. Micro-managing GM. Managers who NEVER do their jobs but expect you to be working constantly. Literally would not receive my scheduled breaks because no one cared or constantly ignored them when requested.Your not allowed to talk to other employees, have your phone on you, or have food or WATER. Worst experience and that's saying a lot I pray you never work at this death trap. I aged 120 years in the span of 6months. Regret is insane once you begin working at Ross."
bad,If you don't have patience this is not the place you want to be. If you smoke they do have a smoking area. They are constantly changing procedures to get in. There a lot of good people who work upfront in the offices.
bad,"I was an FES for 2 years and worked at the Georgetown location. My second year was by far the most stressful job ever due to the manager Lori. "
bad,absolutely ridiculous. told me i’d get 25 hours a week but i only receive 4?????????????? it’s ridiculous and fitting room is awful. managers don’t listen to what you need!
bad,poor management don't have any communication to employees expect u to know the job without training properly when you ask how to they want to treat you like your dumb
bad,"This job is very stressful. Training is mostly on your own. Poor communication from management. Messy and rude customers. Inconsistent and late hours. Lousy benefits compared to similar jobs. District manager sets unrealistic quotas and goals that stress out the store manager who then takes it out on the associates. The minimum wage is $11, but the lack hours and benefits means you will actually make less."
bad,Working at this job was a horrible experience for me because there were no benefits pay was bad and management was not helpful nor good at there jobs. they worked you out a lot and payed you horrible. No way of moving up in this company and they workplace was boring and full of lifeless. A typical day at work was basically being called out and just standing up front of the store not able to move much. I learned that i needed a better job asap and needed to get diploma in something that pays better.
bad,"I enjoyed working for Ross but resigned from my position due to the lack of scheduling flexibility . The culture is your typical retail clothing+ space. The people there (especially management) play favoritism, unprofessional and it just fosters a very unhealthy work environment. No one wants to be there because the compensation does not reflect today’s cost of living for a part time job or full time. Lots of turnover. The fitting rooms are by far the worst of any company I have ever seen or worked for."
bad,"Management makes their own rules "
bad,"Corporate needs to come in and start all over with the management staff, from Directors to Managers.  Associates are very dedicated and not quick to speak as they think they will loose their job because of upper management."
bad,I was a hard-worker that showed up to all my shifts. We were all basically slaves for the management that don't do much at all. They are puppets to the corporate heads. No interest in the well being of their employees. They keep appointing corporate officials that causes less store payroll. This means the people working will have to do triple the amount of work for the same low pay.
bad,"Please if your a teen 😔 Don’t Work here as your first customer service job, It is the worst place to work at for teens and adults. The pay is so sad, you can only work part time their for you get minimum wage and you can not work for more than 24 hours a week, It is a fast, multitask Employment. The management is awfully rude, inexperiencedun and uneducated, they have No respect for employees or customers."
bad,"*The Ross in Orlando,FL located at 5295 International Dr.*"
bad,I would not go back to work for them no matter what. It was just useless to have even worked there. My husband and I asked for time off and they fired me. So no I wouldn't recommend it
bad,"Job doesn’t care about the customers stealing ,only looks out for internal theft with the employees ,doesn’t want to give employees hours ,not enough money to live off of"
bad,"the people were rude and messy . they said you could drink as much water as you wanted , but complained when you had top use the bathroom . wasn't the best place at all ."
bad,"I use to love working here but it's incredibly stressful for only little pay they play favorites, start drama and just not a good company to work for."
bad,"clean. ring up and handle customer service. organize. unpack. flex the store. work place culture was awful. manage, supervise and lead employees. clean"
bad,Ross in San Bernardino is the worse place to work at. The managers their are very childish and they do not work with your schedule. They are also very rude.
bad,"limited hours, often got my shifts cut short due to payroll. other coworkers not friendly, a lot of pressure to not be getting desired hours. management forgetful and not helpful."
bad,"They didn't seem to care for all employees came in there and everyone was in their own thing and order you to do everything, rarely gave you compliments on work."
bad,"They company itself seemed unorganized. The store was always messy, even though we cleaned often. They barely give you a break. You get it where you fit in."
bad,It’s not good and it’s a very stressful place to work and nobody listens. It’s always hard work to do knowing your not getting paid the way you should be.
bad,Management could be a lot better. Working conditions are less than favorable. I would only recommend this job if it was a short term situation like in between jobs or if you're desperately in need of a paycheck.
bad,"Working for Ross was one of the worst work experiences I have ever had. I was a manager required to enforce unrealistic standards on underpaid and underappreciated employees. We required our employees to have open availability while never scheduling them for more than 25 hours, because there were only 5 non-management full time positions in the store. Employees were required to treat Ross as their primary job despite not making enough money or hours for it to be a primary job. Raises were few and far between, I watched employees with 3 years of time in service make less than someone who just started."
bad,The workers in this store are extremely rude and impatient and unappreciative. They give you the hours you have to work and you end up getting out at 2am
bad,Don't work for Ross in atascocita tx they racist I had a manager discuss our argument we had over the phone on Facebook then her boyfriend threating to come to the store and whip my butt and he call me the n word and nothing happen to her but they fired me
bad,"With all honesty I would not recommend working here unless your going to school and looking for a quick part time job. Over the years of being there and doing so much and working hard, I never ever got appreciation from the managers that have came and went from that place. They expect you to work hard at a fast pace for such little money and management is terrible. If you let them they'll take advantage of you."
bad,"This is a cut throat job and I don't recommend it to anyone."
bad,They promise hours at hiring and then do not come through.  Lucky to get 8 hours the entire week.  Very unorganized managers and employees.  Do not excpect steady employment
bad,"Ok,very drama filled. Waste money on new useless products than giving employees raises.management is  a joke. There think they actually  doing something."
bad,"there are no hours to be given in that company, they over staff, there is no room to grow, the pay is not worth the work effort put in, overall the company is a joke."
bad,Not so happy. Can't Get enough hours to support my family. ROSS manager ensure me that I would make the hours that I needed to support my family. It's really hard for a single mother to take care of my family.
bad,"The coworkers are all focus on the one goal of fulfilling their task for the day and getting home. After a busy day customers, they store requires clean up that is not really a hassle as long as everyone does their part."
bad,"The company does not care about its employees, only customers. They are completely ignorant of the true working conditions employees endure. The store is so hectic that people come and go all the time, so you do not usually have to put up with a horrible manager/coworker for long. Many are blatantly not trained at all! In short, the only good thing about Ross is the double discount for employees offered 3 times per year."
bad,"Management not interested in investing in growth of internal employees.  No company culture, punished for having an opinion or different skill set outside managers expectations.  Individuals are promoted to managers with no management skills and poor leadership skills.  Very hostile environment leaving you feeling helpless."
bad,"I enjoyed y time at ross, however it just was not the place for me. The shoes department was the worst. I love the constant flow of customers, but that only meant more mess to deal with at the end of the night. It was always something to do and that's what I enjoyed about working for ross retail store."
bad,"it okay, something thing to pay the bills. haven't been there long enough to fill, my co-workers out but everyone is old and quite"
bad,I enhoyed who i worked with but not the company. you work very hard for not enough money. always over budget but nothing is finished
bad,"Working in the stockroom and sales floor, not enough hours, undecent pay, no room for advancement ,no way to make a living, not worth starting your car in the morning for so little pay, demanding manager."
bad,"Hours are VERY limited. although it is a nice working environment, sometimes it can be a bit unprofessional. the management can sometimes have favorite. this isn't at all stores just the one I've worked. results may vary."
bad,"This by far is the worst place I've ever worked in my entire life. You are overworked and underpaid. The expectations is unbelievable for the amount the pay per hour. There is never enough hours to go around. Management is unprofessional, rude and just mediocre. There is lots of finger pointing and false accusations towards valued workers who work hard to keep the store running. There is lots of favoritism to the point it's sickening. Lots and lots of theft. Security doesn't pay attention cause they are too busy hiding in the dressing room on their cellphones.People are always calling in left in and right so we are always short staffed. Overall it's a horrible place to work and I advise people not to work for any ross store."
bad,"This is the reason why I'm going to be extra careful before I accept a job offer. "
bad,"A typical day at work was counting final daily closes from the day before. I didn't learn anything that I already knew. The management was disorganization with keeping track of logins and hours. They lacked communication within their team and staff. hardest part of my job was having all the drawers counted, stocked , and open in the little time I had."
bad,"Young joy-able coworkers, learned to communicate and work well with others as a team. Learned a lot of job skills in this one work department."
bad,"good place to start working, but after awhile the job justs becomes boring"
bad,the best part about working here was the co-workers they were so nice and loving
bad,would not recommend working there they are not flexible with college students
bad,"They hired alot of people only to help open the store and then fired them...Very unorganized when it comes to scheduling . I haven't worked in a while, and very upset about that."
bad,"Store regularly sub-par to OSHA standards. No chance for annual review, promotion or raise. 25 hour workweek cap for part time workers enforced so company will not have to offer health insurance."
bad,"Boring, non-productive, repetitive company with numerous employee theft."
bad,"Typical Corporate Environment, No place to advance.  Management does not want to hear any inputs."
bad,"I love ross a lot of things could change for the better of the company"
bad,"Good pay, however payroll was horrible leaving alot of the daily stockroom functions to myself, to replenish the sales floor with new merchandise."
bad,I keep the store organized and help on register when needed. the thing I dont like about the job is that they dont give out enough hours to employees.
bad,"This is a good place to get your experience, but isn't a good place to keep working after a while. Can be very challenging at times and hard work because you'll get a lot of rude customers. Also it's a lot of work because it seem like no matter how much you clean the store is still unorganized."
bad,This was the worst job ever. the management work together and they don't care about the employees.
bad,"A typical work day at Ross is openingr closing the store, helping customer, guiding associates, answering phones, cleaning and organizing the store, handling cash, operating a computer. The hardest part of my job is always closing the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is providing great customer servioce and putting a smile on my customers face."
bad,"As a part time employee, it is just that i have been getting 5-10 hours a week.:(people can't live off of two days a week less then 10 hours a week. Then they put you on schedule and cancel you at least twice in a week....I would not have any one work for Ross.. Lack of communication with Managers and there own team leads.   Every Ross I worked at (6) Ross i have worked at, all of them have terrible management and terrible lead people..  All of them are not management material..The stockroom is always a mess. Floors are never free from pins, hard tags, papers, I have never once seen or heard of any one mopping the floors in stockroom. The leadership (managers too) talk bad about there employees. I have told people in leadership of the issues I have had they do nothing about it.. They tell me i can't talk to anyone about this issues, that there 1-800 alert line is not for that, but they won't give you information to talk to a person about it(CAN'T TALK TO MANAGER BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING ABOUT  IT).  and you show up for a 4 hour shift they send you home after 2 hours, how crazy is that!!!!    I am looking for a new job because I can't count on this one to pay my bills..It doesn't even pay my gas to get there for two days i might work.. I have been with Ross for 8 years the worst job ever..They hire like 6-8 people giving them 2 days a week 4 hours and think they are going to stay..  All they can say is it's the ROSS WAY!!! . People need to live, can't on those hours...And people that have been with Ross for years get the same treatment, cut hours.. I could go on and on about Ross"
bad,Unorganized management and authority; the work place was flooding at time due to rain seeping into the stockroom. No one worked in the the evening for stock room.
bad,Store manager never helps with customers or employees. Bad attitudes. Oxford Ms is overall a good store just bad management. The store is somewhat clean. You can find most things. They always have great deals.
bad,"Management changes constantly, but Expect consistent low pay and unprofessional management. The employees who worked at Ross for 10 years made the same amount of money as the new hires"
bad,"They only have part time positions. I worked in the stock room which was fast paced unloading merchandise and placing in appropriate bins then tagged handbags, luggage, clothing and shoes then rolled out to the floor to stock the shelves."
bad,Hard work 😓 for everyone else who actually are faithful to their job and don’t call out . Full time employees have to work mostly mid shifts and nights . 3:00 pm to 11:00 pm . Holiday hours ... you work until 2:00 am to 3:00 am . Holiday time is very stressful .
bad,"This was a toulgh  job but you get used to working here. Its Ross. Its expected to be busy. When I worked here, I would be working in the dressing room to doing racks of go backs that are mostly dresses then all of a sudden I hear my named called out from the speaker to be up at the front to be cashier, so I felt I was running around like a chicken without its head. Even worse having to pick up every single shirt or clothing that has been dropped, thrown or yanked out of a hanger because a customer go out of control shopping. I would pick up after them once they leave that aisle. but other than this job had benefits 41k and health benefits."
bad,Ross is a great place for high school students looking for a job. If you're anyone that has any sort of skill set/education do yourself a favor and stay far away.
bad,I like doing the fitting room and greeting the customers and putting the clothes back in the right place intentionally. The management was fair. The hardest part was standing on my feet. I enjoyed this job but it was temporary.
bad,my experience was not a very pleasant one.due to the fact that when i was promoted supervisor a few months later my entire management team was dismissed and there was not concrete management associates where working their own schedules and doing whatever they wanted. It was alot of favoritism and i no longer wanted to apart of this company. I like teamplayer and motivators and inspirators in my circle and when higer management isnt striving for it you get a poor team and i felt to move forward elsewhere
bad,Management is poor Schedule is all over the place pay sucks paid bi weekly too much gossip drama and b.s. then again I worked with all girls lmao... I worked there for a few months then immediately put in my two weeks. I wanted to just walk out SO BAD. It's a cool place to shop but not to work!
bad,"Not my favorite job, I applied to be a stock associate got stuck doing everything else along with stocking regularly. Management doesn't appreciate staying late to get work done or picking up extra shifts when people call off, there's definitely a favoritism thing going on here. I don't recommend working here."
bad,"Ross is the most worse store i ever worked , yes beats WALMART ! the managers are biased ! they don’t know how to properly coach you or speak to you in private . it’s always one sided with them . if you make mistakes they take you off the schedule ! so in order to be on the good side you have to kiss a** and be liked . the hours barely make a poor mans rent ! and then ofcourse you have managers that don’t know how to manage"
bad,"This company cares more for a matrix system and how much work they can pile up on 1 worker. Young supervisors are  arrogant and more into themselves.  "
bad,"Unless you plan on being with Ross for the rest of your life, don't stay for more than 6 months. Ross is temporary. Whole place is just trash and not worth it"
bad,Management needs to be more fair and organized. They should offer more benefits. They only give benefits to full time but the problem with that is that they keep you at part time unless your going for a supervisor or management position. There is no checks and balances for the management. Alot of favoritism goes on.
bad,"Didn't benefit me at all,not enough hours and not enough support.Nothing is promised.Management was horrible ,love to shop at Ross but did not have the benefits I needed."
bad,"Did not want to work with you and your schedule. Always had to cover shifts for people that called in. It is super busy and packed during the holidays. Do not work her if you are a family person. They do not care that you have family and do not put that into consideration. As a cashier you have to be fast, you have to meet a percentage."
bad,"I applied for full time yet got part time. Managers show favoritism! Team members act like managers because of seniority! Everyday someone will tell you what you’re doing wrong! No chance at promotions barely, and work hours are terrible. If you have a complicated schedule they don’t want or care for you. Sick days are taking as a joke. They talk behind your back. Customers feel way too entitled! Rude people all around tbh.  You kinda slow on the register? WRITE UP. You left clothes in fitting room? WRITE UP! Register short $5? WRITE UP!"
bad,"Not appreciative. Does not want to keep employees more than about five years, always looking for younger and younger employees. Upper management bands together to move you out. I worked with the worst manager in ABQ, she’s opening a new store and she treats everyone like a piece of garbage. She has her own rules and it’s her way not Corporate ways. I called hr several times on her and "
bad,"Was okay at first until they started messing with my availability... not worth the headache, in your face favoritism, no flexibility, to many nights leaving after midnight."
bad,"My job is only part time and seasonal, I only get 3 days a week!! I mostly do markdowns, and we have to do the whole store, and if we finish doing the markdowns for that week you will not be needed. So what hours you are scheduled isn't guaranteed!! And I thought working for a smaller retail store would have no drama in it... Wrong, the management at my store is all about favoritism. I went to the store manager about another manager ignoring an associate and asking to speak to that manager to see what we should do. She didn't show up until 20 minutes later when we finished the task? And I was watching her all she was doing is talking to AP then walked right past us and still didn't say anything. My store manager was defending her saying ""well she could have been busy"". "
bad,"The store was very unorganized , people calling out constantly .They never had a plan B , and expected for you to come in on your off day or you would be penalized"
bad,Store Manager is rude and does not act professional  at all with her employees and or customers. Constantly calling down on employees and gives little to no hours to employees.
bad,"No work/life balance."
bad,"Working at Ross, you work long hours. You deal with people stealing, co-workers calling out constantly, customers yelling at you, etc. After leaving respectfully to a higher paying job, the store owner spread a rumor about me. You don't get paid enough for everything that you put up with. You don't realize how horrible people are until you work in customer service."
bad,"When the Belton store opened, I set it up all week. Then when the store opened I worked ONE day a week. The manager hired to many people and ended up having to lay off people. I never got laid off. People busting their butts setting up just to be laid off. My coworkers were friendly and the actual job was descent but the management just screwed us over."
bad,"do not offer flexible hours if you are in school or have another job to get to or come from. the management is very judgemental and sometimes rude, not willing to work with you"
bad,"The management was in one week fired the next. Zero communication, internal management disputes constantly. Zero recognition for the people actually keeping the store together, as the managers took the credit for everything but always had someone to blame when something went wrong. Felt like i was working for a company run but highschool drama queens."
bad,I was very unhappy with this job as their pay was low and the performance appraisals were rare and not in any way fair. The work was hard and way too much for the minimum wage offered. The management often demonstrated favoritism and only gave certain employees praise for their hard work.
bad,"I would inform a friend about working here; however, not at the location I worked at. Management was very messy, barely took breaks, and there were times when I've been the only cashier from 8-2 and no manager would relieve me from a break."
bad,"when i first started it was a decent place to work but over the past couple of years things have changed.  Mangers, are not on the same page about store policies, I feel like scheduling is based on who kisses the most butt."
bad,"to much work for so little people to do tasks"
bad,"If you are a Ross shopper like I am, this is not a bad place to work if you want the little discounts that employees get. The discounts are not that great so don't think that you wont have to pay a decent price for the goods you want. But a discount is a discount."
bad,While I worked at Ross almost every employee was unmotivated to do their jobs and a lot of stuff did not get done. Poor management led to issues and not proper training of employees. There's a timer on the registers which takes away human reaction time because you get punished for not meeting those times. I was seasonal and only there for a month but the store was struggling under the poor management.
bad,cashiers where always backed up lines where long. not enough employees to cover registers. store was always a mess and security did nothing but tell us someone was stealing.
bad,"There was never enough hours, constantly had a new manager. A super demanding job with low pay and no benefits. Never got a bonus or a raise. Horrible company to work with."
bad,"never a set schedule received text if you were working the night before shift "
bad,"very busy.  But I like that.  However, they do not compensate well.  I was a Area Supervisor, but my salary was not any more than my employees.  The stores stay open way longer than other stores.  We would stay open until midnight on normal days, and until 1 around the holidays."
bad,I do not recommend this place. A Co worker and I had some problems that I had took to the supervisor numerous times. My supervisor did nothing about it and I ended up getting fired over it.
bad,Management is always changing staff has a horrible turn out no one stays employed there long before they are almost forced to resign due to lack of hours. Hours are not guaranteed could have 20 on week and 0 the next. No consistency in policy. Its not worth it.
bad,The job itself was cool because you meet new people every day as far as customers. As far as the store manager very bad attitude he doesn't know how to talk to his staff he looks down on them. They do have great discounts if you are an amazing employee
bad,This company has no room for advancement the hours are not equally spaced out.  GOOD FOR ONLY PART TIME WORK I recommend a student for a job here not for a person with major responsibilities
bad,When i left the store was being driven into the ground by the current GM. It was almost beyond repair. Hopefully it has been turned around by now but i doubt it.
bad,A lot of work for a little pay. Management was very rude but I stayed very respectful. Made sure I help all customer in there needs. Picked up things off the floor. Check out customers.
bad,"Once you get in they treat you very kind. They will give you 18-30hrs a week, then as you go along your hours will decrease to 4-12hrs per week. You will have no problem when it comes down to taking time off."
bad,Learned how to utilize customer service in a fast pace environment. Close to home and was easy to find coverage. Customer's different personalities helped me be able to deal with different characters.
bad,"Lack of management"
bad,If you are looking for a fun retail store to work for Ross is the store. A typical day is circling the store and maintaining a clean environment as well as helping at the cashiers.
bad,I have met many interesting people and had some very good experiences through the customers. Management is found to be very lacking.
bad,"1 manager out of 4 was awesome! The store assistant manager was rude, if you ask her a question, she acts like your bothering her and treats customers the same way. Store manager is only around when it's convenient for him, some employees act like they are the Queen or King of Ross. Not a friendly atmosphere.  It's like employees are afraid to talk and joke with each other.  Not a place to build friendships, and that's sad."
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of cleaning the aisles, and standing throughout the whole day."
bad,"Ran  the Customer Service Desk"
bad,"Completely unsatisfied with this job. Was told I would be a cashier/sales associate, but once hired, I was a stockroom associate. Having to handle packaging & unloading trucks. That was definitely not a part of the job description. Not being able to keep up with the other team members due to inexperience in stockroom, they made fun of me."
bad,This is a place where I felt I worked too much for little recognition. It's a busy store so the more customers the more mess. Management there is terrible. They think being a manager means sitting in an office all day and not helping out the employees. I learned  that no matter how hard you work you will never advance there.
bad,"Stock Shelves"
bad,"A typical day at work involved cashiering, customer service and  up keep of the floor."
bad,"A typical day working at Ross was mostly a Disaster. The customers were rude 75% of the time which never really bothered me anyways. The management was OK. The hardest part of the job is just mainly have to deal with rude people, Other then that the job is OK."
bad,This company can be a very motiving and fullfiling job. Yet the fact that managers dont know how to appreciate their employees makes it a hard place to advance in. They dont know how to help individuals with career advancement or to develope them.
bad,A typical work day was 2 hours. The store manager could care less about you or your family. I had a son that would get sick and she would get upset if I had to call out. The pay was horrible and they didn't think enough of their employees to even give us a gift card for christmas. There wasnt't even any heat in the stockroom during winter months so you would freeze. Doing this job did provide me with book-keeping skills that I may be able to use in the future. This company was basically every man for themself. I enjoyed my fellow co-workers and that was the only thing I enjoyed about this job.
bad,Performance- based job in a warehouse environment. The hardest part of the job was working at a fast pace but still not getting compensated for your work.
bad,Customer Service Cashiering
bad,"So not my style, everything is disorganized, including management! One manager says one thing, and the next says something completely different! On my feet ALL day at Front Service Desk.Worked there while I was pregnant, and they would get mad if I was late from my 30 min break! Totally unfair treatment, another girl who was also pregnant had the same position I had, but she could be on break for HOURS!! The only way to get in the door here, is if you know somebody there (specifically family), and that is the only way they will treat you fairly! WORST JOB OF MY LIFE! Being somewhat OCD, I need things to be neat and in the correct place. This is not what you will find at ROSS!"
bad,it wasnt steady the job didnt pay much ...and the work was extremly difficult
bad,I worked there in the past and worked 12-16 hour days and only quit to persue a diff career and they won't hire me back after all I did for them when I was employed there.
bad,The store itself is great. Great bargains.
bad,"poor management, the best part of the job for me was the day i quit"
bad,Okay job for high school students who need some pt hours and pt money. If your looking for a company with whom you can grow with its really hard. Management shows a lot of favortism and it makes it hard to advance.
bad,Customers friendliness is top priority. We drive sales by maintaining a professional work environment. Assuring all returns are executed to reflect on inventory.
bad,"Management could be a lot better."
bad,"For Ross Dress For Less, There remains an opportunity to grow in other areas of the company expanding on one's abilities from a cashier to area supervisor to loss prevention, stockroom lead."
bad,"I recommend to not apply at ross. The manager is rude and does not know how to speak to the employees. Their hours ARE NOT flexible and it took me a week to do my orientation and their walkthrough took 10 minutes! I've been working there for little bit now and I'm still asking questions. Also, the other workers don't do anything and you should know when you're new they give you the worst job that no one wants to do. The store is extremely dirty they do not mop or broom. AND I'm currently a student in high school and I have to clock out at 2:00 am and I have to get up for school at 5:00 am and when I asked for different hours they denied it. Lastly, they always forget to send me on breaks and lunch. Those are the reason why I quit Ross and also should be the reason why you shouldn't apply"
bad,"Ive never worked with such incompetent staff before. Kids thats been out of highschool for maybe 1-2 years that work there, doesnt do their job, lazy, and will complain to HR and try to get you fired if you try to “coach” them to do better. Its not a place worth working for if you just want headaches and go home in a worse mood than you arrived in. Ross does not handle business very well and the store managers are hardly ever around to answer questions  or just be there for their area supervisors . $11 an hour and no drug test  good luck to those who are there  just dont get promoted. You may regret it."
bad,So been there almost 3 years better shrink numbers than in the stores history only 1 rated team in a district of 30+ stores and have only received 2 minimum wage increase promised promotion only to be told that the job went to some one less qualified (because I am no fluent in Spanish) otherwise great place to work if you want to work weekends
bad,I started my career at a north tx location and loved it! Both the management and the employees were amazing. I then transferred to a Dallas location and have never felt more disrespected in a job setting. The amount of unprofessional acts that go on is ridiculous. I advise everyone looking into this job to make sure you like the general manager before committing.
bad,"it's honestly an easy job, you just make sure to help make the department recovered, help others that need help. A down side would be customers. They think Ross is worse than Walmart and leave it trashed. Holiday season is bad, customers are not respectful. Also they get angry over a price, it's a discounted store people; the price is already lowered! There are some good employees, but a lot of people that should be fired because of call offs or insubordinate. Don't be that person if you're applying for Ross or ANY JOB!"
bad,"The management team of the store was great, they always did the best they could with what corporate decided to nitpick. The manager is pretty great at standing up for his employees but corporate only cares about working you to the bone. You need to scan and bag as fast as humanly possible and you need to always say hi to every customer even if they're a distance away which makes customers feel like we're standing over them. They also want the stock team to work harder instead of efficiently by coming up with ridiculous rules that aren't needed. The sales floor is always a mess due to not having enough staff, stock team complains all the time about having to do more than they should due to not having enough people scheduled, call outs, and being unable to schedule people when needed due to being over the budget. Frankly the most enjoyable part about this job is going home. I've learned that no matter how hard I work, no matter how much effort I give, I will never work hard enough to satisfy corporate. Corporate sucks."
bad,Management was a mess. Scheduling is never consistent and even if you're lucky enough to get a full time position the odds of you getting your days off that you need is slim to none. They have a very high turn over rate for a reason.
bad,"They tried to refused my pay I could never understand it lol. I worked always and did the shifts no one wants. But for an odd reason this mean lady boss just didn't care. When I asked about my check after 6 weeks of working over 40 hours a week lol she gave me every excuse. Oh it never came or it was sent through the mail. Then she said it was a pay card??? Then she said she hadnt recieved it. I love the clothing and merch but I can not work where I dont get paid. She got mad when I asked what was going on. Long story short, I had to call labor board on her. It took a while but I got paid and she refused to send a pay stub. Smh!"
bad,Don’t work here if you have school it’s insane ammounts of hours and you don’t get benefits until your full time if they decide to hire you and the process takes months although it’s promissed after 9 weeks
bad,"The work load is over the top and the expectation to get everything done in a timely manner is extraordinarily impossible at times. I’m a fast paced worker, but to get everything stocked fast and correctly in under 15 mins is impossible. Unless they want everything just thrown every which way without any accountability. The pay is low and they require the stock people to wear slacks and blue shirt which is not comfortable. They should be allowed to wear jeans instead of slacks and tennis shoes."
bad,Customer service should be the first priority. Management gives customer service a back seat to the speed of all transactions from the front of the store to the backroom.
bad,"This company asks a lot of their employees for the little pay that they are offered. Many times I had to deal with very escalated issues and when ideas were given to help prevent those management essentially shut them down. They want to give the stores so little hours, yet expect the store to be impeccable with no line."
bad,"Dont work for Ross if you have two jobs they hate it. Their "" policy"" is you stay til the whole truck is done. At my store I would never go home.you get yelled at if you ask to go home after you ask to go home after being scheduled til 5 and your still there at 9. Yelled at for things that's out of your control. Very short staffed. This company is just toxic."
bad,"I worked at Ross less than six months and in that six months I felt very taken advantage of. Not saying all of them are like that, but the one I worked at was a joke. "
bad,"The work environment was horrible, clothes everywhere, disrecptpful co-workers it was just a mess and did not pay enough nor gave a lot of hours but they were pretty flexible."
bad,"The management is okay-ish very nice but the people who are hired are almost always lazy or very slow. Most of the people are nice but there is a lot when are outright rude in front of the mangers and nobody bats an eye. The store is always messy and never seems to get fully cleaned, with the state of the store in terms of cleanliness it is no surprise there is also a load of safety problems such as open electrical sockets 6 inches away from the sink."
bad,"Retail is overall a good job to have it teaches you several good lessons, but ROSS is hard to feel welcomed as a part time, rude costumers will harass cashiers and ""security"" (loss prevention) is not allowed to interfere."
bad,Every shift we would have a part of the store we were in charge of organizing and taking anything that wasn’t suppose to be in that section. The rest of my shift I would be up on the register and throughout the day I would run breaks for myself and other cashiers. 30 min before the end of my shift I would get off the register to check returns for markdowns and organize them before running them back out on the shelf. The management was alright my store had been through 5 store managers for the 2 and 1/2 years I was there. There were some managers who were demeaning towards employees and called some employees names. Some of the employees myself included called corporate several times but nothing was ever done about it. Overall it was a good job. Being a Front End Supervisor was challenging but that’s what made the job fun.
bad,"I hated working here it was depressing. Every shift I cried during my breaks, its all fast pace and never a smile on anyone's faces. Forcing you to stay longer even though I was still in high school at the time, but did not cared due to my age of 18."
bad,"The lack of appropriate management made the environment more stressful than it needed to be. The team members carried the weight of management. Additionally, a lot of team members were untrustworthy with their time. Many called in sick frequently."
bad,"Management wasn't great. Cut hours randomly very unexpectdly, majority of the time it was understaffed. I learned what team work really was and it didn't also follow through there."
bad,Overall better management is needed as well as more hours given and more raises and appreciation to their dedicated workers.I learned at this job that no matter how hard you work you will never be appreciated. But the most enjoyable part of my job would have to be some of my daily customers and also some of my coworkers.
bad,"working at Ross over the years.I am outgoing person and very professional with a warm friendly smile,I started on stock room then throw on floor 2 months later of hired due my charisma to interact with customers,I have all this time trying to get a full time job and never got it is a ""Click""in each  store and this made by Managers and area sup.if you don't have Blue eyes you never will be employe of the month ,trainee member etc never,never,never not matter how long you work there..Mgrs do not like Smart people.."
bad,"They do not let you leave at your scheduled time to leave, when the stores closes you’re there an hour or more still cleaning up after your scheduled time to leave, you are not allowed to talk to your coworkers, they will be rude to you if you call out sick from work. I asked them if they needed a doctors note for me being in the hospital and they said no, but wrote me up."
bad,"Part time is said to be 15-20 hours a week. "
bad,"The work setting was very unprofessional. Their were multiple managers on duty with conflicting instructions; no communication. Little-to-no applicable training on new tasks. Cold and unwelcoming coworkers. Filthy environment. Overall, not a pleasant place to work."
bad,"I started working here cause i actually like the store, but as time went on and only getting 11.00 a week it got annoying really quick. store closed at 10:30 the closing shift didnt leave untl 12 because we had to clean what the morning and mid shift left. Favoritism played a roll ,i quit because they didnt care about my safety or the fact that 11.00 hours a week is only busfare to get to my job. I still love Ross but i cannot work for them"
bad,"Unwilling to work with scheduling needs. Lack of communication among management. Uncaring if sick, ill, or have immediate family emergencies. Inconsistent hours. Unable to advance even after several years of experience. Unsafe work conditions as well as on the job injuries. Corporate doesn't listen to employee concerns. No decent air conditioning/heater, controlled by region. Selective favoritism by management. Hardly any sick time and no paid vacation or health benefits. Employees encouraged/made to call anonymous number to report each other or managers at any time. Understaffed during busy hours. Horrible customers and customer service altogether. Very strict guidelines and policy, can be fired for seemingly small things. Only benefit would be the discount off merchandise. You will hate your job, people, managers, and feel you cannot succeed outside of Ross. That is the type of environment they create there. Please do not work at Ross."
bad,Management ruled with an iron fist. The operation ran more like a military combat mission and less like customer service. It was generally a dread just to be there.
bad,"Mejor salario, mejores condiciones de trabajo, mejor ambiente de trabajo, tiene que mejorar en todo."
bad,"When I worked at Ross I was told go to that register, dont move until I tell you! When asking information I got information from key employees I could trust"
bad,Some people love working for this company but I personally couldn't see why. My schedule sucked and the pay was even worse. It wasn't enough to support
bad,Working for this place was not the best. Working for this company for almost 2 years and not once was i ever recognized for my work. They wouldn't let you know your work schedule in advance.
bad,I worked my 1 year at Ross and it was pretty bad. There were no standards and no one supported each other. If you truly care about where your working then do not work here.
bad,"Fun environment but sometimes very hectic and poorly managed. Breaks are sometimes not acknowledged, along with lunches not taken according to the company schedule."
bad,"Mucha desorganizacion en el piso, los clientes nos tratan mal, los baños no funcioman so lo ecalo como 0%"
bad,"There was a lot to do. You do not only have one job they put you on everything all day."
bad,"lack of leadership stepping up to address issues. management sits around, there is no accountability. professional treatment of associates and customers. blatant disregard by managers to follow rules and procedures."
bad,The job was horrible the hours were long and management did not care for the employees. Worked here  briefly because the pay was minimum wage with long hour and a lot of manual labor.
bad,Poor management. lack of leadership. never know from one day to the next what is going on. NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. 9 hours a day plus saturdays. well over 50 hours a week at work.
bad,They don't provide any benefits and you never know if you're going to get 12 hours a week or 26 or anything in between. It's impossible to budget with such unreliable hours.
bad,"This is not a job that I can see as a long term place to work, when working with this company the I have not had a chance to become a full time employee after four years of being at this company, if you want a job that could be a second job then this would be a good job to have but if you want a job that you can move up in and have it as a long term job then it's not a job for you."
bad,New applicants BEWARE! Particularly young applicants and those who are desperate to find a job. The senior employees meaning those who have been there for more than 2 years are suffering because they can easilly hired new ones which they can fool like baby by giving more schedule hours. You will be working real tough for a minimum pay. Racial descrimination favors the caucasian and those who have connection with the manager.
bad,It was an awful place to work.  Don't bother going above your duties they will be over looked.  It was dirty terrible hours and unorganized. no advancement and just overall terrible.
bad,"they over work youand they give you false since of job security,not enough to pay bills,and the abuse from management,after they hire you your on your owen"
bad,"they skimp on hours, managers are the worst. They seem to treat the good ones that are loyal to the company and the job poorly. They play favorites. This job is the perfect second job for extra money, dont make it your only job."
bad,"they gave me a book of job description and then when asked for (per the book) for policy and documentation; they stated and I quote ""well we're not that type of store""  so ok explain what type our we. why can you not answer direct questions?  per the book that does not supposed apply to me and why was it given?"
bad,The manager would down rate employees in front of customers and other employees. They would not allow for bathroom breaks unless you threatened to go on yourself. This place is horrible.
bad,I always felt so stressed in this work environment and I was only a sales associate. Management was so strict and picked on only specific people. You had to finish your transaction in less than 2 minutes or you get talked to. It was horrible
bad,Job was okay except scheduling was not to employees advantage. Long hours of work and little pay. Enjoyed meeting new people and interacting with customers.
bad,"I worked there for a few months but I started to see preferences between manager and employees, the manager always got mad whenever I could cover another employee's shift."
bad,"I learned a lot and developed some great experience, but the management is horrible.  They schedule part timers randomly at one point I did not have a shift for three weeks.  They will even change the schedule the day before and not notify the employee.  It was incredibly unstable and inconsistent.  Furthermore, half of the management team will hide in the office when there is a lot needed to be done on the floor."
bad,"I worked at this company for a few months and hated it. I was hired as a stock and while it was nice the first few days, it quickly became a nightmare to work for. The back room was full of people who liked to gossip about each other. Even the managers would join and talk trash about former employees."
bad,"I was a seasonal part-timer for this company for the holiday months. people and managers were good, but hours and pay were poor."
bad,"ROSS cares little for the customer and pushes employees at register (front end) to call next in line before even finishing the current transaction. Weekly count of how fast employees are able to bag the merchandise and move the line. Forget about having your clothing nicely folded. Speed results in clothing torn when the ""hard tags"" are removed. A good assitant manager of 15 years was fired when the new store manager didn't get along with her- no company loyalty to employees."
bad,I worked at Ross for a while during the summer. I was hired as a part associate. Four months of hard work I was reward in the form of being laid off.
bad,"Not my ideal place to work. I am over qualified for my position, not a team work environment, management is only focused on self. Task given are not realistic, poor support as a company, counterparts don't support each other."
bad,I was told i was gonna be a packer and then they put me as a tilt tray assistant horrible workplace. Barely any training i was harassed almost on a daily basis.Then they called me and let me go without a last paycheck immediately.
bad,I worked for this company in 2011. Management was terrible. The company expects 110% from staff and offers nothing in return.
bad,nothing really amazes me here. this job is horrible. do not get any hours. can barely pay bills. its not what you expecting. no advance to move up in company.
bad,"poor work life balance, although they do have adequate vacation policy, Simple merchandising, poor leadership and Corporate support"
bad,I only worked here so long because I needed a job and could find nothing better. I am thankful for the experience I received as far as management but I would not want anyone I know to work for this company if I could help it.
bad,"was to repetative and when it came to doing our jobs managment just had us get it done quick and not properly. ""just make it look good don't worry about doing right"" was something i was constintly told."
bad,Stressful. Didn't like it. To each is own. Blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
bad,"working  the cashier when im not doing markdowns and also helping in the"
bad,Ross is a job. Nothing to look forward to making a career out of.
bad,"Customers were great to have in store, employees worked very hard everyday to complete tasks required in a short windows of time given, no payroll hours to work with, therefore, unable at times for employees to complete their work assignments, leaving management to complete, which was ok, yet again no payroll to schedule enough people to help customers in line."
bad,"A Ross work day is always a busy day. I learn re-ticking, refund or exchange items for customers, and process item to the sales floor. In my position as an FES (Front-End Supervisor) I give excellent service to my fellow associates because we are team and coach them to provide excellent customer. also as a FES I coach my associates to build great productivity in the store. Ross co-workers are very patient and give enthusiasm with every task, customers, and fellow associates. I'm the type worker that is a team player and care about the customers, so the hardest part of my job is clocking out when I'm on register and there is a long line of customers or and when the been slammed with items everywhere and we are short handed. what enjoy about my job is to see and hear that a customer is satisfied with every thing they purchase and excited about Ross prices."
bad,"You learn how to do different types of job positions there, The management isn't all that serious about their job, more excited about goofing off with the other management. They are Not too concerned about their employees, just make sure that the job is done. Co-workers all complain about either missed hours or having to get the job done way before the expected time allowed. Other than that, All co-workers are great to work with. Enjoyable part of the job.... learning experience and waiting to go home."
bad,I just stopped working at the Ross that opened in Plant city fl about a month and a half ago. I worked in the stock room where we would get tons of clothing every day mon-fri. The stock room team is extremely underpaid only getting 7.79/hr. When the store first opened we were all promised no more than 25 hours per week. 2 weeks later everyones hours were cut back I only worked between 10-12 hrs a week. and on top of that they were still HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES!!!!! WTH?? Im glad I don't work there anymore its really not worth it. But ill deff still shop there lol
bad,A typical day at work was terrible. This company has no standards for whom they hire as managers. I had to deal with a chauvinist manager until the day I decided to quit. Co-workers were sweet but far overworked. The most enjoyable part of the job were the breaks from people and the superiors. 
bad,started day off with huddle meeting to get information about work for the day then went on to work if there was even work available most of the time their was not so i would be transferred to another department for the amount of time that work is available. i learned alot about warehouses here. i learned how to work many positions and utilize the necessary tools and equipment to get the job done. this was also the most enjoyable part of the job. finally the hardest part was the fact work was scarce and i could never tell if i was going to be working the next day or not
bad,"Dont work here!! its hard work, and does not pay off very well, unless you are in management. You dont get paid enough to deal with customer b/s and management b/s. "
bad,Horrible Training Crew hectic 24/7 and is a horrible pay rate for so much work 
bad,"They over work there employees, they often put hourly employees in mgmt positions during peak season (X--mas) give them the title and keys but dont compensate them for it. The most and employee can get on a raise is .25 per year. Cashiers are often terminated if their cash is short 3 times but the problem with this is that cashier is not allowed to verify that the till has correct of amount of cash.A till may be 10.00 short to start and cashier   "
bad,"Not a good place to work, messy store, bad store manager, little wages"
bad,"I wish I could give a better review, however, there was a lot going on in the place that is disagreeable. You go in, clock in at the registers which I feel like is a disadvantage because if it busy, there may not be a place to clock in. You just keep up the store to look good and check people out and work the fitting room. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who do not do anything and having to pick up their slack after pulling 10 hours. The enjoyable part would be getting off and going home."
bad,Since new management change store has become very intense and people dont like to work for her
bad,Usually a busy place with long lines and customers are often rude and impatient. Management does not work around your school schedule. Hours are not guaranteed and can be cut any given week.
bad,Though I did enjoy working with the people I met at Ross overall it was the worst experience I have ever had in a retail environment. The employees are worked beyond there means and expected to fullfill corporate policies under awful environments. Minimum wage pay with only one raise a year. No benefits and only 3 or 4 full time employees in everystore.
bad,"This job does not have much advancement, but can be fun. If you are looking for a job that is just as a second income or a college student looking for some extra money this is a good place to work."
bad,Great stepping stone or temporary job until your career lands. Not somewhere I would stay long term especially this location. Retail is tricky overall.
bad,it not a job that is for anyone looking to grow a career unless you are ready to kiss a lot of butt to grow you career with them or if you are a good looking young female
bad,"Do not give associates enough hours, dm does not support newly promoted managers just apply pressure to meet goals too little pay. Too much turnover between managers and employees. Not enough training for new managers no dm support."
bad,It was a slow morning usually which would give me time to set up my area and start working on my assigned tasked given to me on the clipboard. I check customer out and make sure they are satisfied with their shopping experience and greeted with a friendly conversation while checking out. Knowing how to resolve problems quick on my feet. Being polite and clam during every situation that may arise throughout the day. Having to relive people from their areas and making sure everyone was rotating at their correct times so they can punch in and out on time for break and lunch.
bad,Don’t ever work here they treat people unfair and don’t pay enough for all the work they have you do. They only choose their favorite people. I won’t waste my time working here ever again
bad,Some good coworkers but management leaves much room for improvement. They tell you one thing and then change there mind without telling anyone. Then if you need extended tine off and are not one of the favorites you are given the 9th degree of questioning.
bad,"I would not recommend working with Ross. Very bad treatment,  very discreaminating, not nice environment. Very little hours offered per week. Management not trained to work with people. Management having favorites between their own race. Never compliment or praise the good work. Worst company ever that I worked."
bad,"For the amount of money you are being paid, the job is not worth it.  There is a consistent lack of employee and manager support, especially when you need them to do things so you can complete your job.  Consistently understaffed, I was asked every night to stay an extra 3+ hours because they ""forgot"" to schedule someone after me.  And when I refused due to obligations, management would guilt trip me.  If I was being paid $15/hour I could stomach it.  Management also did not care about your availability.  From the beginning I had told them I could not work sunday mornings for religious reasons.  They consistently scheduled me Sunday mornings anyway and always said they would fix it in the system, even though they never did.  Management also would go to employees looking for any dirt they could get on each other to get each other fired.  Just don't work here, go somewhere else with less stress and more money. I quit after only a couple months.          PROS: It's a job.  CONS: Everything else"
bad,"Working at Ross for me ended up being the worse job I've ever had, to much work place thief and when reported to the hotline nothing is ever done. To much work place drama, and when reported to manager there is no privacy because they all gossip with other employees. Just a nonprofessional environment overall. Only the managers favorite gets hours."
bad,"The management was okay but hours where long. "
bad,Bad experiences. The worst manager. Bad culture workplace. The client on the fitting room are despicable. The pay for job is minimal. The cleaner for restroom is responsability of personal on the fitting room
bad,"The store is always a mess. There are never enough associates available for any shift. Poor communication between associates and management. In comparison to other similar retail stores, there is something lacking. They need a fresh pair of eyes and insight"
bad,They expect to much of you when they don't give back a quarter of what u put in. Their extremely technical with everything and your being timed on everything you do and you have to do it in a specific order in a certain amount of time or you get written up. The only way to find out ur schedule is by you having to go in and physically logging in to there computer to Veiw it. Worst part of it all is the poor pay and lousy hours they give you. There's no room for advancement cuz they don't want to pay you more for over time or full time at that. I seen people that have been there for over 14 yrs that still haven't made it full time yet and it's sad. I was only given 3-4 hrs a day 2-4 days out of the week if I was lucky. It's a great store to work for if only they changed how they treat their workers.
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend working here. The store is always understaffed and managers only care about meeting their numbers. I worked in stockroom and fitting room. Stockroom was usually severely understaffed, and if we didn’t hit the required box count per hour, we were chewed out individually. Fitting rooms were always hectic and since we were always understaffed it took forever for anyone to cover for breaks/lunches (have gone several shifts not getting a break at all because no one came to cover the fitting room after repeatedly asking my managers). After asking to be switched to registers or the floor, was told that “everyone had to learn all the positions first in order to switch” but since I’ve worked here these have been the only two positions I’ve been put in? The hours are not so much a problem but it’s not worth it. This company shows a lot of favoritism and I can see why so many people quit. Could barely stomach the summer months I worked here. The only saving grace was the enjoyable coworkers who made working here bearable. I saw how poorly they (and eventually I) were being treated and decided this was not the place for me."
bad,"rude management and terrible employee treatment and unreasonable expectations. Offers and job requirements given in the interview change at any given time, due to managements desires."
bad,"I was full-time, benefitted, customer service, worked every department, 40+ hours. Ross took benefits away (save money) by cutting my hours to 14 p/wk"
bad,It’s a busy job management sucks they pay 11 but will work u pretty decent discount fast paced shifts go fast staff r cool lil but unscripted n unprofessional
bad,"Ross is a poorly managed and very understaffed business. Their attempts at maximizing their profits ultimately result in pushing a 10 person job onto 3 or 4 people. The small pay increases offered for a higher position are nowhere near worth all the extra work and stress they unload onto you. Overall, terrible place to work."
bad,The grunt hourly employees of Ross make it run. Every full time employee has given up long ago. They talk a big game of employing from within but if you don't make it into the click you can go f yourself. I worked for 2 years and doing everything I could just to get passed over for the managers friend.
bad,"In a sentence: soul-crushing hellhole."
bad,Worked at ross in dt Seattle. ..loved that place. Great pay..everything. Moved to Orlando. ..hated ross store there. Poor management hours pay everything!  So it does matter where/what store one works at.
bad,"Honestly, this was the worst place I've worked at by far. The managers were rude and hardly put effort into training their new employees. They were not very flexible with scheduling, even if you are a full-time student at a university. They are also very strict with uniforms and don't allow ANY piercings, aside from ONE earring on each ear. The job was boring, stressful, and honestly drained me of any life enjoyment. I dreaded waking up everyday to head into that mess of a place. I highly recommend looking around some more before applying..."
bad,"I worked here for almost three years.  I was in charge of fitting room.  Once they got rid of fitting room my hours were cut down to 12 a week.  She refused to train me anywhere else because you are timed as a cashier and in stock.  I explained to her you have to start somewhere.  But she gave me no other choice but to look elsewhere.  Management was great at the beginning but then the cliques, and favoritism showed."
bad,"If you’re in desperate need of a job and no place else will hire you, this is the place for you. Otherwise, it’s a toxic work environment that will have you demoting your self worth. Management sucks. Nothing is ever granted."
bad,Unless you are really desperate for a job I wouldn’t recommend it. Unless you were stock or on the sales floor loss prevention there’s nothing you can do but watch people steal you aren’t supposed to stop them in any way.
bad,Typical day at work could be stressful due to month of that year or holidays. What I learn was how to care for customers and give best coustmer service as possible. Management was really poor. Workplace and culture could be overwelmeming at times. Hardest part of the job was being timed on transactions and working fast with a long line of customers. Most enjoyable job was nothing.
bad,"Management was very poor ,each one gave different instructions ,the assistant manager was decent. The job was very demanding,if your a college student this might not be the best job for you . You only receive hours during seasonal as soon as it's over u won't receive any."
bad,mornings a usually slow at first but once lunch time hits the rush begins and the day gets busy until night time. Management could be better two out of the four are really cool the other two you don't see very much throughout the work day.
bad,"DM is not on top of what goes on with management in store. Shady things that go on with store manager. Managers want all clearance items or anything new that comes in..they act like vultures. They go shopping in local stores on the clock, sit in office eating while we struggle to keep up with customers.Also no hours and you are expected to work with not much help."
bad,"Working for Ross need to know from customer services, to cashier, or stockroom. Its a very friendly place to work but sometimes managers can be very rude."
bad,"A lot of favoritism in the entire warehouse that affected everything from promotion to annual shift changes. As a supervisor the employees are great, upper management was not."
bad,"Working retail just isn't a good idea. Working at Ross is a worse idea. Ross is basically a low end Target and customers treat it that way. There's a lot of expectation for things that not only managers can't get done, but neither can you. I was the markdowns lead for Ross for months and it just wasn't a great job. Biggest problem that Ross has is that they move you around with little to no training. I was scheduled for a shift as Front Desk Lead one morning and I had never done that before. They scheduled me in fitting room and I had never done that before. My first day on register was spent asking for help because they just throw you on there with little training. When I started Markdowns, they had deadlines for us to finish sections by a certain day but while we would scan those sections we also had to clean and organize those departments. Customers absolutely trash Ross, especially during the holidays."
bad,its a great experience but not a jo to try to have  a career in management is horrible all the way down to hr. they change management just as much as the season changes you will definetly learn some new a ross
bad,"No work-life balance, management does not typically care about anything except numbers and getting the job done, always a mess to clean up. Good starter job, but other than that I would not recommend working here if you don't have to."
bad,Certain managers treat other associates unfairly if they don't like them. Very stressful too much work and not enough pay. Unrealistic goals they want you to achieve.
bad,"Upper management very difficult to get along with, always wanting control.  Did not have any empowerment.  Too much politics in this company.  I did not enjoy working for this company."
bad,It was lossy pay I wasn’t able to matains a living with it so I decided to come back home the job was way to much hard work for small pay getting up in the middle of the night lifting sorting before store open but checks close to 300 dollars every two weeks it couldn’t work out for me
bad,"The supervisor didn't work in a professional manner. She made it hard for us employees to work in a friendly environment. The job was very simple, but the management team made it stressful to work."
bad,Working at Ross is very stressful because of how the managers deal with us. Definitely not in a polite nor ideal manner. My coworkers and I are always very stressed.
bad,A typical day at Ross for me there is. When I do the cash office count the money bring all the necessary money and paperwork to the front. Then get asked by certain management why it is up there or what it is doing their would I have not been there for 2 days. Yes there are few good managers that work there and I love working with them but certain managers make it harder to be able to do your job and keep a smile on your face for the great customers that come in.
bad,"Very hard work, intense work on feet for long hours. Hard floors, very hard floors, even the mat you stand on is very uncomfortabl, they really don't train you they throw you on the first day you work and then you just go from there"
bad,Typical retail. High stress and low reward job. Little to no acknowledgement for hard work. Not given many hours unless management. Very low pay per hour. Absolutely no benefits. Management is way too lax and tends to do less work than part-time.
bad,"Working for Ross is a wonderful place to work at, its that they're are too many people who want to be in charge and not a lot of teamwork. If teamwork could be done correctly, Ross would make a lot of money."
bad,"I have never experienced poor management or attitude toward employees anywhere else than this company. Management were constantly on their phones or gossiping in the office. i was left upset many times after a conversation with a manager. Asking for help was not encouraged. I was left alone on register about 90% of the time even f there were 10+ people in line. Customers would take frustration out on me for not having help at registers, when I would call for backup no one would come."
bad,Hours are long with little breaks. Management is careless of hard work conditions. Tiring shifts. Messy atmosphere. Little organization. Closing hours are harsh and prolonged.
bad,You get more work and responsibilities; but not willing to increase your pay. When you have an issue and you follow the chain of command ; Corporate does nothing but allows you to be retaliated against until you quit. You barely get your breaks or lunches because its always a payroll issue where a few can only be scheduled and causes it to be pressure on 3 or 4 people to run the whole store.
bad,"For minimum wage this is an extremely stressful place to work, Job performance didn't matter because favorites were moved up before qualified people were."
bad,"I worked hard and its like no matter what i went through or how i did for the company they dont take care of their employees. They were discriminatory, they caused problems during working days, unprofessional, horrible pay, horrible hours"
bad,"There always cutting off your hours, changing your schedule last minute without letting you know. They seem to just never have enough money to pay associates yet still hiring but cutting off recent associates hours which is not fair. They show alot of favoritism which is also not fair hard work really doesn’t pay off better yet you have to become teachers pet. Worst job in the world."
bad,If you like to work in a workplace where everybody is conspiring against everybody then this is the job for you. management can't care less about what happens. good people leave the job asap after observing the unnecessary drama and lack of care from management.
bad,"Ross dress for less was not clearly the ideal job for me, but it did get me by. I am greatful for the chance to work at Ross. i enjoyed making my everyday customers happy."
bad,The company overall is good but it the store manager i had was so rude and she dont care. She would say rude things to her works and customers. She would over react over nothing but my works were since great people. I was upset up the assist manger that she left cause she was a great works she know about everything and she was going to have her own store. I wanted to transfer to that store cause she was suggest a good person and great work but she didnt get it.
bad,"poor management. if you are not a manager you really do not matter. They do not listen or work with you. the workplace is nice, the managers make you not want to go"
bad,"Ross was a very interesting place to work. I did get most of my customer service there down, dealing with rude and impatient customers all day long. I learned how to control my emotions at this place, also learned that a customer is always right even when they are not. Customer satisfaction guaranteed. It was a stressful job having to clean the entire store, making it descent fir the next morning in such little time. Pay was sad for all the hard work you put into that"
bad,The management extremely lacks personal feelings. The amount of hours you will receive daily is very low. The amount of work you do is very hard for the amount of time that they allow.
bad,You are there to work and get the work out.  If you are having health problems or family emergencies then your absence will count against you.  They do not pay enough for the work that I do there.  I work my butt off and barely have enough to make the rent and get groceries.
bad,"For the time I worked at a certain location, I was constantly promised advancement within the company. Never to see any action past words. The management is at constant odds to one another, acting like vindictive children. No one seems to ever address any issue directly, always doing the bare minimum."
bad,"Unfortunately working for Ross Stores was not a highlight in my retail career. I learned to stand up for my working rights, and to ask the hard questions even when no one was willing to listen. I wish I could say my experience had been better, but the dismal pay for the amount of work done is frustrating. Management was unkind and unhelpful, and while I wish them all the luck, I would not work for this company again."
bad,"The new manager is really new and not quite management material yet. We hardly ever see her around. Most of the management stays in the office all day leaving the stock team and customer service to run things alone, with very little back up. Not a good place to work at if you're under the age of 30.  If you are a teen or in your twenties two of the managers will treat you unfairly, simply because they assume you can't do the job you are given. I've left in tears twice now due to the overly intense criticism from them. And I don't cry often. It is also often understaffed simply for the day. Many of us are doing two to three jobs at a time because they under schedule and say the managers are going to step in to help so they can save money, but then the managers stay in the office for hours at a time. This store is very understaffed and frankly needs corporate to see how they actually treat their associates, because associates are quiting left and right."
bad,"A typical day at started at 11 PM for me since I worked the graveyard shift which was part time. I learned to use computer programs to input stock of the warehouse. I recorded countless item of clothing from jeans to shirts, to swimsuits. Management played their favorites and it's very hard to move up if you are a ""temp"". The hardest part of the job would have to be the lifting of the boxes which were 50+ pounds. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be still having the rest of the day to do whatever you needed to be done."
bad,"The Ross I worked at wasn't such a good Ross. They didn't really care about messiness, they just cared about going home. Some employees were rude. I didn't it like it,the pay wasn't worth it"
bad,Work ...Work will be forced for you to do that even you are not allowed to have a tea break before lunch. Your will never get fat because they won't give you proper time and environment to eat & You will never ever get cold while working in ross because ac's never work. MANAGEMENT SUCKS! And they will NEVER take the time to properly train you.
bad,Wouldn't recommend people to work for this company. To much manager and employee favoritism. People getting away with what they want and not doing their job.
bad,"The Management In Place Are Typically Only Interested In The Opposite-S3x. This Is a Well Know Preoccupation With The Supervisors. "
bad,They don't care about you as a person. They don't care if you have preterm labor they clam you faked it. They don't care about their products at all and they only care about them selves
bad,When the new management came into they did not go by good work ethics it was more about personal advancement regardless of what contracts/ contractors were involved
bad,"I didn't have the best time working with Ross. The manager didn't truly care about your well-being all that was thought of was the business. I got paid minimum wage to deal with people calling me racist, people leaving baby diapers in the dressing room for us to clean up and people actually peeing in the dressing room area."
bad,"Ross was a very fast paced environment, although I didn't mind that, I am a college student and need flexible hours. Sometimes I would get scheduled on days I needed off or times I had class."
bad,This is a work place where you are treated with such disrespect and unfairly. You get taken advantage of. They don't really work with you schedule and the managers have favorites only some people can break the rules and other can't. Don't work here it's really bad and disgusting!! You basically have to train yourself
bad,This store was ok but was in a bad part of town where there was frequent theft and major crimes as well... nice a secured future at all.
bad,"its an ok place to work as long as you are not looking for future advancement or benefits "
bad,Its a very easy job that is somewhat laid back and a great place for meeting new people. The pay is great and the manager are very easy to work with. At this job its many different things to learn where you can advance in this company.
bad,"A typical day at work involves interacting with customers face to face mostly and also over the phone. Some friendly customers others not so friendly.I have learned that the hardest part of a job is not the job itself but the people you work and interact with everyday.Management could be way better, sometimes are not very professional with their approach towards employees, some favoritism and retaliation in the amounts of hours given to some employees, not opportunity to advance or get recognition for a well done job. Most co-workers are fine to work with but others very unethical. What I enjoy the most is dealing with a diversity of people that comes to the store and try to be as helpful as I can to their needs."
bad,"There was a lot of power struggles between managers that made it very stressful for workers like me to deal with. Managers expected you to do things super fast while making absolutely no mistakes, yet only paid 8$ an hour. No competitive pay; every store around us started employees off at 11$ an hour, and our store hadn't changed its pay rate in years. "
bad,"Ross has to be the only retail clothing store that stays open till 11 all week long, except on Sundays, when it closes at 10:30, pointless for retail."
bad,"It was a fast pace workplace, which kept you busy. I enjoyed working with my co-workers because we worked as a team, and we got the job done."
bad,I would go into work and be old to do a bunch of different things barely left work on time and didn't get paid extra for staying late.
bad,"worked 10 years plus for the company. Slowly advanced internally. Luckily when I came into the company the raises were decent, now they barley give you a dime. Short to no breaks often and very little staffing coverage. Staff was worse than high school everyone always gossiping. Management was horrible always changing the schedule without notification and obvious favoritism which included inappropriate relationships. The expectation level for certain employees was set high and others could literally cuss you out and get away with it.The only positive thing about working here is the discount."
bad,Typically don't know what kind of work ill be doing for the day. Store was pretty unorganized. No real training in the beginning. co-workers weren't exactly a team.
bad,"In the short time I worked here I was lied to three times in regards to my pay, and hours.  I was one of the best cashiers however I got the worst shifts and was told I'd be getting raises as I advanced although   I never received them.  The management was rude and played favorites.  One of the biggest problems was that they didn't give scheduled breaks, not just mine but others as well, which is illegal."
bad,"I took this position under the impression that I was going to be a supervisor, yet when the store opened, yes I was responsible for some of the day to day opening and closing duties, my training for the job was less than ideal.  Did not feel that what I did counted or made a difference."
bad,"This job was the typical minimum wage job, with no benefits and few good days. I did my best, however, and excelled at working with the customers."
bad,"Management sucks , everyone either quits or never show up there always called off. Rude customer, working fitting you have to organized clothes by size etc. Plus pick up phone and let people in bathroom. Working on floor they be a lot of returns to do. And once you clean it and continue to your next section everything you did ends up on floor. They called you to register. No one work as a team , worker be on phone, they take super long breaks . Managers have bad communication."
bad,Working as a sales associate for Ross Stores was definitely not the best job I have had. I honestly did not like working there. The management at one point was not good.
bad,"The location I worked at wasn't enjoyable, they didn't want to even work with my college schedule so I would work,school,back to work, then sleep. No time to do my studies."
bad,What can I say. When I worked there I would only get like 12 hours a week. Don't waste your time working here unless you're applying to be a manager.
bad,A typical work day is okay. I've learned how to handle situations from all stands of view. Management weren't the best. Very unorganized and discriminating. My co-workers were great workers. The hardest part of the job was coming to it. The most enjoyable part was going home.
bad,"If you are looking for a job to keep yourself busy, or a job that will work around a schedule for a second job or your studies, this is a company that will be a good fit. With this company you be taught everything from counting the maximum 8 pieces of clothing allowed into the fitting room along with learning how to unload a truck and properly stock the shelves within the store. I would strongly recommend this job for students who just graduated high school to start earning some cash, for every position is part-time with a maximum of 25 hours a week, unless you are aManager, Area Supervisor, or a Store Protection Specialist (SPS). Hardest part of the job is getting ready and driving to the store location on time, everything else is cake walk. Your job is secure as long as you can come to work on time and put some effort to help daily operations of the store. Also, DO NOT exhaust yourself trying to advance into the company, especially if you are a college student and give into their intern program that guarantees a manager position when you graduate, for you will most likely want to move onto much bigger and better career opportunities. This job is not for someone trying to start a career, but I really do recommend this company to allow some flow of income and some job history to slap on your resume."
bad,"It can't get much worse than this. It's great if you never want to make more than minimum wage with poor management. They're all about trying to make you feel good. It feels so fake when they don't pay you properly. The wage will never raise, unless you become a manager. They are obsessed with rushing you through customers that you are unable to give proper service. You are timed on how fast you are with each customer. Better off working in fast food!"
bad,"Good place to start working in retail."
bad,working with this company was very stressful. The management was very demanding and disrespectful.  My coworkers were great to work with but I didn't make enough money to do what the wanted me to do. I eventually moved on from that job to something a little better
bad,"I worked part time at the Ross store on Gen Mc Mullen and Commerce in San Antonio, Tx. There was only one good manager she was just an assistant. All other assistant's and store manager had horrible work ethic. The managers were always in their office doing nothing but eating. Management would impose job duties on me that were not part of my job description such as cleaning toilets!! I was just a sales associate!"
bad,Worked in the Stock room sorting merchandise and unpacking. Would unload truck and put merchandise away on sales floor. I also worked as a cashier and fitting room personnel.
bad,My store experiences high traffic and is often subject to chaos and disorganization. This greatly affects any hopes of advancement and there is a higher level of stress for such a low paying job. I recommend this job as a temporary or summer job to gain experience or for the first year of college.
bad,"It was a good job for extra money, but there was no benefits and no room to advance. Poor working conditions and poor management."
bad,"Minimum wage, tons of work, late nights/early mornings departure. Be prepared, wear shoes that are comfortable and have thick skin. The customers are unpredictable."
bad,"the ross experience wasn't a great experience i was a shift leader and before that i worked out on the floor and stock room, management didnt take pride in working for their company and alot of the employee's really saw it as just a job, i knew it wasnt the type of enviroment i wanted for myself, which is why i seeked out a better opertunity."
bad,A typical day was we would clean up the sales floor creating a nice shopping display. We would help customers with questions. I learn that ross is not a very good place to work for. The managers have bosses that want to be happy! My coworkers where great people. The hardest part of that job was the low pay random hours and the supervisors. The most enjoyable part of this job was the meals we ate in break because the older female coworkers would take food for everyone.
bad,"no job security, pay rate minimum wage, learned general labor."
bad,"There's no room for improvement at this location, not to mention the terrible pay and no hours to work."
bad,alot to deal with for minimum wage . you have to size 3 to four places . customer service fitting room security cashier jewlery assaitaince
bad,This was a job I had to take after being let go from the bank due to the J.P. Morgan and Washington Mutual merger. This is a job I wouldn't do again.
bad,It is that kind of job where they call you when they need you and you always left hanging on thinking weather they call you or not. Very hard work with a lot of mess and angry management
bad,"Management is not the greats, they over work you and don't appreciate your hard work."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the customers. I adore my customers - even the difficult ones, and I believe they enjoy me. I have my regulars, too. Management has changed 3 or 4 times since I started 9 months ago, so it is very difficult to get a read on what we are really all about. Our employees work SO hard and for such low pay, that the turnover is truly insane. Five people quit in one day a couple of weeks ago. Our new hires do not last more than one or two days. The basic problem is that corporate management expects us to complete unrealistic goals on a daily basis with practically no personnel."
bad,This was a transiton position for me. This position was never a real means of income.
bad,"salary is fair"
bad,Unless you’re comfortable being a teacher’s pet to the store manager. Never plan to be sick or tardy EVER. Then this is a job for you. But I wouldn’t recommend it. The higher ups tend to pick favorites in every position. Not even some of their own team seems to be their favorite. I’ve over heard some managers talk badly about their employees or fellow managers and they terminate unfairly. Just steer clear of this place for your sanity.
bad,All was well in the beginning with our managers and trust me they were AMAZING! Until the new managers started coming in and it was like they came in with this dark cloud which just switched everything up and just the vibes at work. Some days they’re cool but most of the days it gets hard to even want to come to work.
bad,"not a good secure job to work at, the supervisors only have their favorites and you will never advance up. The store is a mess and people look down on you."
bad,It’s an ok place to work if you need flexible scheduling and little hours. Also you can’t miss not at all even when hospitalized because after 9 days you get fired
bad,Needs A lot of work on their management. They also need to stop hiring so many workers. Many employees were seeking To become full-time but weren't able to because of how many new part time employees that were always being hired.
bad,"Upper management have their own ""proteges"" that can do no wrong. I was made into a scapegoat so the district manager wouldn't look bad. Otherwise, very easy management job. Two breaks and a lunch was nice."
bad,Nothing about Ross system is good. They will give you a lot hours but if you are sick or have a family member in hospital they will still right you up regardless to doctors note or whatever.
bad,"I worked there for 5 years. No raises. "
bad,"Seriously this corporate office is a joke. Management is super unprofessional. They gossip about everyone and apparently are looking for robots instead of human beings. They’ll throw you in the fire and if you can’t handle the workload/stress, will get rid of you. 3 months and they got rid of me like nothing after praising me saying I was doing a great job. Beware of paul Crawford and chrislyn Williams. The two most unprofessional people I have ever worked for . and"
bad,"It’s meant to be a part time job, young kids learning to work type thing. It’s nice having a discount but when you are always working you back side off and get less and less hours because they are always hiring when they don’t need to it’s stressful because your hours are cut."
bad,Ross managers are awful. And no one gets fired from Ross unless you steal that’s the only way you can be fired .......................................
bad,"Ross management sets you up for failure instead of supporting your success. They have a very competitive environment and favoritism is rampart. Had a troubled store that had been failing for years and was made to go there even though that was not the store I was recruited for. Then was told would get strong support but it never happened. "
bad,"Ross was one of my least favorite places to work. They gave opportunities to change roles, but not to any great benefit. They sort of squeezed everything out of you that they could, without compensation. I started in the Stock room, went to acting stock lead, when our lead was let go. I then went to the sales floor (which is where I wanted to be initially). After working sales, I was trained as an SPS (Loss Prevention), and more actively worked in that role, which was supposed to have about a $2 pay raise. I was never given that pay raise. After our Front-End Supervisor was let go, I and another associate were acting Front-End supe's (depending on who was working). I actually tested and passed the exam to become recognized as a Front-End supe, but was never officially recognized or compensated for the hours spent in that role. "
bad,It was a fast past job that's great but you only get about 14 hours a week a few of the manager was great to work for and the other workers was always willing to help you when you first start
bad,"I applied and took this job after I had my first daughter when they were only paying $7.25. I liked working for the most part, but there was a lot of drama among other co workers and it kinda felt like high school which I did NOT like. I worked so many hours that it felt like a full time job and was asked to stay over constantly, but still at the consistent rate of seven dollars and 25 cents....The work schedule is not too bad, as I still got to spend a lot of time with my daughter. I would definitely go back part time, if the pay was higher."
bad,"They treat their employees poorly unless your in with management "
bad,A job only with terrible management. Company only cares about money. Bat atmosphere for men. Retail is a tough place standing with short breaks but they make sure the brakes are provided
bad,Great in some areas but needs a lot of structure. Different stores have a different environment. Kennesaw always struggled bad in areas and supervisors didn't really know how to handle certain situations.
bad,"They were forever sending people home early so that they could keep their favorites. I felt like I was being shortchanged on the hours, and the managers were not willing to give out more or hours."
bad,It is a job for someone who can afford to work part time hours. Management does not really appreciate hard workers. No organization to the store. The employees are fun to work with. It just doesn't pay enough to live off of.
bad,"I got sent to do other peoples jobs more than MY job. Massive gender discrimination in certain areas. No women at the docks on my shift at all. Equal pay, equal work, or its not equal."
bad,"Have you always wondered why there is always a long line at Ross? Or maybe why there is always merchandise on the floor?"
bad,"You were not allowed to drink water during your shift, only if you were on break and only in the break-room. This made for an extremely difficult work environment because you could not be hydrated."
bad,It was all good until new management came in. No longer respected availability. Really messed with raises and did not communicate to staff any changes. Always on the phone and never help his store. That was the Store manager he refused to help assist customers and resolve issues and give the task to cashiers when management had to get evolved.
bad,"Extremely stressful being a cashier ALONE with no help! Especially when it’s super busy. Depending on who you’re working with when you call for backup they(mangement/cashiers) take their sweet time to come to the front. Managment is always in the office or leaving early. You get paid to do ONE job and that job is doing EVERYONE elses jobs as well. Regardless of what you applied for you will work in other departments as well. Also, I never got trained to work their system and their way of processing everything in the front. I watched someone for 10 minutes and they threw me on cash register. The only time someone taught me to properly do things was when corporate was coming in & that was the only time i had enough help."
bad,"Ross is a place were associates are often spread out too thin, not much time is often given to care of put in quality work. Ross is a fairly busy environment and does often lead to stress. Different positions often provide a different experience but eventually people are asked to pursue different positions throughout the store."
bad,"Ross is a very stressful job. You are timed on how fast you check people out. The management is the worst part about the job they don’t care about their employees and they’re constantly switching managers. The turnover rate is really high because a lot of people quit when they realize how badly they’re treated. It’s almost always understaffed and you’re over worked. Did i mention that the management is terrible? Put your energy into another retail job that will give you more hours, better pay and be less stressful. Only good thing is that you get a double discount every few months and you get 40% off everything"
bad,Good place to get a first job since they’ll hire basically anyone. They’ll throw you anywhere so gain your experience and get out! Raises are a joke but the discounts are great.
bad,Corporate does not know what goes on in the stores and sets rules that are impossible to follow. Management could not care less about employees and theft happening in the store. Prepared to ask for cashier back up and never get a response.
bad,"Working full time at Ross means you have to revolve your life around Ross . Managers promises are inconsistent.... You can grow in the company as long as your the managers favorite person. Great discounts and paid sick time. No one ever had a problem with each other, no gossip no drama. You don’t get paid enough if you work in stock."
bad,Working at ross was a very stressful place because a lot of coworkers would argue or start drama. There wasn’t any house for people and the management did not handle problems very well. Plus mangers would have outside relationships with co workers that weren’t suppose to happen
bad,"Management was horrible, hours were nonexistent, associates were somewhat nice, the store was a mess, management did not give enough hours for you do get things done, you were timed at the register to process a sale, breaks were short, people were rude and some employees were treated unfairly."
bad,"Sure, they schedule me from 6pm to 11:30pm, but there have been several instances, if not most of the time, that I have had to stay until on or two in the morning. Yes, retail is hard work but this is ridiculous. There aren't enough workers so all of us have to stay late in order to get the work done, but they won't hire more people! There was minimal training; I had to figure out most things on my own. My managers would periodically ask me to do something that I had not been trained on and then be frustrated when I didn't know how to do it. Absolutely ridiculous, I would not work here again."
bad,Ross is a place of hard work and they let the customer get away with put  merchandise all over the store. And the employees are the one who has to clean. And it not fair to to employees how the customer get to do and anything they like in the store. And the employee can not a dresser are say anything just go along with the program. And the work hours are not good. Some weeks you work only one day for that whole week.
bad,"This particular store has a lot of drama, back-stabbing, two-faced people employed. Especially management. Its really disheartening when you can't go to your general manager in private, to discuss confidential information, only to return to work and everyone knows what your experiencing. This manager is a habitual liar and gets caught in her lies all the time, still corporate does nothing, even after the ethics line has been called numerous times, to report what is happening in the workplace. I am only still employed there because it's one of the best paying part-time jobs in my area. But I do not recommend working there."
bad,No room for advancement not pleased with the management don’t have anything good or bad to say all I could really say it wasn’t the right place for me
bad,Works you like a Dog if you’re a good worker especially during holiday season but after that they’ll cut your hours so bad you’d fee very unappreciated.
bad,"Unstable hours, Unstable management, Good core system but needs serious restructuring. Little to no chances of advancement or full time oppurtunitues. Not worth how demanding the job itself it."
bad,Slightly less than decent job. Great people/associates. O.K. Managers. Awful Loss Prevention/ Asset Protection. Company more concerned with Internal theft than catching the shoplifters which ran roughshod over the place. O.K. Job overall until something better comes along.
bad,I like working here it’s just the management. They have been working really well with my school schedule which is nice. Good first job to have and explore career paths.
bad,its easy work but poor management and dramatic peers and coworkers need to provide us with more materials and have a fixed scheduling for everybody so nobody can get confused
bad,The store manager was rude and disrespectful. He did what he thought was the right thing for him to do so that he could make himself look good. The most enjoyable part of my  job was dealing with the customers. I loved helping them with their shopping experience.
bad,"Worked at Ross for 4-5 months in 2018. Started off okay until managers began giving contradicting tasks and policies. Also began to frequently call to have me come in on my only day off for the week. Work schedule was posted online and on paper; however, the online schedule would change often causing confusion for myself and other associates. If scheduled for late night, might end up leaving hours after 12 a.m."
bad,"sizing audits"
bad,"Poor management , only person working on stock for clothing and stressful. Typical day was check the computer because our schedules whee changed everyday which kind of upsetted me how it was all over the place plus the management made it akwardb working there by talking down on all us and putting us down and attitude infron of the customers ."
bad,"Ross does not pay up to the cost of living. "
bad,"I was a part time employee.  Management cut hours frequently. Hardly ever made a decent paycheck there.  Management would run you out of store, was not a friendly environment."
bad,Very stressful and horrible with hours. Manager said they were flexible. Worked weird shifts and got picked on by manger because of it. Did not work with class schedule and chose school over work.
bad,"Advancement is minimal."
bad,It’s a good starter job but not meant for job security. Very rare to get promoted to full time employee. The majority of the workers are part timers and come and go a lot. You would allows need to speak up to make sure you receive breaks and lunches. Need to touch skin to deal with rude customers.
bad,I was at first head over hills for this company Ross  distribution and nobody couldn’t tell me otherwise it was like love at first site up until now I see that it was never love for me  in return . As the years progress my love turned into sadness  why because of favoritism for other coworkers.
bad,"The store is not run efficiently and the blame falls on associates. Managers do not run the store well or invest in training associates on how to do their job well, and then are upset with associates when they fail to meet expectations. The other associates are friendly, but everyone is afraid of the management."
bad,"Very poor management, not enough hours, very low pay but you get a great discount. My store was always busy and sometimes we would have to stay until 2 in the morning on holidays to clean up"
bad,"turnover rate high"
bad,"The company needs to work on the freight delivery. No one ever knows what is coming on the trucks. You would think that if they (warehouse) are scanning the items in the freight, they should be able to tell management how much staff is needed to unload and put out on the floor and not wait until the last minute."
bad,The store manager made associates walk on eggshells and she would blame others for her own wrongdoing. There was favoritism which affected most associates negatively. Training was minimum for those seeking to promote. Pay was low for the work we were expected to finish in very little time.
bad,I enjoy the work I do at Ross. I do not like the way employees are treated and that there is very little opportunity to advance or improve your career with this company.
bad,There are not enough employees. They need to hire more staff willing to work. It is very underpaid! They change schedule day before without letting you know. If you have restrictions they don’t care they still require you to lift the boxes!! The store is always a mess and is never cleaned right the management team is not very organized the store is not organized at all. Need to be able to recover th store and not bounced around everywhere.
bad,"Ross' is always advertising the Area Supervisor position, but they only like to hire within the company for that position and actually hire for a part time position. If you have open availability all week long, it never fails that they they will have you close on either or both Friday and Saturday til almost midnight and then have you come in the next morning at 7am, they show favoritism to the workers who have been there longer and not make them close late or open early."
bad,Was the worst job ever management doesn't care about staff too much micromanaging very little hours and random schedule always understaffed no room for improvement at all.
bad,At first it was a great job. I transferred to a different store and helped open that store. You are suppose to get a raise after working there for a year. My sister got a raise like that but once I asked my new boss they said that they don’t do that. Management sucks. They are constantly on you about every little thing. I have worked there longer than most of the people have and they treat me like I don’t know anything. There is no room for improvement. Good for a short time job. I have come home crying because of how management treats me. Wouldn’t recomend.
bad,upper level management changed consistently - did not care about associates at store level - often made empty promises for advancement - very unorganized - always fighting for payroll
bad,Management needs improvement big time. The people that work for ross are friendly and have excellent team base work ethics. I stayed for the atmosphere of my coworkers.
bad,"Depending on which location you work at, things can get crazy. Mess everywhere, disrespectful customers. It’s too much for minimum wage. And to top it off one of the managers was disrespectful. Only thing I liked was the 20% discounts and 40% once a year."
bad,"They need to have more cashiers cause it gets very busy at Ross and more  associate to fix how the  store  looks for  the inside.I had to work as a cashier, sales associate, in stock team and loss and prevision associate,"
bad,This job wasn't very good for me. I couldn't get time off at all and getting more hours was impossible since they would only give it to one person. I also was let go without notice.
bad,"I hated this job. No matter how hard you worked you weren't noticed, only when you made mistakes. If you were constantly making improvements they didnt care."
bad,While working at ross I worked my butt off. But because of the younger crowd and how they are I was set up and terminated for posting a picture unknown to me was taken inside the store of a shoplifter. Then I was turned in for this picture by the person who took it and terminated. I hate this store and their policies that only benifit liars.
bad,"If I had to go to work, with no other options, I would go back, but there are so many other opportunities out there, so probably not. Unless I was desperate."
bad,poor management poor culture unequal employment oppurtuntiny the hardest workers were held to a certain standard without wriggle room it was tuff to make average score
bad,"My coworkers were a fun group and each work day felt successful because of how much we had to do, but it was stressful to work as many hours as I was and be a student."
bad,the job itself is good for a college kid or a teenager that needs a part time job while school is out.. They don't like to work with other job schedules.
bad,"You are always doing something, but underpaid. Friendly co-workers. Management not always helpful. No benefits unless you are an actual full time associate."
bad,"managers are, not the best very lazy, rude, inconsistent don't really care about your personal life mixing with work little hours to excessive hours demand much to pay so little."
bad,Thought the year i work only 2 days a week on average and i have open avalibility throughout the week when I'm not in school( only 3 hours the days i go to school) they don't give many hours unless its holiday or inventory week
bad,Not enough to do during the day. Spent a lot of time looking for things to do. Consistently rude customers. Mediocre managers. Disorganized. Bad scheduling. No opportunities for advancement.
bad,The schedules were very inconsistent. The rules and regulations changed constantly. What management is expecting you to do changes all the time. It was a hectic place to work.
bad,"The only issue I had while working there is that you might work with and manage unprofessional or unmotivated staff members. This can at times feel like babysitting. Other than that, I would say the experience was pretty great."
bad,"Just an overall bad job. Drama everyday, people missing work, strict policies, terrible management. Coworkers were half asleep all the time, there was no air conditioning where the unload station was."
bad,"There is no direction and schedules over availability time, then management gets mad when you can't work those times. Conditions are horrible and dirty, bathroom smell and state get constant complaints."
bad,Expectations are high with minimal pay and resources. Constant threat of termination despite hard work and results.The company does not care for its employees and would rather have a high turnover rate than provide associates with a few extra hours of work.
bad,I worked graveyard shift but was still getting paid minimum wage. And from what i recall graveyard shift is more thwn likely to get paid more. They expect you to finish unloading a 300 box truck at a specific time although there might only be 3 people working . Truly stressfull
bad,i was allowed to work an eight hour shift with no break at all given until at least five hours into my shift .I acquired many health issues while staying at the front end and was not given asssociates who effectively covered breaks. Job requirements weren't clear.
bad,Most of the management team does NOT acknowledge or praise work well done. It's ALL about processing transactions FAST....TOO FAST. It becomes ROBOTIC. Turnover is EXTREMELY high. Associates leave the company as fast as they are hired at the Redlands location and MOST of it is due to poor management and how they treat their employees.
bad,"I liked working at Ross , I did the cash office in the morning i was a Cashier and I did the fitting room . Laid back but can get very busy around holidays management was okay"
bad,I've put a lot of years into this company and had very little advancements. The hours also fluctuate due to the new hires who only stay for months at a time.
bad,"During my interview i was promised at least 25+ hours. I worked for four days and put in less than 16 hours. The managers are rude and unorganized. I was poorly trained. After numerous attempts to contact a manager on duty, i was told i missed a day of work when i was not even on the schedule. When i called for my schedule, i was put on hold for 10+ min or i was hung up on. When i did get contact with the manager, she didnt know who i was. The best part of this job is the 20% employee discount. They pay very little, and they work you past your scheduled hours without your approval. Poor place to work. Do not recommend."
bad,no much to say. the company was great five years ago but the more money the company got the less the bottom feeders saw. the more stock value the company got the less respect they had for their workers.
bad,Good place to get your foot in the door if retail is your thing. The store is always busy so there is always something to do. Holidays get insane busy. Time flies by at this job.
bad,"this job is horrible. they will put you on the schedule for about four weeks the first couple of weeks, then they will cut your hours to one day between 5-8 hours. they are always cutting hours, but also hiring more and more people and not putting them on the schedule at all. you are supposed to get a salary increase after a year, but will never get it. they will cut your hours to avoid from getting it."
bad,"A typical day is communication with customers dealing with returns fashion,and creation.I have learned a different way of looking at colors.Management is to be on task. the hardest part of the job is maintaining order organization in sizing recovery and what is expected with being on task when their is a speed monitor on the check out.experience and the Customer is not aware of this.The most enjoyable part is the discounts."
bad,"I spent two and a half years here, only to watch the people who worked hard constantly be held back and the people who were willing to kiss up to the mangement were promoted endlessly. I ran the front end of the store for a year and a half, and was constantly smack-talked by my store manager, despite being one of the only few people who knew how to actually work the schedules during the day."
bad,"This company was not a good fit for me.  However, in all honesty, my district manager was the reason I left.  No support, no action from HR............,"
bad,"Customer service, properly hanging clothes, assisting customers, and efficiently cashiering them to grant them with a good day so my customers want to come back."
bad,"Maybe it was just the time I started working there and they were trying to just get people in, but I felt extremely overwhelmed. I received very little training for my job.I mentioned I had only ever cashiered, but they still put me out on the sales floor and expected me to do everything correctly without someone giving me at least some idea of what they wanted. Coworkers were obviously frustrated by my lack of knowledge and were often very vocal and unprofessional. In addition I was not warned that I'd be staying 2-4 hours after my shift was supposed to end to help clean the store. Had I been told ahead of time, I would have chosen a much more convenient schedule. The managers never even attempted to work with my school schedule when I had mention time and time again that I'm a college student. I'm hoping it was just that store, because I could see the job being enjoyable if the management worked well."
bad,"Working at Ross was exhausting, there were times in which I was required to show up multiple times in one day. It's very demanding in the fact that you practically live there."
bad,"so productive, the store was nice, the pay hmm more or less, but the hours are good and the people are nice, sales associate was my title, i have experience"
bad,"Receiving payments by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers or automatic debits "
bad,"in the beginning they treat you nice. you get some of the hours you put down on your application and they work with you. however, once they get comfortable you will find yourself working late the majority of the time and if you cant work the schedule they begin to take your hours or continue to go against what you may have agreed upon. also management is not the best too many managers and sometimes negotiate based on favoritism."
bad,"New management and policy sucks. The ""policy"" is constantly worked around. Rarely get breaks on time, no pay raises with any promotions . No benefits."
bad,At the pearland location I witnessed a bit of racism in the workplace. I was quite displeased with the establishment. I went back to Ross because I worked for another location before.
bad,"I was hiried for seasonal work. I worked as a floor associate, dressing room, jewlery, go-backs, home decor, toys, all other areas. They need a better system for there employee's work schedule."
bad,"No problems with any of the employees, the problem is all management. Management makes working way harder then it needs to be. Unprofessional etc. Its a good first job though. Really sets your standards"
bad,"As a loss Prevention. ill have to review some paper memorize it and have to explain my previous day to them in the format they wanted, which i think it sucks. when it came to suspicious activity we are only there to intimidate the person."
bad,"they are very unorganized, if your scheduled to work one thing they will throw you somewhere else, full of lazy people, especially the managers. my first day i had to clean a big spill of juice that another employee spilled in the break room area. People call in every single day and they call you in 247 to work others shift. you can never get overtime or work fulltime only management is allowed."
bad,"A typical day included balancing tills for two hours before heading out to the stock room to assist with moving inventory to the floor. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with the extremely negative District Manager, and the constant gossiping. I had worked many other retail jobs before, but Ross has the least professional culture out of any of them. Many of the associates were very snarky and lazy. Many do drugs, both at home and at work (in the break room or out in the parking lot)-- including management. I was also offered a certain rate of pay for hours of work, and was never paid it. Reporting illegal activities to the 'hotline' is pointless because they will simply tell you there isn't enough evidence to do anything about it."
bad,"If you like low wages, poor management and getting hardly any hours to work, this is the place for you.  They allow hundreds of dollars of shoplifted items to leave the store everyday but will check everyone's purse or backpack at the end of every shift to make sure (the honest) employees are not stealing from the company. Its a minimum wage, go nowhere job and your annual raise will be about 25 cents."
bad,"I've been working there for over a year and our pay just got raised from $7.50 an hour to $9.00. The management is a joke, or at least at my location it is. The workers get about 4-10 hours a week and I'm not sure how they expect us to live off that but I can assure you that they do not care about that anyway."
bad,The people I worked with were nice.  Job training was a bit inadequate.  The work schedule could not be accessed online.  The work in the stockroom was very difficult and fast-paced.  The pay was minimal.
bad,Coworkers and assistant managers are pleasant and helpful but the manager is irrational and put in place ineffective procedures that we are never allowed to deviate from. You barely get any hours and the pay is dismal.
bad,The turn over rate is horrible the managers are lazy and they don't care about their employee's. They never have enough staff scheduled.
bad,This company does not care about employees or work ethics. Management changing every two months because none of the workers can stand the horrible environment and stress. The SPS position was never needed therefore making workers feel worth less.
bad,I hated it there they would treat you like you don't belong. They would always yell at you when something got messed up. You had to be done with your stuff in a timely manner. They would fire you for going to the hospital to have your baby even when you told them what you weren't gone to be there
bad,"I came to work, everything was unorganized and employees bickering all day long. the pay sucked too! management was the only good thing in that job."
bad,Store is ALWAYS busy. Not enough associates scheduled to cover the foot traffic of the business. Plus side is the company has fast advancement but doesn't provide the proper training that is needed.
bad,"Poor management, but a fun place to work. Its a very busy environment. Goal is to get all merchandise out onto the floor. Flexible working hours. They have a high turn over rate, employees always coming and going. High turn over rate for store managers as well."
bad,I helped the customer on the register with transaction and refunds with their purchases and also help them on the sales floor. I learned how to help people with their daily purchases.
bad,A typical day at Ross is always busy . The associates that work there are hard workers but very underpaid and always short staffed .
bad,"management was very off, they didn't want to give me more hours, that's why I left"
bad,"is a good place just no benefits."
bad,"Working at Ross was personally rewarding. I enjoyed the customers and the overall job was easy for me and I caught on quickly. Co-workers were helpful. They helped me more than management/supervisors did. I understand that some tasks are self explanatory but they didn't train well what so ever, and when they do their so called minute reviews they mark you off on things you were not trained on. The store was poorly staffed and remained junky through out the day. Lines were ridiculously long and they want to blame the two cashiers for not moving fast enough."
bad,"I worked at Ross for 4 years through college, because I was a full time student there was no opportunity for me to advance. Most people did not last that long. The work shifts were terrible and because I was a good employee I had to do twice as much work. I was grateful to the management for working with my school schedule, but overall would not recommend. Having the discount was great."
bad,"Was an okay job, but they stay open all night and got assaulted by a homeless man."
bad,Ready to lead a new team. As I have been in the retail business for over 30 years.
bad,"I did not enjoy my time working for Ross.  It was high-stress and very little acknowledgment for completed tasks.  The hours were never the same and you never knew when you would have to go to work the following week until just a few short days beforehand.  "
bad,Company sole focus is profit and not tools or people. Company must adjust to ways to make it profitable without sacrificing technology and competitive market salaries.
bad,"This is a first job not a career driven business. The wages were low, management was bad and not a good place to start a long term career"
bad,the people are nice managers are ok but they make it seem like everyone there is a family but they only promote the same people or out of the blue they will promote a new person that just started you can only get 25 hours a week and they dont even give you 25 maybe sometimes just 18 its never consistent last week i worked 20 hrs next week i work 9 people cant live like that this is a good job for a highschool student
bad,My managers were all rude. One of them even told me not to conversate with customers just to scan and bag. They could care less about you and your well being.
bad,the work days were long and underpaid . the job required a lot of attention for a little compensation . the management was very nasty and unprofessional. However the employees were very nice and welcoming .
bad,"Company doesnt have there act together for a ""fortune 500"" buisness honestly there is no job advancment for dealing with incredibly high expectations for that little of pay. Perfect second job but you honostly cannot trust them. Constant messes on the floor, no stucture, no professionalism."
bad,"The management at Ross in San Dimas was the worst. The main manager there was very rude and would let her personal life affect her work life. She would constantly make employees feel nervous and anxious. She would always target those who in her eyes were ""weak"" . For example, i was called up to her office and yelled at one day for ""playing around"" during my job. The footage she had shown me of the security camera clearly showed me organizing security tags when two other girls came from behind me and started playing patty cake and calling to me. In  the video you can clearly see me walking away from the girls to continue working, I found out later that same week that she had only confronted me because I was the only one out of those three girls that she knew would not yell back at her, I would never work for a Ross Dress For Less ever again."
bad,"not good pay and rude employees, bad management, their is no pro's in this job"
bad,"- this is a hard job, working in very busy store."
bad,"Always work long hours without breaks,learn how to work on a deadline.also learn how to work short handed. I love the employee discount."
bad,"I can't say that I really enjoyed working at Ross. The pay is minimum wage which is absurd considering the amount of work. The store manager actually quit completely with no warning. Which didn't surprise me too much because everyone who works there only cares about themselves. The assistant manager has a bit of an attitude problem and does not care one bit about your personal issues. You can work extra shifts, come in when called, and just be an amazing employee and receive no recognition. But as soon as you slip up, its a huge deal. Not to mention the customers are absolutely HORRIBLE Its not worth your time even applying here."
bad,"The manager is passive aggressive and treats you like youre dumb baby monkies, the store is always messy and always understaffed so youre constantly moving but not actually getting anything done, pay is dreadful and you only get a small raise after a year, you get only a 20-30% discount and its not particularly worth it "
bad,"A typical day would consist of a store that is undermanned so the current employees for a shift would have to do twice if not more then their share of work to compensate for less employees not to mention the fact that you have to do it all while not getting enough hours to finish the work given to you, you would have to do more then what you would expect from a part time job under twenty five hours a week also there tends to be a high turn over rate due to the small amount of work hours and low pay now with management they tend to put their work off on others and if you need help the excuse is we have paperwork so they will be in the office most of their shift the only way I have seen anyone get promoted is by being a friend/brown noser the hardest part is putting up with the constant miscommunication the best part of the job is the discount which isnt much but hey its something"
bad,"You were trained on every part of the store, but depending on your availability, that's where you were placed. I was working as a stockroom associate. I would occasionally be placed on fitting room and cashier duties. I learned sizing, product placement, and everything stockroom related. Management was terrible. They would blame the entire team for any mistakes. Store manager and supervisors only cared for themselves. Only the assistant manager was great till they quit due the the poor treatment. This is a job anyone could do. Turnover was high. I never looked forward to a day working here. I don't know if it was just my store. It was hard everyday trying to process 2 boxes full of clothing with 100+ items in each in an hour. The worst part is that they would literally yell at you to go faster and more than 75% of the time we didn't have enough hangers and items needed for processing the new merchandise so fast. The stockroom leads are a joke an only cared about moving up. Manager only cared about numbers. The only enjoyable part was the discount on already cheap merchandise. Co-workers were of all ages and were great people. I liked all the people that were getting paid the same as me."
bad,They cut your hours
bad,"A typical day was filled with many things that needed to be done, from unloading the trucks, to putting out freight, making displays, running a register, counting tills, managing your employees."
bad,Upper management really does not take responsibility or help with daily tasks. My store manager is great and one ASM is but the others do not do anything but sit in the office.
bad,"Good company to work to put there is to much unnecessary drama going on in there, specially with one of the supervisors gossiping and spying on others in order to make herself look better and in order to get others in trouble. Coworkers in general where ok."
bad,"The management is poor, and employee safety is the last thing on their mind."
bad,Of the people were so nice. But the management had no idea how to run a business.
bad,Not a good place to work if you are looking for full-time employment or advancement. The pay is very low for the requirement. No benefits.
bad,Is a decent management position but the upper management lack people and personal skills. I enjoyed and relied upon my workers who were a great support system.
bad,A typical day at work was busy in the receiving background.
bad,"People who have worked for Ross more than 10 years (and there are many) love it because the changes are very gradual and are happy going in making there numbers and collecting a paycheck.  New people tend to get frustrated, because with a company as big as Ross, everything get done via committee and it takes a long time to see any real change. Management is seems behind the curve/trend and only makes change when absolutely necessary.  With Ross, they will save every dollar if it helps the bottom line, even at the cost of there own people"
bad,I think this job is easy but management makes it difficult by hiring unproductive part-time employees. They come to work and do the bare minimum and complain about doing the simplest task. Management enables this by not letting them go and continuously overlooking behavior that decreases overall morale
bad,"I did not have a good work/life balance. My days were mostly spent working and had few breaks or lunches. The compensation was ok, but I felt that the management wasn't really supported."
bad,"They have good insurance, PTO benefits, sick time, employee discount policy, management doesn't listen to concerns or complaints from any of its associates."
bad,"This is a great job for teens wanting to make a little money and will provide any teenager with the importance of attending college. Good way to teach young people of hard work and how without a degree or favouritism they wont move up."
bad,"Working in retail has taught me that people are entitled and rude. The company only cares about sales and not the wellbeing, mental health, or safety of their employees. The days are long and exhausting and the customers make it worst. Management is no help, other than to nitpick at the things you do wrong and ignore all the things you do right."
bad,"Debería de acabar el favoritismo entre empleados, tratar a cada asociado con respeto, para poder tener un ambiente  donde se trabaje feliz y no estresado."
bad,"Store Manager is horrible. Managers Tr and Ced are spectacular. Fair and encouraging on a rough day. The two of them could run this store alone. Been with this company for sometime and if the Store manager would leave, Ross in Opelika would be a happier place. Why doesn't corporate listen to employee complaints?"
bad,"I have been with the company almost 5 years, moved up as a part time associate and took years to do that because of favoritism. This company will use you up! My mom got sick and management did not want to let me go in leave. I will be filing a lawsuit. They dont care about their associates and fire management for anything. Great place for a secondary job and the discount only."
bad,"Not a place I would recommend, because there literally was no training, and it's completely under staffed making it impossible to maintain job duties."
bad,For the most part you get close to your associates but as far as management it could be a lot better. But for the most of it was a great working environment when staffed right.
bad,This job is a revolving door. The staff flows in and out of there every 60-90 days you don't even get a chance to know anyone. I have been there for 6 years and I have never seen.
bad,"They started me as cashier. I had asked for a different position for the year I stayed there. And I got maybe 3 shifts in another department every month.  Even with my skills, they would hire other people rather than give me a break from register. Felt ignored. The customers were cheap and treated you very nasty if you rejected their request(more discounts). Corporate is ridiculously strict on their policies for such a simple job. Makes you cover every millimeter of tattoos but won't spend money to fix a/c to make employees comfortable. (Everybody has tattoos) They are so high in their position, Treats you like dirt and like you are too stupid to even count to 10. Everybody is terrified of them which is ridiculous. All they care about is how quickly you get the customers out the door. But when you learn their daily computer tracker, and have the best timing on register, they fail you and you get in trouble anyway. WHAT????? So they continue to train you like you don't know how to do your job."
bad,"Even though my time there was short, it was a good moment for growth. This job taught me how to manage time, stress, and customer concerns. However when it came to changing schedules for availability for school, no matter which supervisor I went to, to discuss my concerns, they never told the manager or H.R. Even when I did talk to the manager about my situation she would forget to talk to H.R. like she said she would. It left me to make a choice between my school or work and eventually I choose school."
bad,The job was great. I enjoyed working there but the managers are lazy and put all their work on you when they wanna go home early. After they do this then you leave a hour late and the boss gets mad.
bad,"I wouldn't refer anyone to work at Ross unless u r really strapped for cash and looking for a quick buck. Due to the fact that they don't keep the equipment in good shape and management has been there so long they don't know what other UPDATED processes there r in the industry."
bad,"Structured very well but only cares about moving items out regardless of consequences. Merchandising nightmare, they don’t want it. Allows customers to steal under your nose w out doing a thing. Let em go policy I do quote “75% of all theft is interior”, well that backfires making it dangerous and allowing anyone to pik and go. It’s a write off they need to balance books. No security, was all taken away over a year ago, don’t need it, well hope not. Management sits in office all day hardly seen and never gets breaks. Employees constantly un able to get their mandatory breaks themselves. New hires take weeks to go thru the background procedure. The good people leave w a bad taste of taken advantage of. Good part is 20% discount for employees, you can advance getting a better name tag if that’s important to you but be careful what you ask for. Upper management doesn’t care about employees needs only if paperwork is correctly done but merchandising ah who needs it, leave it scattered all over. Cashiers are pushed to be fast, make eye contact say hi and take that money while asked next in line to come forward while current customer fumbles for the payment. By all means do not be personable at all. In the handbook it states and I quote “ do not ask customer if they found everything” why you ask? It can prolong a sale because conversation starts and possibly ask the cashier for something else they couldn’t find. It’s sad, this is brutal honesty from a few staff members that previously left and a cpl still employed. Businesses at one time were personable but setting up thousands of"
bad,They’re a little all over the place and they gossip a lot. They’re really nice people but management is a little scattered. The general manager is hard on her employees.
bad,Horrible management and little to no hours unless you're there favorite employee. I would not recommend working here. Some employees are fun to work with.
bad,"It is a very good place to work, they have a lot of good employees. Most of the time you do not have enough people to work with. You have to do a lot of work."
bad,"I previously worked for Ross years ago and unfortunately the culture has declined. Training of associates and management is a joke, only those able to train themselves will make it. Opening more stores closer together keeps store volume down which in turn keeps wage range down and available payroll for staffing. Customer service is not a focus for Ross, they provide very little payroll to allow for adequate coverage which is a strain on associates when met with call outs or high deman days."
bad,you only get up to 25 cents a year if you do go that is not going to help you pay rent. The area supervisor position on gets you to learn new areas not much more money.
bad,"Ross was great loved the customers and very few employees, wish you hired nicer people because people were very transphobic and rude to an extent of high school drama which included my reason leaving. (Alondra Carson city nevada store)"
bad,I have very bad health and they wouldn't work with me or let me excel. It just isn't a healthy place to be sometimes. Also the people there hate working there.
bad,This place can become a fun and environment to work for if you keep your mangers happy but the moment you make them made you somehow end up with only a minimum hours and them saying they don't have any hours while they keep hiring people and saying the need more people.
bad,Managers fail to follow protocol. Employees are poorly trained. Everyone does whatever they want however they want to. Employees are frequent no call no shows. The stockroom in disorganized and messy. Store manager is bitter and shows favoritism to anyone who isn't working harder than she is. Which is hardly. Very rude and uniformed on how the store is run.
bad,I worked the night shift doing unload and it was miserable work conditions. Was told the only way to advance was from within then later found out all the management positions were hired through a completely different system.
bad,"To advance you have to be a YES MAN & also in the group, if not Supervisor is as high as you will go. Don't rock the boat paddle for upper management."
bad,Thing at work were always hectic. Management didn't know how to get things done. They didn't listen to scheduling requests and were always having staffing issues. I was there for a complete management change but it never had real results.
bad,"there is no room for advancement and it is way too stressful for what little pay there is. the co-workers are friendly enough, especially if you speak their language."
bad,"Management is horrible and I don't just mean the people in charge. Time management is also horrible and they don't know how make sure you have all the required items for a successful day at work."
bad,doesn't pay enough and not enough hours but since you can listen to music and do your work alone you only have to deal with some stupidity the customers are the worst though.
bad,Great co workers. Current store manager doesnt follow many of the store mottos or programs. Fast pace environment. Customers are usually always kind and respectful.
bad,"My typical day at this hellhole consists of being hounded by my hours and being told to do things other people didnt want to do. My managers were hired despite not showing ANY experience in their area. They literally do as little as possible and get away with it. The store Manager is constanlty absent so dont bother complaining, or just call HR as soon as theres a problem. theyre going to tel you not to but that only hurts you in the end. be prepared to have your msic on alot cuz ignoring them is the only way to get through the day. they will talk about you in their native language so get used to that. overnight is wayy better"
bad,Not a good place to work. They lie about the hours.tgey also dont have benefits at all. They also dont respect the employees breaks at all. There is also alot of robberies at that store and they dont do nothing about it.
bad,Compensation/Benefits are not competitive with other retail managements. Managers are more likely to promote their friends and their families above tenured employees
bad,Typical day sucks especially weekends you dont get enough hours if you are looking to work more than 30 mores a week. Be careful with that before you get hired. They say you can move up but you wont.
bad,its ok for a first job its very much unorganized. too many kings trying to run one castle. some of the managers are quick to mess you over and out of hours.
bad,employees don't want to work in a filthy environment where customers don't care about the merchandise they are throwing on to the floor.  Some people may call them handicap shoppers (meaning its not their job to pick the stuff they threw on the floor)
bad,"The hardest part of the job was being a new person & not having anyone to train you. You pretty much have to learn things on your own. You are suppose to have a week of training but I honestly got two days. After that week is up they expect you to know everything or enough to be fast paced. You have to run items and you are expected to run mini hummers in 7 minutes. Blue bins in 35 minutes & z racks in 10 minutes I believe. The only problem is if you do not know where the items go you take longer and you get into trouble. If you work in the stock room you would work from 9:15am till 1:45. They recently cut hours and some people now clock in at 9:30am or 10:00am. The pay is also 11:00 an hour. Another problem is lack of communication. You are expected to know the top 5"" spots for Ross and other information & this location does not give any of this information out to anyone. We never get a prep talk or how the day is going to go such as having a truck filled of things so it is going to be a long day or not. They write things on the board but being new I never really understood what those things were. I didn't learn what top five even meant until a month and a half of working there. A board in the store claims they have flexible hours which is a lie.They accuse you of lying if you can not work on certain day such as trying to make their own schedule which is in my opinion not fair since people have kids, another job, school etc  hence needing certain days off. They also like to write people up for certain things such as clocking out a few minutes late. What I dislike the most is"
bad,"Ross Dress for Less is a place where if you have no higher aspirations than becoming a manager, it’s the place for you. The internal hiring is very good at this company but once you get higher up, you’d wish you would’ve stayed oblivious to how the operation really works. Being one notch above regular associate, I got a glimpse of how shady managing practices are at Ross. Blatant disregard for proper channeling when it comes to handling associates and their individual needs. Managers are irrational in their desicion making and tend to favor one over another. I’d have to say the only reason to stay is for the people who endure alongside you working at Ross."
bad,"I work at a fast and professional pace to secure good customer service. Can be very stressful at times with the amount of work, lack of employees per day, and not enough time to finish the extra tasks."
bad,The managers were kinda rude . And I didn’t like the atomosphere a lot of stealing went on . And you had to also clean as well as work the cash register too .
bad,the company has strict rules and guidelines in place however it is only enforced for those not so special few. their is bulling that is an ongoing problem within the store that has been on multiple occasions brushed under the rug or just plainly ignored. management will tell you what they think you want to hear to avoid conflict but immediately turns and talks and laughs about you behind your back with other management and employees in their friend zone/click.
bad,"The store hired people with the expectations that they would rehire.  Too much turnover, not interested in paying people to stay.  Staff that came to work faithfully was never recognized and those who were courted for Assistant Management was often recognized and then given discipline actions."
bad,It was a fast paced job when it comes to being a cashier. Lines were out the door since most days the store was short staffed. The pay was not at all great.
bad,I was given more duties and advancements in title WITHOUT any pay raise or even more stable hours. I did everything imaginable with little to no praise and I can't with sound mind recommend this job. I worked there 3 years way too long. Most of my success there and advancement I had was not due to more training or grooming. I just had to figure most of it out on my own!
bad,Unless your friends with management and don't turn down unscheduled shifts you're guaranteed to go far but cross a superior and you might as well look for a new job.
bad,"Fun job while i jeeded it. Its a job bu u start out with young."
bad,There's no way you'll be able to live on an hourly wage that low. On top of that you will do every job in the store on your feel all day for minimum wage. You're better off at telemarketing or sales job.
bad,"Work started on time"
bad,"As an associate,I was implored by management to do pointless practices intended to maintain in-store cleanliness at a store that never stayed clean. I was on my feet processing transactions for hours on end while being timed and badgered by management about how I wasn't fast enough. There would come a time every day when I would stare into outer space,daydreaming about working somewhere I could make an actual impact instead of wasting away at a discount store. All of this,while a CD curated by corporate played the same songs(awful,most of them) I heard the day before."
bad,"A typical day is extremely busy especially at the waterford location. You can expect to see long lines, shoes everywhere and carts everywhere. I learned to not let these managers overwork me just because their tittle was ""manager"". As hard-working and giving as I am boundaries is a must especially with these managers. If youre sick and cant get out of the bed you are still expected to show up. My co-worker was sick for a week, they threatened to fire if she didnt come in, mind you shes never missed a day of work or called out and there have been others who do ""NO CALL, NO SHOW"" yet they are still there. They have alot of favoritism going on and managers are best friends with employees which is why the no call, no shows are forgiven but when it comes to others its a threat. Managers have their prioritize all messed up, they wait til last minute to start things that should had been started the minute they arrived and clocked in which then results in them getting mad because things are still not done. Everyone ends up going home extremely late, I'm talking 2-3am. And lastly, their turn over rate is terrible. In one week i met 4 new employees just to see that 2 of them quit and they hired 3 more. Everyone who works here leaves because of the dysfunction and corruption in management."
bad,"Not enough pay for the hard work they expect, they don’t necessarily work with your hours.  They expect you to do the job of 5 people by yourself,  and if you’re on the register and have a big line well they don’t really care!They expect you to run the store on a skeleton crew!  I’m a very hard worker, one of their best I would say, but nothing is ever good enough."
bad,"Being my first job, I learned the requirements of an entry level position and how they differed from that of a student. On a typical day my tasks would include working the register, managing the floor or the dressing rooms, and stocking products. I quickly was noticed for my work ethic and was put on many long shifts despite my request for less, because my particular location did not have enough employees to be able to adequately cover the shifts. This was a well known fact in the area and sadly the store suffered a lot from theft which increased the stress of the job as an employee."
bad,Store Management is great. Coworkers are friendly and supportive. Job duties are not to difficult. Upper management has a tendency to micro manage small details. Upper management will rate you heavily on very minor details and will try to save every penny they can. Changes to processes every single week. Customers vary but we must treat every customer as a potential thief. Many customers have no respect for the merchandise or the employees and will leave the store smelling of old cheese.
bad,"As a cashier, the management pushed too hard to be fast on the registers. I understand the faster you ring up customers, the more customers you'll have in a day, the more money you'll make, but if you upset or rush or annoy your staff, you'll drive away customers based on the vibes your staff is putting out there."
bad,I learned how to process apparel and other items when shipments were received and where to place them on the sales floor. I learned how to properly work a register and how to productively ring up a customer's transaction.
bad,"The type of day I have at Ross is a very busy also what iv learn is that speaking to people and helping people makes there day a little better , great"
bad,"i was seasonal. I was given a final day to work; but I was not told that there was not going to be any more hours. I had to go and let the manager know that I was not given any more hours after 12/24/2017.  She said that there was no more hours for now. But I learned that she had promoted some else. I was under the impression that after the seasonal, I might be hire."
bad,The store manager is very unfair and rude. He will question you on why you are calling out. If you have a high fever or something with family he will continue to ask you to come in. He does not care about his employees. It is either his way or the highway.
bad,I did like working there.but I did a lot work in the stock room. it was in warning that i didn't like  working there but that is where I learned my retail skills.  No good pay management has not management skills hours were not good
bad,The location I worked at was very low paced compared to others. The clientele was not the greatest most of the time but what I can say I got out of this job was my ability to assess and fix difficult situations and deal with differing personalities in a way that made the day run smoothly.
bad,"It's a bad minimum wage job.  They don't pay you much of anything, but management expects you to work over your expected hours, or to drop things you had going on to stay late because they didn't schedule the correct amount of people.  In the stock room you never knew how many boxes you would get in, so sometimes you were there for an hour and sometimes you were there for 10 hours, there was no guarantee.  As an associate, they would ask you to stay for an extra shift or two after you worked 4-6 hours if someone called off, and would make you feel bad if you couldn't stay late.  Overall, this is exactly what you think this job would be, and you really only take it if you have no other options."
bad,"Until Senior Management gets reconfigured, I highly suggest staying away from any position in the Construction Department.  Perhaps to achieve a Senior Management position there happens by ""who you know"", not ""what you know"".  While there are some good folks in many departments, the Senior Management in the Construction Department is weak and lacks knowledge in many areas of construction."
bad,"At the beginning of my time at Ross, everything was great, but overtime the only thing I enjoy about going to work is seeing my fun coworkers and clocking out to go home."
bad,I was with this company for 4 years this was my first real job in retail Ross taught me everything I know about retail and customer service. A typical work day can be busy and can be very slow paced but I enjoy fast pace work days it makes the day go by faster. Management was great when I first started working at Ross but after a few months went by we started getting a new management and i was poor. The hardest part about working at this job was dealing with all kinds of people rude and respectful knowing how to stay professional and keep a positive mindset.
bad,"working there i consistently got in trouble because the managers assumed i wasn't doing my job but they refused to check the cameras when i argued to defend myself. I've been accused of stealing or on the verge of stealing, i really don't know what to call it but it made me feel uncomfortable because i was singled out. the store lacks in management and training. I've been a sps for a couple months now and i just got proper training after continuously getting in trouble for not knowing any of the ross information. the hardest part about working there is trying to do your job or at least what you know how to do without a manager coming at you side ways or without them interrupting your work to conversate about something that has nothing to do with work. the most enjoyable part about work is when corp comes in and everyone pretends like they are working hard. i really like corp because they are cool people. and i love my associates. everyone is pretty cool to talk to and it makes work a lot better"
bad,"The job was only available as a minimum wage, part-time job with no benefits and no advancement.  I needed full time hours so could not afford to stay at this job."
bad,"Nothing to really say about this company, it's not the best,  definitely would not recommend or being an option to go back to. Every company has flaws however the best interest is not in the favor of all employees."
bad,"Inconvenient hours, rude customers, merchandise everywhere, managements slacks off, constantly understaffed, always run out of medium and large bags, customers always complain about things."
bad,"The management is unfair,the favor people over others that do the same job.Me personally I would have pefered to stay working on the floor as a driver the to have went into nthe office ."
bad,"Managers outside the company get promoted over great managers already present, these managers usually don't have a clue about the company and makes the store worse. These less knowledgable people promoted over experienced managers either think they know it all or rely on you for everything, sometimes both. Unfortunately they're not fair about promotions, its all about how much you can kiss up to the people in power. "
bad,It is like a typical retail environment. Very busy not a lot of down time. The management fails to support their associates over the customers. The company as a whole cares more about who shops there versus the staff that aids their customers.
bad,i used to love working at Ross. But it got the point where all my hard work would go unappreciated. other associates could take advantage of any the managers and whenever someone had a real excuse to having to leave they will come out telling you that you had to stay and finish your shift or come in to work cause they had no one to cover you. But they wouldn't ask that to any of the other associates
bad,"-Coworkers and management are great people but when it came to work the management looked loss and coworkers would slack off"
bad,It really depends which location you work at and the management team you have. My location is horrible and the place is going downhill fast. The employee morale has gone to thegutter it s no longer enjoyable working there. Always short staffed and they want to overwork the few employees they do have.
bad,"High school type environment, don't do it. you'll make $8-$9 An hour. You'll mostly work part time hours. They'll cut hours constantly, so don't expect to have too much job security there."
bad,"This job is stressful and The management is unfair and does not follow policies nor procedures. You don't receive proper breaks and lunches during your shift.  All together this place only looks out for the people in corporate, unfortunately the associates do not matter to them. It is fast paced so time will go by fast and co-workers make it better be cause they understand and go through the same thing as you."
bad,"Under paid part time retail associates, never enough hours to go around and never enough payroll. they abuse their management team. no one likes it after they start. No full training."
bad,I love my job towards the middle when we had a certain manager then management team fell off we ended up with two more managers that didn't know how to manage they had no respect and took advantage of their title
bad,"Lack of proper training for positions, need better communication between employers and employees. smaller stores have to do more with less.The customers can be... interesting. People will absolutely test your patience, sanity, reflexes, and faith in the human race. makes for some good after-work stories though."
bad,This place is a good place for students that are loolimg for part time jobs. Very friendly staff that will do their best to work with the associates schedule
bad,"•	Worked cash register"
bad,Hours are unstable and work runs out quickly or there is too much work. Some trainers do not train the associates to do the work the correct way which hurts production
bad,Six day weeks are becoming more frequent along with an extra hour on weekdays. When work runs low it is likely to be moved to a different department or asked to leave early.
bad,It is very easy to get hired on here and turn-over is avoided at all costs so it's also pretty hard to be let go. If you are a part time employee then this is a good option.
bad,It is a good place to get your first job. Every person I met there was great but the work was awful for what you were getting paid. and if you are working part time you will probably get like 12 hrs a week only.
bad,"One of the managers that hired me and I actually worked under asked me what my nationality was, when I told him,  his words were "" But your skin is so light, you can't just be black.""  Didn't take me long before I quit."
bad,Learn many tasks.  Customer service experience was not the best.  The store gets a mess easily because it is hard to keep track of the customers that come in.
bad,"Terrible job, ill trained and unclean. I haven't been back since they laid me off... would never go back, they barely train you and the pressure you.."
bad,it seems like the company is not about the employees. some of the corporate status employees act based off of friendships. there is no care for the lower level employees at all.
bad,"With the exception of one manager, the entire rest of the store's employees were constantly fighting to ""fit in"" so that they could keep their hours. Its is just like working for a bunch of superficial high schoolers. If you do something that the managers don't agree with (even in a conversation, not necessarily as a part of your job), you will lose your hours. My hours were reduced to 5 per week, simply because I don't talk about my personal life at work."
bad,"Rosss is a great place to work, if your looking for a part time job. They are very good with working with your schedule. Good place to work for extra money."
bad,a typical day at work is working 10+ hours. Not being fully staffed management and employee wise is a huge concern. Need bodies to operate. it's much to be desired.
bad,"I honestly hated working at Ross but it's retail so not much you can do about it. the pay sucked, management sucked, the hours were terrible, they scheduled you to work just under 40 hours but had absolutely no benefits besides small discounts at affiliated stores. Would not recommend making this your lifelong career choice, but it is good for people just starting out like i was"
bad,The truth is Ross base pay is too high and the ceiling is too low. The expectations of there area supervisors is incredibly overwhelming considering the lack of training management back up and garbage raises. For less than 50 cents of an increase you are met with a over hauled work load and responsibility for a group of people who do not want to work.
bad,"A typical work day is standing and more standing. I learned that Retail is not what I want to do ever again. Management was a revolving door. No one stayed. My coworkers were fun and mostly students; very sweet kids and displayed great customer service."
bad,Terrible management and very uncompromising to work with schedules or emergency issues. Not very good training and pretty bad with promotion opportunity.
bad,Lack of scheduling does not meet employees needs or concerns. Lack of employees over working them and yelling at them in front of others
bad,Bath and Body Works is a great Store to shop and find the fragrances that you love. Working there was alright . I enjoyed greeting the guests.
bad,I had worked for Ross WCDCs for the past 13 years. I had many advancements which led me to an operations manager. I enjoyed my job because of the employees who showed more team work and willing to get along compared to the exempt teams including Hr and VPs. The culture that is being driven there has put fear in alot of people. Its the don't tell policy and you will keep your job. Unfortunately as a person  I found it difficult to allow the behaviors that the exempt team was driving and I had gone against the grain with the immoral acts that were being planned and executed. The only positive benefits were discounts.
bad,"I was discriminated against."
bad,A typical day at work can either go good or bad but always busy.I was always on the register or helping clean the store with whatever section i had that day. The store was always messy through out day.
bad,"Kept a safe and secure environment. "
bad,"I learned many people/customer skills, how to price items, organizing the store, cleaning, etc. Most enjoyable part of the job was organizing the store."
bad,"I walked into work without ever having a formal interview, was hired over the phone. The pay for my position was $9.50 an hour. Now that's not terrible but when you are a part-time worker and there is no organization, the job can cut your hours and have your working 1 day out of the entire week. Do to someone quitting I was only trained for about 3 hours and was on my own from then. BUT..Good luck!"
bad,"flexible schedule, pays as less as possible no benefits at all, if you want to be a full timer you need to be closing every day, people looking at this job as a very temporary job !!!"
bad,"company would not hire after 6 yrs of hard work, no raise, no commissions"
bad,"A Typical day at work, I would go in at 9am, and Clock in and head to the stock room to unload, and unbox Merchandise. "
bad,"A typical day at Ross as a Cashier was not any different from any other cashier positions. You process transactions and if they train you to work the customer service box then you process transactions and accept returns. "
bad,The job was ok but the hours suck. You work all these crazy hours and none of your hard work is noticed. There is no room for advancement.
bad,"I was at Ross Stores for almost a year, the works were definitely under paid! Managers constantly giving task after task without allowing to finish pervious tasks that were asked from another manager. I am very good at multitasking but I felt like the managers at Ross always expected everything done within a snap of a finger and that is just not our reality. Communication is TERRIBLE! No one would ever be clear on what they were suppose to be working on. They also do not provide much training, when I first started they kind of just threw me in the mix and I was suppose to just pick up, which really sucked because I would get yelled at for not keeping up with the normal pace when I didn't even know what I was suppose to do.  Managers often scheduled me when my availability show I wasn't able to work, one the managers actually changed my availability without notifying me. I was also denied availability changed a could times. Long story short, they excepted way too in such little time!"
bad,Ross needs to hire more employees for the long lines that they have and to have a better recovery at the store. It has good product and prices.
bad,"Love all the employees and made some great friends, but management is just awful is unprofessional and seems like they don't know what they are doing."
bad,"This company is unrealistic about company production goals. They view  their employee as robots. If you even call off because your mom is dying they don't care, still expected to come to work."
bad,I have a hard time caring when I am paid minimum wage by a multi-million dollar company. Customers just throw clothes on the floor and its horrible.
bad,The job involves standing on your feet for long periods of time and being alert while looking for shoplifters. Ross is unorganized and management could be better. There are not opportunities for advancement
bad,"The jobs I did at Ross were Loss Prevention, and Sales Associate. The work was not difficult and at times was fun. Lots of good co-workers that I enjoyed working with, but a change in management led to my not wanting to continue being employed. The management lacked communication skills to a point of hurting the productivity of the store. There were a lot of issues with schedules and pay as well that it seemed nobody was doing anything to fix."
bad,"It's okay. Bad hours for part-time and one store only has like five full-timers. If you like clothes, this is your place."
bad,it was ok. Needed a better place to work. Hard and long days. No work life balance. Pay is ok. Don't know what else to say....
bad,"My hardest part about this job was dealing with extremely rude and unprofessional management, made me not want to go into work. I enjoyed some of my coworkers but i pretty much kept to myself and made sure i excelled in my job."
bad,"work here for awhile for part time. i usually have 25-32 hours a week until they cut to only 5 hours and only work 2 days. There will be some good days where i enjoy working with my employees, but some days it's like WTF!"
bad,A typical day is like slave work . Very dreadful . Mangers were inattentive and co-workers stayed to themselves. Warehouse was dark and gray
bad,"I started as a cashier when I started working there. Under new management, and within a few months I became a Front End Supervisor. And once I became a supervisor, I was disrespected. Most of the supervisors I knew would leave me in charge to do their job while they dealt with office tasks. While working there, the company went through several managers and district managers in several months. It was hard to keep track of everyone's names."
bad,"The most one could expect is a few hours a week from 12-21 at the most. At minimum wage, it isn't necessarily a good wage to live off of."
bad,the staff were not to nice it was not a good place to work for me but that is just my opinion
bad,"As far as Ross it was not a fun place to work at. During the week days was slow ,we didn't have the customers like we did on week ends ,and when a race was in town we were extremely busy sales were up and going . I learned a lot about working in the fitting room while I worked at Ross. Our management was not as good as it should have been ,especially the store manager was not nearly as good as she should have been. I really liked  most of my  co-workers, they were nice to work with because we worked as a team .The hardest part of my job, was keeping the customers waited on and happy and smiling  most of the time. The most enjoyable part of  the job was when I had found out I did succeed in making my customers happy ,then I was even very happy myself."
bad,Managers were not really letting you have a chance to come up in the company.
bad,"A day at work was fun and stressful at the time but in general it was wonderful day. Management was there all the time, provided the customors with all the help they needed. My co-workers were like my second famlily we all worked as a team when one of us was a little behind on cleaning after hours we would all ptch in to help one another once our section was clean and organized. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers that were rude and the busy holidays. For me personaly i felt that the official hard part was me working every time someone called off and i wasnt reconized for it nor rewarded. I learn that retail isnt as easy as it seems to be it takes a lot of patients and dedication to maintain the stress levels you may incounter."
bad,"learned about the latest fashion"
bad,As a manager i was paid way below any other manager in the same field. High stress levels to keep the store looking and feeling like a macys or nordstrom. all regular associates have to much on their plate for minimum wage.
bad,Long hours. Not really any time for a family life. Challenging but you got to me some good people from time to time.
bad,"a typical day at work was working with the customers while multitasking various duties such as cashiering, customer service& stocking of sales items. a lot of inconsistencies between management that made it difficult to perform my duties. Not knowing expectations that where needed to achieve my goals daily. Coworkers enjoyed each others company. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
bad,"-Clock in, walk the store for any damaged products"
bad,"The advancement oppertunities are great. Although the Upper Management such as District Managers and HR reps are not very approachable, They do not create a good work life balance. They belittle you and talk down to you. I would not recommend anyone going to work for Ross unless you have to."
bad,"A typical day at this company was more than stressful, you had to be very strong minded and controlled to work there. I learned a lot of hands-on manager training, most managers in training had an individual development plan, current managers fell short of keeping these up to date, which in turn, interfered with management training for those such as myself. Unable to learn more skills without and up date. Unfortunately some parts of the management team played out like a high school drama more than a professional managing team, playing in favoritism and petty gossip, very unprofessional. Co-workers, too, were like high school rumor factory, focusing more on who said what, when, and where, instead of focusing on the task at hand. The hardest part of the job was the customer service, lots of dishonest people and thievery, ticket switching on merchandise was an everyday problem, and the customer would create an uproar until they were given the merchandise at the switched price, I had been cursed at and threatened lots of times at that company. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to grow and learn when possible. That is until the management training for all eligible candidates was at a stand still. The company was no longer hiring or promoting assistant managers, leaving no room for anyone to move up."
bad,"Mgmt doesn't know how to do there jobs"
bad,"Working at Ross has opened my eyes to how little respect management can give their employees, though this may just be at the location that i work. This place has a high rollover rate because of the management. The job itself isn't bad. I like the early hours i work. I enjoy working with my coworkers as well, and we all work cohesively together. The management belittles us, and expects us to not have a life outside of the job. We are only given a max of 24 hours a week, and they will switch the days you're supposed to work without letting you know."
bad,Company has no standards when it comes to staff and customers. Employes are hard to deal with and top talent is hard to come by.
bad,Management was bad and discrimination included bad communication.
bad,Ross is a great company with some great staff members. working in such an organization gives you the opportunity to meet great people and a joy in knowing your assistance has made a refreshing difference in their day.
bad,"Advancement opportunities are not lucrative and rather difficult if personal feelings between employees/management exist. It becomes a daily struggle to enact job duties desired by upper management when supplies lack, staffing issues exist, and no team work. However fellow employees are lovely to work with."
bad,This company doesn't follow the three steps of corrective action.
bad,"If you work retail, do it for a very short period. At this job and other retail jobs, they schedule you 20 hours one week, 8 the next, then 0. Nothing is set or structured and a lot of people call out. This wasn't the environment for me."
bad,"A typical day at work is when I get there we process the inventory which we receive boxes with different things that we have to put in the correct places in four hours or more if there is overtime available ,and my coworkers and I assist the front cashiers. The hardest part of the job is the Christmas holidays because there is so much inventory to process, I enjoy having first picks at clothing and shoes."
bad,There are many things that could be improved by this company
bad,"As an area supervisor I was in lead of apparel. On a daily basis I'd focus on my flows and at given times I would also act as the Manager on duty. All associates were very pleasant to work with. There were exceptional team players, who were on top of there game and did what was expected of them with out being told constantly and it was always a joy to work them them. "
bad,Worked with a lot of different kinds of people which made work interesting.  Bad management made it hard to complete tasks.
bad,"no concern for employees , we are all replacible . problems arise and reported to proper chain of comand,no one des anything about"
bad,It is all about team work at this job. The management is good but the sometimes coworkers are not good team players or they are very negative. I prefer a positive and encouraging work atmosphere. I learn every day to work hard and always try to set goals to better myself. It helps me if I am focused if there is no goal I feel purposeless.
bad,"Every day was basically the same. Work 9-5 and make minimum wage. I was good at what I did, I never got recognition from management, and they basically left the store up to me and the other employees. There was no leadership and no benefits of any kind. I should have made 15 dollars an hour for the kind of work they had me do. I would suggest finding another company to work for."
bad,Under paying job for work that is being asked to be done. Employees are treated unfair and basically feel like they cant stand up for them selves without being reminded that they could easily be replaced. 
bad,"Short shifts, nice co-workers. the hardest part of the job was the customers and dealing with managers. "
bad,As a company Ross has great ideas and changes to make the company better. However the execution and delivery of such changes are not always the best and most efficient. Working at Ross is very busy and can be fun. I have learned in the many years that I was with the company how to handle tricky situation and a calm and customer friendly attitude. I really enjoy that I was able to have the opportunity to work with many different types of people. The hardest part of my job was the inconsistencies in scheduling it was always changing and then being changed again. Which can be very changeling in a family of 8.     
bad,"very busy"
bad,Chaotic workplace.. Management do not work as a team instead throwing anyone under the bus and also some management team taking credit from someone's else hard work... I like the company to work with but i never got a recognition from my DM or from my peers after the great visit or good results regarding my department.. If its a bad visit then I get a criticism and I feel like not part of the team and lack of professionalism... Anyway I'm here to work to pay my bills but I'm hoping someday they see my hard work and pride of my position...
bad,"I started as an associate in the bay araea and excelled quickly to srl. I had to move to the central valley due to family and continued working for ross. I was passed up by internal canidats transfering in from other ross stores out of state, for positions that I worked hard for."
bad,I would go to work without a partners help. I learned how to operate a pacer and a walkie i also learned to off load trucks. They would just tell us what to do and offered very poor help. Co-workers where good workers. The hardest part of the job was some paper work but it was no problem. The most enjoyable part of my job was working their i enjoyed it but very poor help and getting experience to move on from Ross.
bad,"Neither liked nor greatly disliked working there. Hours were too long especially after close, but that mostly reflected on the people that shopped there not the company"
bad,"The workplace is very nice and so are the employees and management. The only serious drawback is that this is not a job with steady hours or income. It is more suited for retirees, disabled people or students who only need a little bit of extra spending cash. The management may promise a minimum of 10 hours a week; however, the minimum hours an employee can be scheduled for is 4 hours a week. That is not enough to support anyone."
bad,"A typical work day at Ross is repetitive. You unload cartons, push them out on a push belt. From there you unpack the merchandise and load them into hummers and blue bins to be transported to the department in which they belong (Hard lines). If you are on apparel the cartons get pushed in a separate direction for you to accept. They get unpacked, hard tagged for loss prevention, size nubbed, and hung on a rack according to the store layout for easier hanging on store racks. Management is ok. My co workers are great. The time limit to get things done is very little so you have to work hard and fast."
bad,"The Area Supervisor is a member of the Supervisory Staff who is responsible for a specific, assigned area of the store as well as the general operations and supervision of the store when functioning as the Supervisor on Duty. Area Supervisors are responsible for opening and closing the store, supervising Associates, providing Star Customer Service at all times, supervising merchandise processing, markdowns, sizing and the Front End as needed."
bad,"Minimum wage and constant short staffing and staying late for shifts and bugs EVERYWHERE. The schedule being posted doesn't mean that's when you're expected to work -- they'll post a different one the next day, so if you don't work Saturday, be sure to call in or get written up for not showing up on the right day."
bad,I enjoyed working at Ross. The managers did not do any work and was very inmature.
bad,Dm only wants men to be manager. talk down to all management team does not talk to any empoylee when he visit always on phone.
bad,We had worked very hard to be ranked number 1 in our district. New mgr and DM have lowered the standard for hiring and expections for the store.
bad,This is no place for a long term career w/ growth possibilities.
bad,co-workers are nice but when it comes to management it get very high school your hours are picked out from how good of friends you are with certin managers. the hardest part of the job is not being on your feet all day or putting up with rude customers it is dealing with management.
bad,A typical work day was being put on a register while lines were half way down isles. Learned to put a smile on even if a customer wants things there way. Management worked hard but some could not maintain there stress levels. Co workers were always exhausted and tired. Hardest part was being on my feet eight to ten hours strait. Most enjoyable part was working with people.
bad,i believe they worked us to hard for a little pay. not enough teamwork.
bad,"They never have enough staff on duty..If your lucky 2 checkout lanes will be open and they will be all the way backed up, so if your scheduled in another department you will be called to register...Managers are lazy and if your not one of their favorites good luck cause your job will be h***!!!"
bad,"In the beginning, Ross promised me advancements and within a few months I would get full-time. The Ross store I was employed with had certain ""clicks"", if you will. I, however hard I worked, did not fall into any of those ""clicks"" and had my hours down to nothing. I was informed that I am still an employee, however no calls to work. It makes me sad that great employees that benefit that organization are being treated in such a manner."
bad,Not enough hours for part-time and if the store manager does not like you you will get no hours..  so you have to be a yes man in this company to make it..
bad,"I like the company,The current store manager isn't running the store properly.In the beginning four years ago,it was a good place to work management was great up until July of last year when a new store manager was hired."
bad,"I usually worked doing markdown merchandise, put the merchandise on clearance section,organized all the merchandise for sizes and colors, and for types."
bad,the management tried to make thing more fun but the people higher up had a problem with that. the work area was cold and we were not allowed to play music even thougth it was have improved moral.
bad,"Decent for a first job, other than that the company doesn’t prioritize you. Raises can be less than 20 cents a hour. Company is based on favoritism for promotions"
bad,"The store was always disorganized even with all the effort done to maintain it throughout open hours. We were not allowed to stay past closing hours to thoroughly clean the mess shoppers left behind. Very repetitive, management would rush you to be faster when already giving it all you have. It was very tiring after a few months. "
bad,The store is a busy store if you are a cashier that is what you will be doing. The manager assigns tasks but unable to complete because it is so busy.
bad,I was told I would get between 20 and 25 hours per week and I only get between 4 and 8 hours per week. Management is nice on tg hd outside but in all actuality they are very selfish.
bad,"After being with this company for 5 years, I can say it is terrible. It’s not the pace that makes it bad either, I actually enjoyed the constant running around. The problem is HR will continue to ignore employees complaints about management and their behavior. The SM and ASM will pile up petty infractions so they can nail you with a larger write up. They will make you feel like you can’t have a social life. They will guilt you for being physically and mentally ill, which is absolutely against company policy. Management will hide in the office while the rest of the store may as well be on fire because they have supposedly been told by the DM that they should be “less hands on.” and if anyone questions it they are told “it is none of their concern what goes on behind that door.” I’ve caught managers on their personal phones tending to personal matters on company time, watching YouTube, Netflix, etc. It’s funny how break and work time blur together for them... It is shameful how they behave and treat others. If you want to work here for the experience, by all means do it, but be in control of your hours and do not let them take advantage of you."
bad,"I work so hard here. Our SM decided to transfer to OH which left our store short handed. Myself and my coworker had to pick up the slack. Both of us capable and wanted SM, and neither got it. They hired outside the company. After we worked open to close for them! 6 days a week! No structure, constant changes, no payroll and you are expected to RUN. All stock work is timed. Kills your spirit."
bad,"The place is very unorganized because they don't use skew numbers or barcodes on the shelves."
bad,This place is never really busy unless it is the Holidays. And the store always understaffed and shelves are always empty. People would always ask if we were closing. Poor management team.
bad,Ross in general has a high turn over rate for good reason.  Management expects you to do way more than you’re initially told. The pay is average for retail type work. The hours can be hit or miss.
bad,"No support from upper management, Store Managers do not hold any power and District Managers and other District / Zone / Corporate Leaders do NOT communicate at all."
bad,"I don't know where to start, I can start on the side that I was ""Fron end Supervisor"" and they pay me the same as my coworkers, or on the side that almost every Sunday I left work at 4pm, but I had 3 hours to do my things, because at 7pm I had to fall asleep so I could be at work on Monday at 4am. Or also on the side where the managers refuted me because I sent my coworkers to their break or lunch, that was their time, but the managers did not want to give it to them. The work is very stressful depending on the position you have and the store in which you are, the store of the Dolphin mall is always stressful, no matter what position you have and that of the 137 and 46 is more relaxed but it is not good That you are front end, because in some part the pressure of the entire store falls on you, and they won't pay you for that."
bad,"I feel like the retail businesses have high expectations and low incentives, gratefullness or care for employees, I've yet to find one. Ross gave me a quick 5 hour a day schedule to supplement income, but nothing to goal for. The store I worked for seemed to not care about collaboration only to get the job done. It was a consistant schedule and a regular pay day."
bad,"Long hours and customers show no respect, Working there you need to know how to work fast past,  you need to know how to multitask and is best when your bilingual."
bad,Overall a Good job. Pays was very low. Good fit for a student or something. Discount is nice to have aswell. The customers were nice. A recommend this job
bad,"Just another retails location. Deal with work place politics, customers that are difficult. placed more responsibilities and duties on team members that were beyond their job descriptions."
bad,"Store was super packed with merchandise and very cluttered, made it very uncomfortable working there unless you were cashier or loss prevention at the front of the store which isn't as messy as the entire sales floor. Stock Room was very fast paced but easily manageable to complete each hummer with merchandise to roll out on the floor. Rolling the merchandise on the floor was sometimes difficult due to how cluttered the store was. Cashiering was fun, easy goals to meet. If you're in the ""box"" for register 1,2, or 3 it gets super messy with hangers, tags, beepers, and go backs that you have to deal with while ringing up customers. Loss Prevention is very boring. You stand at the front of the store all day, greeting customers. You can't even do anything if you catch someone stealing. Management was very unprofessional and causing drama. Played favoritism and would promise promotions but never follow through with it. Best part of the job were the coworkers and customers you would talk to."
bad,Required to be a cashier but also put clothes back where it goes. You will be putting clothes back on the racks and hear your name be called to jewelry only to then be called back to your register and then be called back to put things on the racks. Very very very past paced and frankly you'll feel overworked for the amount of salary given.
bad,"If you get lucky, you'll get put in a store with good management and a good team to work with, and everyone will communicate and work together as they should. But that's rare. The work was simple and easy, even though they usually try to rush you through the workday if you're in stock. But if you need anything done by management or higher, you'll have to deal with some of the most uncooperative, unresponsive, and irresponsible people. I'm amazed that the district manager even has their job with some of the decision they made, such as leaving my store without a manager for months because she put him somewhere else. In general, it's fine as a part time job, but if you try to go full time, expect them to be calling you about work nearly every day. Not for me."
bad,If you have a degree then don't waste your time because it is a place where all about who you know and not what you know. Your supervisor may has no high school degree but he has the right color and relationships...... and its more about favoritism and parties....
bad,"This place was unorganized, unprofessional, and stressful. Some of the coworkers don't like to do their job, which means the rest of us had to pick up their slack on top of ours. Management was good, except for one manager, who was loud and intolerable, and she was the hiring manager. Overall, not a good place to work, especially since it's not paying well."
bad,Job is flexible when it comes to scheduling but the pay is way less for the amount of effort and time you put in.  Some times the job is stressful when you are under staffed.
bad,"I am thankful for the opportunity, employment, and things i've learned with this job. It was a good experience and somewhat worked out for the time being. With that being said i would never again in life for or even apply for another ross position as the conditions were'nt the best and they treat us associates as if we were invaluable and very disposable."
bad,"I'm not sure who to blame management or the corporation, not enough help especially on busy days. They do spread you thin there...a blessing & a curse."
bad,", New manager came in and cleaned house. Some got out early, I decided to stay and help out, though he and the new assistant tried to go behind my back and replace me in a position that I had been in for 2 years and had earned. Management is clueless and lazy sitting in the office all day gossiping, while the assistant runs the store micromanaging and bullying the associates. They blame hard working, veteran associates for their mistakes and shortcomings to save themselves from the wrath of the grumpy DM. Moving up in the company isn't difficult if you do your job, but it's really not worth it for the extra dollar you make more than a regular associate. Maintaining cleanliness of the store is one of the biggest hurdles, given that adults and their children treat the place like it's their own personal dumping ground. Many times did I find myself knee deep in a pile of shoes at 3am wishing I had stayed in college. The turnover rate is especially high considering the only real qualification is having a face, leading to associates that are as lazy and apathetic as the customers. "
bad,"I worked at the Ross on Brodie Lane in Austin Tx. That location is awful, very disorganized!! They have no organization going on, starting with the managers they play too much favoritism, they only reward their favorite employees and never reward those who are  trying and the employees are just full of drama everyday.  The environment is just so negative, they are always gossiping about each other. I didn’t feel welcomed or appreciated at all!! They don’t even give no type of benefits at all, they want you to work and come in in your days off but you’re not even getting no benefits"
bad,"Management was complete Trash... it's not everyday you find the management being the catty ones and the workers rolling their eyes at them. Seriously awful environment, but the coworkers were great! Hours were scarce if you w in the managers group of friends. No benefits. Awesome discounts(the only reason I stayed for a while, even so, eventually wasnt enough.ere"
bad,As a stock clerk you can barely get hours. You will work 4 hours a day maybe 3 days a week. This job is for someone looking to get out of the house that does NOT need the money. The minimum wage is $11 an hour but it does not make up for the lack of hours. You can work in other dept. to get more hours but you can NOT work overtime. Management is not good at all.
bad,a typical day at work can be hectic. there are days when the store is quiet but you always get a crowd of people at a certain time in the day. i learned that the customer is always right and its best to be calm when a customer is upset.
bad,I had high Hope's for this company but it was just like most retail jobs. It really depends on upper management. The manager I was under was doing unethical things and constantly lie. He was later fired
bad,I get to work and unload truck then leave. Management is Ok hours are short. Sometimes they cancel without calling first .the work environment in stressful
bad,If you have ever been into a discount store then you know how chaotic they are. The employees are underpaid and overworked. The clientele are messy and disrespectful. It is a very high stress environment for minimum wage.
bad,"Management varies from exceptional to abysmal. Poor upper management hurts local managers ability to perform to the best of their abilities. ""not enough payroll"" was an all too common issue."
bad,"This job is okay if it's not your primary job. Management have favorites or they pick and choose who to pick on. Most people working at this location are lazy, they take advantage of their breaks. By not clocking out or taking longer than they should. The management doesn't do anything about this and always end up picking on the people that actually work hard. Management always complains about payroll, they don't motivate the employees, they never really do anything fun for the employees. Some of the managers are rude, and unprofessional."
bad,"Didn't like the corporate culture. If someone didn't like you, you were pretty much pigeonholed in your position."
bad,"Worked at Ross for almost 3 years, I started to move up within the company until i went on maternity leave my position was given away . "
bad,Pressure on every day to get the job done very stressful management was terrible place to work never got  written up for anyting but they found a way to say that I put something in the wrong place and they let me go for that
bad,During the time that I worked at Ross my experience was very horrible. There is little to no room for advancent opportunities. Everyone in the store was part-time in exception for management and a few other people. Overtime at the location I worked was not offered. No benefits and the pay is beyond disgusting!!!!
bad,"The management is always quitting,   Co-workers are also always changing prices on tags and stealing from the store.   Customers are very rude.   I would never recommend this place."
bad,This store is located in a college town that can have high turnover.  The duties required by each position takes effort and these duties should / must be completed to assist the following shift's duties.
bad,"Worked here for 3 years. "
bad,Lack of supervision in all job tasks.  Scheduling was very inconsistent. No employee benefits for part-time workers. Scheduling enough employees in for daily tasks was always a challenge for them.
bad,I was told to organize shoes and clothes on first day but a temporary manger. Next day new manger comes in doesn’t acknowledge me and I didn’t have any actual training. Doing hiring process I was told not to apply if I didn’t want to work. I was under the impression I would’ve been working a lot. I only worked 1/3 days a week. Pay was okay.most of my shift was me walking around trying to organize racks of clothes that would’ve taken longer hours to organize. Nothing I’m store was organized and rare you would find double of the same thing or I’m a different size.
bad,"Ross doesn't care about their employees. Ross field leaders need to work on communication, especially with people who have a desire to grow with the company"
bad,I have been working at ross for about 3 years now. My job is to minimize theft by providing customer service. My main job as a store protection specialist is to greet customers as they walk in.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at/with this company. No concern for anyone's well being. Not reasonable if you request time off for family,death, etc."
bad,"Most of the problem of working at this establishment was because of the management and the terrible store manager that used to be in charge of my particular location. Had we had different management, it is likely it would not have been as bad of an experience."
bad,"Quite frankly, it isn't worth it. Especially if you are a store protection specialist. You are barely trained, then are told things in the training that will be contradicted by someone else later. Too many chiefs, and they will all tell you something different about policies, or not know them at all."
bad,"Ross is a good company to work for, part time. Managers are good at leading and it’s a lot of hours during the holidays as well. Would recommend working here during college"
bad,"Don't work here if you don't have to. A very stressful work place, to be in. There is never any help on the  registers and the lines are always backed up."
bad,"I was hired with intent they was gonna keep me after holiday rush but as soon as it was over they cut me down to 2 days a week, and claim that’s because they didn’t have trucks, so basically no trucks no hours"
bad,Ross Dress for Less is a company that pushes you to the limit for little pay. I would not recommend working for this place. The assistant manager trainee program is not what they tell you.
bad,"Pretty good company to work for unless you are looking for acknowledgement  for being on time, always there for your shift or you ability to do your job effectively."
bad,"poor management and hectic hours, They allow some room for schedule to be what you desire but everyone talks bad about one another and its just a negative vibe."
bad,This place would be great for a student needing some extra cash or someone who has a few hours to work during the week. Definitely not a place for a career. Upper management on a regional level is HORRIBLE. But the double discount days you get are great! You will meet some amazing people as well. Just don't make it a career.
bad,"They don't even let you leave the building on your lunch break. The place is a plantation. They work you like a slave but you do get paid slightly better. All employees are temp to hire, they have draconian work policies and micro managers who are more like hall monitors than actual business professionals. I suspect a lot of man hours we work were due to their incompetence and slack management. We spent a lot of time cleaning up their mistakes because they could not coordinate shipping and loading."
bad,I was a front end supervisor and backup loss prevention. We were constantly over worked and as a result many workers and managers walking out of the job and never came back leaving the workers who stayed with the same amount of chaos and customers. The people who were supposed to be management didnt get communication from their superiors and that confusion trickled down to the floor workers. Great place to shop but not work.
bad,"A typical day when you are employed at Ross Dress for Less almost always entails a fast-paced and busy environment. What I have learned in my time while being employed with Ross was that I have to work hard but if you are a person that enjoys happy, satisfied customers that can easily shop for what they need then Ross is perfect job for you. The management team at Ross all depends on which store that you work at. Depending on your availability and your work ethic, management can be your best friend or if you do the bare minimum they will not be on your side. Ross Dress for Less's workplace culture consists of eager customers based on the availability and pricing of the clothing and shoes. The hardest part of working at Ross would most definitely have to be at the end of your shift keeping up throughout the store on it's appearance."
bad,Everything was unorganized. Supervisors and managers expected too much in so little time and never took the time to help. Not enough hours per week given to employees. The only thing I really enjoyed at the time was the flexible schedule.
bad,I loved working at Ross because of the people but it was very long cleaning hours for closing shifts and stressful in tourist areas I wouldn’t advise to the faint of heart to work here.
bad,they hire way to many new people to work at the same time as it hurts every one working there to make money causing problems for people in the work site i was forced as much to leave due to this problem
bad,i wasn’t signed up all the way for the job pore management manager didn’t finish paper work so i wasn’t able to work after the new supervisor come on  my paperwork work was expired it was so many days the manager had to put my paper work in
bad,The management team would often complain about how hours are restricted due to sales but never gave a clear solution to increase sales and obtain more hours. The store manager was often pessimistic and petty over others taking independent initiative while the other managers were clearly not up to task and made it public that they were not satisfied. The great team came from the coworkers I met during my time there and our shared problems and concerns is what made the job tolerable.
bad,"At first I enjoyed it a lot. But then they want to give you a lot of responsibilities but they don’t want to pay you more. The only thing keeping me here is how flexible they can be, especially since I go to college, it helps."
bad,"I would average less than forty hours a week as a full time employee. I would stand on my feet the whole day. If someone was walking out the store with merchandise (stealing) without paying you could not go after him to stop him after they exited the store. You had to stand at the front of the store the whole shift. You could not walk the store to look for suspicious activity. A lot of merchandise was out of its box or plastic container, missing merchandise, empty containers. You would find hard tags ( a security device) always on the floor."
bad,You are employed through a temp agency. I worked there two summers in a row. It payed the bills and helped me do what I needed to do. Will go back if I ever need extra funds. Meet my spouse there and we have been together ever sense. I will always be grateful for that.
bad,"Great discounts, customers tear up displays, racks, merchandise.  Much of the time is spent repairing the damage that the customers have done.  Associates are hard working, and get along well with each other"
bad,I was having a hard time with the current position I was holding. First of all was not told until the last minute where they’re going to put when I had signed up to be a cashier. When I approached them about moving to cashier from stockroom they didn’t really even listen to me. I was having a hard time in the stockroom and wanted to move but it wasn’t up for discussion at all so I’m return caused me to resign.
bad,It was a warehouse job you had to work quickly and alone on your feet daily for 8 hours. This job made me gain more experience working alone and getting things done quickly.
bad,"What I've learned being employed with Ross is if you're not on managements buddy side you don't get treated fairly,, They complain when you have family emergencies and you get punished even with a DR, excuse by them calling you off or not scheduling you but one day a week. You try to go to upper management like an general manager to discuss the issue and nothing is done to resolve the issue of not just one employee but two or three with the same complaint. Expectations set to certain standards but no help in the progress all take no give environment. No career job just a pay check by pay check job. Enjoyable part is some employees and the fact I will get paid for working so hard."
bad,"A day at work is fast-paced and pretty stressful for only working >20 hours a week. You'll work like a dog to receive only your paycheck at the end of every other week. Customers are pretty rude, as expected, it is a ross. The best part of the day is clocking out. The hardest part of the job is the fact that you will get called in any days you're off, and when you are working, your scheduled breaks are usually forgotten by the people whose job it is to relive you for them."
bad,good prices and discount people worked with were great customers you saw all the time you made friends when busy with lots of people it got frustrating
bad,"i worked in the stock room, at two separate locations, the first location was good,the second location they ran their stock room into the ground. management was a joke"
bad,"Stock associate positions require an ability to work with a fast pace, ""busy hands"", good team playing attitude and able to take direction and be flexible to learn. "
bad,Ross was an interesting place of employment.  The workplace culture was for the most very unhappy. The store was a mess all the time and management seemed to different agendas for different employees of the same job function.  Did get a discount every 3 months.
bad,"All in all, I find that this job is what you make it. The management is decent, but there is unfairness with the hour system. The best part of the job is the other stock employees."
bad,"Too many abrupt schedule changes. Poor training systems. Very mentally taxing work with semi-hostile coworkers. However, the pay was decent. Still, wouldn't work there again."
bad,Able to meet new and interesting people a great place to network Loved what I did because of the wonderful people I came across good experience in people management skills
bad,I have been with the company for 3 years and it was a fast pace cut throat environment and It was very difficult to get the managers to do there job properly.
bad,"Al principio te dan muchas horas para ""entrenarte"", luego pasas de trabajar 5 o 6 días a la semana a 2 o 3 días. No vale la pena."
bad,"Personal, I still enjoy shopping there, Its a great store if you are looking for a great budget. I was just looking for more of a career. I felt as though i was stunting my growth there, & it was time for a change."
bad,It was such a negative environment. Management seemed to always be in a bad mood. The computers they provided hardly ever worked. Parking was horrible too.
bad,"Great benefits fast-paced make your day go by faster  I just had a manager  that was unconcerned with employees receiving Fair benefits,  more hours and no overtime"
bad,"I am a hardworking no-nonsense focused individual.  I enjoyed my job.  That store is just not where I belong.  There are, however, many individuals who work there that I am/was very fond/appreciative of."
bad,"Manager Never Did His Job Right. The boxes were too heavy. When You Need Help, people Want Help You. The Supervisors Rarely Do Their Intended Job. One Supervisor Did nothing but have casual conversations with employees like they're friends from high school or something"
bad,"i work 1 day a week 4 hours in the beginning I had good hours for part time but then it jus gotten shorter as the months went by. Great people, very quick paced. everyone was nice and greeted everyone they passed overall great experience just wish had more hours."
bad,it was a good place to work but no too many hours and some times they called the to tell no go the work because they have hours so no at stable place to work
bad,The job was stessful at times and not well organize some days and the changeover with management often. I work in one partically store for several years and was the management team change to 4 different managers and several area supervisors
bad,"Horrible. Management was lazy , didn’t appreciate the thirst for growth and lots of favoritism . It Wasn’t a fair company for employees who want to grow"
bad,Great job to have some kind of income coming in while going to school or looking for a full time job. Flexible scheduling and great employee benefits like great employee discount.
bad,The coworkers are friendly but the management does not care about you. They don't train you in areas you should have been trained and expect you to already know it
bad,"The job itself was pretty simple & easy.  However, after being hired I didn’t receive a schedule.  I asked about it and was told someone would call me when they want me to come in.   I thought that was really unprofessional because I didn’t agree to be on call.  I don’t have the luxury to wait around, I have bills. I was under the impression that I was going to have a actual schedule. Overall this is the type of job where they give you little hours and cut you when they don’t need you. On the average day you might get 4-5 hours. Just a complete waste of time."
bad,"This location was very slow, on my shift we probably averaged 20 customers. The environment isn't any fun at all. When working on the floor its very stressful trying to organize clothes"
bad,"If you have ever been in a Ross, you should know that the store is often a mess, and the layout is ever changing. When working there, you have to acknowledge that and be willing to adapt constantly. It is not a hard job and is great for beginners."
bad,If you love working in retail then please don't work here because you will hate it. This is definitely not a job I see working long term. Its a great place to start after graduation and to get experience but a person can only take so much of disrespect and the lack a care for the employees.
bad,if you are a cashier you must work quickly to keep lines moving and putting product that wasn't purchase back in their area before getting call back to front.
bad,They will work you overtime without getting the pay. As a Store Manager in the San Diego market they will pay you salary and will make you work over your hrs stated in your contract. You are to work 9 hrs per day but they will have you work over 11+ hrs per day and even 6-7 days a week to take advantage of you as you are salary.
bad,this job is good to get into work environment . Very fast paced job need a lot on patience and organizational skills need to be people friendly a lot of customer interaction
bad,Working with this company can be very fast paced or just a slow day like a Monday at the beginning of the week. The management skills are very poor but the associates are very helpful.
bad,"It’s a fun place to work , just would of liked if I had got more hours . I would like to go back but just would want a full time position because they only cut part timers hours only ."
bad,No matter what you did the store was NEVER in order. Kids running around everywhere. People trying to steal things. People trying to change tags on merchandise it was CRAZY!!!
bad,"The fact this is basically a surplus discount store I guess it's not surprising that there's a lack of personal space and common decency. The customers are more than often rude or unconcerned with the fact that you are working around them and there's not much to be done about it. Excellent stock room manager however, nice lady who understands small problems."
bad,A typical day consists of doing the same thing which is making sure your assigned department is clean and help out ringing up customers. Overall easy job
bad,"I loved my coworkers they were like family to me, but corporate was horrible. We have a policy for a reason and apparently corporate didn't understand that so when we would follow policy customers got angry called corporate and told us to just give the customer what ever they want. Whats the point of having policy if corporate them selves doesn't want to fallow it."
bad,every day things were backup store stayed messy the recovery section was always out of the right place also the job was stressful because of the demand
bad,I loved my co-workers management played favorites and they seem to not want to work with other employees or play by the rules unless you where one of the favorites
bad,Overall this job is boring. I was there for at least 6 months and never progressed. My hours were cut so short i would work 12 hours a week. A person cannot make a living that way. this issue was presented to the managers many times. There was a man who would threaten Ross Associates and costumers. When we would go to our store manager she said there is nothing we can do. This man made some employees go into tears. I did learn a lot about the Ross way and costumer service.
bad,The actual job itself isn't the problem. Its really easy to do. You do not get enough hours and there is really bad management. The location I worked at has a huge turnover rate and management and lack of hours has a lot to do with it.
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal worker with promises of full time opportunity. That never happened. Ross store #606 has no store manager, just an assistant manager and whom ever is on duty. Overall, I actually liked my job as a stocker or retail associate. But they couldn't give me more days on the schedule. I worked only 4 days per week, because I was taking evening classes. But I would always get called off and was only able to work one day per week. This was based off of the truck delivery loads. The pay was $9.00 per hour and overtime (if you could actually get it) was $ 13.50 per hour. There were lots of new employees quitting due to this problem and the organization from management. There also were typically arguments amongst employees and management. Although I liked my job, I had to leave."
bad,"I really didn't feel like I was going anywhere with this job. The customers are horrible, management is too inconsistent, and you feel no progress. It really is only a part time kind of job"
bad,"The hardest part of the job is always having to help others who can't do their job, because they just don't care."
bad,Manager at Greenacres Fl store does not communicate with employees. Hired over 25 employees to help set up new store and then began to cut hours until the point where employees werent even scheduled to work. But get this as they were cutting hours they had jobs posted online saying that they are hiring. They used employees to help set up the new store and then laid them off to hire new people. This place is a total joke!
bad,"If you don't mind inconsistency, this is the job for you."
bad,you'd walk into work.  the store was a mess. id be sent to the fitting room to clean it before my shift. id be in charge of letting people into the fitting rooms and bathrooms
bad,Suggestions often go unheard and management worries about the wrong issues instead of undeniable ones. Problems are not solved until they are completely horrible.
bad,"If someone is trying to find a job, Ross is an okay place to start. Customer service retails are always the toughest job that many people don't appreciate."
bad,management (store manager) was very unprofessional. over scheduling as well as under scheduling. Does not care for its employee's. OVER WORKED AND UNDER PAID.
bad,What I normally do at Ross is I attend to all the customers by getting on the cash register and interacting with them with a big smile and asking how are their day.
bad,"Within the store, it is a fun setting.  I believe in keeping cost low and  the other business modules they employ except for the amount they pay their workers for what they expect."
bad,"hectic environment, purely a part-time or additional income type of business"
bad,I would work here as an absolute last resort. It's not fun but by any means. you deal with the worst customers with the worst attitudes. Also management wasn't my favorite group of people
bad,"Overall it's an ok company to work for. The hours are flexible. I did advance one time, but I didn't receive the pay for the position. So, I took it for the experience. Also, there was never any full time positions available. Which made me have to get a second job. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and having great relationships with my customers and a couple employees."
bad,Too much required for minimum pay. Constantly told theres no payroll. Forces people to do more work instead. Hates giving raises. Can never call out sick. Always making sure we are replacable. Ridiculous hours.
bad,Management team was amazing The store worked as a whole team. Wonderful experience. Chance for advancement. Good benefits. Employee discount on merchandise was great. All around a great working environment.
bad,It's a great job if you like being active all the time.  Since Ross is always busy and understaffed. Customers are very hard to work with they try to get discounts on everything and always complain of how busy we are
bad,"Fast paced environment made the day go by fast, employees could hardly keep up with organization and cleaning of the departments. Managers where rude as well could never help when needed"
bad,"Too many task, not enough payroll hours to complete. The store stays open until 11:30p weekdays and 12a on weekends when the rest of the stores in the strip center closes at 9p. Very busy and Chaotic."
bad,Not a real bad place to work. Management was friendly as well as other associates. Flexible with school schedule as well as being understanding when my granddaughter was born.
bad,Horrible paying job and extremely stressful to work at. It got to the point where I hated going to my job and was sick to my stomach walking in the door. Store managers not knowing how to prioritize tasks and always having the store look extremely Junkie. Training was very minimal but expected you to know your job. I was offered another promotion but turned it down and went elsewhere so happy I no longer work for that place.
bad,"I didn't like it cause  supervisors had their favorite people and I didn't like that  "" Favoritism"" Theywere always change the process of the job I was doing it would make it harder for me to work"
bad,I was part of management and I have to say that the management here was horrible. The store manger would pick employees she don't like and find a way to fire them for something they didn't do.
bad,Do not believe anything the recruiters say. They will use the bait and switch method to get you onboarded and then turn you over to a training program that is a joke due to the training managers using as labor. There are no incentitives for associates to be loyal to the company and they treat the Ross the way Ross as they treat them and this is as benefit a human. The STEP team is nothing but a legalized sweatshop with illegals working on falsified documents whom do not speak any English. They will call you a manager and that's exactly what you will be. You will not be leading anything besides managing continued chaos.
bad,"No matter how many people on payroll, there are never enough on the schedule.  Payroll requirements are too tight.  You are expected to get everything done with only one or two associates.  "
bad,very unorganized company I believe maybe now since they have better staff its better but as for me while I was working there it was not a fun environment to work in
bad,Overall I enjoy working with this company. It has gave me plently of experience in customer service and as a cashier/ stock clerk. I get along well with my co workers and management.
bad,"I was a seasonal associate at Ross. Before the season was over, I was told to help other associates, who are there permanently. As I turned around to hang up some clothes, I slipped and fell on the whole right side of my body. It isn't my fault that they couldn't keep their spot clean. I, at least, did my part. Of course, Workers Compensation. Because I was a seasonal associate only, I was told to leave. I know that if I didn't fall at work, I would've been hired permanently. I'm quite glad I stopped working there though. Some of the employees there are bullies. There's too much drama that shouldn't even be drama."
bad,I work here as a security guard. Great place to talk to customers and network ability. I have the tendency to talk to customers and helped them with directions in the store but management usually get involved and tell me to stop helping them. Management team doesn't care too much about customer service. They are there for one thing: paycheck. They also treat their employees lower than dirt at times.
bad,"Working at Ross was not the most ideal situation. Very messy, rude employees, unorganized and they did not compensate well or give many hours. That's retail for you, though."
bad,"Management can't work together to maintain a decent store, not providing the correct hours for the associates (unfair paycheck bi-weekly), and bribes to choose favorites separating departments---no team effort."
bad,"Great place to work now that managment has changed , often previous maganment would pick and choose employes to be nice to and they were a bit rude to others and your hard work nwver pays odf they give 3 to 5 cent rasies even after 90 days . I left becauae pay was not enough and they didnt not want to raise me after a year and a half of working there they only gave me 5 cents and often got sent home early due to payroll"
bad,It pays minimum wage and the raises are less than 10 cents even for tenured employees.  Typical retail environment.  It's a job if you need one.  The customers are nice.
bad,"Come in from 6-2:30, downstacking and stacking up the pallets and totes. You will learn how to work their scanning tool and other hand tools. Hardest part is picking up 80lbs boxes."
bad,Consider hiring ppl !! %%% they should percent the higher management as well as the employees!! Strongly disagree with no opportunities in this company !!
bad,"if you need a job were you can have any experience, this company should be okay. i was only working part time here and as a sales associate, we just migrated and I just want to start working."
bad,A place to keep a flexible part time while studying. Schedule can be fluctuant and sometimes there are not enough hours for permanent employees to work a week.
bad,Ross is a good starter job for someone right out of high school. I learned a lot and the management team is extremely iffy. The workplace culture is diverse.
bad,"The managers allowed for anyone to call our of work at the last minute, leaving the current workers to do extra work and the store to be short staffed. The store manager and some cashiers have terrible customer service skills and many customers threaten to call corporate on those employees. There is no room for advancement in this job, no matter how hard you work or how long you have worked, Ross does not offer promotions or pay raise unless you already know someone in a higher position. Most of the managers would rather sit in the office all day instead of actually working on the floor when we are short staff or need to get things done. They would instead put more work on the other employees, but take very long or do not answer the employees when we call for their help. The assistant manager always messes up the work schedule by scheduling people for days that they are unavailable for, and cutting their hours if they do not want to work evenings. The employees in the fitting room are forgotten about and ignored most of the time when they need to take a break or leave for the day. The managers do not care if it is your time to leave, they will take their time with bringing someone else or, or even themselves up, to take the position so that the employee can leave. Some of the managers talk about the employees behind their backs to the managers' friends in their office. The only good thing about this job is that the hours are very flexible, but the pay is not high enough for everything that the employees are put through."
bad,The store I worked at was not very organized and the job assignments that were originally scheduled were not followed. The management was lax and certain employees pretty much called the shots.
bad,"management is lazy. appear to have ""favorites"". Hours are minimal and pay is low. "
bad,"the pay was good, however it was a very strange environment, managers were always coming and going, making it very unstable and confusing. the hours were really strange as well, overall it was an okay job, I would not go back though."
bad,I was hired as a temp so my first week of training went well but later on I saw how it became a favoritism type of environment. I did my job to the best of my ability. I don't like the register system of grading you on how well you scan items. It's like it doesn't matter if your a good worker. Only numbers matter. So you can be a bad associate but do well on the register and you stay. Sorry but as a customer I would like to come into a store where I'm treated with respect.
bad,"a lot of multitasking answering phone sending coworker to lunch and breaks as I am working the cashier in a fast pas, working all around the store well making sure all returns are going back to the store floor"
bad,"Meh, you can only make it so far unless you are a so-called favored son. They tend to get rid of the productive people, yet promote based on favoritism."
bad,"its an ok job but wasn't stable, seasonal hours varied from day to week.hired mostly latinos to work more and pay less for production work."
bad,The managers at the Ross I work at were not the nicest people. They always had one employee doing three different jobs at once. The hours that sometimes they made me work did not work around my schedule at all and they never did anything to change that.
bad,"Upper management * district managers and higher have no clue whats happening in stores from managers adjusting payroll to meet goals to sending people home on sick day to save $. Associates thrown into work environments ' with little or no training . .you will never see this company on * under cover boss "". As your associate number is how your identified. You ideas and work output go unnoticed. .have seen store go thru 3 managers and all fail in terms of expectations from corporate guidelines. "
bad,"Working at Ross as a Store Manager has taught me nothing I didn't already know and has not challenged me in any way. You are simply a monkey for the rude, dirty customers who think we owe them more than they want to pay for. The company does not compensate enough for the amount of strenuous work one does and does not recognize the hard work work the associates do. - Overall, a very disappointing experience."
bad,"Dont apply for this location ! the management is tough and unfair to their employeers. I volunteerly quit cause i couldn't stand their pressure and for the amount of pay, hours and work was not worth it. Employeers dont last long at this location ! The management needs to be more professional with their job! the only pro was our cowokers, our customers and discounts."
bad,"customers are encouraged to dump go backs on floor, so all I did as a manager was pick up after them, very strenuous and tiring. never any positive feedback from district management, no payroll. I ran a store with 5 people in it, and couldn't clock out for lunch because I was the only manager in the building."
bad,Unorganized and not good and team work or communicating in a professional manner.  More hours and pay increase should be applied.
bad,"At Ross for Less, it was really great when I got transferred to the stock room. We enjoyed being able to listening to music and crack jokes and laugh out loud. But work still needed to be done and there were times we needed to get serious. I learned was the details need to be checked, like merchandise going out to the floor, because if it is in the wrong place or not tagged properly then there will be a problem for management. My co-workers, for the most part were dependable. But the hardest thing on the job is correcting employees mistakes. Also it was hard to train some new employees because of the detail involved, but that is where I learned patience because someone had to show me the process too."
bad,"The management isn't the best,when working at Crystal lake Ross i had like 5 different managers during the whole 2 years that i was there."
bad,"This was probably the worst jobs I've had. The management was terrible. When I started I only had one day of training on the computer then was put out on the floor. During my interview I had mentioned I was leaving on vacation on December 17th, I was hired on November 30th of 2015. I only worked for two weeks they still ended up scheduling me on December 18th. I mentioned to them about my vacation that was planned and already paid for. While working there every employee that I met complained that the managers were terrible and were not together on things as a team. Only the assistant manager helped around with the store and the head manger stayed in the office her whole shift."
bad,"A typical day at work is busy , associates are friendly and welcoming. I learned to be more open and social. the management was okay. My co workers for the most part were very helpful and friendly. There wasn't really a hard part working at ross it was pretty easy going. the most enjoyable part of the job was socializing with customers and being around different personalities, and learning new things was very enjoyable."
bad,"This position is good for students as they can work around your schedule for you. Other than that, there are no benefits, there's no room for organizational growth."
bad,"No one there was hard working at all. No one followed the rules, and the management was terrible. It was so clustered and unorganized in every aspect."
bad,"Ross was an okay employer, they didnt care much for employees and were understaffed majority of the time. Wouldnt work there if looking to move up in employment."
bad,I worked in the dressing room most the time I was employed there. I was one of the people responsible for retagging clothes that came back there with no tag or the wrong tag and then organizing them on racks to be put back out on the floor.
bad,Co-workers seemed to always call out or just not show up. Had to cover for them constantly while in school. Let alone that but management never held these people accountable for their lack of attendance
bad,Good place to start out at to learn basic needed skills.  Customer service and cash management.  Not the most organized company.  Not great for furthering career.
bad,Only helped to get the store opened. Great experience to work with very dedicated people. Hardworking individuals who worked toward a particular goal with no problems.
bad,The work is really easy working overnight they rarely gave us hours the lead were too friendly making out with the employees
bad,"At the beginning i liked working there, but further into my experience i seen there wasnt any oppurtunity to move up inthe company. Also the managment was corrupted and wasnt there for their employees."
bad,"Poor upper management, favoritism, long hours.  HR is not supportive when having issues with upper management.  Upset DM, and its nothing but harassment and poor DM visits."
bad,"when you come to work it begin to be a good day, till your head set goes down and you have to wait hours to get back to work. Its an okay job but they want you do so much and when your production is down they want to write you up but its not our fault because when they move us around it mess with our production,"
bad,you do not need to know anything and i will not give a review to anyone. it is not necessary to know that to get a new job what i feel about a company is not relevant to getting a job.
bad,"Use to enjoy working at foothills store until new manager came in and then she started to get rid of employees she didn't care for, so she had company district manager of Tucson stores start to transfer other associates to other stores. Broke promises she made to me, i was a very loyal worker for company for six years and sent me to a store forty five minutes from my house. I lost all respect for district manager, the way she handled my situation."
bad,"Management team are uneducated,lack management skills. Work ethic sucks. They could care less about  sales floor employees or customers.   Store manager is always on vacation, stealing company's time by doing nothing, sitting in the office doing nothing to assist with the long line. Need to retrain  store management  members on employee relations and customer service. Will never recommend anyone to work in that store or area. Very dangerous and crime ridden."
bad,"Friendly coworkers. rude customers, terrible management. Terrible pay. Discounts are nice. Not rewards no employee parties."
bad,"Constant cleaning the area on the sales floor"
bad,"It was a fun job while it lasted. I learned how to use a cash register more properly and learn to take payments such as debit/credit cards, cash, and TANF benefit receipts. Learned how to do returns and exchanges. Co-workers were very friendly and helpful with learning new tasks. Managers were lazy and rude. Hardest part of the job is when it got busy and other employees or managers did not want to help, like i said no team work. Enjoyable part of the job was seeing the new items and clothes come out. And helping customers."
bad,I'm not the type to bash a company and I can't speak on other people behalf but I would never work for Ross again. Low pay and underemployed. Management was horrible and unorganized. We were always understaffed.
bad,"Customer service, cashiering, and merchandise handling, keeping to store organized and clean. Providing a friendly atmosphere for customers"
bad,"Very difficult customer environment, short staffed and only allowed 4 hour shifts..in short I will never work for this company again."
bad,long and unprofessional  really is not a good company.HR real rude and doesn't have any humanity for their staff really wouldn't recommend anyone to work
bad,some days would get slow and they would send you home halfway thru the day which suck some days.but other days it would be okay some supervisors are cool some are not
bad,"This was a long time ago.  I  started out on the sales floor doing recovery. But, never made it to the cash registers, Tough manager too."
bad,ross is a great place to work if you are in college and just need  some extra money. They work around your schedule and really promote team work.
bad,over all the management here sucks and so does the environment that you would work in and the managers treat you like a robot
bad,Overall it's the easiest job on the planet. Always a pleasure to work with associates. All were great people! The hardest thing about the job was being understaffed - daily customer complaints about it. Experiencing a very aggressive DM. He showed his true colors in front of the store on the sales floor. Hostile attitude. Very unprofessional.
bad,"Training can often lack especially as you advance. Makes it difficult to properly do your job.The more outgoing you are, the more you'll be noticed. Unfortunately, that can sometimes equate to those worthy of promotion being overlooked. Associates at all levels are often under appreciated especially by upper management visiting stores. Lots of changes taking place with the company....but not necessarily the right one."
bad,"Upper Management is not supportive of store level employees and managers. They have a ""got ya"" attitude and seem to always be looking for trouble with their employees even where there is none."
bad,management with unorganized and they hired more than enough people just to get the new store open and running then they gave out minimal to no hours at minimal wage. It was sad that I had to walk away from the job but they left me no choice and I believe it was just wrong how they deal with the situation as a whole
bad,"This particular Ross location has very poor management and a strong lack of leadership. A typical day at work was chaotic. Customers never seemed to be checked out in a timely fashion. The managers displayed strong favoritism to certain associates. The store manager is very arrogant and nonchalant as well as the assistant store manger. Many associates never receive their breaks or lunches in a timely manner. I even went shifts without taking a break or lunch, because they were so ""busy"" in the front. The discount really didn't make working at Ross worth the madness that this location put me through. As a part-time associate at this location, you are not even guaranteed 15 hours a week. You do so much, for no sincere thank you and for so little pay."
bad,coworkers talk behind your back a lot. management wouldn't do anything about it. but very easy work. come in do your job thats all you have to do and youll be fine.
bad,"The jobs here are very stressful and demanding, I've learned alot about customer service and retail. All short shifts most is 6 hrs a day. The management team is lousy and doesn't help or treat or care for their employees as they should. The way they pay employees is a joke and unfair. The schedules are ridiculous and get like 10-15 hrs a week.  My co-workers are great people but most are lazy and most don't deserve to even keep their jobs."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of tending to customers, receiving and displaying merchandise, and selling merchandise to said customers. My time at Ross taught me how necessary it is to seek higher education at any cost. My co-workers were mostly students. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent scheduling and the low pay. The best part of the job was the in store discount."
bad,"very hectic and always busy, great co workers and management was also very good. everyone got along well"
bad,They make it very hard for you to advance in this company most times when there is a higher position up for grabs they hirer from outside of the store first.
bad,"very hot and dirty place to work at"
bad,Worked here in college but not the best thing for a career minded individual.
bad,I have been working with Ross for about a year now and I have enjoyed it; I help customers out with what they need and enjoy my co-workers. Management has always changed so I feel neutral about them. Hours are always fluctuating so work is never steady. I understand that the hours our store can provide us is due to sales but there is definitely favoritism among management.
bad,"A typical day at work for me was working on the cash register and doing go-backs. I also had the chance of working in the fitting room and in the fine jewelry area. I learned that customer service was the most important thing working at Ross. It is always essential that you greet customers with a ""hello"" and a smile. I liked the assistant manager and MOD but really didn't care for the General Manager. He fired me for cash shortages on either days that I didn't even work or for a till I never worked on lol. My co-workers were okay I guess. I can really say I liked and only talked to about two of them. The hardest part was cleaning my area once it was almost time to clock out because of the needles from the hard tags. I would get poked trying to retrieve them from time to time lol. All in all, I really enjoyed interacting with customers and to my surprise, people are really nice nowadays :)"
bad,i would pretty much do waterer they told me to do i had no set and stone position. majority i was the cashier.
bad,"Good place to see if you are cut out for retail. Busy days, difficult clientele"
bad,"After walking through security and 1/2 mile to get to your department, the job consists of packaging thousands of boxes with the well-known tool called ""the gladiator"" This arm strapped device is to aid you to load the products in the right boxes, thus leading certain boxes to the right store location. They hire excellent people for management & co-workers. The hardest part is the walking around part. I thought it was fun."
bad,"Retail, customers don't change"
bad,"•	Greeting and directing customer, as well as staff members; responding to complaints, service issues, and other general questions and/or concerns as appropriate"
bad,"Its an okay job if its your first job...but not recommended for a career or even if you need a good paying job, not a place to go. The most enjoying p;art of the job was meeting and helping people all day and the discounts."
bad,"The store I am at does not give me enough hours. It is very hard to advance here. I do not have any benefits, which I truly need and more hours."
bad,"My typical day at work consisted of standing behind a T-Rack in the dressing room area."
bad,"•	Diplomatic and patient with all types of individuals. "
bad,Is a the beginning of the day. Everyone comes in with nice big smiles. I go around helping the associates with there daily projects.
bad,Ross would be the ideal work place for me if they offered more hours
bad,a very good place to work always busy never have enough people.never leave on time they dont pay  enough money people are always angry.
bad,"I got hired for the holiday's and it seemed to be really busy and kind of confusing how things were ran, but I did meet great people."
bad,this was a great place to work if you were in college or high school. they care about employees but to much work for little pay
bad,"I worked at Ross department stores seasonally during breaks from college. Duties and responsibilities were, cashier, stock and inventory, and dressing room attendant. This was a great place to learn customer service and patience, but there was limited professional growth and advancement within this company."
bad,My typical day of work at this employer was the same routine every single day. I had to check merchandise in the computer and send out the the right amount of merchandise to the rite store. One of the other skills that i learned while working here was to manage and work with the employees. I had to supervise the employees at times and verify they were doing there work correctly while working next to the manager him self. As well as i got receptionist skills and many other skills in computation; for example microsoft word and excel aswell as powerpoint . The best part of my day was having to manage a high amount of people in a high amount of paste environment .
bad,I worked there for little over a year. They barely gave 15 hours a week. I loved my managers but they didn't do much work they passed all the work on us. Its a good job for right out of high school or still in high school. Not for someone with family. 
bad,Cashier associate and stock handler. Ring up customers and pull merchandise from the back of the stores stock room.
bad,"I take care of the customer's needs like checking them out to voids, refunds, and exchanges. I also due the cash office where I must find where the money is over or short "
bad,"A typical day at work starts of by getting to the store clocking in immediately going to your fist assignment which usually is recovering a certain area in the store, as soon as the truck arrives you are expected to be there and expected to run , i mean literary run from first box that gets there to the last. First thing is first , you have to clock in at 6:30 in the morning ( not the same in all stores) and are pushed to the limit , to get all merchandise out on the floor on a time limit of usually four hours. If you do not comply with this you will be running what you dint get to the next day while having to process the next day's truck. they give you 10-15 minutes to run bins full and rack's full of merchandise and clothes in my store we process over 100 boxes everyday , approximately 10 of those boxes are clothes , there's about 75 pieces of clothes in each box that need to be hung and hard tagged. They pressure and expect you to be on point if not, you are useless and they treat you as such and the cherry on top they talk about you too, no matter hard you may be working. All this for a merely 20 hours a week with a minimum wage pay . I expected much more out of this company being worth billions of dollars they treat employees almost as paid slaves, they stress managers in the stores about payroll, every extra second you make they are on top of you because of that , they cut corners and are usually very disorganized. Managers are as fake as barbie dolls, always stressing about new ways to make money for the company, instead of the satisfaction of the worker. "
bad,Management is horrible. Also the pay is not so great either. co-worker are nice. Most enjoyable is the flexibility. Otherwise the customers are absolutely rude.They cross the lines. Either way we have to deal with it. The hardest part of the job is the low hours and training. No training for everyone. The only training given is at the beginning  for 20 minutes but after that they assume you should know all. 
bad,"Easy money, but no respect received. Co-workers are diverse, to say the least. Just say hello and goodbye to customers, and kiss upper management a $ $..."
bad,Stayed busy stocking and sorting loved helping out customers 
bad,"A chaotic workplace. Management did not work as a team. My trainer for Loss Prevention trained me the proper techniques for managing store security and safety, however when I started working there all my training went out the window.  "
bad,"They are vindictive, very rude, horrible hours, don't care about you at all because they can ALWAYS find a replacement for you."
bad,"there main focus are inventory not enough of customer service, treat employees bad and always change schedule at the last minute"
bad,"I loved working in the Jewelry Dept. in Waikiki. I wasn't really happy about the attitude of most of the Managers there. I personally have never walked out of a job in my life, even though I had thought about it. This place was the exception. I had opened the store in 2011 and Jan. 1st 2013, I walked out. I just told myself I wasn't going to start this year bad. I didn't!"
bad,Some co-workers were great. Fun to window shop while you worked. Ability to learn different aspects of job if you wished to.
bad,Back-breaking work with no great compensation plans. No benefits and high lay-off workplace.
bad,"An OK place to work. Management is ok. Associates work well together. The most enjoyable part about the job is working with the associates and meeting new people, also learning and developing in the company. The hardest part about the job is dealing with certian situations."
bad,Being a buyer anywhere is rough so this is not out of the ordinary. You do have the ablity to have more control over your business but they expect alot of of you with little time so you are forced to repeatedly take work home. They try to make the claim that there is a good work/life balance but that simply isn't the case.
bad,I found that the people I worked for were just on another look out for a gofer someone to run around the store preforming jobs that were at the time meant for management to preform or more than one person at a time. I did not mind the hard work or the hours it just I got into a situation in which I was taken completely advantage of and was treat with little next to no respect.
bad,Not enough merchandise to give the store a full look to customers. Not enough employees to keep the store clean and neat. Expectations re too high for the small staff on hand. The company doesnt pay new employees nearly enough money compared to the workload of the employees. I did enjoy the yearly trip to meeting all over the US for a couple of days.
bad,Ross doesn't pay enough to meet my salary needs. The Management staff is thoroughly competent. The hardest task of the job is the never ending line of returns which has to be reprocessed and restocked. I learned that I do not want to be a part of discount retail and have set my focus on another career path and want to proceed with getting started as soon as possible learning everything possible to be successful there.
bad,The store was growing and difficult to evaluate due to what I consider a lack of training/guidance. Ultimately I believe the store will mature and fill a much needed low cost market.
bad,Management was completely irrational on how productivity should be.
bad,Poor quality control and poor management direction. Job duties extend beyond position.
bad,I was always the worker to do everything.
bad,It's a place that you can do the normal things that are required in a retail environment. They do watch the employees more than the customers for suspicious activity and theft though.
bad,The pay and hours suck they treat you with no respect and when you try to advance to a higher position instead of give u the position because you earned it they give it to a transfer from a another store so there is really no winning in ross to be Honest
bad,"As an ASM, you can choose to do one of two things. Constantly work or constantly watch others work. The life of an ASM at Ross can be very fulfilling if you like to work as hard as all of your associates. The life of an ASM is a painstakingly long day if you have a lazy store manager, or an uncaring district manager, and it is made even worse when you cannot pay people what they are worth. Operationally, you can be sound and just. Ethically, you can treat people with respect and be loved by your staff and your customers. It's all great until your store manager's true nature shows (bonuses bonuses bonuses) and you watch the turnover rate be acceptable at 75%. For the lower associates, part timers and full timers alike, growth potential is nil. Raises are little. New stores open in new markets and pay those brand new people exceptionally better than tenured associates. It's sad. I loved every day of my job until I did the wrong thing and actually cared. I do not recommend jumping aboard Ross unless you know the reality of the job ahead of time. I chose to say, this is not the retailer I want to work for anymore. I see good Ross stores become empty as the company sends all the product to newer stores. Every day you have to defend your store to shoppers and insist you are not a flea market or going out of business."
bad,It all depends on the store and the location. Overall its ok. Its really a job for a high school student.
bad,"Customer Service, dealing with customers, processing returns, making sure the tags match the item, hard tagging the item, then placing the item where it belongs. As a front end supervisor, I'm in charge of the front end of the store, making sure everyone is doing what they are supposed to be doing, and making sure everyone's break and lunch's are on time, basically watching over my associates. Another part of my job is training the new associates that come into the store."
bad,"During my time at Ross in Whittier, I was not given the proper training to handle most of what was required of me and was therefore verbally punished for it. They changed their working policy quite often and made it difficult to follow them due to the many exceptions that just happened to arise."
bad,horrible pay treats you like a peasent and managment is slacked and unfair on people they don't like.
bad,"I worked for this company for over two years. The people are nice, but many do not like to do much work."
bad,made sure the customers did have the right number of garments and answering the phones. What I have learned is how to deal with people. The management was interesting and the co-workers were young and were fine to work with. The hardest about the job is dealing with public when we were very busy;it was hard to keep up with.I like going home from this job.
bad,Burger King is a pretty cool place to work and they have pretty good food.
bad,The store is though to keep cleean but everyday is a treasure hunt.
bad,"Work at Ross, Main issue for Managers is the Management teams in Hawaii stores seem to run on a very negative tone, change is not welcome nor are new Managers."
bad,i enoyed working with the people. i enjoyed the work i did but overall the pay rate is below anywhere else.
bad,ross clothing store was a department store a very very busy store
bad,I did not like working here. I moved back to Louisiana the first chance I got.
bad,"Typical of most retail where you are told you will be trained and it never happens. You are just thrown into the mix.  Although most of the people I worked with were friendly, there were some that seemed to thrive on drama and causing trouble. Management was aware of the problem, but took no active role in resolving. The Manager at my location rarely left the office.  I used to be in retail management.  After a few weeks of a new hire working, I always met with them to see how things were working out. NEVER ONCE did this ""manager"" ask if I needed any clarification of my duties or additional training. I worked for Ross approximately 5 months. This job would be good for someone who just needs a little extra money in the month. But, very few career opportunities.  All in all, I was not impressed."
bad,Worked in the warehouse. Not good. like a prison. Bunch of felons. Mangers and employees getting threatened. Did enjoy the 5/10s though. Loading trucks (2 at a time). didn't mind work it was the environment. Half the employees don't work. They hide or even leave and come back but management ignores this. They are scared.
bad,"There is absolutely no diversity up top. all of the people of color seem to be stuck within the same two roles. no appreciation for temp workers. unfair holiday hours, weak pay raises and lack of innovation for new processes to increase teamwork efficiency."
bad,There are few hours for part time employees and it's good for fast people but not for people who are detail oriented. Training is negligible but you are expected to know anyhow.
bad,"Management are always grumpy  hardly smile , for beeing managers they need to smile and greet all of us customers,i ask a question and she dint responded"
bad,"Ross is a great place to work if you have nothing else to do. They will run you into the ground with as little staff as they can manage, they do not care about your health or safety. Management will form personal vendettas against you and cut down your hours to nothing, all while expecting you to work your hardest despite no staff or payroll being on hand. Their management quickly quits once they realize their plate will be more than humanly full so there is usually only one manager. The building is always hot, humid, and unorganized."
bad,The job itself at Ross isn’t the problem at Greer the problem is the people with the authority and can do just abt wat they want with it your word against theirs even Human Resources they only good for theft far as a real situation they ignore it as if your the problem! Easy job this job had picks and u don’t grow off work ethic they always promote someone off the streets or someone who didn’t have to work they way up
bad,"this job is very slow since the store is so small and there are a lot of cliques. In my opinion of working here, these cliques are tight knit and hard to socialize into, so you always feel like an outsider. Management are in these cliques and plays favorites. "
bad,Lazy management. Slow business. I'm shocked the Florence AL location is still open. The work is boring and mundane. Little chance for advancement. I would not go back.
bad,It was a good couple of weeks. Management started cutting hours without advising which turned me away from them. I was unaware I was part time and seasonal up until the hours were taken.
bad,"You have to be face paced with cashiering. There’s always  something to do whether recovering the store or helping management with store projects."
bad,Its. Okay the management isn't the best the staff isn't the best I get along with people but its hard to communicate with people who don't know how to communicate.
bad,Only if it's the last result would I go back or recommended to an individual to work here. It's a pool of bitter women and low expectations. The clothes and shoes are the best to offer at any Ross however.
bad,"slow day poor management lack of training for people just throw's to floor, takes days to get anyone to help train, Hard to talk to management they have there focus and that is it."
bad,"For such a large company, they have too many managers that are horrible at managing people.  Having conflict resolution as one of the requirements is a dead give away that there are issues in each department."
bad,"If you want part time, this is great. But trying to make a career out of it is not wise.  I was promised every 3rd weekend off, 2 closes a week, and health care starting the 1st of the month. "
bad,"Worked for as Asset Protection (SPS) and withing just a few months realized the policies they have are doing anything but helping prevent theft/loss... The SPS are not allowed to do anything barely except stand at the front of the store and greet customers, they say to watch for theft and indicators but nothing is done to really stop it, and once the loss reports come back from each month and the numbers show we lost more than previously, we get lectured and watched more tightly, but how can loss be improved when nothing is ACTUALLY being done about it?"
bad,"The management team is more concerned with hiding in the back office than making sure the store runs efficiently.  This is more for this store than the overall company, however.  The benefits for full-time employees include paid vacation and sick . time."
bad,the woman I work with are very shady and would never work at that location ever again I was a happy sprit when I started and like my job but they was not happy with me being I felt a lot of negative energy
bad,The majority of the people that shop here are careless and rude and made my job miserable. People are cheap and walk all over you. No money is worth the way this job made me feel on a daily basis
bad,The time I worked there they asked for too much work to be done in such little time. Also the job wouldn't have been as bad if we were getting paid at least $14 or $15 back when I was there.
bad,"I worked as a full time associate for 9 months with the promise that I would be management. No moves were made to actually move me forward, how ever the potential for moving me into the managment position I was promised, had been lorded over me as a motivational tactic. "
bad,Possibly moving to a different opportunity and helping more customers understand new things about the future of the company. How it can be an BETTER place to go and shop or work
bad,"fine for a retail job, wouldn't work there if I didn't absolutely have to. The schedule was flexible while I was in school though. They take themselves too seriously"
bad,"Easy job! Just standing and greeting and occasionally monitoring cctvs, but bs management. The store manager was useless and looked for ***self(not saying gender). Good for college students, for extra $. Definitely not a career. Although their were guys 26-27 living paycheck to paycheck. Shoplifting was occasional due to the demographic and the area. We couldn’t do anything. Many shoplifters were aggressive, but due to our hands being tied. There wasn’t anything we can’t do and associates and customers looked at you as if you were an idiot for letting people steal. Associates called off often and somehow you had to cover them when you don’t work those days or hours. Budgeting was terrible, always cutting associates hours due to their negligence of checking for sufficient funds."
bad,"A way to get a little extra money but not if you have a family, discount was good. But not enough hours for me to work, would of liked full time only I would do it again."
bad,"My typical day at work would be me getting there about 15 minutes before my shift began. I was the front end supervisor so I watched over the whole front area, which included the employees scheduling, managed the cashiers and customers. I was on register constantly unless told by a manager on duty to do something else. I learned that I had to take time to do things, but also do them at a fast pace. The managers on duty, not including the store manager or manager assistant, were lovely. The store manager and assistant manager kept changing. The last manager I was working under was not a good one. They favored a couple of people and was not treating anyone else with respect. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers the way the current manager wanted, which was against the book and the district managers ideals. The most enjoyable part of the job was the workplace culture and how the other employees treated each other during the long night shifts."
bad,"nice pay , stressful work environment , poor management , rude customers , fast pace , timely , unorganized , works with any schedule ( school, daycare , second job )"
bad,"In the weekends, it's very busy with several customers in the store. In the weekdays, it's a little less busy. You learn on the go and don't get properly trained. You do have some flexibility as far as your work schedule and management tries to work around your schedule. There is one main manager and then, there are several assistant managers/supervisors. It's weird but they rotate throughout the day. The only ones working full time is management, everyone else is part-time. This is a perfect job if you plan on working here temporarily while you are going to school or working at another part-time job, but it is not an ideal place to work if you want to work full-time in something that is not in retail and/or retail management."
bad,The manager is a great guy but the assistant manager has a little bit of a attitude. I feel like she’s not use to working retail so she doesn’t have the right answer for the question people ask .
bad,"Good job if you are in school because they are flexible with schedule, but not a good job if you need to make money. They barely give hours to anyone even though the store is busy, which makes it more difficult for the employees working that day, especially if they are closing."
bad,It was a learning experience for me. I dealt with different kinds of customers and relations with the staff. Most of the staff was generous. Ross dress for less really was a challenge for me .
bad,"I was an ASM at one of the highest grossing stores within the company. Pay was low and OT was required as stated in the contract. Job was stressful but the employees made my job enjoyable. ASMs get unlimited sick time and paid vacation was acquired fairly quickly. I left the company because when I asked for a raise, they denied it. Advancement opportunities within the company is good, the starting pay for any management position (Area Supervisors AS or ASMs) is really low. Ross needs to re-evaluate this to retain managers. We literally had 7 managers quit within a year. Think twice if offered the position."
bad,"Very little hours a week, No benefits offered for part-time workers, and over work the little staff they can schedule and show a little appreciation. Very stressful."
bad,"While working here I worked the nightshift, which always ended at 2am. It was really rough balancing working 6pm-2am and trying to spend time with my husband that works 6am-4pm. I was also in a leadership position while at starting pay. I was only part time getting scheduled almost full time hours. Managers weren't professional and slandered my name on multiple occasions. The only pro I have was the pay; $14/hr in Waikiki, Hawaii."
bad,"I left this place because I only got 9 hours out of the week....AT MOST."
bad,Lack of hours... poor management  the company itself isn't bad but the idiots they hire for management  are jokes..seriously you can't call in more than twice in a year or you'll get written up
bad,"Good deals.  It was nice when we got the 20% off for employees. Long hours during the holidays, but what do you expect from retail. the hard works pays off in the end."
bad,Started out well but in the last year the culture has changed dramatically and things have gotten really cutthroat. There are constant threats to your job.
bad,It’s a stressful stepping stone for first time employees. Main manager is amazing but other employees are moody and pick favorites. Not a good place if you have any mental issues.
bad,Everyday at Ross was another day. It was stressful due to the lack of employees working at shift. The stress on how time was wasted due to lack of laziness.
bad,"They will fire you for any reason whenever they are ready,  You may have done an action 100 times but when they are ready to fire you that action will suddenly become a fireable offense. "
bad,horrible dock management skills in the had receiving department pertaining to the delagations of work loads in had receiving! it seems like the managers were unable to properly rotate who had heavy doors in order to lessen the chance of injury among workers unloading trucks
bad,"Was okay when I was full time. If your part time you get nothing really in the way of benefits, and pay/hours are low. Management was okay till management changed, then it went down hill. Very inconsistent job and even get blamed for things when you were not there working."
bad,Overall experience is pretty good but not enough hours with to many people being hired at a time. Otherwise i felt the experience is pretty good for the type of position
bad,Good for people with low self value and no ambition. If you want to get into a position just to get a paycheck its great. Otherwise there's no reason.
bad,"Management is not great, very unorganized and no communication whats so ever. Store Manager is sometimes rude and unreasonable. Store is always a mess. During the week it can get pretty busy during lunch time and after 3pm and on weekends its gets even crazier. During the busy times the store manager expects you to be a super human and be in 5 places at once which is not possible and will get mad and not offer any help. Schedules are not flexible and very inconsistent."
bad,"Great experience to gain, but low salary and co-workers were rude. Overall great job fast pace and finishing on time. Cleaned the fitting rooms, got to know and understand the store more."
bad,"A typical day at work included either being at the front of the store working the register and providing customer service, or working the sales floor with merchandise."
bad,The store was unorganized and management had a higher turnover rate than employees. This store allowed customers to completely destroy the sales floor on a daily basis without repercussion.
bad,customers treat you like trash and management never defend you. the most high theft place i have ever work for. For what you are being paid and the labor that they ask for is ridiculous.
bad,"I worked here as a second job for a short time until I realized it just was not for me.  For starters, you start off at minimum wage.  Be prepared to work in a very dysfunctional understaffed environment.  Training is virtually non existent here. ALWAYS understaffed.  A lot of equipment doesnt work properly such as tag removers, which ends up causing back-ups and lines, be prepared to deal with a lot of tough customers.  The clientele this store brings in isn't the best.  That being said, there are a lot of nice customers too.  You will never have time to breathe working here, if you don't have customers, you are required to re-tag returned merchandise, hang up hangers, or have some sort of task you must complete before the end of your shift.  Your minimum wage pay certainly doesn't reflect what you deserve to be paid.  The store I worked at was open until 11PM at night, while all stores surrounding it closed hours a go.  It certainly made you feel unsafe late at night.  Co workers are nice to vent your frustrations with, and the manager wasn't a bad person.  I found some ""shift"" managers tried to throw their weight around at you, and tried to show they were in charge by being petty at times, which I basically just brushed off my shoulder.  Not a place I would enjoy moving up in anyway."
bad,Always work to be done and enjoyed working with the team. Managers could have been more professional and customer issues could have been dealt with better.
bad,"Ross was good as a first job but I dont Recommend to apply to a seasoned retail worker. Not organized, management played favorites and the hours and pay are minimal."
bad,"As a first job for students, working at Ross isn't really a bad choice. The starting pay is above average for jobs of this type. Generally better than fast food. The company has almost no room whatsoever for advancement in any reasonable amount of time, and the work you do won't make you feel satisfied at the end of the day. If you need money to afford to live, it's worth it, just don't expect to go home feeling like you were challenged or made a difference."
bad,"Many hours on your feet in fast paced work setting, only there for job, constant possibility of write up. The hours are odd for a department store in the sense that they run late into the night. Despite having decent management the store is hard to maintain due to the volume of customers on a daily basis."
bad,"I provided customer service. Processed computerized sales transactions in cash, credit, and debit. I organized inventory and returned go-back merchandise to proper department."
bad,My days were stressful. Managers act high and mighty. Supervisors don't do much besides talk.  They give you a section of the store to clean up but most of the time you don't finish because the call you to the register a lot. Coworkers are mean and snobby. The hold grudges. It was fun at first but after a while the job weighs on you and becomes stressfull.
bad,"It is a very unhealthy work culture you find here. The managers, including the store manager, are always interfering in employee's personal lives and I am almost certain that they never perform background checks."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is standing too long! Not only that, resulting with weak backs and tired feet. Corporate management needs improving and be respectful!"
bad,No hours and poor management.................................. it was great for gas money... the store always looked a mess because no one ever had the time to finish there job because you worked for 3 hours a day !
bad,"In a typical work day the manager on duty could have you work all over the store wherever you are needed. It was difficult adapting to a new store when I was transferred from Ross in Lakewood, WA to Phoenix, AZ. I learned how to work a register/cashier. Talking to customers while on register was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"Never go back, poor management, poor employees, favoritism everywhere. Was sick of it so I transferred and then left. Wasn't worth the stress to me..."
bad,"Working at Ross I enjoyed working with most employees. However, I came across and few people who upon the first impression weren't so friendly. I worked in the stock room, where is was dusty, freezing in the winter and hot in the summer. It was full of material that either needed to be placed on the floor or in the dumpster because it was broke. We seemed to always be understaffed with crew members, communication wasn't very effective. I gave 4 stars for job work/life balance because I didn't work too many days, so it was easy to balance."
bad,"The jobs were very trivial and sometimes demeaning. The employees were treated and compensated poorly. Management always stood behind the ""our hands are tied"" policy."
bad,"A typical day at Ross is first unloading the truck, then you have to unpack the boxes. Hang clothes meaning put size nubs and hard tags on majority of the merchandise. when that's all done you have to run your racks meaning put everything on the sales floor. The stockroom has to be cleared before the end of the day. The stockroom shifts are usually 5 hour longs. You also have a set number of boxes you have to complete. Mined you you are standing on your feet the whole time, it could be very hot in the stockroom or very cold. It was like working at a factory. The final thing you are timed on EVERY task you do at Ross."
bad,"a place to shop and find a verity of things for a comfortable price."
bad,"the best part of my job is my co-workers.  They keep me going everyday, but the policies and processes are hard to handle.  Ross is a hard store to manage."
bad,"The associates and supervisors here are great. They always provide a great work environment. But the store manager at this location does not know how to be a manager. Lack of training, lack of knowledge,lack of care and respect for associates, very unprofessional, irresponsible, and immature. You are either a friend or enemy. The store manager cries a lot about work which I see kinda odd since they should be the one keeping everything together. And I definitely would not recommend management here at this store because I've seen a lot of them come and go as a result of the store manager. I would say the location is a good temporary or secondary job. I do not recommend this location if you are looking for a long term company to learn and grow with. This store manager will not get you there. This location could be great if they had a new leader. Unfortunately the store manager brings down the team."
bad,I honestly did not like working there. One thing was that the managers were awefully cruel. I remember I injured my wrist and got workers Comp and the next day I felt I was being interrogated by them because supposedly I was lying. But that was a long time ago in Orlando.
bad,"Great work experience, great coworkers"
bad,"Working at Ross is an experience like no other. The management is supportive of the associates, and ensure that everything runs smoothly. The work-environment is friendly and helpful."
bad,not enough hours made u be there early before stored opened and they wasn't even there. then made you stay late and wasn't even getting paid that much only 9 dollars an hour
bad,I worked at multiple stores and each had their Pros and Cons. The opportunity for advancement is present but it is very hard work. The benefits from discounts are amazing.
bad,Learned a lot about customer service. The hardest part of the job was having to stand for long periods of time. Management was friendly but didn't know what they were doing.
bad,"Overworking associates. This is not such a positive place to work. Tell some coworkers to SMILE... or stop publically griping about their lives. ** store managers and more. Dirty. Tons of theft. They have sales associates stepping onto both restrooms hourly. Not their job! Custies wanting cash or further discounts. Creepiest crank callers. Skipped breaks, ignored cashiers & fit room attendants. Worse... Low pay in light of stress and strain etc. output. Almost zero advancement. Tons of flake, no shows, and resultant backup. Mgmt repeatedly took back such half in workers, who would drop out again and again. And expect your hours to dramatically drop, some stores, after holiday seasons."
bad,"There is a lot of talent there across the board but in my opinion there is a lot of the good 'ol boys club as well.  If you don't belong, you will not advance or in time you will be ousted."
bad,This was more of a change control role and supporting another project manager in another state who knew nothing about project management.  demanding and ambiguous environment - stay away!
bad,"they didn't give me much training, probably because i was a temp, but still. if they trained me better, then i probably wouldn't have been making mistakes left and right. you should be a people person for this job, because you will be around them all the time."
bad,"This job is very strict in everything they have going on. I would recommend working this job temporarily to avoid unemployment. They will hire lots of people train them and if they like a few they will keep them to be cashiers, money counters, sales associates or store protection specialists. If they don't like you or your work ethic sucks  they will lay you off fast."
bad,"worked odd hours due to school schedule, that was the one plus of working there. the management was not good at all however there were a select few co workers that made the time there mostly enjoyable."
bad,"It was a very busy and high paced environment."
bad,"Workload can be a lot especially if you are  AS. DM belittles associates, throws you to the wolves with no training. Turnover is terrible, hours long."
bad,I enjoy my job here at Ross. The only thing is wish is I wish they had more hours to give out. I only get 2 days a week 3 at the most and that is very frustrated because I love working here.
bad,I worked during the holidays and it was the worst management ever. Very unethical and unorganized. I didn't like that management would just boss around co workers and the leaders would just stay there and talk to other persons.
bad,"I worked with some great Store Managers but we all had the same issues with upper management, so many of them have left the company. Long hours 60+ a week no home life and always on call. Never felt like upper management would go to bat for you no matter how much you did to make them look good."
bad,"You are over worked and under paid. Raise's a pittance at best. Although training is better than most discount stores from what i have heard. Management is okay i guess at least in the knowledge department in the social skills and being understanding or having empathy, however, was deplorable. The job overall was not very enjoyable best part was when i quit. Was grateful for having a job though. By far the hardest part of the job was getting the customers to follow the store policies. Due to how mean and nasty they were, making it a rarity to find a pleasant customer."
bad,"Worked my way up from the stockroom associate to area supervisor, worked 40 hours a week even did overtime, and attending college. I was very versatile, I worked the cash office, operated the registers, managed the fitting room, I did mark downs. I worked for that company for 3 years and they treated me like a robot. Wasn't even getting paid what I deserved. A couple of times I worked a 12 hour shift. I was very under appreciated."
bad,"The overall work environment is a busy and has a fast going pace. Employees NEVER get off at the time they're supposed to. Their management is completely disorganized and information is not conveyed properly.  Also, the way they schedule their employees is not correct. When one person is scheduled to work from 9-5 in the fitting room, the next person taking over the shift should be scheduled at exactly 5 if not 15 minutes earlier but, instead they're scheduled 30 minutes after the 9-5 person is supposed to leave. This causes the 9-5 person to stay an extra 30 minutes because no one is there to cover the shift."
bad,"Working on the stock team at Ross is very hectic and demanding. No matter how hard you work, the managers always seem to spend more time on criticizing the workers than giving credit when it's due. There is not much opportunity for advancement or cross-training unless you speak up about it. Ross is a great store overall. It just depends on which location you work at because every store is different, especially with this being a retail store."
bad,Stand for hours. nobody would help with the fitting room. always under staffed on busy days. they didn't give me my lunch break when it states when working over 5 hours I get a lunch..
bad,"I'm not saying Ross as a whole is a total wreck, but the one where I was employed was ruined by management. Messy customers Bathrooms are always nasty, co workers would eat and steal your food. Money would be taken from purses. GOSSIP RULED !!!!!!"
bad,Decent staff in store but constantly hiring due to low wages and cutting hours. Almost all staff is PT and hard to get consistency. Too many checklists that go nowhere.
bad,"nice people to work with, learned a lot about management and training associate. too much mess to pick up at the end of the night but its retail so it was always expected"
bad,"Great work place to gain cashier experience. Team members very helpful and friendly. Enjoyed working with a diverse community and learning new things. Primary job duties were cashier, attending the customers needs and doing go backs."
bad,"Co workers were amazing, but there were questionable work ethics. I was promised a $1.50 raise with my promotion.  After arguing with management for close to 5 months I ended up only getting $.50 raise.  I was told I could not receive the full raise because I was not full time.  I was actually paid less than the incoming employees."
bad,"There was usually 1 cashier for a really long line. I got experience since it was my first job. They where not flexible with my schedule, scheduled me very few hours during the week, but where always calling me at night or on the weekends to fill in for others knowing that I needed the hours. Management only cared about getting the job done so they would get a pat on the back by district manager ""crazy lady"" always mad about something never satisfied."
bad,"Awesome place to work with a crew of exceptional associates.  Fun, fast pace, and educational place to work. You are encouraged to learn and grow at your own pace, however, opportunities for advancement are strictly limited."
bad,"Most new employees get very little training within their new department; most of the responsibilities for any position in this company you have to learn by yourself. Upper management is almost useless when it comes to any issues you might have; in fact, you're probably better off not talking to anyone (including the ""anonymous"" AlertLine) because retaliation is apparently a company standard. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the obnoxious and rude customers who think it is part of your job to pick up every piece of clothing that they didn't consider to be worthy of their wardrobe. The most enjoyable part is bonding with other employees."
bad,after opening a typical day for me was just keeping the men department clean. my manager was really nice when he wanted to be. co workers were cool. hardest part was trying to ring up customers and watch the men department at all times. the most enjoyable part was friends and family day
bad,"First job, worked there while i went to school, managers were basically regular employees needed to fill the spots who had no experience and were horrible in those positions, only the store manager is actually qualified and knows what he/she is doing."
bad,"Ross was an amazing place to work and has taught me all my management skills to obtain a store manager position with them."
bad,"Its a place where you can grow and learn from and move on to another position, I out grew the company and had to move on to another position with growth opportunites"
bad,"We can't go home until the store is 100% recovered. Sometimes we don't leave until after midnight-1am.Good hard working associates. Job security goes out the window, never sure if and when you'll be fired."
bad,It is a very fast paced environment. I enjoy working with the customers and making sure they leave my store happy and satisfied. Most of my co works understand the meaning of team work and we are able to get the job done in a timely manner. My typical day at work is supervising my team and handling the high security packages and solve any problems that my associates have and/or the customers.
bad,"typical day at work, is just being stuck in one place doing one job. "
bad,A typical day consist of running around and fixing the shelves. Not many hours very rare to work full time. Organizing merchandise was very unorganized. Workers would trow merchandise around in the back and the manager would not say a word.
bad,"I'm on SSDI & needed extra employment fast. This was easy to get."
bad,"During the time I have worked at Ross, I have learned great customer service skills, how to maintain a clean environment, as well as how to work fast and efficiently. "
bad,"Fun starting job or if you dont have better options. Pays minimum wage, hires on part-time, need to get promoted to receive more than 25 hours, however with only a 50 cent raise, and a review with raise after additional 6 months. However, there is high turnover of associates and management, making it difficult to work long term if you can't adapt. Also, overwhelmingly busy and stressful around busiest shopping days of year, with very messy customers, and very rude and impatient. Also lots of shoplifters"
bad,"Just wasnt my cup of tea. Managment was horrible, we never knew what our schedule were, they would not work with my schedule, they told me i would work 25-30 hours but I only worked 10-15 I got items from the store thrown at me by customers."
bad,Co-workers can be friendly with you but so far how management at this particular Ross needs improvement. The particular people chosen as store managers and some of the area supervisors do not fit the category to their duties and responsibilities. Favoritism over rules this company in general. Compensation is bad for all the work they expect from their associates.Great discounts but horrible management.
bad,"A typical day at Ross Dress for Less i would have to say interesting being that its was always a pleasure meeting new people and interactive with guest that you never met, also making them smile on their bad days and assisting them when they needed help. which I enjoy helping people."
bad,"Environment is extremely busy and you must really think quickly as lines of customers (oftentimes angry for long line and wait) sometimes demand discounts and manager availability is difficult. High Stress Environment.  For retail store, just be prepared for this because it's difficult when training is limited."
bad,Ross is a company that you can slightly advance with but the pay wasn't so great..
bad,"different culture. I Understand that each company wants you to succeed, they make it difficult to communicate with."
bad,safety is the goal saleassociate area supvicer have a job and make decison
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job was the people and the discounts. The hardest part of the job was the management and company.
bad,"A typical work day consists of customers demanding discounts on already discounted items, ignoring you when you greet them, and wondering why there are no associates available to help them after their behaviors drive the associates to quit."
bad,ok company lot work for pay high turn over due to hire part timer
bad,"Hardest Part of the Job is Being Able to Leave when Scheduled. The Scheduled is Consistently Changing Weekly without Noticed.   No Communication Among Managers .  A lot of Secret Shops, Cooperate and HR Visiting Among the Stores Monthly."
bad,"the Job at Ross had much happy, and highly productive times, as well as stressful, patience testing moments. But overall i learned more in depth how a business operates from a multitude of different positions to become the best employee i could."
bad,I highly don't recommend working here. I never got paid my last paycheck and they would never return back calls or emails about this.
bad,Hardest part of the job is staffing. We could not keep the store staffed which in turn made us managers have to do alot more work and do normal associates jobs.
bad,"bad experience working there, employees are mean and nasty, people advance in the job that don't really know what they are doing, non-appropiate relationships. barely any customer care. your lucky to receive 12 hours a week, very low pay. drama filled and a bad atmosphere never have i ever experienced working in a place like this!"
bad,"nice place to work there and shop, you could find a lot of neat things and cloths there."
bad,provide customers with good customer service. Provide a clean work area and speedy service. Operate the cash register. I had nice and friendly co-workers and the management team was fair. I enjoyed team work with my co-workers. The most difficult part of the job would be dealing with extremely rude customers who would belittle me.
bad,Ross was a fun job and I always exceeded what was necessary for me to do. I did not feel appreciated for my hard work. At times I would get recognition but only when I did jobs that I was not scheduled to do.I went above and beyond while working for Ross and made sure each customer I interacted with felt the need to come and shop again. I could never work more than 25 hours even when they needed extra help.  I think Ross is a good company but they do not pay their employees enough for the job being done and the hours scheduled are unfair.
bad,"A typical day at work was cashiering, providing  commendable customer service, marking down items, cleaning the sales floor, working in and maintaining a clean fitting room, and putting go backs where they belong."
bad,"I feel as thought no though goes into my work day, unpleasant working conditions, unnecessarily stressful. Not learning anything, mundane work and I'm becoming bored without having a purpose."
bad,"My shift normally consist of greeting customers. monitoring the store and ensuring that no one is stealing the merchandise. Most of My co-workers are normally assisting with monitoring also so that helps to keep stealing down to a minimum. The hardest part of my job is ensuring that everyone working my shift is doing what they should be doing, as far as ringing customers up and charging them the correct amounts for merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job is when my store has their Monthly inspection and our loss revenue numbers are the lowest they have been in months."
bad,"•	Responsible for completing schedules in a timely manner using STAFF WORKS software."
bad,it was only a seasonal job but i  did enjoy working there great people and a great team 
bad,Ross is a great place to buy discount designer fashions. The stores seem to be cluttered consistently.   
bad,Ross is ok u get paid every week but they only pay 7.50 and u bring around 300 home every week BEFORE taxes but they WILL work u half to death and send u out the door as soon as a problem of any kind come up
bad,"Fast-paced, constantly changing retail environment. Work with various partners inside and outside company on a daily basis to meet agreed upon department goals and deadlines. Constantly strive for growth and improvement of department. Off-price planning and flexibility allows achievement of these objectives."
bad,Constantly busy and on the go enjoy my job. I have excellent managers as well as a team that I work with. I've learned how important it is for everyone to do their part at work or just in everyday life because without that team work everyone else is thrown off and their work is doubled. The hardest part of my job is when I'm taken off of my assignment to go cover someone elses because they are being irresponsible and not doing their job. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I was able to make a difference in any new projects we have going on and hearing the feedback from the customers.
bad,Hours are erratic and change to much. Manager : Thornton Burch is ridiculous
bad,"Great employees, great location, not enough hours per week, hourly rate isn't too good either."
bad,The work load is always on going  and always want more from you no matter how great you perform. The pay is terrible and do not care about the employees
bad,"Working stockroom wasn't so bad at first, you don't deal with customers that much. but they don't train you right, you have to rely on your co-workers to know what you're doing. after a while it gets so boring and repetitive. and the hours suck. but it was a consistent time you would go in so that was a benefit. It just felt like I was going nowhere and left after a year. but if you want two jobs, ross is good side job. I got another job for the afternoon since stock was only morning. ok bye."
bad,"Ross is somewhere you would work for as if just another job. No real room for advancement and not viable for a career option. Bonuses are supposedly given as incentive when a certain requirement is met, but there is a hard time with the follow through on that. The management is shotty at best and the place is just highly unorganized in work structure. Y"
bad,They company does not take very good care of it's people and the stores are very unorganized. I would not recommend this place to anyone for a career.
bad,"Promotions are biased and based on favoritism, not overall and skill and job performance. Pay is not up to par and does not match work demand nor the living wage."
bad,"I only worked at ross for a few months and i dreaded having to walk into that place every day, the only thing that made it bearable were some of the employees i befriended. The managers( one in particular) were so rude and disrespectful, even customers had to stand up to the managers to say something. The manager(s) were not only rude to employees, but customers as well. I was treated less than a toddler and talked to as if i were incapable of doing simple tasks. I was encouraged multiple times to call corporate on the manager in question. The pay also sucks for the amount of slaving they make you do. One week you’ll have a full schedule and the next they’re cutting down your hours. I think working here would be much better if one of the managers were to leave or, hopefully be removed from the location. Overall i really enjoyed working with the people i worked with and i’m grateful they were able to make my experience a little more worthwhile."
bad,"Everything was fine til I figured out that you have to kiss up to management to be treated fairly. If you choose not to, you are at their mercy when it comes to the schedule and getting time off, also they'll let their favorites get away with more than you can. And if you think having 8 hours turn over between shifts are bad, stay away from here."
bad,"Management wise you’ll have those who truly run your store and the main manager who most of the time does nothing for you. Personally, at my store, we had someone hired who’s never worked with Ross rather than promoting the next in line. He’s made a mockery of our processes, treating people with respect, and promising promotions just to pull the chance from under your feet. Everyone underneath that  man makes that store. If you want to feel like you run the store and give the credit to someone who does not lift a finger, this is the job for you."
bad,"Ross dress for less is a good place to work, if you’re looking for part time you will get 1 to 2 days per week because payroll is always bad. If you were in management you will be told you will be trained and you will not get the proper training that you need. You are underpaid and overworked and let’s not forget underappreciated"
bad,"Loss prevention is all about looking like security without actually being security. You spend a lot of time memorizing (and reciting) the ""five aspects of command presence,"" which eventually you realize is just being a human scarecrow. Every day, you show up to stand in place (or pace within a predetermined area) and just watch retail happen. "
bad,"Worked there for a year. I enjoyed the people I worked with but I didn't enjoy working for Ross. It was busy location with normal to high crime rate. After meeting many corporate employees from store inspections, I had no reason to work hard for Ross anymore. Was happy to leave, even with offers for move up in position with Loss Prevention."
bad,"Worked for almost 3 years. Worked at 2 different locations in Washington State, the second of which I was mostly in management. I started as a basic sales associate and moved up to what is called an Area Supervisor. I was trained for almost everything at the first location which made me a valuable asset at the second. If you have no friends, no kids, and no life; this job is for you."
bad,"Management was chaotic trying to control majority college student employees. obvious favorite employees had preferential treatment. management would manipulate employees into less paid positions."
bad,The manager is not very friendly and only gives employees 10 hours a week. The manager also gives out hours to the employees that are favored. Working there is stressful. The manager is constantly trying to find ways to replace employees.
bad,This was a ok experience but I would have been better if I new what I was actually was going to be doing other than the lack of communication and the few hours available
bad,"Unless you want to work 15 hours or less a week, not a good place to work. The management was nice enough, they worked with what they had, but still was lacking. It is a good fast paced environment, and nice supervisors and co-workers. Just not enough hours or pay to survive on as a single job, part time only."
bad,"A typical day at work was the the stock Supervisor yelling at the employees. There would be constant ""meetings"" on how to improve but the issue was clearly management.  The manager and assistant manager were ok but the stock supervisor really needs to learn a lesson. I had to leave as so did MANY others because we would get yelled at everyday ! There was constant arguments that led nowhere. The most enjoyable part of this job are the potlucks and some of the employees. Besides that, the  stock supervisor was the most unprofessional person I have ever met she should have been let go."
bad,Generous employee discount. Worked 2 different stores 1st store was by the book second store was poorly managed. DM will only take managers word over supervisors.
bad,Paid every 2 weeks. Not enough hours. They always forgot to give me a break. If you work in stock you never know when you’re going to get off. Hard to pay bills when you’re scheduled 4-5 hours 2-3 times a week sometimes even one 4 hour shift for the entire week. Your shifts can be cancelled if labor is high or not enough to go around.
bad,The same as any other job I comment about just do your job and go home I didn't like it because wasn't paying enough working so hard for that little bit of money
bad,I did loss prevention for Ross for a few year while finishing my BA in Psych. It was a temporary job while I finished school for it was great for just that. Cannot support yourself in Bay Area working there.
bad,"While the coworkers overall are great to work with, the majority of the management is something else entirely. Definite brown nosing going on and on a first mistake, you're done and get demoted if you're in a leadership position regardless of if you are new or not to that position. Getting trained is more baptism by fire and extremely incomplete. Then you start to get held accountable for things that you were completely unaware about. At least that's how things are at the store I worked at."
bad,Many people almost every week quite and new associates almost every week as well. This is an extremely fast-paced and stressful environment to work in.
bad,Good environment to work with the team members. All managers are continuing guide their team to complete the task which are given to them. So many things I learned from Ross.
bad,"It was okay I guess If you like constantly working with horrible guests, managers who don’t care and  huge messes to clean up at the end of the day with little people to help because they’re so cheap they don’t have enough people to close ever!"
bad,"Took a while to actually start working.  "
bad,"Ross was fun at first. You get a discount and like twice a year the discount doubles. Most of the co workers are nice. The problem is that the place is incredibly stressful. The customers are incredibly rude and some will even verbally assault you. The customers will also completely wreck the place and they don’t schedule enough people to help fix the place properly. The scheduling isn’t the managements fault it’s that the company doesn’t give enough payroll to help fund the extra workers. If you are regular associate, you may not get more than 15 hours a week and that fluctuates quite a bit."
bad,Out of 3 years Ive worked under 3 different store managers and countless supervisors. The turnover rate is ridiculous. Ive worked from the back to the front within 3 different positions and I can easily say the DMs and SMs get away with entirely too much as far as a lack of communication or building any type of positive relationship with the employees. Favoritism should not be utilized in retail as much as it is.
bad,"No matter how hard you work its not appreciated, you are forced into more demanding positions without being asked or compensated for it, unwilling to work with me on wanting to transition to stock from cashier/sales floor position due to hours and being fed up dealing with entitled rude customers and was denied just because I was one of the faster cashiers, went through 5 manager/ assistant managers in 2 years"
bad,Working there was great.. yet if your good in a certain area don't expect to move from there. They keep hiring and hiring and cutting hours instead of giving them to the employees already onsite
bad,"I worked at Ross Dress for Less for 3 years. It was my first job out of high school. It was fun and I enjoyed coming to work and working with my coworkers until new management came in. The SM was external and was very difficult to work with. The new ASM was Hispanic  and would give most of the hours to people who spoke Spanish. The store became a very toxic environment and I decided to leave. There was no order, everyone just did what they wanted. Ross is not a horrible company, it just depends on the management."
bad,"I have been working at Ross Stores full-time (More than 3 years)"
bad,"Working at Ross has always been a temporary plan for me. The store manager is very disliked by his employees and is disrespectful to some employees. Sometimes its a fun place to work, other times it is not."
bad,When I worked at Ross it was a very stressful environment and they were always shorted staff. Even though management was nice they were to laid back since employees would always be late or not show up for their shift. It felt like it was always disorganized since they have you run around cleaning the aisles and call you to the cashier to ring customers up.
bad,"- A typical day at work involves completing purchases and cleaning the sales floor "
bad,"I would not recommend to anybody to work here."
bad,"My life was dedicated to Ross Dress For Less in Aiken! Until, poor management. There was always drama. They descriminate so bad there it's sad. I use to love working for the company until about last year. I love the customers that come there. I always enjoyed them.   If they made a better management team. I would definitely go back. But I worked so hard there and my hard work was always unnoticed. Discrimination is it's highest in that store. Ive heard and seen a lot in that store. And If I had cooperates number I would have went to them before quitting but from what I heard, they act like they care but they don't care either. Sad. I pray things go back to how they were before."
bad,"Not an easy job, lots of expectations .. the good thing about it is that you get the experience first hand in the retail industry. I would recommend if you don't mind hard work"
bad,Not really my kind of job due to dirty work place .needed to be constantly picking up broken pallets or trash in the warehouse . Fast paste work environment
bad,"Typical retail job. Didn't learn much, employees were kind & hard working, work was meaningless. Breaks were reasonably spaced and assigned. Was initially promised rotation between fitting room and cashier shifts but they stuck me in the fitting room every shift."
bad,"Everything must go on the sales floor, whether there's room or not. Often times you have to ""make room"" or just put merchandise on the floor. Freight is always different, so you can have slow days and fast days, but your deadlines remain the same even if there's a hundred more pieces than yesterday."
bad,Worked graveyard shift through the busiest holidays at ROSS. After hours always left the crew with an incredibly messy and disorganized store. Always had to re-organized everything on top of adding to the inventory.
bad,"Go in, and stuck on the register all day! On top of a bunch of other tasks you have to juggle. Then because you're left with a whole load of workload, at the end of the night it all piles up and because you're stuck on the register constantly, it is difficult to finish everything that you are tasked to do."
bad,The hours are long and late. The mangers aren't very helpful. A lot is expected from part-time employees. Ross is open most holidays and no matter your availability you will most likely have to work.
bad,"Management was very unorganized. Scheduling was somewhat regular which was convenient, however, there were a lot of cut hours or constant attempts to have you come in on your day off."
bad,"If you love fashion this job might be the perfect fit for you. workplace culture is great, management are very friendly and you get to enjoy free bagels, yogurt, and fruits every monday! hardest part of the job is probably the workload, can cause some stress if you are not organized. as a side note ive noticed that some areas are not the same as others but everyone is paid the same, sometimes feel as though some areas are underpaid for the amount they are tasked with."
bad,"I was very glad to have gotten the call to come in to orientation, but after getting a feel for the atmosphere and feel of the place... I realized that once the holiday season was over that the hours were going to be cut very drastically. "
bad,"its nice place to work for people need easy job and part time "
bad,It was only a fun place to work because of the employees there but the management is sad! The management does not seem to take care of it's employee's
bad,"Attention to detail is a must. Jobs entails several things to do. I didn't like working there because you could not change how things operated even if you didn't like it. A lot of times you saw things that went bad, you try to report and nothing happened."
bad,"Not a good place to invest too much time in. Annually there are $1.00 raises and 3 times a year the employee discount is doubled for a short time. Besides these two factors, your experience while at Ross depends on the customer load and management. The more busy the Ross the harder it is to manage and the more stress is placed on employee shoulders. The down sides of this job mainly lie in closing, because you can not leave until everything is in place. Management fails to provide support in the day to prevent late closings for employees and do not compensate scheduling for closers."
bad,"The company prides it self in people development but the truth is most leaders were put in place because the company did not have any option. They need to make the day to day for managers bearable, pay leaders enough to feel valued and find a way to really train their associates."
bad,"Managers outside the company get promoted over great managers already present, these managers usually don't have a clue about the company and makes the store worse. These less knowledgable people promoted over experienced managers either think they know it all or rely on you for everything, sometimes both. Unfortunately they're not fair about promotions, its all about how much you can kiss up to the people in power. "
bad,"It's a good place to work, people are friendly, and it's easy. My previous two managers were A BLAST! They made working there challenging and fun! New manager made job stressful and hardly wanted to work."
bad,"Fast paced ,   ringing up customers, processing merchandise to sales floor, observing cashiers/customer service,  great middle mgmt,  terrible manager"
bad,"I loved the people i worked with, but the company demands to much.Often times the ideas corporate would come up with would be counter intuitive. The manager demanded a lot but the pay does not meet what they demand. Part time hours are hard to come by, often not even getting 15 hours a week. the hardest part of the job is that everything is timed an recorded on time sheet daily/weekly, the job is not for the weak minded."
bad,I learned a lot about how to lead a team and essential management skills. There was a lot of pressure on my shoulders without the recognition or compensation that was deserved. I learned a lot from this job experience and many skills that will apply for a lifetime. I quickly realized I could be far more valuable to a different company and really just wanted something more fulfilling.
bad,Worked for the company almost for two years and didn't not get a raise until I was getting ready to leave. Management was not good and always changed every couple of months.
bad,"While this is a good place to work at there are a few things that need adjustments. For example, the management has  its kinks. Scheduling is a mess, and the store is somehow shorthanded. The plus side is that everyone that works thee is friendly and always ready  to help"
bad,Discounts are good. Customers can be difficult at times but that's to be expected. I would be cautious because things aren't always what they seem. Met some good people.
bad,"the management.... "
bad,"After 14 years in retail management i ran into my first horrible boss here at Ross Dress For Less."
bad,Good compensation and work life balance but role doesn't include planning and is more of an assistant role. Spend a lot of time printing and doing reports that I am not sure anyone looks at. Waste a ton of paper and very unconventional type of planning that is not consistant with any other company.
bad,not much to say about ross when the manager left it wasn't as good as before so I left because of the way he would talk to people a lot of people left that year
bad,"My experience at Ross was a okay. I just never liked how everything was timed from scanning an item to putting it in the bag, to the time the receipt came out to when you had to scan the next customers item or even at the fact the we had poor customer service, we had to hand the receipt to the customer because us handing it to them was 'time consuming'."
bad,"I was hired temporarily as a stock associate, but ended up being there for longer. I would go to work between the hours of 2a.m.-4a.m. and we would work till a certain time or if the job was done. Some days we only worked 4 hours. We did get paid a $1 more than the minimum wage. But some days we wouldn't get to work because the truck loads were small. It was nice getting off in the morning because you still had your entire day. But this job isn't ideal for people who have bills and or families. Management wasn't very organized either. We would get to work clock in and head to the backroom. Pick a spot on the line we wanted to work near. Then we would grab a bucket and fill with clothes pin security tags. A cart with hangers/sizing tabs. And then a huge trash bag. Stand there and just do our job. Go out on the floor and put the clothes in the right places."
bad,Ross was a ok store it wasnt rewarding .you deal with a lot of rude customers.the store was always a mess the manager ask for too much.felt they thought the were all of that.my experience was not bad .it was just alot.the lines were always long.every other customer was rude.the managers expect you to stay even thought it was time for you in to leave.and they get mad if you dont stay  .and if you tell them your going to be late.they get upset with you.that is so annoying.
bad,"Fun place to work at times....Assisting customers as they enter and exit fitting room...Make sure items taken in were the right number returned after exiting fitting room.  Learned how to arrange clothing on racks to be taken back on the floor to be placed on the right racks.  Management was kind of confusing as no manager stayed for long periods of time. Co-workers - some were nice, others weren't. The hardest part of job was dealing with customers who didn't want to follow the rules that were given to us for the purpose of entering the fitting room. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people as I am a people person."
bad,Salario bajo. Ambiente laboral no muy bueno. Tienda muy desorganizada. Falta de personal.
bad,The management role seemed great at first but it is a lot of responsibility for not enough money. The people are great and that's one of the things that kept me coming back. The company is a multi-million dollar company and they low ball you with your pay. It is HIGHLY stressful but could definitely be worth it if the pay was better. I am in management and the difference in my pay and a regular part-time employee is $0.25. To me that is ridiculous when I have WAY more responsibility. Yes I get more hours but there should be a clear difference in pay between regular employee's and management.
bad,"long hours little pay, store manager barely there and when she is always yelling and disrespecting employees, rude customers, no team spirit."
bad,"In a typical work day, I am actively involved with my co-worker(s) to maximize productivity. This is achieved by daily training, supervising and delegating. I enjoying having the ability to balance a fun work environment with a productive one."
bad,I did not have a good experience with this company.  I was a Front End Supervisor for the winter season.  I wa lucky to find a job after the holidays elsewhere.
bad,"Walking the shortage highway to find misplaced items when entering and exiting the store.  Sorting and oraginzing returns and tried- on items upon a clothing rack. Once a cothing rack is full, the items are to be put back onto the sales floor in the correct area. "
bad,"Typical day - Work an 10+ shift as required. Work hands one with the staff. Try to keep a clean and recovered sales floor and provide customer service. Hourly follow up with company routines and follow up with staff with feedback or coaching if needed."
bad,There was NO ACCOUNTABLITY from all of our management staff. The employees had no energy to work but only receive a paycheck.
bad,"Ross is a great place to work if you love to shop. A typical work day would be spent helping out on register, helping out in the dressing rooms, taking clothes back and sizing, and doing returns and exchanges."
bad,"I have never worked for a job that does not follow thru with training any of their employees. I start this job in December of 2014 and was suppose to go to training within 2 weeks of starting and it took them 5 months to finally send me to training and it was suppose to be 4 weeks long and I only got 2 weeks of training. And during the 5 months that I did not go to training you would figure the store manager would have trained me on some of the things, but she instead was showing another Area Supervisor how to do my job instead of me. I believe there should be team work between all managers but there is so much favoritism in that store that all the other employees even see it and end up quitting because of it and the lack of training for all employees. That is why I am looking for another job."
bad,"The company is particularly good at working with you availability so that is definitely a plus. You do however, have to have the ability to work in a fast paced environment."
bad,"A job with this company is primarily for young professionals either beginning their careers by trying to obtain experience or for people who just need a part time job. The company generally starts employees at minimum wage, and working your way up through the company is virtually impossible. Some managers will attempt to work with employees schedules while others will not at all."
bad,"Most management either have no idea what they're doing or they do know but are too burnt out to actually do what needs to be done. Lots of blame passing goes through the store constantly."
bad,"It not the best job if you want a career just a PT job to make extra money.  a regular day is always short and understaffed. Associates always calling out, so it make difficult to get things done. Management has been okay, but so many ppl in management has either been quit, transfer or fired. already went through so many supervisors and managers, it absolute crazy. Co-Workers are not ones you want to depend on. They  would turn on you to get to the top. The hardest part of the job is being work so hard for so less. the most enjoyable part is sadly clocking out and getting a paycheck."
bad,Great place to work if you don't care about exceeding in life. They don't offer full time and they don't allow you to work more hours. Full time positions are only available for a few positions and they're never available because people that have been there for years already have them
bad,"it was fun to work here but it was hard work and odd hours and not very high pay, store at end of day looked like a bomb went off, customers were very disrespectful."
bad,"Slightly ok for a college student."
bad,"I enjoyed my time as an intern, but it helped me realize I do not want to do this forever."
bad,"A typical day at work is the same as yesterdays day at work. Nothing new happen'd and nothing old Happen'd. The coworkers were very easy to get along with, though some has the inner circle already set. Including managers. The hardest part of the job was getting stock down. So little workers vs. one big truck full of merchandise."
bad,Loved merchandising and getting to know the people.  Also loved the repeat customers.
bad,Our jobs vary from the work we have and if there is room avaliable. Some days as Unit ID we have to go in the back and sort our work so it can be ID.
bad,"greet customers, process shipment, tag merchandise.  Some co workers were very hard to work with."
bad,"Ross Dress for Less INC is the usual Retail Job. Each Store is ran by different management, therefore they are each ran different."
bad,First job I got that gave me the manager title. I've learned a lot. And I wish this company would step it up to be in good competition with its competitors.
bad,"Corporate shows no appreciation for its retail associates. No bathroom soap, paper towels..unsanitary."
bad,"Well, it was a stepping stone into greater heights. One learns how to operate a store on the most limited resources and that can definitely aid in later stores."
bad,i hate working here nothing was about this job was good. So unprofessional. I was part time working 3 or 4 hours shift 3 day each pay period making no money because they couldn't afford to pay the employes but they was still hiring people. Hated That Job
bad,"I worked at Ross Dress for Less in Mililani, Hi for almost a year. In that time I became pregnant. During my time working at Ross there were a lot of favoritism, rude management, and poor work ethnic. The pay was low, only 8$/hr, and raises were not high. I did however enjoy the relationships I had with some employees and customers."
bad,"The best part of the job is offering outstanding customer service, worst part of the job is no acknowledgement of what is right only constant of what is wrong.  salary not aligned with duties. scheduling is always non-balanced on all levels"
bad,This was a difficult environment full of politics where customer service was the only thing that mattered. Time managing skills were a must and quickly learned.
bad,I loved the regular customers that know you by name. Everyday we had new merchandies. Meet new people and training them
bad,Managers & Associates are very pleasant. The hardest part of my job is being on my feet all day in dress shoes. I enjoy the challenge of minimizing theft and shortage.
bad,A lot of expectations with no direction. A huge advantage with expansion within chicagoland. A lot of managers fired often.
bad,"running register, helping customers,working in stockroom, I learned how to size, the management was rude and didn't know how to treat their employees. Coworker were nice and friendly and helpful. The hardest part was having to take the store manager's unpleasant way of speaking to me. Meeting new people"
bad,"At Ross, the main focus is on the customer, of course. A typical day at this retail store includes getting the store ready to open, assisting customers in fitting rooms, working as cashier, and in the customer service section, helping customers who have returns or simply have a question. The hardest part about working at Ross was definately, dealing with the weekend and holiday rushes. The store would get so crowded and messy, it became difficult to walk around the aisles and customers. Other than the 20% employee discount, the most enjoyable part of this job was the warm atmosphere the employees provided."
bad,"Checked in driver, unloaded truck, stocked merchandise, entered daily data into a computer software system."
bad,"extremely low pay, fluctuating hours, not the type of job to stay at for a long period of time."
bad,"I was let go because I was catching on to SM stealing money, making fake W-2s, paying employees in cash. Company didn't press charges. She told employees I was fired for stealing but told DM I quit. I tried to fight it by calling HR but nobody would listen. "
bad,Loss prevention at Ross essentially means greeter that writes down entrance times of sketchy people. There’s absolutely nothing you can do about theft other than tell a manager. If you have a decent manager you may be able to talk to other employees to pass the time but if your manager is strict it’ll be about 7 and a half hours of standing there and about 5 minutes of actual work.
bad,Loved the associated inworked with as well as the customers. Didnt care for the lack of communication with the management team. The 1st location I worked at in Montana the store and assistant managers where both very hands on. The ones at the OR store not so much and they argued alot with eachother coassociates.
bad,"It's mostly what you'd expect. don't expect more than 12 hours a week unless you're on the manager's good side. Store manager causes a lot of unnecessary drama. Every area supervisor tells you completely different rules, it makes no sense. When we get super rude customers, managers won't stick up for us, they'll just make us look stupid. We get yearly raises, but only by a few cents."
bad,Overall it would be a work environment t for young school children or college students.  Not enough Security and an unsafe environment. You had to memorize merchandise sales and projections which was not explained to me during the hiring process. They kept giving me additional work hours when I informed them that I was a student and can only work part time hours.
bad,"In the early stages of the internship there was substantial activities and projects for leadership development, which slowly decreased to where there was not much for an intern to do even when actively seeking projects and improving upon others. For most of the internship, my cubicle was in a compacted temporary tent until the renovations were finished on the corporate offices. It was very nice of the managers to treat us interns to a night out at Top Golf."
bad,"Title says it all. Loved seeing my coworkers everyday, but management was just a disgrace. We saw so many new managers because so many kept getting fired for theft, unwanted sexual advances, hiding merchandise, or outbursts of rage against customers (Yes from managers!)"
bad,"In the beginning, it was a good place to work. You can move up fairly easy by having communication with management. Co-workers are great and everyone gets along. Good management made working there efficient and quick. Unfortunately, this did not last. I currently come in every day to work, and the store is always unorganized and people are dying to leave from their shift. I get constant complaints from employees about how unhappy and how overwhelming it is working here. Corporate is cheap and expects its employees to do the job of three while getting paid the minimum. We are constantly exposed to hostile customers and homeless unpredictable people entering and stealing. May I add that we are not allowed to ask people to leave even though they come in almost every day to steal or cause both the staff and our customers stress. This is something that happens daily and multiple times a day. Corporate does not care for the safety of their employees with their ridiculous extended business hours of one in the morning every day. The mess is overbearing to the fulltime staff which have to constantly pick up 2 departments every night. A lot of miscommunication between management results in people slacking from their jobs and doing things incorrectly. We are always somehow ""lacking hours and payroll' to have both cashiers and people cleaning on the sales floor, even though we always have business and sales. This leads to a busy, over-packed, small store always having lines and not having enough staff on the register so that others can organize merchandise and departments, provide decent"
bad,"Stressful work Day work, nothing impossible,tough management team, very stressful work culture, the hardest part of the job is unload and finish the truck,"
bad,"Had a very interesting experience there, you can be a very dedicated work and still be given more work than others or given the tougher assignments. Management has their favorites so that says a lot."
bad,Working at Ross  is a amazing experience to work at you have amazing team everyone is amazing to work with and you able To flex your hours with them plus you get discount on everything. However I wouldn’t recommend Ross for everyone I would recommend for people who still leave with there parents and ain’t paying bills but trust me when I say if you are independent person who lives by them self’s and depending on Ross as there primary source I would recommend . The hours sucks when I used to work there I kept asking them for full time position and they wouldn’t allow me because they didn’t want me to get alll the benefits so they hired another guy so they could keep me on part Time which I was getting  eighteen or a less a week which I couldn’t save up my money because all my money went to paying my bills and sometimes they would cut my hours because we were over payroll which it was frustrating for me not for the managers and the supervisors because they all got there hours. Every two weeks they would hire a new team because they couldn’t keep the others team because they couldn’t sand there hours and there pay
bad,"They were not very flexible with schedules, they don't seem to care too much about the associates, and the customers are almost always rude. I got in trouble several times because the customers didn't like our policies, and every time management would get on to me."
bad,"My store has 4 different managers and none of them know what the other had in mind for the store. There's literally only like 4 people that work per shift , the store has to sell a certain amount to keep its employees  , it's rare to get overtime. Its mandatory to get at least 1 day off ."
bad,"It's been a minute since I've worked at Ross but I did not like it. The people that have been there for years are so nice and incredibly hard working, but It was a brutal working environment; it was disorganized, with safety hazards everywhere."
bad,"I didn't enjoy my employment at Ross, but that doesn't mean someone else will feel the same way and/or have the same circumstances as I did. Regardless, It's a decent first job with flexible hours."
bad,"Hours aren’t stable. You get cancelled a lot."
bad,The store will not benefit you fairly if you have experience. The pay is not worth the duties unless you really need a job. Retail work is stressfull enough especially when you're not being compensated fairly for your experience and everything you are able to bring to the table. I would not recommend working here unless you're inexperienced and have an urgent need for money.
bad,"Typical day of work: Enforcing policies that consistently frustrate customers and dealing with the blow-back while getting inconsistent direction from multiple members of management causing more confusion. "
bad,always had to be aware of your surroundings because of shoplifters. Sometimes management goes crazy because of store sales volume. In addition there is always something to do.
bad,"The company does everything it can to under pay its workers. If you are not a favorite of any of the managers or supervisors you will probably hate it there. Blue chip is a scam, it is a ""bonus"" that the company gives when employees reach a certain percentage. Ross does its best to under pay the employees since they keep finding ways to cut blue chip and make it harder to get."
bad,"A typical day consisted of meeting with the department managers and teams.  Processed daily deliveries (#1 priority) of merchandise. Daily recovery of merchandise and overall operations."
bad,"Very understanding , but could ask for things that arent in job description and even if you do it they will expect you to do everytimes with less time afte"
bad,I was a stock associate. They told me that I would be learning to do customer service stuff but I worked there for 1 and a half years and barely learned to do that. When I was doing customer service they just threw me into it and didn't really train me. The store manager didn't listen to our suggestions and was constantly putting the schedule up late.
bad,Ross was eye-opening to me. I have never worked that hard in any other situation. Employees would just not come in which would increase the workload for everyone.The resetting of the entire store every 30 days was taxing.
bad,"Some issues with management and customer service but other than that it's a great and fast moving working environment. I worked in every department in the store, you'll defiantly learn a lot."
bad,"Working at Ross was definitely a stressful job, a lot of people everywhere and clothes all over the floor that you were expected to pick up at the end of the shift sometimes you'd end up staying about 2 hours after your scheduled time off. Co- workers were friendly though and the pay was decent for the position I worked. (cashier)"
bad,"I worked at Ross for 4 years of my life. At the ripe age of 23 I basically lived and breathed at Ross. To say my whole time working there was terrible would be misleading. I worked as a back-up MOD for 1 year and was considered one of the best cashiers in Ross for many months, I provided many and many of hours trying to help and assist my associates and managers to the best of my abilities with little to no complaining and every time I kept my smile towards the customers. A lot of my frustration comes from the lack of management explaining or coaching things to the associates, and the lack of communications towards the other managers. I wish that the situations that arrived towards my leave would been tame which is quite saddening, but I hope for the best for them and pray that everything goes in there way."
bad,"My time with Ross was not that one of enjoyment. Management and employees were great, but the company has a lot of improvement to make. I wouldn't work for this company again."
bad,Managers are super professional and understanding. Get a 20% store discount all year with two times out of the year being 40% off. Work environment is stressful.
bad,"Work was normal warehousing and processing. ticketing, and shipping. Most days were same with seasonal changes. Used a large temp workforce. Did promote when they were able to."
bad,I would only recommend this job if the person is capable of stepping on other foots. Communication between managers and employees really was bad. If you plan on working for the location I did my suggestion is not to.
bad,"The postion that I had was very relaxed, I was an induct-or for tilt tray, most of the time i scanned boxed took merchandise  out and sent it off on the tilt tray and through my boxes under an trash bin."
bad,"busy"
bad,There are many different positions at the Ross Distribution Center but you do not choose what position you could work.  You must reach a certain percentage of how many products you distribute and if there is no work for the night they cancel your shift.
bad,"This job was wonderful first starting out here. But as the months went by it became poorer and poorer. The managers are extremely unprofessional, starting with the store manager."
bad,"Their were more roles in this job than any other i've ever had, and I think that they were understaffed and over working us. I did not enjoy it, but I did learn from it. So that I can say is worth it."
bad,My general manager is awesome but the other management staff is awful. New employees want to quit because of the attitudes of the store managers. The pay is low compared to other businesses. The job is fairly easy going but productive. The benefits are only for full-time employees. They pick and choose their favorites to be full-time regardless of work ethic. They give the least amount of hours possible.
bad,While working at Ross I got to add more retail experience to my work experience but they lacked hours to give employees so i only worked twice or sometimes no days a week.
bad,you have to all positions on your salary and deal with rude management and customers and hr is not helpful towards situations very political behind the scences
bad,"A typical work day went along the lines of coming in, putting back items around the store, picking up things off the ground, and manning the register. Truth be told, all of these wouldn't be so bad, had it not be for customers that constantly leave the store a mess. I've walked into other Ross stores in other cities and their employees work just as hard as those at San Leandro, it really just is just that the regular people who shop at this Ross are especially messy. I learned the typical ins and outs of being a store associate, it wasn't really anything that difficult to grasp. The hardest part is just cleaning and dealing with disrespectful customers, but that's expected from a retail. The only enjoyable part of work were the two floor managers who were truly a job to work with."
bad,"I loved the people that work there, but you are always short handed and the management would rather hole up in the office then get on the floor and get your hands dirty."
bad,"My typical day usually starts simple get my marching orders, execute said marching orders. It gets difficult when you find out who you're working with and whose the ASM or AS cause some of them do not care. Then it follows with customers who will act like 4-year old children when you're the only one there so you have to manage to find someone willing to help you while helping customers and when there is nobody and no one is there and you're calling the ASM or AS to help you get two answers: 1 they're on there way in the next 3-5 minutes or 2: they'll say call someone else so you're pretty screwed. After all that process more than a dozen returns then being one of the strongest and tallest or only male there you have to do heavy work which i'm used to cause it gives me a chance to cool down a bit. At the end of the day I've either had a drink and i'm calm or i'm going home angry and ready to yell at someone. Sometimes I get lucky and find one customer that makes all that frustration go away or i tire myself out from running up and down the store. when it comes to asking for a possible full-time position or an opprotunity to try and become it's pretty much a no. I've been asking for the past three months if there's an open position or a possible chance to move up and no one will reply back or even acknowledge that you asked a question and i finally have my college degree. it's like saying no but even worse."
bad,"As I was working here I realized retail is only fro specific people. Ross Dress for Less was also never very organized, they did not train me very well and the staff never wanted to help out with training. I was forced to learn on my own."
bad,Working part time is good there for the hours not the money and the labor is to much for so little pay and very little acknowledgement toward the employs.
bad,"Ross is a very time consuming job , i stay there for sometimes 12 hours . They have there favorites , if they don't really like you , you have no hours ."
bad,TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!! managers don't train they make the employees train you and as a new hire if you don't know what to do they blame you for it...
bad,"Just like most retail jobs do not provide the best when it comes to gurantee hours. There can be one week with a full schedule and  2-3 days off or the next week working 1-3 days, When your looking for temporary this may be the perfect job. Pay is great and always able to get a raise based on overall performance once a year."
bad,"Work seasonal for one year, loved retail."
bad,I didn't learn much. They would have me stock merchandise then I would welcome customers to the store. Management was difficult to deal with. Co-workers were nice. Hardest part of the job was trying to advance your position due to the number of workers they had. The most enjoyable part was stocking merchandise because it allowed you to be a productive part of the store.
bad,"If you are looking for a job with discounts or supplemental income, Ross is good. There is not much room for advancement."
bad,"if your looking for a job with hours, this is not the place, you barley get any hours maybe 2 or 3 days of the week but never a full shift."
bad,With this job I was able to use and improve my customer service skills. Interacting with customers is something I love to do..
bad,"Got hired here after being laid off in 2013. On the store level, the job is great. I made a lot of friends with my coworkers. Even had regular customers that went out of their way to show how they appericated my customer service. "
bad,Only 5-10 hours a week. Would go to work just once or twice a week and that was when they will call you the day of or the night before. The management was okay but could of talked more to the employees. Little training.
bad,"I worked at Ross for about 3 months. I loved the job at first, but over time, things got much worse. The managers were very rude and uncaring towards me, even though they claimed that they loved me as an employee; they would give me cards and compliments as thanks, yet they treated me horrible, so this did no matter much."
bad,"If your lucky you will meet great associate that are willing to help you get better and teach you things you need to know. management wise, they obviously have favorites, at my store it would be a very long time to move up unless you transfer. and to much drama. management needs to be more strict with people who comes in late all the time or who doesnt even show up at all. they still work there. i was late 2 out of my 2 years and i got written up for it"
bad,"The workers make it a fun place to work. The management need to manage better. They don't communicate with each other. Fast paced environment. One minute you are in the fitting room, the next minute you are on register, the next minute are you on the sales floor. Not enough hours if you are part-time. However, they do work with your schedule. It's a great job if you are going to school and don't need that many hours."
bad,"short handed, only PT offered ever, you'll get 8 hours some weeks and 15 others, nothing to count on. you'll get paid almost nothing and expected to do far about your job."
bad,"they expect alot of work from you with little pay."
bad,$9.00 just to stand on your feet watch shoplifters but you cannot apprehend shoplifters or touch shopping carts yes shopping carts and you will barley get 20hrs a week unless your full time
bad,Its a good job if your in school and can't work that long cause unless your a manager you can't work for more than 20 hrs a week and its always messy in their and everything is on the ground or hidden on shelves.
bad,A normal day at work is good. The environment is nice.  Co - workers are pretty level headed but yet very content. The hardest part is getting every one on the same pace.
bad,Unwelcoming work environment as management does not take employees into consideration with decisions that directly affect them. Lack of communication often and rules are loosely applied most of time allowing for lack of consistency.
bad,"I loved the interaction with the customers. I was the first and the last person the customers seen daily. I got to know alot of them by name even. The location I was at was the busiest (so I heard) so there was always something to do to keep busy, which passed the day very fast. That's always a plus!"
bad,"Good scheduling, and fast pace working. A lot of employs work hard. organized schedules. managers cool."
bad,"A typical day at work was to grab your pallet jack and grab your pallet with boxes an scan an put them in there designated area. I learned ways to be faster with my job. Management was good, Always trying to look out for you but can be real stern. My co-workers didn't speak any other language so i couldn't really converse but they were hard workers, The hardest part of the job was doing 16-20 pallets a day filled with over ex:1,000's of items at a time. Most enjoyable part was knowing that i did a good job."
bad,"The store I was placed in was a disaster. I stuck around hoping that I could really make a difference. The turnover is very high, the customers are the worst in retail. Overall, I learned how to deal with extreme situations that I hope will never be duplicated."
bad,i liked the company but from the moment i got hired to the time i left i went through like 4-5 managers because the job is too stressful.
bad,i loved to going to work everyday and the mangement was great.
bad,"Cherry Hill Ross has an excellent atmosphere and congenial co-workers.  Management is also as accommodating as possible and have a great attitude.   The hardest part of the job is trying to live on the wages paid, and coping with a schedule that changes week to week.  Workers and management are extremely busy and often cope with stringent demands on the use of necessary supplies, (bags for customer purchases, etc.), and minimal manpower for workload."
bad,"Managers & co workers aRe great."
bad,"Working for Ross is horrible. The company as a whole asks way too much of it's associates for minimum compensation. The company doesn't pay the regular employees well, the managers don't make nearly enough, or even the people in corporate. Anyone who works here can do way better and are probably seeking other employment opportunities. EX. Base pay for a manager responsible for opening and closing a store that makes millions and handles thousands of dollars daily is $9.45 an hour in the state of TX."
bad,"They sell stuff for cheap, and pay for they employees cheap too. You can find the worst customer here. Many of them come to destroy the store or to steal something."
bad,*Every day there is a lot of work
bad,"I work from monday-friday 5am-130pm, a typical day at work is sometimes frustrating, can be fun if you love what your day, and overwhelming because of the fact you got to keep a fast pace of 75% to meet the warehouse requirements. I've learned a lot working here at the Ross warehouse, i've learned to mark clothes, put stickers on shoes, tagging products and much other things that we do. I would say the hardest part of the job is keeping the requirement of 75% per week and trying to get a higher percentage to make a ""Blue Chip"" bonus on your checks. The most enjoyable part of my job is having communication with the two supervisors, they help a lot and want you to succeed as you make your way up."
bad,"My typical day at work is very hectic. We are understaffed so it creates an extra load of work for everyone, but it definitely gets me busy. I start out running items to the sales floor that are left from the day before. When the stockroom is clear and ready for shipment our Stockroom Lead calls everyone back to unload. After the truck is processed, items are placed on the sales floor and processing of other shipment begins."
bad,"Not a bad job, great employee discount.Alot of time goes by quick its so fast paced. I have learned to stock and size certain things. Management and co workers are pretty pleasant. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with all the hangers and hard tags.They all have to be removed and there is a place for all of them. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and putting a smile on there face before they leave."
bad,"Ross is good for people that need a flexible schedule, The Management don't really manage though so the associates are left trying on their own. If you are looking to move up in a company they will do it but you you will still be making the same pay. (min wage) There is no sense of structure and there is ABSOULTLY no repermanding of associates that leave work because they are mad or don't show up at all. The older associates are left to training and designating lunches, breaks and what areas need to be cleaned. So basically I ended up a supervisior without the raise. Oh and im sure my boss has taken money out of my check after i worked the hours. Make sure if your working here you write down every single day you worked."
bad,I really loved my job at Ross I had been there a little over a year. I enjoyed what I did there. Which was a variety of stuff. My favorite was cashiering. But I went to purchase one day and tried using my discount card it had times me out.
bad,"From my experience personally this is coming from a sps aka their loss prevention team. They had a total of like 5 of us and only kept one full time. I expressed numerous times I wanted to be full time, once the full time left the company I asked again and instead they brought in a transfer from another store who was full time instead of promoting within their store. Not to mention the low wages they pay and the ridiculous uniform they had us wear."
bad,"The best part about working at Ross was the discount. Management could have been a lot better. The absolute worst part about working there was the CPR rating and having to constantly shoo customers away to keep it up. I couldn't engage in any conversations because id either but messing up my CPR or my manager would yell at me. The most complaints I've gotten from both people in line and my register was because of the fact that we had to call the next guest while the person at our register hadn't even paid yet. Customer service is very important to me and working at Ross made me look like i was a rookie. Also your forced to rush elderly people as well and it just doesn't make you feel good."
bad,"The process of the job changes every day making it difficult to perform the job at hand. Management is weak, supervisors need to be more patient and able to answer questions. I had more questions then answers & that was a big problem for me. My coworkers were pretty cool. Some talked down to me but I over came that. Employee handbook was not up to date and some things stated were not true. Each department is different. They have you shadow different departments and sometimes it can be confusing."
bad,They gave me little hours and put me right to work without teaching me anything. They were not rude people it was just not worth it. Especially since the hours were inconsistent and the pay was low
bad,"Ross is a very hate or love it kind of company to work for depending on who you are working for (Management wise) , it is best for the person working or applying to ross to just go there do your job and go home."
bad,"It was a nice place to be and work at but everybody got very very little hours per week, besides certain employees. There was actually a time where I didn’t have any hours for about two weeks."
bad,"I was working for Ross as a seasonal part time employee. Figured I'd pick up extra cash for the holiday season. However, the managers made it increasingly impossible to enjoy your job. As soon as I clock into work. They're repeatedly telling me to clean up a certain section of the store. Keep in mind, I'm already working on a section but they're breathing down your throat to ensure you're being productive. Very young managers that don't have a clue about fairly treating their employees as human beings.  Finally I had enough of the micromanaging. I already have a full time job and coming into Ross makes the first gig feel like a cake walk. I HIGHLY suggest finding a p/t job elsewhere."
bad,"It seems they promote from within based on time spent with company rather than level of competence. "
bad,Part time employees would receive less than 24 hours a week. Sometimes I'd be scheduled 8 hours a week.Work was fast paced so shifts would go through quickly.
bad,I was with Ross for a few years. One of the years I ran the store as a manager for 8 months on an assistant managers salary. I had at least 3 new distict managers within the few years i was there. There were 3 different store managers as well. This company needs to restructure to acknowledge customers first and work on a solid management program.
bad,"inconsistent work hour"
bad,"Makes you a leader a times, we keep running through managers,needs a bigger stock room, fellow crew members made it worth sticking around, all an all a good place to for teenagers."
bad,i have been employed by ross dress for less and yes i can say its a secure job but i am ready to branch out to a more challenging job with a motivated environment.
bad,the job itself is easy but there is so little support from management and the hours are insane; i gave so much to this company and they never reciprocated
bad,"As a sales associate at Ross, My job was to greet and guide customers to help them make the best decisions possible when it came to interested them fashionably. "
bad,"Ross never informs you of when your last day may be working there if you are a seasonal team member."
bad,"The position itself wasn't bad however, I had issues with policies that felt like it prevented you from being effective.  As a Store Protection specialist, it was my job to prevent shortage, however, we were unable to give chase and only ""offer excellent customer service"".  This became frustrating as time went on as the company also doesn't prosecute when criminals get caught.  It felt like I was just a higher paid door greeter that gave out recognition cards to employees if they knew basic questions or followed the rules."
bad,"Company had high turn overs because there were no full time jobs available. Employees are not engaged, and would leave to work for a more reliable place."
bad,the managers never scheduled enough workers due to payroll. when the lines got busy there would only be 1 or 2 cashiers. customers would complain but there is nothing we could do. No matter how much you clean up the sales floor the clothes would go back looking a mess. Customers would have their kids running around unsupervised. Job could easily become stressful.
bad,If you do not do what they want you to do they will throw you on an Island by yourself and watch you fail until you're forced to quit. They will not fire you because it will ruin their reputation so instead they will make working hard for you. They will not pay you what you deserve and rush your work so they can save money and get you out as soon as possible.
bad,Would only recommend this job as a second job or for someone that is a student. The most hours you can get as a part timer is 25 a week. Seems like always understaffed which is a huge hindrance on the employees working.
bad,"Not the best place to work due to never being out on time. Workers either liked you or didn't talk to you. "
bad,"I enjoyed working here , not so much for the stability or salary but because It provided flexibility. I was able to work this job after my full time on evenings and weekends. I really enjoyed playing as a key team player and supporting my staff in pressured situations. Another key component that I really enjoyed was dealing with different people on a daily basis. I really liked to help people find what they were looking for see that they were over satisfied with my customer service"
bad,"I've worked with this company for a year and 6 months, never called out never was late. Covered shifts for those who called out. "
bad,I enjoyed working in customer service. The pay was not equal to the job required. They do not support trying to advance in the company. If you requested a day off they would cut you to 8 hours a week from 37 hours a week.
bad,A typical day at work required all the employees who are stock associates to maintain good quality customers at all time. Greets and responds to the customers in a timely manner. The co-workers are superb. They were great at team worker and very respectful. The hardest part of the job was failing
bad,"this is a good part time job"
bad,"My experience with Ross is that I like my coworkers, but everything else about the job is stressful and did not provide a lot of hours."
bad,"ROSS is built on the principle that if you keep your expectations for management high and your payroll low, you'll still turn out a profit when your teams fail. Each store operates in a sort of managed chaos that grinds through employees and managers at an unprecedented rate (Google ""ROSS Median Tenure"")."
bad,"it was a laid back environment, heavy work load, poor management, easy job for the most part, check bags coming in and out, secure dressing rooms pretty typical"
bad,My employees made work for Ross great. Being in management was not the best experience. I learned a lot about myself working for Ross but would not want to work there again
bad,"Ross Stores, inc is an off price retailer, and that is shown in our corporate environment as well by giving us more work than one person can handle and at a lower wage than our competitors."
bad,The store manager was very rude and unprofessional. She would put you down in front of customers and co-workers. The hours are absolutely terrible. Over working during holidays and any other time of the year you can receive 23 hours one week and 4 the next. UNRELIABLE.
bad,"I'm from California & I recently just moved to ATL Ga. I needed ANY job that would hire me A.S.A.P, just to have an extra income until I can find a career in my field of work (Health Information). The Management & the people I work with are really nice, helpful, funny, and cool people SERIOUSLY, they make work days less stressful because of their team work, theres no permanent set work schedule, the schedule changes every week. For ME I don't like that, I'd prefer a more stable set schedule. So unless your a teenager, and you want a after school job, ross wages SUCK!!!. I don't know who can survive off 7.25 in this world & part time(you have to start off part time), your being labor worked for a piece of change"
bad,i leartned how to be a fitness atentant.  management suck after u been then for three months or more they start treating you badly and cutting your hours hella sahort also cant have more then 25 hours bcuz then ur full ntime i enjoy most is helping the customers
bad,"The co-workers at Ross that are not part of management team are great people to work. They do feel as if they are treated unfairly and are overworked. The management there is not very good. They try to say it is all about team, and working together but that is not it at all. I enjoyed it there at first until things started to settle in and then the true side showed. Unfortunately I don't think it is a good place to work."
bad,I am not sure if it's because of the type of store or if it was management but it was always to unorganized and hectic here.
bad,co-workers are the best they just don't stay to long.
bad,"Your availability is set to your standards and you can change it as much as you need to, so working hours are very flexible. However, if you haven't been working there for more than three years, it is made very clear you are not a valued team member."
bad,"It was very difficult to talk to other people I worked with cause of a certain time we had to get everything done. But it was good because you never had to wait for someone to be done, you just had to worry about yourself."
bad,Always under staffed and not much to do in some areas. The people were good to work with but the environment was ok most of the time. The pay was also bad.
bad,Staffing seemed nice at first. Very disorganized. Always last minute calls to come in. Hardly any training. Very fast paced at the check out station. On feet all day.
bad,Ross is an amazing please they just need a different manager that actually helps the employees and doesn't set in the office until she leaves. They need a more hands on manager.
bad,"If the manager does not like you she will do every thing she can to make your life miserable.  The moral at the store at this time is at the very low.  This is due to management change, the store has gone down hill in the last year and I feel it will only get worse. I feel the company is racist towards the white who are still there and trust me there are not that many."
bad,"Short with cashiers, worked late hours. one of the assistant managers is very rude and didn’t help at all. very stressful. Most of the workers are fake and talk about everyone behind their back ."
bad,"Commutable to living areas, tyrone mall and other major facilities. Great store discounts, great employees. Management not so well. Great recommendation for first time job seekers."
bad,I would say they need better people working at the front desk they are rude and always on there phone . They make you feel unwelcome and makes you feel like they don’t want you to work there .
bad,Ross hired me with no experience and trained me in several different positions. I have had several promotions over the years. These were both lateral and financial.
bad,"This person use intimidation to get his goals."
bad,"The store I worked for was always busy, and we NEVER had enough staff. It’s rare to get your scheduled breaks and lunches . It can get crazy busy in the fitting rooms, but they refuse to have 2 people working back there. The job doesn’t pay enough for what employees really do ."
bad,"Stocking shifts were early morning where I worked and went to whenever the team finished putting all products on the sales floor. However, this could be a bad thing if you are the only one putting 100% into getting everything done that day, because with my experience most staff members would slow down when it came to the stocking part. I had to work longer shifts because all the stock was not placed on the floor or because the other staff members were lazy. Although I mentioned this to my manager, it didn't seem to make a difference."
bad,"My job here started off good and I actually really like the company. I'm not sure how other Ross stores are run but I am truly disappointed in the one i worked at. I worked in the stockroom. I was told the position was weekdays and an occasional weekend. That my hours would be about 5:45 am to 11:30 or 12:00 pm. This was a part time position at $11 an hour. Also being a full time student and taking care of a sick family member these were perfect hours that would allow me to afford my bills. During the opening of our store I was trained the first day in the stockroom, all of us did. After that the manager kept putting me in the front to just sit and watch the doors so as everyone else was being trained I did nothing. After the first month everything declined. I would get called to not come in the truck was cancelled or it wasn't a big truck. I went from 10 hours a shift to 3.5. One time I only worked one day so my paycheck was $33; which became a more frequent thing. I wasn't the only stock room associate who this happened to either.  Apparently if you come to work smelling like marijuana, cuss and say the N word in front of the stockroom leader, text, and listen to crude niki Minaj music you will get more hours than the hard workers. Ross seems like a great company,but I would not recommend working at any of them in New Mexico. I am grateful for the opportunity they gave me but I simply can not live on $33 a check."
bad,Its good for newbies.. High School Grads or College students..only part- time available. Very flexible times for students with more then 1 job or classes.
bad,"Constantly under-staffed, mangers act as if they are children only looking out for themselves instead of what is best needed for the business. As the front end supervisor I experienced working by myself to maintain excessively long lines and constantly butting heads with management over needing help to make sure customers have a fast and friendly checkout experience. The store was a constant mess and management had a really bad habit of throwing others under the bus for their shortcomings."
bad,"Short hours, but they ask you to stay a lot. The management really makes it, when I first started, everything was great, but when we got a new store manager, everything went down hill pretty fast."
bad,"While employed at Ross, I Handled customer assistance involving the fitting room with organized clothing and products, performed duties in the company stock room involving store products, and "
bad,"The comradery between associates is probably the only thing that keeps everyone from breaking down from this high demanding job. The moment you arrive your percentage scores on how fast you scan and bag will be announced. If you do poorly be prepared to feel the pressure and shame for how badly you did. When you get sent off to do your job, be ready to be pulled around all over the place because there is typically not enough trained employees on the floor to help. Not to mention the ongoing requests of covering others' shifts then getting sent on a guilt trip if you say no however if you say yes, do not expect to gain any more respect as a dependent worker. Overall this is a soul sucking job that one should only take as a last resort (or if you're a robot). Welcome to Retail! (:"
bad,"First, they never trained me. Then, they would complain and watch me work and correct me. The next day, they would do the same and correct something that they originally told me to do. You never got your breaks on time or full-time lunch breaks. They never trust you and overwork you."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Ross for the most part... being promoted twice within a year of employment was exciting. However, when I took over my new position I was informed that I would not be receiving the two weeks of training that everyone else else got. Then when I didn't know what to do in certain situations I was told I needed to figure it out myself. The manager was helpful at times, but other times I was almost afraid to ask for help."
bad,What I loved most about this job is that you can learn a lot if you are interested. there is many opportunities to get promoted. The down fall is that if you become full time you have to have open availability.
bad,I feel they are unorganized when it comes down to in packing the truck they do not have enough people and then want people to stay but the people that stay dont get over time
bad,"Fitting Room "
bad,Ross is not too bad of a place to work at. The training sucked as I got little to no training and only worked 4 hours 2 days a week. The manager expected so much with little of training.
bad,I worked here in college and it is a good gig for some extra cash when competing school. It is pretty laid back but not something I would see myself doing in the long run.
bad,"Ross was a great temp job for when there was not a lot of options. The economy was down, I was in college, and they were kind enough to work with my college schedule."
bad,management is terrible. almost everyone at this ross would rather take things personally and do not act professionally the majority of the time. schedule always messed up and understaffed on the busiest nights of the week.
bad,working at ross wasn't a great experience. a tiring job and not many people who will help you when your new and confused. best part was interacting with varies different people.
bad,Many cultures in the facility. The new employees needs better trainers and training.The training period is 3 days and the expectation are to great for those days.
bad,this is a place that only people that love to have passion for this job so to those that like to work as cashers this is a great job for them you would love the customers are loving and caring if you love your job you will have loyal customers..
bad,I enjoyed working with the employees and the discount we get but it wasn't for me. I mean I felt like I was the customers maids. They purposely do things knowing its our job.
bad,place is always dirty and the expect employees to clean up within an hour or less. management doesn't handle problems accordingly. they don't know how to schedule employees and of course customers and very rude and nasty.
bad,It was ok just really tiring I was working nights but I was still one of the fastest people there and I didn't really get much sleep near the end but I must move that's why I'm quitting
bad,There was always drama and the manager at the time would have emotional swings. One day she would be mad at you for no reason other days you were her favorite employee
bad,"It’s ok to work at ross, but you don’t get promoted and they require you to do so much for not enough pay your basically not moving up in the company and that’s what I don’t like about it."
bad,"A typical day at work as a cashier consists of staying at register for 4 - 5 hours at a time (maybe longer) before taking a break, due to the lack of cashiers and abundance of customers. You're expected to be able to come in whenever, even on days off, even on days you normally can't work. You will also be asked to stay behind often due to the lack of cashiers, and potential call-outs. Store is often dirty both from a lack of organization and poor shoppers. When closing, either during the week or weekend, you are expected to stay potentially an hour or more after closing time (closes 12:30 AM weekdays, 1:00 weekends) to help clean up the store. This is in contrast of their previous, earlier closing times of 12:00 and 10:30."
bad,"I recently started working as a stocker in the back; unloading daily truck, organizing, stocking, tagging. At first, I thought I'd really like it. It worked well with my other work schedule. I was available to work 24 hours a week, which management happily gave me because all positions in the store were SEVERELY understaffed. But after my first week, I quit today. It was definitely not worth my pay of $9 an hour. Had I been working up front as a cashier, yeah $9 an hour isn't too bad. But being in the back was too much. Being there for 6am to unload the truck of big boxes almost as tall as me and as wide as me. The store was very disorganized... the night crew didn't organize their areas for the following day shift, making it difficult for me (and I'm sure other morning crew employees) to confidently put away the new items received. I'm not sure what I feel is a fair wage for the stockers in the back, but it's DEFINITELY not $9 an hour..."
bad,You have to be very fast paced because they time you. The people who have been there for a while train you very well. I learned how to use the register in less than a day. Great experience.
bad,"you would be be given multiple boxes of clothes and would have to unwrap them, put security tags on them, size tags, and hang them and they expected you to have 10 full boxes done in 4 hours."
bad,Ross is very fast pace due to being located in one of the busiest mall's in Jacksonville; St. John's Town Center.  It's basically hard fast-paced work for little pay. Great job for high school and college students.
bad,"A Typical Day At Work Very Busy, You Meet Alot Of Different People, Fast Paced, Great Learning Experience, Training New Associates, Being A Team Leader"
bad,Not much hours after holidays. Its wasnt really that fun only writing this to so I cant go on to next step. It wont let me go on without saying something about ross.
bad,would change schedule every day and wouldn't let everyone work if you weren't working the day they change it you wouldn't find out they did til you had to show up to work and you weren't on the schedule
bad,If you are looking for a temp job or part time job its great. but if you are looking for something to live off of then this isnt the job for you. they give you as little hours as possible so they dont have to give you health care
bad,Keep a watchful eye when it comes to supervisors and or management!  I never had a problem with Ross until I relocated to Rock Hill. The supervisor and management are always assuming things about there eployees
bad,Always asked to do Overtime and do all odd jobs. Way too much work to be paid 11$ an hour. Ridiculous hours. Expecting to be up at 4am shift even though i asked for a change.
bad,"At Ross it was very tough to work. The management was very sloppy and disorganized. What I learned here was to go the extra mile. The reason is because not much team work was involved and many workers were employed there. So an employee here my help was very much needed. When they needed someone last minute I would go, if they needed someone to stay late it was me, and I always stayed until my work as completed."
bad,"Enjoyed working as a Cashier in a busy store"
bad,You walk into the building there is only one cashier. there is always a huge line. the store is a mess and the store manager is so rude. you can be the best employee but if you call in sick one day she goes and cuts your hours and is nasty to you. This place is horrible.
bad,the managers don't want you to really help customers they complain if an area is dirty even though the customers keep messing the area up. these managers want you to be in two areas at once. they mostly stay upstairs where they are mostly never seen but they come downstairs to make a routine walk around the store
bad,Typical day is clocking in and opening up your register while being all over the place and stocking multiple departments on your floor as well as handling returns and purchasing and moving to fitting rooms and making sure everything looks neat and organized. Very VERY fast paced and the best work is expected. The benefits are there. Constantly quizzed on security questions twice a day from loss prevention so it's like school. The hardest part is keeping everything in order when theres people constantly misplacing things but the most enjoyable is giving people great service in such a hectic place.
bad,Not a place I recommend working for the management does not work well with the employees they don't give courtesy calls when they change your schedule and the hours are bad.
bad,"•	Customer Service"
bad,Customer service and stock. It's a company were you meet some unique people. At the company you learn a lot of different things. They work with your schedule.
bad,"co workers were okay, fast paced warehouse, pay should be raised more due to all of the hard manuel labor, work hours fly by due to always being busy."
bad,While working here I learned many different things about the retail world. I got the chance to work with people from all walks of life. As a cashier I had the opportunity to learn many necessary skills in customer service.
bad,"I have worked for Ross for 3 years now, seen good management and bad management (which I am currently under.) it took over two years of hard-work before I was offered the management position, but I was in school at the time so i had to turn it down."
bad,Some days are better than others. Management sucks. Co-workers are lazy and not very team oriented. Enjoyed my break. Learned nothing from this job. Dealing with customers was the hardest part
bad,It is a nice place to work when it comes to customer service and stocking shelves. I learned a lot about how things work in a retail environment and how to please customers.
bad,Topical day always busy but can be fun with the right people lots to do so not very hard to get bored plus shop while you work co works are the best we are like family we help each other out hardest part about the Job being on your feet for long periods of time and the most enjoyable part is the people
bad,"Very predictable days and weeks. Standardized ways of doing things, that is good when you are starting to learn but gets stale when you are ready for the next step."
bad,It is an okay place to work. alot of responsibility for the same pay as other. typical day at work for me is getting there making sure the front is cleaning making sure everyones taking their breaks and recovering everything that needs recovery
bad,A typical day consist of arriving to work at exactly 5:45 am and i usually stay up until 11:15. My job was to unbox merchandise and bring them out to their rightful spots on the sales floor. The management is not always the best due to the fact that they dont really take the workers ANYTHING into consideration.
bad,"Easy work. But only allow up to 25 hours per week. Usually fun atmosphere to work in. Pretty flexible with scheduling. I only worked in the stock room, and on the floor. Never as a cashier. I enjoyed my job."
bad,"They did not train well, they leave you on your own, they do not schedule you good hours, the employees only speak negatively about their Ross experience, they did not accept my calendar that I made with my school schedule and dance, since I am still in high school. The store is very messy, all over the place. The ladies gossip all the time."
bad,"Most mornings are slow but always great customers. The store manager is fantastic but some assistant managers are not on the same page and are very ignorant or rude. my coworkers are great and are friendly with the costumers. The hardest part of the day is dealing with rude costumers, yet I enjoy having fun talks with customers and coworkers."
bad,I loved working with apparel but the management and coworkers I had issues with. They were rude and disrespectful towards other employees and customers.
bad,My store manager was very inappropriate. The store was falling apart I was getting sick every week from being there. The fellow sales advisors were like mentors and were optimistic like I was before people started quitting. I left because I needed more hours and better salary.
bad,Working with people is something that I love and am good at. I've gotten complements and love working as a team. worked in the back up front mainly on the register one on one with customers.
bad,Is accountable for delivering on all aspects of stockroom ... multiple tasks and work in a fast paced and deadline-oriented environment.
bad,"It was boring working there and I'm the kind of person that needs to constantly be doing something if I'm being paid to be there. Hardly made any money at all. I always closed too (7-11pm) even though I asked for different hours. Not cool being a high school student at the time. Needless to say, I'm never working retail again."
bad,Ross was a great place to work. The customers were amazing and some co-workers were great but the company was expanding too quickly and did not properly train management. The policy and procedures worked well for the company as did the product. The pay was decent. However lack of management experience caused the employees to be less dedicated or disciplined.
bad,"Not an easy job, very demanding and extremely fast pace. A lot of unresolved issues and was not allowed to help guests the way I felt they deserved."
bad,employees dont get paid well and you see it with a very high turnover rate. managers can be fun but they want to save their skin most of the time and will throw you under the bus if something is wrong. district managers dont care about your degree or tenure at the company. they will get rid of you if they dont like you. be ready to not have a life if you work here as it occupies most of your time.
bad,Ross is a fast paced environment that requires the ability to multi task and plan. There is a lot of heavy workload that is realistic in completion.
bad,"The people I worked with are amazing, hard-working people; I am still close friends with some of them. However, the Ross company as a whole, has some problems they need to work out."
bad,Every year there was a new store manager that liked to do things their own way which made for a less productive and steady-flowing store. Assignments given were unclear and working environment was sometimes hectic. Hours are not guaranteed. Management is flexible with your personal schedule.
bad,"company is extremely unorganized, only hires part-time at minimum wage."
bad,"greeted customers during entire shift. management had very poor attitudes, co-workers were friendly. hardest part of the job was standing in one place and dealing with the boredom. Not a very enjoyable job at all."
bad,"Management was very reasonble"
bad,So risk-averse they create the very issues they were trying to avoid.
bad,"hardest part of the job was being disrespected and talked down to by the District manager and being an area supervisor that had to do the jobs of the assistant manager and other fellow area supervisors. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers and being on register, executing a fast and efficient scan and bag.Co workers could have been a little more positive."
bad,good for part time not for moving up in the companyklllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
bad,"•	Keep the store organized, by picking clothing off the floors, reorganizing the shoes, and grouping together similar items"
bad,"Just do what you need to do to get the job done.Also, you get to meet new people that come into the store.There is times you have your regulars that also come in."
bad,"My first warehouse experience, and wasn't too good at it, but this company is okay for a start. I wouldn't suggest it to anybody unless they want a step into the warehouse field."
bad,"Imagine coming to work in a good mood and leaving in a horrible one every single day. The work itself is not hard. It's the customers and people higher up who complicate things. The standard is to provide the best customer experience, but it's extremely hard when you know a customer has stolen something and is trying to return it or is just flat out rude or wrong. And this happens a lot."
bad,"My skills far exceed working in the several positions I do in ROSS, Inc.  After caring for my elderly father for a year full time, getting back into the workforce was stressful & discouraging.  ROSS was available.  I am trying to get back my dignity in working in a permanent position with a rewarding company.  Although, since I have been working for ROSS for two years now, I can say, getting this job was a relief, since it took so long to get it.  The job market has been challenging.  I wish to be an essential part with an organization that needs me as much as I need them."
bad,"Ross was not well maintained or organized, a lot of times management did not know who was scheduled who was doing what. which made it hard for employees too stay on task."
bad,"The managers constantly had wires crossed and rarely communicate with each other. Typically, associates are responsible for several departments which leaves very little time for everyday tasks, especially when stationed in the fitting room. Co-workers formed clicks, gossiped, and often upset other co-workers. The hardest part about working at Ross is being told one thing by one manager or supervisor and then having everything switched on you. Honestly, there were no real enjoyable moments. The staff is over-worked, under payed, and under staffed for high volume times."
bad,Rushed and crowded store. My duties consisted in tending the register and securing the merchandise from theft. The Chula Vista store on Palomar street is always busy.
bad,"Ross has a very unorganized method to manage their products. Too much time is has to be spent when minimal changes could solve the problem. My experience with management was that if you didn't play along with their absurd decisions and poor treatment of employees, you had no future to move up in the company."
bad,I have worked at two different stores and the way the store works and looks really depends on the employes and managers.
bad,I would go to the truck un load our item and stock the floors. I would use customer service skills at the cashier
bad,At this job there is no advancement unless the manager will benefit in some way from you attaining that position.  Coworkers were hostile.  You receive little praise for a job well done and miss many breaks that never get redeemed.  Occasionally you would get treated to food/drinks if the manager wanted something. 
bad,Like working with guest. like working days. was expected to do work even when i was the only cashier made it hard to get anything done when i didnt have backup
bad,Ross has given me the security experience I need to move on to a better career.
bad,giving top quality customer service and keeping the store tidy
bad,not much to say but it didnt work out for me. I wasnt happy with the management in the store I worked for.
bad,very flexible with your schedule. pay sucks if this place paid better i probably would have actually enjoyed living there.
bad,"Sad to say, there is not one day that went by that I did NOT want to come into work. I am always a well punctual, hard working employee that does what he is told with no hesitation. The co-workers are hard workers and do their job well. Management could have been WAY better if the company had given the store someone who can provide BETTER management. What I enjoyed about working here is that I am able to use my customer service skills in assisting customers in any way possible, according to company guidelines and policy of course."
bad,"I started at Ross and loved everyone I worked with. Its a super fun place to work and everyone is so nice, even the mangers. But i was promised 20-30 hours a week which is awesome and I've been working there for 2 months and have only gotten 20 hours 1 week the rest of the weeks I was dropped down to 12 and then even farther down to 8 which is where I am now. And I'm certainly not happy about it. I need a new job badly I love the company I am just not making enough money to pay my bills. we recently had a roommate abandon us with the almost $1000 a month rent so now my rent is $300 a month and that does not include water electric or anything. I just need a new job not ROSS."
bad,"Although I was employed with this company in different states at different periods in my life, I was displeased with the amount of growth opportunities they provide."
bad,"Its an okay place to work for someone that's not looking for an career, that's not looking to move up in the company, for a person that's down to wasting there time. Things that I love about the job they know how to keep you busy, and working hard, and keeping my customer vary happy ALWAYS PUTS A SMILE ON MY FACE!"
bad,"The store is always busy, so your never bored. There are many times that I'm on the register without moving from the time I clocked in, until it's time to clock out. So I like the fact that it keeps me busy and always moving."
bad,Ross is understaffed for the bsiness that is required. Management is constantly helping the jobs that hourly associates are hired for.Advancement is almost impossible due to lack of training on behalf of senior managers.
bad,"It can be a really fun job but also physically really taxing job to work for. It is a great company to move up fast in and gain experience. I would highly recommend it for someone who just got out of high school and is looking for a job that can support them and gain experience while they go to school or to get a better job. The hardest part of the job would probably be the customers, they can be very rude. The most enjoyable part of the job is the other employees. Everybody there is friendly and make you feel welcome."
bad,"Ross is different in so many ways of every place I've ever worked. Ross cares more about you being fast than the quality of the customers experience. You are timed on the registers and all employee scores are displayed and ranked for all to see, changed every week. If your scores are not up to par you do not get many hours. I was hired at part time but was told that if I answered my phone I could get full time hours no problem. That is a lie. If you go to work there you want to be in the stock room, it is a more laid back ,fun environment and most stock room workers are full time and get benefits."
bad,"A stressful environment to work in.  Not paid enough for the amount of stuff you do and stress you go through. The people overall are great though, just a terrible work environment."
bad,"Pros: good if you need flexible days/hours."
bad,"Really great opportunities for job advancement with this company BUT that is because of high turnover with management. Ross works on low payroll in order to keep prices low for customers but most times the workload is extremely high while payroll for labor is low. It gets to the point where it is unrealistic and management cannot do their job because they are forced to pick up the slack in other areas. Store hours are late, often open until midnight or later which makes for a rough work/life balance."
bad,Work goes unnoticed must know the right people in order to advance up to a better position. A lot of drama and messy people. Young people not enough older people.
bad,"The workplace is nice , my fellow very friendly high concept have a customer service and supervisors enough accessible to help and support when needed . There areas of opportunity to grow in the company"
bad,"A typical day at work would look like, getting all my job duties done while in-between waiting on customers. Those duties would have been; keeping up with the salad bar, restocking all the salad items, making sure there was clean dishes ready for use. When I would wait on customers, I give them a couple minutes for them to choose what they wanted to eat, I'd then take their order, while making good eye contact with each individual and keeping small friendly conversation. As soon as I got their orders, I placed it in the computer, and continue to care for my table for any needs they needed met. I learned team work with working with my co workers, I loved the management, everyone I worked with was always happy to help in any given situation. The hardest part about my job was always having to keep a smile on my face even when I would have rude customers. My favorite part about my job was working in a team work environment."
bad,"Sometimes in your life, you work a job that makes you do so little that you actually realize that you couldn't do ""nothing"" for the rest of your life; or any amount of time."
bad,"A tipical day at Ross was very diffrent each day. Some days I was assigned to work cashier, or a diffrent department assisting and greeting customers along with making sure my department was precentable and clean. For the most part I was placed in the jewelry department or register."
bad,"a typical day at ross was always very busy but keeping busy is something i like to do. The managers were very responsible and payed attention to their workers needs, my co workers were of all ages but all easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was the late nights since i went to school in the mornings, i enjoyed my job because i like working with people as a team and with customers and helping them find what they need."
bad,"Managers do NOTHING, those who are hard workers are the same ones that they push to get work done on a daily base. Store Manager is not one you want to work for. If everyone was treated equal it would be a fun place to work."
bad,"Although the hours are flexible, the work is harsh and unfair. If you don’t stand up for yourself, they’ll push you around. Being strong, mentally, is something that is a necessity."
bad,"A lot of people only work here for the discounts, which are amazing! Working here isn't so bad. It gets stressful when they are short-staffed and you are rushed to do not only your job, but the job of other people as well. Also! If they see that you are a hard worker, they will take advantage of you and make you do way more than the average employee. I've worked at two different locations now, and it is the same. Work culture is okay. The busier the store, the more drama encountered, between management and team members. We earn ""parties"" sometimes. It's basically just some cheap, off-brand snacks that they put in the break room once in a blue moon. "
bad,"Fast paced, hard working team...not so good on the management part but, besides that... AWSOME! PLACE TO WORK.  Great supporting co-workers, team leaders."
bad,"The people I worked worh made being there bearable but other than that, working there was stressful. We never had enough people working, SPS were always quiting, half the management  team quit. I was a supervisor, I rarely got my breaks and lunches I was always running around doing everything. I never had enough people so the store would end up being a mess which made customers mad and complain.  I did not get paid enough for what I had to deal with."
bad,"Great if you enjoy a fast paced work environment, they greatly work with your schedule, but it can be difficult to move up in positions. If you need more than a few extra dollars to help you out this may not be a place for you as they majorly hire part time employees that only receive 4 hours of work per week."
bad,Ross makes you work super hard and does not pay you enough for it. You have to do the job of two associates and they don't have a good work-life balance.
bad,"Work in the stockroom. Restock. Label. Help customers. Love the co-workers. Very poor hours. Hot in the stockroom. I learned how to label the shoes, purses, luggage, etc."
bad,the most enjoyable part was the other employees and the benefits were available. the hours were steady. the pay raises wiere minimal if at all
bad,"Typical day at Ross, recovering store, ringing up people."
bad,"Working in the fitting room, I was exposed to loss prevention techniques and customer service. I hated picking up after the customers. I had confrontations with many of a customer."
bad,"It wasn't so bad working here, got along with everyone, Didn't work late shifts often. It can be stressful at times but not all the time. Good management. Hard working workers"
bad,Everything was going great with me job. When I told them that I cant would late hours. Cuz my husband was getting deployed they said that they cant change it for me. But when they hire me them told that they would work with me.
bad,"Start the day greatting the costumers."
bad,"I learn so much about working with people its a good experience,the hardest past i don't like when other bother me to much,the most enjoyable is when they always telling me that I am a cool person and meet friends,people."
bad,The managers here are all awesome. There is always either mandatory overtime or voluntary time off because there's not enough work.  Most days the manager doesn't even know how much work the department will have and some weeks the whole warehouse will be shut down for a day or 2 because there's not enough work. There is only 1 30 min lunch break even if you have to work an extra hour. So imagine going 6 hours until you take a break. Some days it's okay and some days it's not.  Every department also works based on production so you can get production bonuses every week which is extremely easy to obtain.
bad,"HR department is pretty terrible and disrespectful ."
bad,The only problem that I really had at this job is that they don't give me enough hours at all. And then I am the person with the lowest amount of hours on the schedule and every other day I get a call saying not to come in because the payroll is messed up. I was only getting 10hrs a week
bad,"work with computer receiving   merchandise ,"
bad,"loved working there it was fun and a great experience, got to meet new people . got to interact with people alot. and overall just had a blast."
bad,helping new customer its pretty nice. managers are nice but need more experience also coworkers are nice to work with. typical day there it was just to maintain the customer happy.
bad,a typical day of work. what i learned. management. workplace culture. the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job. Great company to be employed by
good,"Management there makes it hard to be happy in the work place. A lot of drama in which management is right in the middle of things. From a customers point of view, lines move slowly because employees are having conversations at check out time."
good,Want let you get close to 40 hrs and scheduleing is not fair they don't care if you have kids its hard to get full time hrs unless your management even then its only 35hrs the company worry about security cameras on the employees instead of the customers didn't feel safe at all no loss prevention at certain locations
good,The Ross i was hired at was always a mess. Management was always unaware of what was going on and the scheduler was always out of order. I personally would only recommend this job if you couldn't find one
good,Everything was great until I was fired for no reason and all of the employees but a few turned out to be two faced snakes. They dont care about their staff in the topeka location so I can only imagine what the others would be like. Maybe a new store manager is what the place needs.
good,"You will be doing everything and on your feet the whole time , cashier sucks its timed . the stores are busy and always get messy. "
good,"This place is a relaxed place to work, with flexible hours. The problem is the people that shop there, they make it a horrible place to work. Too many ignorant people."
good,Ross was a descent place to work until they changed management. It is very clickish and everybody cares about themselves. No team atmosphere.Pay is below average also.
good,take advantage of worker low opurtunties to progress no stable schedule and mangers are demanding for no return employees are expected to complete crazy amounts of work and are always offers poo hours
good,Like most retail stores there are favorites and unfairness in this location. Most employees are unfriendly and set in their ways. Management also shows no interest in correcting the situation.
good,"Poor employee focus, limited advance in career"
good,Bad choice in hiring managers for payroll benefits. They use good employees to do managment work without having to pay more or offer benefits
good,"Most of my co-workers were rude and made me feel uncomfortable. A typical work day was easy and went by fast. I sorted boxes, merchandise, and bubble wrapped."
good,"Greeted and responded to all customers in a courteous and friendly manner. "
good,My day at work began at 2:30 clock in and start identifying merchandise. I learned how to give a brief visual description of product to the best of my ability. My co worker was down to earth and friendly. The hardest part of my job was dividing receiving merchandise individually because i had to open new description labels and give each piece a different name. The most enjoyable part was doing my job making sure everything was done on time and correctly.
good,My co-workers are the best! Very polite and easy to work with.
good,"They refused to let me sit while i was working in the fitting room, and would not let me have a bottle of water unless i brought a doctors note in. They also made me run back and fourth sorting bras and under ware and if the phone rang i would have to rush to get it before the second ring."
good,"My Typical day at ross was a surprise, i never had stable hours. Ross was always slow , i understand warehouses are on and off with hours and time, but i wasnt satisfied with working there. My learning experience was fine , i learned what i was hired for and i was also moved to different stations."
good,storers tend to be overly messy and its cleaning it up is not a number one priority.
good,"Typical daily duties included organizing departments and maintaining an approachable friendly attitude for customers. Answering questions and offering quality customer service was mandatory. During my time with Ross I learned how to manage stressful situations while keeping poise and be aware of my surrounding as we were also responsible for loss prevention. The downside of the company was management, lack of attention to employee concerns and had problems with being flexible regarding scheduling for those who were students."
good,The managers picked favorites & made that very clear. The schedule changed without employees knowing numerous times. The breaks & lunches were never managed so some people had to sacrifice one or the other. They expected way too much for how little they payed.
good,"Loved working for the company but the management was unorganized, the current manager is belittling, rude, and harasses her employees on stepping don from their positions/ titles. The customers are wonderful and polite when they are treated and taken care of with respect as they should always have, the current manager does not know how to do that."
good,"Ross is a fortune five company, but don’t pay employees nearly enough to survive , working in retail is challenging, but is not enough to survive on, I’ve been in customer service for over 20yrs"
good,Honestly some of my co-workers made the job easier to get by. The location i was at was all over the place and there was a lot of favorites. Sometimes they'd take you off schedule and not even tell you. They also would send you home early because they're over payroll! How can you take hours away from people when they were scheduled
good,It was an ok job If your in high school with no real bills to pay. The people there were ok and friendly. You were not allowed to work over 30hrs. Like I said it's only good for a part time job and if you have no big bills to pay.
good,"I like the job because it has flexibility hours, but I didn’t  like that the team don’t work together and no one follows the rules. For me it was a really toxic place to work."
good,"Management could care less about policy if the customer is demanding enough, no matter if it makes you look like a fool when you already told the customer the RIGHT thing. They promise more hours but give you 9 for the whole week, barely enough to pay a car payment at the end of the month. They treat you like you're below them and then expet you to go above and beyond with your performance at work. There's almost always only one cashier and a line out the back of the store."
good,"Very high turnover rate. Poor management and communication. Hard to get the hours you need and never a consistent schedule. No benefits, minimum wage."
good,The new management is HORRIBLE they don’t know how to be “team players” and pick favorites. If you go to them about someone they like with a complaint they completely ignore at and make you seem like you’re in the wrong ! Was here for 2 years and worst job I EVER worked at!
good,"It was okay starting out. Managers didn't really care about worker/customer relationships. Lots of people called out during the week. It was stressful at most times, but the pay might make up for it if you don't care about being heard."
good,Working at Ross was a great experience it taught me alot about managing people and my feelings It also made me more responsible and reliable. It was my first job that i had to manage more than 6 people at a time.
good,"Never would work with this company again , unporfessional management , horrible work hours no consideration for scheduling , pay wasn't worth with it and no sick pay"
good,"stocking new merchandise, helping customers, performing transactions, operating a cash register. answer phone calls from customers, always busy even in non holidays."
good,"Managers would call me (sometimes multiple times a day) to change my schedule for the day as late as three hours before my shifts. Despite the management not being competent, my coworkers were great, and we really worked as a team to keep the store tidy."
good,"el trato de los encargados no es bueno"
good,Stores are open to late. Holiday hours are ridiculous. Turn and burn management. Claim to foster an environment of development and caring but its not true. Pay is low. Not enough payroll to run store properly.
good,Company is too lean but profitable. Company would operate a 30k building with only 4 people. Manager was jack of all trades and was ultimately responsible for all things in the building.
good,"It's very fast paced, so if you're not quick the customers will eat you alive. Sometimes they cut your hours while you show up to work, instead of calling you which is annoying. but yet they expect you not to call out."
good,"More people were concerned about drama than work. Also they dont have a Medical leave act in place if you need it. Scheduling is horrible, and there is no over time available. The pay rate is low and not acceptable to make a living off of."
good,Worked the cash register if you were not fast enough they would put you on the floor didn't allow sufficient time to gt use to the register. I was great at getting the product to the floor in a good amount of time.
good,Horrible place to work. They have no care for their employees! Only one thirty minute break all day; horrible pay. Always having mandatory overtime. Doesn't care if your sick or have a illness they do no excuse it! You have to meet a certain percentage or you're fired
good,typical day at work clock in and go to your areas and start your job.. the best part about the job is meeting new people. work is always the same. management some are nice and some not so.
good,"Ross is a faced-paced retail job if that's what you're looking for. However, they don't pay you enough to work as hard as you do. Probably 95% of employees are still part-time, after working there for YEARS. You don't get pay raises and management advancement is unlikely."
good,"I liked working at Ross because your always busy but, the pay isnt great for the work you do. Example: I was a front end supervisor and never received a raise."
good,management and co-workers were not enjoyable to work with/for. store didn't stay tidy because not all co-workers did their share of the duties. management was not always professional and showed favoritism.
good,The Manager is extremely rude and don't listen to her employees. She yells with employees in the middle of the store. Everybody in the store is afraid of her.
good,"I LOVED working for Ross at first, but the company itself is corrupt. They dont even  follow there own policys. I was a very credible worker, moved up to area supervisor in less than a year and they let me go over a simple mistake after i closed a high volume store, short staffed, for a whole weekend. A mistake that i had never made before, my register was always on the dollar, never over, never under. "
good,"Low pay, no advancement, one break for lunch then stand the entire shift, hours vary, some 6 day work week, bad management"
good,"managers have favorites, never enough staff to close. when you call off managers tell everyone your business."
good,"I did my job to the best of my ability at the Ross Distribution Center in Moreno Valley, CA. However, with the company giving breaks that were too short to consider the distance between the work areas and the break rooms (the breaks were fifteen minutes, but it would take eight to make the full walk), as well as supervisors and management that refused to work with employees, and exhausting work conditions, it wasn't very pleasant. However, I would have stayed if it weren't for the company laying me off."
good,"stock team lead, i do inventory from truck process it and display on the floor"
good,"Too much gossip and an unethical work environment. Anybody and everybody does what they please, including management."
good,"Fast days, No advancement opportunities, very low pay for the job."
good,Hardest time was when your child is sick and your manager say you cant leave.
good,"Overall great environment for boosting your cash handling and customer service experience. At my location, there wasn't much room for advancement. Flexible schedule."
good,"Not enough hours, Rude Customers always bringing stuff back with 10 different receipts."
good,"They stopped giving me hours as a whole without reasoning. I'd call to ask when I work next and store manager would tell me ""I don't know, I don't memorize schedules."" They didn't give me work for over a month so I quit. Overall, just don't work there."
good,"Everyone was so lifeless but fast paced, which made it tolerable because at least it was productive. I didn't love standing up all day but I had conversations with people all day long so it balanced out"
good,"Ross is simply out for Ross where as you are just a number. If the management decides they don't like you for whatever reason (even if it is your supervisor feels like their job is threatened by your outstanding performance) they will find a reason to get rid of you. Ross truly wants mindless robots that work simply to meet or exceed their goals. If you have any ideas on how to better the system, this isn't the place for you."
good,The pay would have been fine if they gave hours. My manager also was more biased and  Favored spanish speaking employees better. I am black and speak little to no spanish so I suffered.
good,Even as a temporary job it was like being used for a while for a back up only 8 hrs a week it was horrible and then they let you go after the season their is no opportunity to stay with them even after the season 8 hrs a pay doesn't pay my bills
good,"Management doesnt care about their associates and isnt very friendly. Hours are given to those that they like most and the associates, especially the older ones, gossip alot about everyone"
good,"A typical day at Ross would start when you first enter the store. as far as thee eye can see, a massive line of people staring at you and your Ross outfit and name tag with malice. The first thing that is uttered at me by a manager is to quickly clock on and grab a cash register to help ease the massive line. Every time I go to the backroom to drop off my stuff, I see three managers hanging out. Up until my lunch break, the line is still massive. By the time you get back from lunch, the line is still there waiting for you. randomly, my manager will ask me to go clean a certain area, even though the line is still massive and three of your managers are still hanging out in the backroom. The most enjoyable part of working at Ross was seeing and meeting the costumers.."
good,"I learned a lot about being a supervisor,manager . Multitasking. Productive , friendly, environment. Love the discounts . I loved being a supervisor, being in charge , taking care of customers, having a positive attitude."
good,At first this was a great place to work at until the store manager started treating employees as though we were children. No matter how many times we report to corporate nothing was done. Customers were even complaining and calling corporate to report things in the store and nothing was done. Discount was great but once our pay went up our hours dropped.
good,I was a good employe and had given it my all and i was treated unfairly i was lead go due to the manger fault she was unable to e- verify me. I was let go and i was never called back even thou i was told i would.
good,"Unloaded and Loading inventory for 4 hours"
good,"This job is not enjoyable if you have disorganized managers and staff. Low pay for maximum work. Nice discount. Does not drug test. Inconsistent hours, yet they call you a lot on your days off because they did not adequately schedule people. Management makes all the difference. This pay is not enough to provide for yourself, use it as something to have a little money while you look for something else."
good,It's a decent work experience but I wouldn't advise anyone to make a complete career choice from working there.From my experience it's fast pace and the lines are always there.
good,"The job offers some flexibility on hours. Working on the strip location the store was open late. There were not a lot of hours given. Some part time employees were scheduled two days, some were scheduled one 4 hour day. Full time employees get 40 hours and benefits."
good,"very hands on work field, constant moving, bending, lifting up to 50lb boxes/totes. co workers are friendly & helpful when you are new. management it okay for the most part."
good,"This would be a great company to work for if you have a higher position. Managers are underpaid for the stress, but all-in-all, you cannot beat the experience gained. The most enjoyable parts of the job is being a leader. A leader shows you how and what to do in hard situations."
good,"I have worked there for over two years. I passed up a higher paying job for this one. Initially, the company and the tasks were great, minus the customers, but we got new upper management and two of our area supervisors left. Since then it has gone downhill by a lot. "
good,it is a place where they only give you 10 hours a weeks and they expect you to show up whenever they want you too even though they don't schedule your for that day.
good,"The work is pretty mundane, management is not very good. Every day looks like the last, you do the same things over and over again. Hours are really inconsistent too."
good,It was a good job but not enough hours!!:/wasnt trained in all areas as promised an was alot of drama there so i needed a better job with more hours...
good,"Ross Dress For Less paid well for a small clothing store, all though the store manager was very rude. Mr. Justin Bellinger which is the store manager at ross, is very unprofessional, he would call employees out in front of customers. The way store manger treated me is the reason why I resigned. The work place was very stressful. The job was not enjoyable what so ever."
good,"Management is racially biased.  High employee turnover due to poor management of store and employees.  Once you are in a position, forget about moving up, or simply to another part of the store. Management took no responsibility for safety of employees or customers.  They blamed employees when merchandise was stolen and took no accountability whatsoever."
good,Even though i just started at ross but i had prior experience at another place of work  for years  that was very similar.  As of now just experiencing these last few weeks i can tell management is gonna  be a problem. Employees are not happy and turnover is very bad.  (but i can only speak for my store) things may change in the future... hopefully
good,"The enviroment is busy in which i like it makes time go by faster. The pay is $9.00 at entry level. I've been at the company since December of 2015 and only grossed a 28 cent raise. The schedule is also busy, but not in a good way. (EX) Last week i was scheduled to work Mon-Fri for 4 and a half hrs each day. I only worked Monday for 7 hrs and was called of for the following days."
good,"Incompetent staff.No training procedure in place at this location,everyone did what they considered right. Needs a specific way of doing things.Some sort of policy and procedure needs to be in place."
good,"not a bad place to work, no workplace advancement opportunities, low pay, they will cross train you in everything but wont give you the necessary raises for the positions, they have an incentive bonus program. if you get a 160% or higher in a day they will make you change your performance for a lower percentage so they don't have to pay out the bonus."
good,My experience started out great as a part time associate. As I went full time and into management the job became overly stressful
good,"I was typically in the fitting room and I love interacting with the customers. I've learned that this was a great opportunity, it's just not the job I thought it would be. There is poor management."
good,"It's a nice place, I enjoy it overall.  I think there should be more security to prevent theft.  There are a lot of people who steal and it sometimes makes customers and employees feel uncomfortable."
good,Its ok if you like being bossed around and disrepected. The co workers are awesome. I liked it there except that boss. The pay was ok and the paydays are not to far a part from one another.
good,"Open store take in a truck by my self, unload the truck and scan everything, I would also cover found ends breaks during that I would handle customer problems during that time work on a resister and take Drops to the cash office"
good,Provided store security operations; on your feet all day. NO real advancement opportunity. Managers stay in office all day with out assisting in the store no matter how short staffed.
good,"6-8 hours spent standing at a door greeting people and saying ""have a nice day."" Very rarely was it required of me to actually stop or intervene in a theft."
good,"Rude employees. the management spoke to us as children."
good,Not a recommended job if you have a life. The hours and employee payroll sucks. this place beats its associates down with no remorse and is open on major holidays.
good,i was working two jobs this one and another and i had to quit my other job because i wanted to advance my working with this company. and as soon as i quit my other job i was starting to get  1 day a week. when i told the manager she didnt change anything about my schedule and i have a kid to take care of.
good,If you work at a busy location at night everything on the floor has to be picked up and put up in the right place at times we have stayed way past 1 am in order for the store to look neat.
good,extremely fast paced but the hours worked out great for me at the time and met some great people but the pay was not enough and the managers were not good in their role
good,"Working at Ross as a part-time employee can be fun but it is a lot of hard work to get moved up in the company.  It is even harder work to maintain your new position, especially if it is fulltime."
good,"I do not recommend working for this company.  They do not give any days off, even when you have requested them off.  If you have kids, do not expect them to care.  They will make you work your butt off for next to nothing."
good,"It was boring, same old same old every day had to follow procedures which were time consuming.  They never turned on the ac so from the time you walk in you sweat until the time you go home."
good,My experience working here wasn't good. It was late hours and never kept up.
good,Ross is an easy job with low pay and no responsibility. the people are nice but its nothing but that.
good,"Better as a seasonal, or as a college job not a long term career."
good,"not a lot of hours, and very flexible but not reliable. management does not appreciate hard work. also they make favorites among employees"
good,get up go 2 ross for 5 hrz work in different parts of the store.i learned how 2 work in the stock room and how to work as a team with ppl and managers who dont really do there jobs.
good,"Management is horrible. On a typical day we are short staffed. At least 1 person quits a week. 4 people or less are closing the store on weekends, our busiest days. Management wants work to be put before school and doctor appointments to work around the work schedules. I love working with people so that's the biggest thing that makes me stay."
good,"I enjoyed the customers, they always made my day better. A typical day would go by fast depending where in the store you were. I was pregnant so I stayed on register one, and rang people out all day. I tried to avoid the drama, the co-workers all faught. No one really got a long, and also the managers picked favorites. The hardest part of the day was picking up the shoes.. There were so many, and constantly bending down to pick them up with a big belly was complicated."
good,Worked here for a while with no advancement. Management definitely doesn’t care about their employees or the rules. Only good thing was the flexible hours. Would not recommend.
good,"Working for this company was one of the worst experiences I’ve had. They weren’t very giving with their hours, nor did they pay attention to events I stated were previously planned during my interview- which caused issues with me requesting days off. In addition, this was an entirely new location, therefore we had to build the store and section it off and employers weren’t very understanding of the tiredness few of us obtained. Lastly, the training process was not thorough  and we weren’t trained for every position- despite being hired to work all positions"
good,"The good would be your coworkers. "
good,"I would look at the schedule on Monday, atleast twice they changed the day I was supposed to work without notifying me. I was hired to work more then 40 hours, that never happened they gave me one night a week after I applied for a full time position"
good,"under paid for company expectations "
good,"Not recommend for long term, great flexibility if you are going to school.  security acts like the police. I didn't get any advancement after working here almost 3 years"
good,Made me feel bad cause it was difficult to work with fractured ribs. Employee of the month within first few months. Then review time came and I got like 5 cents  but always gave my 110%. Was pretty much a slap in the face especially when others got .10 cents.
good,Ask for all the rules and all the training before you start work because they will not tell you everything until it's time for them  to write you up for not being fast enough but they doesn't tell you that before you start
good,"I worked here for over 2 years, the culture was ok, but they were always understaffed and did not compensate employees with a fair wage that is why they have a lot of turn around."
good,"The hours that are given are very little, it is a fun job if you work in the stock room but the stock room does not provide a lot of hours. The pay is good but management is horrible. There is always gossip the hardest part would be the crazy work schedule, they will have you working all positions."
good,"The company itself is not that bad, however, it isn’t good either. At this specific location, the management that remains is highly incompetent. The assistant store manager is extremely unprofessional and petty. I’ve seen him cut hours of people he didn’t like, spread rumors about those who speak out against him and change the schedule without telling anyone. And the district manager just looks the other way."
good,"it was just a temporary job during the summer but great place to work for young people. I mostly just stocked clothes on the rack and worked the cash register,nice coworkers at the location i was at in Texas. I relocated here to Louisiana but Ross Inc only pays minimum wage i would have left after the summer anyway for a better job because it was not enough pay to live on."
good,"I transferred to a Ross when i moved and the management was awful. I lasted two months and quit, they over work you then don't let you take breaks or leave at your scheduled time. Really wanted to stay but management drove me away."
good,"Poor management and lack of open communication made it a stressful work environment. Management focuses values job description to a fault, to an extent in which common sense and moral values are put in jeopardy."
good,"I stayed for so long because I was talked to about a full time position, they ran me around for a year and a half with not an ounce of advancement. My manager cared more about herself than the workers. She protected workers who come in intoxicated missed months of work. I got another job and I worked one Sunday a month they would not notify me until the night before i was scheduled to come in. I had to call out because i was out of town alot. They fired me last December and have yet to notify me. The only reason I found out was because my discount card quit working. The store manager also told a friend of mine who is a manager to not tell me. Dont work at the Ross in 89015 part of Henderson. They also upped their starting wage to more than what I was making even after raises. They did not compensate me for my loyalty to the company so I was making the same amount as someone who got hired the day before. Hours are horrible they range from 30 to 8 a week. They give more hours to people who dont do their job and make the decent workers suffer low wages."
good,It was great to be a helpful hand. However If I showed up to fill in for another employee if my time card didn't get manager approvel on the clock in screen I most likely did not get paid for said hours. Make sure to keep an eye out for how many hours and days you worked because 9-10 ya didn't get paid.
good,"The boss was okay I mean a little overwhelming but she was nice but she didn't really talk to anyone, you could leave where you where unless there was another person there and I just didn't like how they said it was a family nice place but every time I had an emergency they would write me up or tell me I couldn't be there even when I called to make sure that stuff was covered ."
good,"A typical day was working in the return/exchange and as a cashier. Greeting customers, processing payments, cleaning a designated area in the store."
good,The only good thing here was the employees. I barely received hours and I asked  numerous of times for more hours. They have a set list of who they want to work.
good,"Teaches you customer service. Current work place culture is full of favoritism, so make sure to stay on their good side. Dont make a fuss, it puts you on their bad list, full of bad shifts, and obvious select favoritism over other employees."
good,A typical day at work would be juggling between being on a register and putting the go-backs away when you were finished. since I was a seasonal hire I don't really have an opinion of their management or workplace culture. What I can say is this would be a really great place for someone who is just starting to work and get into the workforce.
good,It starts off simple just arriving and doing the assignments given to me to do and then after just get down to whatever else needs to be done. It's just too slow for me.
good,"Needed more hrs they couldn't provide,as a single mom I needed more hrs and money to support myself and my child.they could not guarantee me that , therefore now seeking other options"
good,management was pretty bad. They didn't organize anything correctly. they would hire a lot of seasonal and just throw them out on the floor as if they knew everything already.
good,I just don't like the management or the fact they say they have flexible hours when they won't even let me change my availability to better my life. May be leaving the job soon.
good,Working there is fast paced and customers complain about calling other customers up when they are paying with debit cards constantly. They call you up to the register often when you are trying to organize shelves.
good,"This job was okay when I first started, but as time went on, my coworkers began to show their true colors. Management was horrible. Pay was horrible. Managers expected you to stay late everyday."
good,I enjoy the sweet senior citizens that come in for their Tuesday discounts.  Fast paced.  I've learned that managing the employees breaks and lunches is key to balancing out the shifts and coverage for the checking out customers.
good,"You can walk into work in a good mood and be in a funk by the end of your shift. Customers can give a hard time. "
good,"very stressful place to work, managers will see that there is a line and will not open more registers. Manager does not plan out schedule according to employees availability."
good,While working at Ross I was mistreated by both my managers and co-workers. It was a very hostile environment in which I was not trained properly and had to figure out many things myself on the job.
good,"Constantly on the go, provides very minimal training mostly read material bill be expected to be a subject matter expert. You become part of the team. If you are use to just managing this is not the role for you, expect to ring daily, recover daily, receive merchandise daily, dispose trash in compactor daily all this leaves minimal time for one on one direction, managing and following up. You will be expected to keep a motivated, engaged on process productive team with minimal payroll but there is no senior leadership touch base to check leaders motivation, engagement and recognition. "
good,"I started this job as just a part time job to help me get through college. As it turned out, I was unable to support myself and two kids with the job. So, I was forced to find something else."
good,The employees are overworked but there is always an advancement opportunities for people who want to be in the management field even if your not skilled or know what is going on! Overall i had good experience there
good,There was no benefits at Ross.  The management also needs improvement.  The hours are not manageable.  The supervisors are do not listen to the employees' concerns.
good,"Mangers do not wanna do there job. Almost all your coworkers have attitudes every day. Too much Katty stuff, but honestly if you concentrate do your job and keep your mouth shut, you can move up quickly and get offered other jobs like loss prevention ect."
good,"Check in , log in complete daily paper work and inspections . I learned more extensive operation of CCTVs. Co workers were very non trusting. Management is very professional and experienced. Hardest part of the job is checking 600 to 800 trucks in monthly , three days a week at the guard shack."
good,"Ross was an okay job to get me by when I was going to school full time. I unloaded the freight from the truck on days we got them, so there was constantly things to do. The fighting between coworkers was some of the worst I have ever seen and the management was just as bad. But I honestly think I had that bad of an experience is because of the people."
good,"When working at the dressing room, you get to see & talk to Customer.  When my co worker , working together helping each other out."
good,"On a typical work day you would clock in do your start assignment. Then run register/fitting room/ stock your going back and fourth between those. You also have to processes your returns and clean up you hangers. On the register you have to reach a certain percentage 95% - above. If your closing you have to make sure all clothes are off the floor, shoes have been sized correctly toes pointing out, all you go back carts are ran, all you fitting room racks are ran, pick up in accessories, all other areas are neat and organized, toys are in straight lines, etc."
good,Unloaded freight from inbound trailers with the use of sit down forklift. Also checked in merchandise for correct product and quality with the use of RF scanners.
good,just about everyday was good but when it came to getting paid it was horrible and i didn't get the hours i asked for or wanted. my coworkers were pretty cool and we all got along. the job wasn't hard but you have to know what keys to press when working the  cashier; so if you're not ready let them know. some managers were cool and others were just plain rude and let their frustration affect their work.
good,"glad to see management has changed, when I worked there  no one respected managers.  they did what they wanted and the management rode the few employees who did their work with some  self respect."
good,"I worked with Ross for a year and attempted to transfer my job upon finding out I was going to school in North Carolina. I was not only given the run around by my manager at my home store, but the managers of the store I was supposed to be transferring to as well. Completely loved working there and now I have a sour taste in my mouth."
good,"Has potential to be a great place for employees, however, hours are not decent. Sometimes a week will go by and I am not on the schedule."
good,"Ross works you like a slave and pay peanuts. No enough working hours for part time, and you can never become full time. Work is really easy but what you have to do you should be paid more."
good,"To advance in this organization you have to ""know someone"". Your educational background and hard work do not show that you are next in line for any positions of advancement. "
good,"Worked there starting at fitting room position, then 5 months later switched to stock, and sales floor. Managers were horrible at scheduling and keeping up with the stores policies and blamed the employees for not following the Ross way's when I was never introduced to them, I only learned the shortage highway. Also, when I was almost to my year mark, they shorten my hours to 4 hrs and only worked one day, and never got called in, when I normally was the backup person if someone called off. "
good,"Management not up to part, you only get one weekend off a month, Rules do not apply to all. Co-workers are great, hard working people"
good,Very poor management. Not enough hours to work a week. Manager was not available to talk about issues at work. Stressful.
good,"A typical day at Ross Dress for Less went a little something like this. I would walk in, clock in, do my first perimeter check of the store, check base decks as I'm doing my walk, walk into the stock room make sure my associates are not stashing any merchandise that they could potentially steal or buy since the customer are suppose to have first selection of everything. The hardest part was the management team, each of them wanted something different from you or for you to do, it was hard to try and keep everyone happy. The most enjoyable part was when we had potlucks, everyone seems to enjoy food and that brought a lot of people together."
good,"work from 2-11pm "
good,"Management could have better communication skills with each other and employees. Does not promote based on time with company, hardest part of the job would be taking customer complaints with a smile, best part of the job would customer assistance."
good,"Horribly disappointed to say the least, the first few days were amazing and fun and then it all went down hill. Very unfair treatment from the management"
good,"Management is horrible hypocrits. I would not suggest working at this particular ross unless your going in as supervisor/manager. Coworkers are very friendly and ejoyable to be around, they make me not hate my job as much. The hardest part of being at ross (figueroa/vernon) is dealing with unfair managers and messy shoppers. The most enjoyable part is which it is time for me to clock out. The pay is horrible for cashiers, but actually being a cashier here is pretty O.K. and time goes by fast."
good,"A typical day at work last anywhere from 4hrs to 8hrs. I've learned just about everything that is needed to run the store. My management team is ok. Some could use a little more training, but they are ok. I love my co-workers to me everyone is a big family. The hardest part of my job is knowing that I'm not allowed to go over 25hrs being that I'm part time. The most enjoyable part is knowing that I have a job to go to."
good,My job was fun but management changed to much and all of them were completely different. 
good,"management didnt know what they were doing so no communication through out anyone , co workers all got along they were fun to work with as a team"
good,management not being far to the associates. the loss prevention was not doing their job. the store manager was not being far. less and less hours
good,"Was hired to open new store, after grand opening I was sent to dressing room duties...count items, clean up and replacement of items to sales floor. Not much after that"
good,"If anyone reads this, think twice about signing up for ross."
good,"I loved the workers that were there but overall the management was not right. I actually loved coming to work but I just wished that they would treat the workers better. They use you and hardly ever let you take your break unless you ask. A typical day at work was to come in, ask the manager what is your assignment to do that day and you just do it. It could have been cashier, running, fitting room, or stock room. The customers were friendly . The hardest part of the job making sure everything was in the right place because sometimes customers would just throw clothes on the floor and you have to pick up after them. Overall everything was great."
good,"I really liked my Job, I would have loved to make more money at the time but other than that iit was a goo place to work."
good,"Easy to grow within company, but very hard to balance as a single parent with young children. Long hours during holiday season. Pay and benefits not good."
good,"Go pack boxes for 2 hours, 15 min break, 2 more ours packing, 30 min lunch, 1 and a half packing again, 15 min break, the lastly pack for another 2 hours."
good,the benifits they offer are considered by alot of companys has the worst possible insurance offered. at my store They rather hire some one from the outside instead of hiring form within. The managment shows favore toward certain employees
good,"I worked for Ross for two years, and in that time I recieved two raises, topping out at 7.70 an hour. I was full-time, and given management responsibilites, but only when it was convienent for the upper management. My co-workers were great, but the management really needed a clue about motivating employees without making them feel like they are doing a horrible job. The final straw was coming back from maternity leave and finding out that my postion was done away with. The customers were great, but the company really needs to realize that they are losing good employees by cutting payroll and not providing proper security for the store."
good,"Meet new people, work well with others, have fun, people I work with are nice and friendly, my bosses are very nice, they give me the hours I can work there very flexible"
good,"Efficiency is the name of the game.  Of course efficiency is important however, they push it to a fault.  They require you to work FAST.  If your a register operator EVERY transaction is timed . Once a week there's a report printed out with your overall avg score . I was told by management that corporate standards are expected to be 95% or better. I was on register  for 3 yrs and I can tell you, that score isn't easy to achieve. They want to get the most production out of you and that's it.  The turnover rate for the store I work @ is 86%. That says it all in my opinion."
good,"It's a warehouse, loud, dusty and hot. But for the pay (especially around the holiday season) it's an okay job. Expect to stand for your entire shift except for 30 min lunch. All non-company issued absences are unexcused and will be recorded. Expect to be working for the entire shift (besides lunch) without the grace to stop and have a two minute conversation. And expect to be working most if not all Saturdays. The most enjoyable part of this job is the pay, over time and bonuses that you receive."
good,"You tell them when you are and are not available to work so its easy to fit into your schedule. The associates are fun to work with, you also get a company discount and a few times a year they double the discount for a few days so it can really help."
good,I applied for a seasonal part time that the manager told me during the interview that they will give atleast 22-25hrs per week.From my understanding is that they will give me that hours weekly and that's fairly good for me coz i cant work full time. But this assistant manager who is making the schedule is not giving me a working schedule that sometimes the whole week shes only giving me 5hrs and sometimes none. Good thing is that I have my MOD that calls me when someone's call in. I know that i am more productive than the others.she's giving schedules to people who are dearest to her.
good,"cash office if needed, stockroom till its clear, sales floor "
good,You work with nice people but managers have their favorites and they get more hours... the pay isn't worth all the work they have you do and under a certain amount of time. They're favorites are untouchable! No matter if they work bad or are rude! They just care about speed.
good,High turnover rate with employees but once full time there are are good benefits. Some stores are harder to work for than others. Overall it's an okay company.
good,"Company pays minimum wage, there is no raises, only California minimum wage raise. Company does not appreciate employees. Its easy to move up but the pay is bad."
good,I just wish this company would support there stores more instead of nit picking everything they do if the dont know what works for that store. And i wish they would ask the people that work for them. And what makes it easier instead of tell store how to do things.
good,"Honestly if you work SPS all you do is stand around and do nothing for 8hrs, can't even talk to the other associates, all you do is stare at customers it's an easy job but really boring."
good,A lot is expected of you.  Very fast pace.  Only a handful of full-time positions....majority are part-time with no minimum amount of hours guaranteed.
good,"I did everything in the store (work related) besides janitor, manager, and working in cash office. It was a really fun environment to work in and yo learn something new every day"
good,at first it didn’t seem like a bad job you can move up quickly there is always room for advancement. The only bad thing is once you become full time you’re strictly scheduled night shifts but yet expect you to have an open schedule.
good,"Managers are rude, let some slack off and work others really hard . The managers are not considerate or understanding. Day goes by fast because of fast pace environment."
good,"Good company , have grown within the company and this position was very good to me given my time here would recommend them to others seaeching for a job"
good,When I left the environment was almost hostile.  It is not a good environment to come into each day have your job threatened for uncontrollable. RVP targeted specific people based on race and gender
good,"Not a lifetime career. Better for younger people looking for part time work.  "
good,They only used to give me 2 days of work in a week. Managers were Alright. Some times it used to get really full and there wasn’t alot of cashier to help out with the customers that came to the store to purchase items.
good,A typical day in a retail environment was what you made of it. The music was alright could have used a longer playlist there was not too much to the job.
good,i like my coworkers and my job is easy. Stockroom puts out the merchandise. Cashier checks people out. Sale associates makes sure the the floor is neat and to help the customers.
good,"focuses on internal theft heavily"
good,"Ross store wise is a great place I just feel the associates aren't respected or rewarded for what they put up with from customers, the management team focuses on who's telling on someone rather than fixing issues"
good,"A typical day at Ross was unloading merchandise off of a box truck every morning and sorting the items out. I learned the different clothing/shoe sizes for kids, toddler, ladies, and women."
good,very  few hours inconsistent work schedules and hours. Un predictable schedules. poor managment  communication. Cares very little for co workers. no benifits or pto.
good,"The typical day depends on the volume of the store. Busy days are the best if you're a hard worker. Slow days can be tough. Only because of the lack of work."
good,"Management at Pomona acting unprofessional, discouraging, drama bringing stress into the workforce. Lots of complaints, nothing changes. Ask associate"
good,They don't care about you and are always changing your hours up. One week you'll get 25 then the next you'll get 10. I would never recommend anyone working here.
good,It has it's good days and bad. Management wasn't the best before I left. The last manager I worked for cut my hours even though I worked stock in the mornings and I felt like she didn't care to get to know me. Ross is a wonderful place to work but like all retail you are constantly on your feet and picking and fixing clothes and items off the floor. Pay did go up.
good,it was just a job i had to push my way through the people had some terrible attitude a bunch of people could care less but it whats you get in jobs like that
good,"Assist customers helping with merchandise and answering questions. Perform daily markdowns, and cycle counts of inventory as scheduled. Handle various forms of payment processing. Cash draw accuracy. Maintain outstanding customer service. Process sales quickly, accurately, and efficiently"
good,"I would walk into work, and go to the cash register and help the customer. Usually, they would have me clean the shoes, and restock the towels and pillows in each isle."
good,The first two years of my employment there were not a walk in the park as it was very demanding and busy work but that was to be expected. The last four or so months when a new store manager was installed to tow the corporate line workplace morale drastically worsened. Any impediments that presented themselves were due to lack of proper staffing or implementation of rules that dehumanized the staff like removing fans from the registers and forbidding water to be allowed at your station.
good,"Fast paced environment, Employees were friendly and helpful, Stock team was timed on every thing. No room for advancement. Not enough hours. Great employee Discounts."
good,these type of jobs are good for the new starter after high school. they help you grow and learn but i would never say its good long term job because its not at all a good long term goal/ 2 to 3 years max
good,Management does not comunicate well between departments. Was required to work 8 hours a day 6 days a week as a part time stock employee so even though full time hours no f.t. benefits. Get an occurance (write up) for every absence even with a doctor's note since you are labled part time.
good,Get experience then leave as soon as you can unless you want to get stay in the same position. Management only promotes friends regardless of your background..
good,Working at Ross gave me the opportunity to learn a new skill and become familiar with the retail experience. I enjoyed the fast pace when working in the stockroom and I enjoyed the competitive aspects of receiving good customer feedback.
good,"Working there has been great, the team effort that I had among my coworkers was great in fact we still keep in touch. unfortunately in my experience the managers that were from 02/2015 to 06/2016 were very unorganized."
good,"Working here has its ups and downs. As an employee you feel like your work is being judged every minute. There isn't a ton of positive reinforcement from all managers. Mostly co-workers have your back. You will learn a lot of new things, including how a business is run from the inside out, and what you like and don't like about management."
good,"It is a good job but only if it's a temporary arrangement. Usually understaffed, overworked and underpaid. I would recommend this job to students that need a bit of extra cash."
good,"Road has varied pay for each store. Its only part time so you don't get many working hours. The only plus is the employee discount, which is 20% off everything in store."
good,"Does not pay associates enough, does not have good raises even for associates  who has worked ten years and more with the company.Ross is cheap and is not organized. they should offer more pay roll or pay workers more for all the work they have to do."
good,"I had this job for about a year and i had to leave because it was stressful. the hours depending on which store you go to aren't as flexible as you think. there were shifts that were 12 hours and sometimes you wouldn't get a break. Management was new and didn't care about staff , and when you complained to corporate they did nothing about it."
good,"Ross wasn't bad from the beginning, but over time management became more and more preoccupied with micromanagement and meeting quotas than the value of life provided for employees."
good,"This job was a seasonal job but they kept me full time, but after so long I wanted to advance my career and move up but there wasn’t any where to move up too! I had reached my ceiling and I wanted some thing more!"
good,Direction from management was all over the place. I would start a project and then be switched to something else. No clear direction or expectations. Management and buyers were not on the same page so many projects fell by the wayside. It was disappointing because it seemed like there was a lot of potential for it to be a great position.
good,I enjoyed the discounts provided to the employees by the company. Management wasn't very secure. I was glad to have had to opportunity to work for the company.
good,very poor management . favoritism. if you need any kind of help they will assist you for a short period of time. very rude managers and supervisors. a majority of them dont know there dept.
good,Policies and procedures often change without prior notice. Each store has own policies and procedures despite having a corporate policy to follow. Assistant Managers were responsible for all store Functions while Store Manager simply supervised. If work was not completed all responsibilities fell on Assistant Manager and not Store Manager.
good,"I loved the people especially the customers but management sucked it my specific store.I was pregnant at the time I was there, and they had me and another pregnant woman working stock room lifting 30-50 lb boxes on our own. For anyone that doesn't know pregnant women are not supposed to lift anything heavy of that nature."
good,"I wasn't there long enough to say much. The management was a bit hard on employees, strict workplace environment. Not as busy as expected for the Christmas holiday for some reason. I was bored a lot."
good,"Overall nice place to work, Often times it was really busy but it depends on the location of the store. Our store was ran well and things were good. Would recommend it."
good,Ross in Hammond is a stressful environment with one or 2 jealous arrogant managers. The work place would be so much better if you didn't have them on your back every 10 minutes.
good,10 hr days with 15 minute morning and afternoon breaks and 1/2 hr lunch break. Being a warehouse- can be very hot in the summer and freezing in the winter. Production bonus.
good,"at first i love it there, until i realized they hired 70 of us to open up the store, and then i was only getting 4 hours per week, so i decided to quit"
good,"The co workers made the job amazing. The job itself was a fast paced environment that created too much stress for the compensation I was given. No chance to move up, and no chance to get any sort of pay raise. I was supervisor for almost a year and my pay was the same, and so were my hours for more work."
good,"If you are looking for a job doing menial tasks for minimum wage, with no rewards, and very little possibility of advancement this place is great. Company policies are a little skewed and management doesn't really care about much. Overall I would not recommend a job here."
good,"As a company they are ok, it is not a company I would advise to grow into. They are very selective for leadership. Unless your a management puppet, then perhaps. But as a first job in high school is ok."
good,A typical work day was generally slow. The hardest part of the job was actually dealing with customer returns. the most enjoyable was talking with the customers.
good,I was suppose to be part time but I was working full time hours with very little pay. I was always working with little days off because I was basically the lead cashier
good,"What I have learned from working at Ross was encouraging your co-workers to strive to do better everyday in the workplace as well as finding new ways to make your job more productive. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday, the team I worked with was very in tact with their work. We always made our work enjoyable."
good,You mostly spend your work day cleaning/organizing the store and operating the register. Management is likely to play favorites and I found gossiping was a huge issue among employees and management. There isn't much to expect out of this job.
good,entry level job experience.  There was not enough training and management lacked organization and failed to properly apply my skills to the work available.
good,"Ross is extremely efficient at producing grey margins for an off brand discount retailer. However, operational and management style has room to grow and to build a strong core employee base."
good,"Ross is an interesting company to work for. Personally, the store that I was employed in the management team was really unorganized and unprepared. Overall, my experience there was just to build up my patience and customer service skills."
good,"I worked here while I was in high school, which the managers knew since my interview. They would call me numerous times during school hours, and would demand me to go into work. They knew my school schedule, so they were just careless, and lazy to find someone to go in. I was never properly trained either, they literally just threw me in an area, and would criticize me for not knowing everything."
good,Good part-time job for extra cash. I enjoyed being able to go to school full-time and work this job until I graduated. The managers wasn't much help at times. Lines are super long some days.
good,"Great for kids just out of school or for a supplemental job. Average working person cannot make enough to live on. Not ever enough hours and very unstable, always changing schedule. Other employees were great, but too much work piled on one person no matter what position you're working and no matter how hard you work or try to stay busy, managers will come around and tell you what all else you could be doing. Also corp office in California controls the thermostat so store stays very hot in the summer."
good,"Management at this particular store was not on the same page with day-to-day tasks. One manager would ask an employee to complete a certain task while another manager would ask that same employee to work on something else. Then that employee will be asked why they didn't complete their first task. "
good,"Love my coworkers just not making enough money. Fun place to work, must be a hard worker and willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Work with a good group of people."
good,The store feels like a flee market and looks like one too. You find the rudest customer who will do anything to get a cheaper prices.  Very stressful job.
good,"Ross is a very interesting place to work. It will teach you how to handle pressure, multiple tasks and resonsilbilities at once, work with frustrating people (customers), how to learn on your own, how to deal with drama and favoritism in the workplace, and generally just how to survive a retail job. If you can make it here, you can literally make it anywhere. In a typical day at work, evvery employee will complain about the stress, the poor management, and the impossibility of expectations, but you will also hear a lot of people cracking jokes and making friends. Management positions tend to turn over fairly quickly, and unfortunatly their unchecked power can lead to a lot of favoritism and unfairness. The discounts are worth it for sure, and so are the friend's you'll make, the skills you'll earn, and the confidence to know that the only way to go from here is up."
good,"The job is not difficult, but does require that you are versatile and have flexibility to move from task to task. The management does not provide information that may prove beneficial to employees; it seems that stagnation is preferred in this position. Co-workers are okay, but the workplace is crawling with opportunist who will aim to have you lose your job. It is not the most enjoyable workplace."
good,"Like most retail, it's not a place you want to be at forever unless you really like it. Does provide a platform to build experience and boost your resume. Management was fine but not happy whenever schedules needed to be moved around."
good,"Nothing unexpected just a regular retail job. Scheduling is ""Flexible"" to meet their needs not yours. The job can get boring after a while."
good,A few members of management don't care about anything. They don't care about employees. They scream at you in from of your co-workers. BAD MANAGMENT
good,"I have worked for Ross Dress For Less for over 4 years. I always asked about any openings of advancement and was either transferred for a new ""advancement position"" with more pay but never received it. A typical day would be cleaning and maintaining the store a lot and getting out late. I have learned excellent customers service and store operations with a high volume of customers on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was advancement. The most enjoyable part of my job was teaching and training new hires."
good,"Poor compensation for a role of a Store Manager, Top Management IE: District Manager and DLPMS forever coming and going. Average DM`s a year was 4-5. No consistent message or direction"
good,"This is a good place to get your foot in the door for retail. This place has a high turn over rate. Not very friendly, very stressful to work here."
good,stay away nor worth the headache. learned how to manage different types of people mt team of 5 managers was terrible ept for me and one other person
good,Very productive day. Always busy. Management is okay. Small pay for a lot of work. Most people are nice. Flexible with schedule.
good,"When very busy and the lines were continuous time went by fast but it was constant. Returns were a big pain too. Not enough help, employees to pickup the store after customers let clothes fall on the floor, parents let their children play with the toys then just put them down anywhere instead of back where they belong. Shoe department was always a mess because customers tried on shoes and left them on the floor instead of the shelf where they came from same with the children's shoes but the parents let the children play with the shoes and they were all over the floor."
good,Enjoyed my time as an employee. I decided to leave because the managers are not fair to all employee and did not know how to treat associates.  No hours of any were given. No care for the staff.
good,"A typical work day starts off with you clocking in at the front, start your day. You will always have something to do and you cant stand around doing nothing. There is always something to be done to occupy time. It is a busy during the day so you are always doing something rather than nothing which is nice. It can get overwhelming sometimes because of the lack of workers we have working during the day; if we have no call no shows or someone calls off."
good,It is a job. The pay isn't anything compared to all the work that needed to be done. The people are easy to get along with. Working in the stockroom for little pay was ridiculous. The best part was working with people and helping customers
good,I work for ross dress for less and i work in many departments. I wass loss prevention for the day a few times and also did the fitting room as well but this store lacks communication between both employer and employee. They need to set more ground rules you can get away with pretty much anything i know i saw it all.
good,"Management was great to work with, however the hours were terrible and un-flexible."
good,"I was hired as a cash office representative, but after a few weeks I was given supervisor codes and was trained to perform as a supervisor. The workload was great because it kept me busy, but at minimum wage it was not worth it. No one should have that amount of responsibility for minimal pay. Several times I was offered the position, but they didn't have the payroll for it"
good,I was a cashier/ customer service cashier.  Then after an 8 hour shift we were still required to clean the store.  Which took anywhere from 2-6 hours making me leave at midnight or later and having to be back by 7:30a.m. I was also trying to go to school and they were not very flexible.  I missed to many classes and was asked to leave but I had to still pay full tuition.
good,managers weren't on hands at work. undermized the problems between their associates
good,"Calm work inviorment"
good,"I zoned the sales floor, and worked the cashier. Customers at Ross are very rude. So were my co-workers, but i continued to do my best and give my all to my job and also the customers."
good,fast pace and easy to adapt allow you to advance your people skills.
good,run register all day by myself while employess walk sales floor and talk all day.  I've learned that education does not matter at this company it all about how long your have been there. Im the only employeee besides the store mgr that has a degree and they leave me at the register all day like i dont have a four year business degree.
good,"* a lot of walking thrugh-out the day"
good,"I unloaded boxes all day. Folded clothes, put them on hangers, and put price tags on them."
good,overworked and underpaid. Its a fun enviroment to work at but the store is usually a mess and you have to clean it. Not enough hours are given and you dont make alot
good,"A typical day involved running a cash register, and counting/confirming all the cash in the store prior to opening"
good,Enjoy co-workers and customers. Learned all positions in store.
good,"I didn't like working there. long hours, pay was not good. hardly got breaks"
good,"I like the work i do but however the management is horrible. There is no appreciation from management to employees, no recognition, therefore this puts the employees in bad moods and makes my work environment uncomfortable."
good,Ross was iight. They were just unorganized and had trouble with payroll. The only thing I really liked was the people I worked with. Everyone was so nice and friendly. They made me feel right at home.
good,Balance all register from the day before.  Make change for store and safe. Write reports for district managers.
good,"Your typical work day is to clock in and get your assignment for the day, especially if you are on the registers or sales floor area. Usually your schedule will let you know what you will be doing for that particular day. (i.e. fitting room, mark downs, stock room) Depending on the needs of the day, management will take you off the assignment and onto the sales floor or registers. Something that I learned from the 3 years that I've been working here is how to deal with your associates as well as the customers that you will encounter. Patience and keeping your cool is recommended in this work place. Some of the co-workers are very hard working while some are not. Management, I believe and especially at my store location, do not have a great judge of character when selecting some of their new hires. I have encountered a lot of associates that slack on their work and are never let go from the company. Management also communicate poorly, and schedule poorly. For example, they will sometimes revise the schedule without notifying the associates of the changes. So when we come in to work, we may have had to come into work earlier or later on in the day than when we thought. The pay is not worth the work that you do. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with extremely rude customers. The only enjoyable parts of the job is some of the people you work with and the associate discounts."
good,Come in at 4am start unloading trucks very nice environment.
good,Very skimpy on hours. Unaccommodating when you need more hours or time off. 
good,"Friendly people, management sometimes not so friendly. Co-workers were great people to work with."
good,"Fast pace, face to face customer interactions, the environment is nice"
good,I enjoy the people I work with the most and how the enviroment is very laid back and down to earth. I havent came across any hard parts of the job.
good,I would come in and count the drawers from the previous night. Order money for the week. Count the safe and do deposits. I also did product replenishment and inventory loss prevention. Recovery was done at the end of every night and the store cleaned before anyone could leave. The management was not organized and many times we were short handed due to people calling in and no one coming in to replace them. Co-workers didnt like the job but we loved each other. The most enjoyable was the customer service counter. I got to work with the best we had there and help implement new Operation procedures.
good,"I have worked for Ross for over 5 years part-time and my salary has only gone up $1. One Ross I worked at was okay. And then I transferred to one in California and it was a mess. I wasn't getting the hours I requested and the person who was doing the scheduling didn't know how to schedule! Some stores are super outdated with technology, making it hard for the employees to be able to take customers quickly, since they track us by out handling time. Also, if you do find yourself at the company for a while, make sure you are willing to move up and make a difference. You can tell that some managers do not like their position, and it shows in the way they treat their own employees. Seriously consider the environment before applying. Chances are, it'll be like if you get hired."
good,"My tasks as a manager included directing employees to their different departments, distributing/counting cash for tills, answering phones, using a cash register, doing cash pulls when there was 300 dollars or more in a till, recovering the store, assigning breaks and making sure employees receive them, as well as maintaining a safe and cleanly work place. This job taught me to be patient and learn how to manage my time with extreme precision. The hardest part of this job was making sure everything that was assigned got finished in the amount of time in a shift. The most enjoyable part of this job is having management experience to put on my resume."
good,"For the most part customers are the worst, you run everywhere to clean up after their mess. Management is pretty shady, pay is way to low for the amount of work being put in."
good,Ross was going through a lot of changes and the communication among the managers was very poor. Not a great company to work for
good,"I love the fact i can interact with the customers and assist on home & clothing apparel. I feel i encourage the customerss to help meet sales. I stand in the fitting rooms, count items that go in and out of them, do periodic check inside fitting rooms, size all the clothes customers return, and complete an sizing assignment. The hardest part of the job which is not to hard but when the person you are relieving leaves things a mess or out of order."
good,Many products are not in great condition. Some of the furniture and some of the clothes are irregular.
good,I typical day at work is mostly stressful. I have learned very few and dont think this job will further my career. The managment is not good. The managment doesnt care about your well-being or happiness. I do enjoy my co-workers though. The hardest part of the job is dealing with certain managers. The most enjoyable part is seeing my co-workers and payday!
good,A typical day at work at Ross consist of watching the store and assorting clothes. I learned that the friendlier you are in the fitting room the customer is more likely to purchase the items. My co-workers at Ross became like family. The hardest part of my job was taking care of the whole back of the store by myself and what i enjoyed most is the people.
good,it was retail not the best retail job i have had but it was ok sometimes it was ok but it was retail and veary sucky pay
good,"Productive for those that want to be. Loose management when it comes to any direction. No possibility of promotion unless you're over 40, even if you have 10 years experience. Look forward to needing bachelors degree to make a little cash."
good,"Although the coworkers I have met at both Ross stores I've worked at have been friendly, the manager at my current store is not approachable because she is not considerate of the employees. Along with this, the scheduling at this store does not necessarily work well with my school schedule so I am currently getting very little hours."
good,"Organizing and cleaning all day, must always have a smile, and be ready to help any customer. The pay was good for the jobs they had you doing, but not enough hours were given."
good,"I worked as a loss prevention specialist and actively stopped several thefts, but most of the time we weren't expected or encouraged to stop thefts. In fact we were essentially showpieces meant to deter honest criminals."
good,There are a lot of call outs. The turn over rate is high. A lot of work falls to the night shifts. There is not the best training going on. Some of the managers really do care about their employees. There is some room to move up in the company.
good,"the pay is really low "
good,If looking for part time permanent or temporary it’s a great job to have however for full time they require way to much with not enough compensation worst department is the fitting room!
good,I only lasted 6 months there because management was bad. Store manager ended up leaving our store to go to a bigger one in a different city. No personal life because the hours can be long. working there during the holidays was TOUGH!
good,"It's a great job if you need one immediately, they seem to hire almost anyone as long as you pass the online multiple choice test. Past that it's horrible, you are always being watched as if you are a thief of your own store,and you are expected to watch everyone else to catch them doing something wrong. You are constantly called in on your days off to cover people who called out, and when you are sick it is up to chance if it's going to count against you or not. There is no work life balance at this job. Management is hit or miss depending on location and they often are not on the same page."
good,"Worked as a regular associate, loss prevention associate and supervisor. Management team was all over the place and that went for in the store I worked for, the district and it seemed the company as a whole. For the retailer to be so big, nights we close we only had three maybe four people to clean up the whole store. The only part of the job that I liked was the in between period of associate and supervisor, when I worked as SPS, and that was only because i took the initiative in what got done within the program."
good,"I love working with people, customer service etc .. but they talk a big game and don't hold to it. We don't really get treated right and we are short staffed always."
good,"You start out $ 11 per hour its a part time job only!  but , its cool easy fast paced business casual work environment.  Cool job to have access to a great discount and extra money in your pocket"
good,"Es un ambiente de trabajo tranquilo, agradable, pero son muy pocas horas de trabajo, no hay horas fijas asi aparezcan en horario"
good,Work culture was very cliquey and unproffesional. However the management team was excellent and had a wonderful compassion for helping the individuals beneath him strive to accomplish their goals both within the workplace as well as in life
good,flexible work environment and friendly atmosphere. Part time hours are options. Full-time hours are not offered to staff but only to managers. Teamwork is key.
good,"Liked to coworkers there, and had good management for  a good while. However, they have no steady schedules, no advancement to move up, and management does not really care of employees."
good,I was scheduled then always called off.managment was not proressional.new hires dont get same respect as seasoned employees or hours.training is awful
good,If you end up pregnant they treat you poorly even if you have been there for 2-3 years. They act like you dont belong there and it wasn't just me they treated like this. They treated 3 other pregnant employees like this.
good,"For the most part working at ross isn't the worst. There are a few down side, but also so good thing. The biggest win for me were the other works, and the discount. The downs where not getting very many opportunities for moving up, and inconsistent management. Not just from the store, but from company. Getting inconsistent hours is like a financial rollercoaster that I did sign up for"
good,"Training was supposed to last 3 weeks, and training lasted 3 months. I was really good at getting the clothes ready to get out onto the floor. However, they moved me to stock for a few weeks and then transferred me back to working with the clothes and for the last few weeks, I worked in the fitting room. "
good,It was a oof work experience there was a lot to learn in a short period of time but over all I learned a lot. Always learning something new and always busy.
good,"Overall the work environment at Ross is terrible. The management is terrible, there’s no opportunity to grow, favoritism is all over the place, and you essentially get no recognition or benefits for working hard."
good,"we have to provide good customer service and treat the client right even if that client is angry ,as a cashier we have to be as quick as possible with everything."
good,"For the most part, the job isn’t the worst I’ve had but it’s far from the best. I worked SPS and Sales Associate positions. The job seems to always be short staffed which means sometimes you’ll get extra hours if you pick up someone else’s shift. However, even if you work part time, there’s no work life balance. You seem to be always there. SPS is boring because all you do is stand there, greet people & learn new things to memorize & if your mind races like mine does, you’ll definitely find yourself unfulfilled. Stock room and sales floor aren’t bad positions to work at all. Markdown is actually decent as well. At the cash register, they time you and want you to maintain a score above 90% (Yes, the grade you for your cashier performance). The highest percentage wins prizes sometimes. The discount is great for the most part, especially when they have 40% off sales for the employees twice a year. If you have great, polite and friendly co-workers, it makes the job bearable. If you don’t, you may not like the job because management tends to be flawed & inconsistent. They don’t actually care about you & they will easily replace you like any other job."
good,I worked for Ross and enjoyed working with the customers and some fellow co workers. I was a cashier so most of the day I would operate the cash register. The other part of the day I would try to help maintain the sales floor which most of the time was a mess. Some of the co-workers were not too nice which included supervisors and managers.
good,"At first, i enjoyed working at Ross. Easy work, fun environment, decent pay for one who is just starting. But, under new management, things took a turn for the worst."
good,"Every review I’ve read about Ross Dress for Less training is accurate. They throw you into every area and expect you to know the areas within a week. Management in Berlin 1/01/19 took advantage of staff and would give them their sidework plus the tasks they were given previously to finish.  They understaff the front end, and don’t train properly. Breaks were a plus. Coworkers were nice. Upper/lower management was poor."
good,I was let go mid Janurary. The asst store manager didn’t tell me it was my last day she left it up to a supervisor to do so and she caught me on my way out the door to sign for my last pay. I was told I should consider coming back next season because I was a lot of help. I hustled and did everything I could to do what they asked me to do. I think I was the only new hire cashier that got the line down. I’m sure it had to show by the night totals. That’s another thing that was strange about the job is that cashiers couldn’t count there drawers in or out. I had no idea what I started with or finished with. To sum it all up don’t work too hard instead direct your attention towards getting to know the management on a personal level. It seems that’s what made the job a permanate one. There are many things about this job that were odd.  I don’t think I worked even one shift that I felt like it was a good day. I always was left in disbelief for something or another. Best of luck to everyone there.
good,"Overtime is a big thing with Ross. At the same token, so it Voluntary Time Off. When applying for this job, think seasonal, as all associates start with a temp agency."
good,"Working for this company can be pretty easy going, but if there are not enough people staffed it can be rough. In the store I worked at, most employees were college students, who needed flexible schedules due to their classes, for this the scheduling of shifts was great. If you wanted more hours, you could almost always get more by asking a manager."
good,"an easy job once you learn all the basics,not a bad place in general to work at if you're looking to earn some extra cash. the management is the problem though favoring those who suck up to them & do anything they say over workers who always show up & finish all their tasks. of course this only applies to some managers others actually acknowledged every employees work."
good,"Inefficient and unprofessional management. No job security, inconsistent hours and failure to follow through with one's word on part of management. In my experience, the store manager was awful and constricted the other managers' ability to do their jobs to the best of their ability. I was promised more hours (is 15 a week too much to ask for?) and they weren't provided. Actually, they were cut further. I had surpassed the required efficiency percentage for cashiers and front end supervisors, yet was still talked about behind my back and had my hours cut simply because the store manager ""didn't like me"". After copious amounts of kudos from customers I was told ""that's great and all, but you should always prioritize your speed"". They may say that their focus is helping the customer but I can definitely say that's an enormous joke."
good,"It’s stressful most of the time. You’re constantly busy, which is great but it can be difficult to get everything done. Management can be difficult. Very strict."
good,They basically only have half time positions and the hours are horrible. This job is good if you don't really need that much money or as a second job.
good,"Overall the people that work for me and I worked with made it a easy to go to work everyday.  However, the hours I put in didn't as the only salary executive in building you were the catch all to everything.  If the truck wasn't done or you were over payroll as the store manager you were responsible to stay and get things done.  The team was the piece that made it bearable because they have my back."
good,job has very good benefits. but the pay is way bellow average. you meet a lot of nice people that shop at the store. also you meet a lot of negative people while working.
good,"packaging merchandise for shipment, shrink wrapping goods for loading onto trailers, ensuring that the correct labels are on all pallets completed, routinely cleaning all warehouse areas, matching quantities and items being shipped against the invoice"
good,"They underpay employees and don’t wanna pay them enough. They complain about about how much work need to be done, hire new employees, then don’t want to give the main employees enough hours th do the job correctly"
good,"As an assistant buyer you do get to analyze sales and work with PD which is great!"
good,"Very few opportunities for full time roles.  To work here full time you must have a completely open availability.  All in all a decent place to work part time.  The discount is pretty nice but management can make or break this job.  If you have great managers, even dealing with retail drama isn't too bad but if you have a manager with unreal expectations then this job will be a nightmare especially when holiday season comes around and the store gets picked apart."
good,Worked for ross for a couple of months. The staff was friendly but didn't give enough hours. Sometimes i was working 1 day a week with the cost of living i couldn't servive.
good,"It was three years ago when I was there my reason for leaving was there was no advancement for me. The two leaders above my district manger left the company. I was hired to be a DM after a year. But when the two left no one would stand up for me. My DM was only concerned about her. HR was even worse, they would come into your store and would tell you all the wrong merchandising you had but could offer no help on hiring in tough markets. They were useless."
good,"very boring day, cant talk to anyone on the clock. paid lunches. hardest part is making blue chip. peoples tempers get a little crazy. its an ok place to work for"
good,"es un ambiente de trabajo es bien agitado con bastante movimientos, se tiene muy buena comunicacion"
good,"I normally would walk the floor before I started my shift. I liked to get a feel for the day. Often time the structure and upkeep would prepare me for the sort of day ahead. Not always, but often. "
good,It was not the best job for the amount of money they are willing to pay.  Costumers we’re constantly rude and disrespectful.  We only received 15 min breaks sometimes.
good,It was a good place to work but we wouldn’t make good money to afford the life style here and also we had good co- workers they were nice and fun I liked working there
good,"collective no unity , No one cares about the interests of the company, , the security system is not tight, the goods are not neatly arranged, generally lack of attention of the leadership"
good,"Starting your day as front end cashier is awesome as a first time job. Simple till instructions, easy way to learn cashier responsibilities. Basic people skills are needed, and very achievable with respect and enthusiasm. Moderately fast paced position, hardest part would be handling escalated situations with respect and remaining calm. Most enjoyable part would be the learning aspect and the return of everyday customers. Management comes and goes, some are good and some are bad. But its not up to you who manages you so as long as you remain a dependable and efficient employee who follows the rules then the manager should only guide you with everyday tasks not make your employment there a bad experience."
good,I enjoyed working her although it was complex with the staff. I disliked the management and wished I was offered a different location because I enjoyed the job itself.
good,"The people are friendly but after the holidays my hours were cut from 20-25 down to 4 hours per week.  I made employee of the month within the first two months,"
good,"management isn't the greatest, they don't communicate with each other and there extremely petty, they also don't like to work with your schedule its there way or no way"
good,"Stock was fun, unloading trucks and stocking the sales floor. Un packaging clothes was the fun part of it but people in that position are very stern about it and wont let anyone andvance to it. Manager at the time was very mean, rude, and always insulted workers instead of taking them aside, tell you what you did wrong and helping you fix it. the hardest part of the job was keeping the sales floor clean and organized. if not clean by the end of your shift or the night, you stay later to clean."
good,A great diversity of people's. Most don't speak English. Job is curtailed towards the third world sweat shop style work environment. Was told one thing by the Ross manager then changed his mind when asked by my direct supervisor. Was warned that you are just a number in a book. Found out this to be true.
good,"At the store I worked at , it was always a competition within the associates  on who was going to get promoted next . Management would tell a bunch of associates their chances on moving up just to movtivate them when in reality their chance was very slim. Its a good tactic though to keep people from quitting . "
good,cashier the culture is alright but management tends to have problems communicating with employees.  They tend to act very childish and it is very stressfull
good,"The manager who hired me quit my first week there and didn't tell anyone, so there was no manager for two weeks. The new manager was rude and the some of the other employees were not easy to work with at all."
good,"They need more jobs for pregnant employees ."
good,They have hard workers that they overlook often. You cannot move up in the company unless you become a manager.  There are excessive turnovers in the company for employees.
good,I was in stock and it is very fast paced and a lot of work to do. The hardest part was the days when we couldn't go in to work because of the size of the truck
good,"Most companies have ironed out their store's issues by now, not Ross. They will find some way to make your job annoying and inconvenient. No one there really cares but they will still have the energy to hassle others."
good,"My typical day at work is working on register, assisting customers on sales floor, organizing merchandise, reprising merchandise and assisting cashiers with any change or problems."
good,Ross Stores was a very calm environment to work in. The hours were flexible for me and the management was willing to work with anyone as long as it didn't severely interrupt the schedule.
good,Nothing much to say either about this company except the discount for the employees. It’s a retail store you work much harder basically it’s confidential nothing else to say
good,Working at Ross was a great experience if I ever wanted to become a store manager or supervisor I would say no ! Ross says they have flexible hours. HA! They LIED!
good,"They work you like a slave, with little recognition. Only get recognition when you kiss their butts...Whichever day you do not work, they will call you in or if you don’t answer they will get mad.... managers tend to be very LAZY. I’ve worked at two different Ross stores in two different cities and it was the case for each one. lines can get as long as Walmart lines during senior day Tuesday’s, Paydays, Christmas, and back to school time"
good,"Ross wasn't the worst place to work. My coworkers were friendly and the discounts were nice. However scheduling was always a problem for me. I was hired as a seasonal cashier and they would either never schedule me or only have me scheduled one day a week. I had to call every week to find out if i was scheduled that week before they finally told me over the phone that I wasn't going to continue working there. They could have at least let me know in person that they were going to let me go, instead of me calling to find out my schedule and being told that I no longer work there."
good,The company paid far more attention to company matrix than to actual customer testimonial or my store's trackable annual sales increases. The inconsistency of district managers in my area made for a stressful management environment when district managers expectations were also inconsistent. Also the blanket company goals for stores that varied in annual sales and stockroom square foot caused daily struggles with both sales floor and stock room associates and management.
good,"Working at Ross was not necessarily bad, I feel like the job was very easy, but the management had created a culture there where there was no order and the rules only applied to people on a whim and not consistently."
good,Not a good fit for me would not get enough hours after Christmas but until Christmas was over you never knew what time you would get off work and I did not like that I couldn't make any plans outside of work
good,The employees there are great! The assistant manager and awesome!  The manager is ok but he favors a person over the rest of the employees that work very hard and go above and beyond. So doesn't set a good example for the employees and is starting to make them just not care. Which I am sure will lead to employees not doing a good job cause of it.
good,"The job was simple, basic retail job where you stock, provide customer service, etc.  Employees were welcoming, friendly, and hardworking . The management was very poor unfortunately. Poor and petty. Horrible communication with a negative atmosphere."
good,"Motivation for the Employees was low at time, and their was no type of consequences for consumers who was caught red handed for theft i felt as though the should have the same polices implemented as  Target retail stores have"
good,management needs to be better. they could use better equipment. other than that the work place is just like another warehouse with similar functions..
good,This job is a great way to experience retail and strive to better career goals and advances in careers within retail. You'll achieve great overviews  on customer service and ways to better communications skills.
good,The hours were convenient. Each day was the same type of work and the same amount of work. I learned how to prep and stock the merchandise to the companies requirements. The only part of the job that would be hard for someone would be constantly on your feet. But nothing I couldn't handle.
good,My typical daily routine consisted of unloading a truck everyday and making sure all merchandise was unpacked and put in the proper place on the floor and Management could have been better I felt like they didnt care about their employees and the only thing that kept me there was my customers and my coworkers
good,"The biggest thing I learned from Ross was how to treat and service customers, especially the regular customers. We experienced a lot of theft in the store, so learning how to deal with that was different. Damaging items for returns typical retail duties. The hardest part about the job was holiday seasons very chaotic place to work."
good,A typical day at work was stocking all merchandise received that day. Making sure it was placed in the right place for the customer. Management was not the greatest when i left  because we had a new manager so didn't have enough time to see any improvement. He was very flexible when it came to time off.
good,"It wasn't the best place to work. I hardly got hours, and they stuck me in the fitting room every day. My coworkers were also not very nice, but 9.25 an hour was pretty good for the work."
good,Excellent co-workers that would work extra hard and highly motivated. I learned a lot about shrink and units. Culture is very friendly and positive.The hardest part of the job was keeping everyone happy. Working with certain individuals with excellent team playing skills that help and assisted with all necessary changes during seasonal changes was the most enjoyable part at work.
good,"I would prefer a job with more hours,  and better pay.  Fit the work that has to be done,  the pay isn't so great. The job can be very unorganized and dysfunctional."
good,"very busy lots of people."
good,"time goes by quick, you get a discount of any items sold in store"
good,there were no hours really they barely have enough money to pay there customers i was a stock associate for a month only because they had to many people not enough money
good,"A typical day at Ross is fun but busy. The only thing about it is that the breaks are very short. The Manager and Supervisor were good people, they would give you hours if you needed it"
good,"The work environment at this store is alright. Very limited hours and empty promises. The managers were very ""short"" and trained poorly. They were aslo somewhat slow, and never really helped out."
good,"Overall working here is fun and fast pace work, however, they do not pay well and expect you to a lot of work. Great for high school student or as a part-time job."
good,"trabajo rapido , buenos companeros,la gerencia buena,buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,The store can be very be disorganized and unruly at times. Management can be much better. There is not much availability for full-time positions.
good,"long work hours,i was a key carrier with way to much responsibility, constant micro management made it difficult for me to do my job. i worked in freight so i couldnt leave till all clothes and other merchandise was processed and put on store shelves."
good,Ross Dress For Less is a great first job. Come here to get experience in the work field. The sets you up to deal with all means of customer service and floor work.
good,"Ross is okay if you're looking for a part time job. It's hard to get over 25 hours a week. If you're looking fora second job, Ross would be great because they do have flexibility with your hours"
good,"Very rare to get on full time at this job, as the company doesn't want to have to supply benefits. poor hours, and not worth the little pay."
good,They have a great team/ environment. Ross is my first job and it was an cool experience to have. Now I'm ready to branch off and try something different.
good,"Fun environment, but no hours. They always hired people every day instead of giving hours to the workers there. This job would have been great if they gave full time hours."
good,During the holidays the stock room would get super busy. Management always kept it serious but fun with rewards like snacks. I always had to be careful with the big heavy boxes but if you needed help all you had to do was ask.
good,In my opinion they use their worker they pay is not very good they do not appreciate they good workers and worst management staff
good,a typical day at work was hectic depending on the day. i learned how to use a cash register. management was okay when i worked there. everything there was pretty easy just boring.
good,"I applied to this job thinking it would be flexible because from the very beginning I let the manager know I was a full time student first. Each semester I submitted my class schedule, and if i had any class assignment I needed to attend I always let my manager know ahead of time. Although I was always straight forward with management, somehow they always scheduled me during class times, I would let them know that I would not be able to attend, but the mangers never communicated with each other so i would get calls during class asking why I didn't show up for work. "
good,I worked at ross when it first opened 6/2014.  I worked there part-time but previous manager & supervisors didn't acknowledge hard work! Favoritism is practiced which is hard if only working part-time! I would've loved to continue working there but they are uNfair about work ethics
good,"Easiest job ever, but there was so much drama All. The. Time. At one point I was working double shifts every single day because someone else kept calling out and they refused to fire them. That's 9am to upwards of 11pm. Every day. Add the catty 20 somethings trying to kill one another and the terrible pay and you have a great big NOT WORTH IT! I've heard they've raised the pay grade a little but it's not really a career building kinda place."
good,"Management was lacking.  Co workers were dedicated and fun to work with. Not any room for advancement.  The work hours were decent, but more would have been nice."
good,This job is really great...very flexible with your schedule. I would recommend this to anyone especially if you're in school. It starts off 9 an hour!
good,I have worked for the company for three years and I won't complain it pays my bills. I love most of the co works that I work with. Most of the managers are awesome and I get along with.
good,"It's all simple to understand and do, you just need a good memory and self some discipline. Also don't expect a livable paycheck unless you get full time, and that's if you don't have a lot to pay off any time soon."
good,A very good job to start at but very little promotion opportunities. Company methods are ineffective but strictly enforced. Not recommended.
good,It's an easy job but they provide little to no hours for part timers; they focus all the pay-roll to the five or six manager they have. Management could be a little better as well.
good,A lot of employers know more than their managers. When you have to train a manager there is a problem. The job is easy to adjust to but there are some issues that the company needs to work on.
good,"The people at Ross is what really make the job. They don't really appreciate your hard work. You have to ask for a break. The hardest part of the job is having to be in 3 places at once, such as being the cashier, sales associate and the front end supervisor all at once."
good,"A typical day involves running the register, fitting room, and organizing your designated area of the store. I learned how to become a hard worker here they really push you to be the best you can be and work your hardest. Management was friendly and interested in helping you do your job. Co-workers are very team oriented and rely on one another to keep the store running smoothly. The hardest part of the job was staying on register for so many hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was so fast paced that the day would fly by."
good,"In the 2 years that I worked for Ross, we had 2 different store managers, 4 different assistant managers, and 6 different area supervisors. There were periods of time to where we didn't even have a store manager. They were very unorganized. I was always having to get used to a new manager. Also, there was no communication in the store. One person would tell you to do something one way. Someone else would tell you another, and then, you would get in trouble for both when the district manager came in."
good,Working for Ross was challenging for the fact that we were always short-staffed and that was the first time I was in a leading position.  I learned that just because I was a supervisor does not mean respect is bestowed-it's earned.  Management had a high turn-over and though it was hard at first we found a middle ground to get work done.  I believe everywhere I went co-workers and I always had a good time.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were mad because of us being short staffed.  The most enjoyable part was employee appreciation day because everybody received 40% discount on clothes.
good,"Castro valley Ross had a great manager and work policy. Turlock Ross felt like Highschool, if you didn't fit in you'd be outcast-ed working one day a week for 4 hours. Management was terrible."
good,they don't give you hours. if you can work nights and weekends they'll love you other then that they will jip you on hours. they sounds promising but they aren't
good,Working at Ross Dress For Less was not the greatest experience I have ever had but it also was not the worst. Working at Ross is what ultimately helped make the decision to go back to school. I knew that I did not want to work here for the rest of my life. It was actually pretty difficult to advance to a full time position but not impossible. After working there for a year and going from a part time cashier position to full time Lead Associate Position I was only given a 14¢ raise.....not $14 obviously but $0.14. At that point I was trying to figure out if it was really worth all that.
good,Lots of variation in different types of work. Flexibility in your work schedule. Ideal for a student or someone that is still living at home. Not ideal if seeking a good paying job.
good,"This was the last of my many retail jobs. "
good,"Minimal pay and benefits combined for a high turnover rate and poor management, over all a fun job but had no room for improvement and advancement."
good,"IT was fun, different managers came and went, time went by fast because it was so busy. helped awesome customers. had fun pricing all the new merchandise that came in."
good,When I worked for the company I did not find management very pleasant. Out of 4 managers there was one who ruined it for everyone. She was very rude and over worked me and sometimes didn't allow me to take lunch breaks. I also worked long hours and felt that minimum wage did not compensate me for my time and efforts. The hardest part of the job was dealing with her because she called me on the weekends I was off and left voicemail's screaming at me for not being on the schedule. There really wasn't an enjoyable part of the job I just needed the money before college and it was my last resort. I learned that in life I'll have to deal with good and bad managers but I need to keep pushing instead of quitting.
good,its a retail store so its always busy and your day would pass by fast i worked for this company for 3yrs and i went up from a cashier to a supervisor and i loved that i could move up and do more and also learn about the company. i hurt me to leave but the management changed and they were cutting people very fast to hire new staff
good,Good experience with no long term prospects.  My typical working day would involve a checklist of assigned duties/ responsibilities supporting the stores operation. Promoting a culture within this store for good shortage and safety behaviors.
good,The perfect environment to experience the correct way to provide customer service. A learning opportunity in time management.
good,Management could have been improved. The coworkers were nice and also nice to get along with. They helped me every step of the way. The hardest part of the job was to deal with different customers attitudes.
good,"They will hire new people who quit or don't show up while they have employees who want the hours, but their hours get cut to accomodate the new hires."
good,"Management is never 100 percent secured, you will have multiple managers in a year, which makes it difficult, especially if you are trying to get noticed to move up in the company. The hardest part of the job is if you do not agree with the policies, specifically if you are Loss Prevention. This retail store is not similar to other very well known retail stores. They have a strict policy that no employees are allowed to go over 25 hours a week, this can be a deal breaker for some."
good,Very boring job. Especially working night shift. I tried so hard to make production every night.It is hard to get 75 percent of a hundred.
good,"Typically you come in when you're scheduled and, depending on rather or not you're going to be asked to stay over, leave on time.  You learn how to deal with rude employees as well as customers.  The management team is nice, if not a little disorganized.  Co-workers tend to do most of the work.  The job isn't hard at all; it's mostly just really tedious and you don't get much for the work you do."
good,Not enough time in day to clean store.  Got along great with sales associates.
good,A pretty good job there is a sense of community but there is no room for advancement and it seems like everyone is only there temporarily
good,"On a typical day things were pretty simple. At the time I worked there it was a new location. It was a new location and a lot of things were not organized. The hardest part of this job, was trying to receive delivery trucks within five hours. This job, in my opinion, was not fun. Keep in mind this was a relatively new location at the time, so not much was invested into it."
good,"My days working at Ross Dress for Less was exciting, you never knew who you would help in the decision of buying the best outfit. Very self pace position one of the longest jobs I worked."
good,"Not a bad job to work at, love working with public. The worst part was the constant change of management. Had personalty conflict with manger at time of being laid off, I believe he had a lot to do with it."
good,Great company with excellent benefits.  Casual working environment.  Summer Friday's with good work life balance.
good,"You don't know what type of customers you will be dealing with.  be prepared for the worst, because anything is possible.  I've learned all the basics, including the back where the boxes come in and stocking wise,  to use the register and how to communicate with customers.  The management can be a little off, but no store has everything together and can be on time with things.  My co-workers all have nice personalities and are the best!!  hardest part working at Ross is actually communicating with the customers because you don't know how their feeling, you don't know what type of people you will be dealing with.  The pro's working at Ross is seeing all these cute products and of course getting a discount."
good,A typical day at work would be very busy. The Hardest part of the job probably has to be recovering the store because it can get very messy . Most enjoyable part is that you meet new people and time goes by very fast since its so busy.
good,A typical day at work was long and stressful BUT I enjoyed my job so it was worth it to me. I learned to be honest as well as speak up when needed. Most of management needs training and lacks compassion. No repercussions for misbehaving employees. My co-workers were generally great but there were few that were not very nice as well as a few who did not want to work hard at all. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep up with unrealistic expectations. The most enjoyable part was running my own team and helping to build their confidence.
good,This store was a very productive store before the new store manager came into play. Now it's a hot mess where no one knows what they are supposed to do. Schedules are being changed and the associates are not being told then yelled at because they were late for work. I would not recommend anyone getting a job here.
good,"As I first started, I started on the register. I learned pretty quickly, working fast and efficiently with each customer. A couple weeks later, I was moved to the fitting room, where I managed shortage, customer service, and handeling merchandise. After a couple months there, I was moved to stock, there we recieved and processed merchandises. It was a great work place with great co-workers, and management. I really enjoyed experiencing the different job areas. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers but I learned how to deal with them with practice and past experiences."
good,Co-workers were excellent. Very laid back place to work. Typical day was slow.
good,"Ross stores in general are known for being extremely disorganized, cluttered, and at times dirty. This is due to the customer volume and under staffing. The location I worked at was extremely busy. I liked working here because of the employee discounts on merchandise. Can be a frustrating job at times, and the pay is minimum wage, overall decent place to work."
good,I really don't have much to say. A typical day at Ross can be a crazy  I mean through my training i learned a lot  as i got the feeling of the job the store moved me to a different department that i had to learn and it was find because i enjoy learning new things but after a while i guess management was not seeing eye to eye so at that time i was looking for another job...
good,Typical day would be to put out new merchandise on the sales floor and assist customers.  Learned how to organize my work area and use floor layouts to put out new merchandise. Co-workers were nice and helpful.  Hardest part of the job was having to do other tasks while trying to meet a deadline on my own tasks.  Enjoyable part of the job was the people I met while working there.
good,"Understaffed, under-qualified co-workers, poor management, 0% for potential growth within the company."
good,"l did front end customer service. l was in charge of refunds , counting tills, making deposits, and change orders."
good,Managers were too strict for a such a low paying job. Some employees were always quitting do to the stress caused by the store.
good,"Standing all day in the back processing, trying to get done, while understaffed, and huge trucks is rough."
good,"This company is a typical retail company."
good,"There were family working together in the stock room, it was very cliquey and ill managed. "
good,"My store manager was terrible, I enjoyed working in the departments that I did. Most of the people I worked with were very nice."
good,"What I learned working here was opening/closing procedures. How to write schedules, recover the store and train new employees."
good,"They are a good company. They work well with there people but they dont have many oppertunities they dont keep people who know the area that they work in but they do train you. They show compation to their employees, when they get hurt."
good,"Cleaning the store, cashier great co-workers, It is a busy environment"
good,"picking up after people, no matter how wrong the customer is they always get what they want, management=oblivious,"
good,This store is always messy and the employees don't do much but just walk around looking for gossip. Training is poor.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in and checking what my ""start assignment"" was for the day. Basically a start assignment is an assignment that a member of management assigns to each employee. Each employee has to finish their start assignment before the end of their shift. A start assignment could consist of sizing the clothes, folding the towels in the linen section, making sure the right size shoes are on their designated shelves, etc. Once I finished with my start assignment I would go to my designated register and helped other cashiers keep the lines to a maximum of two people per line. When there were no customers to be checked out I then focused on recovering the store. Recovering the store included putting returns back on the sales floor, maintaining the floors free of trash and merchandise, etc. Close to the end of my shifts I would make sure my register was ready for the next employee which meant clearing my trays of hard tags and security tags and clearing my rods of hangers."
good,"Ross was more very customer service oriented, usually working the cashier desk, or picking up, helping customers find items or get dressing rooms."
good,"Repetitive, Loud, Management wasn't good, co-workers didn't speak English, Lunch was short, Fun part of job was the fast pace, didn't like not being productive."
good,"it was ok for the time that i was there i felt they didnt give me the benefit of the doubt all i could do was my best and thats what i did, but it was just a seasonal temp position"
good,The job was pretty easy going and laid back. The store was just unorganized and need new management.
good,"I constantly handled a high volume of customers while maintaining compentency and efficency. The hardest part of the job was effectively explaining company policies to customers. Althought this was difficult it was also one of the most enjoyable parts of the job because I loved negotiating and working with customers. Due to the high volume of customers I learned how to quickly scan, bag,and proccess payments while providing excellent customer service"
good,"Ross is ok at first, after a while it gets old. Hours fade into existence! If your looking for a suuuppper part time job that’s the way to go. It certainly isn’t an ideal stable job but it is something."
good,I learned that its a lot of standing on your feet. My manager at the time did work with my 2nd job I had. The hardest part is when the guest ask if they cant get a discount on something that is already discounted.
good,"Skeleton crews"
good,Ross is nice to work at but the pay does not compensates the hard work at the back. The store is the best place to shop. And it is a neat and good quality goods too.
good,"If you like the busy body type of environment this place is for you!!! Your there to unbox, hang, sort and tab clothes of all sizes and types. Everything you see in Ross comes at midnight and if you choose to work overnight you’ll be there all night putting stuff away and prepping the store for the next morning. It’s a great place for people who LIKE to work but keep in mind the conditions of your work place might not always be the spacious place you will be in very small places doing what you have to do"
good,As an associate you get to experience all the areas of the store.  Most of the jobs were easy to learn.  Of course there was always something new to learn.  The management however needs a little help.  There were some people that made it not fun to work with.
good,"Like all other minimum wage starter jobs . Crazy.  Messy  . All about customers that like to trash stuff. Early mornings,  late nights and everything in between."
good,"The stores were kept messy, very unsafe. There was a lot of robberies in the daytime and the security staff left at night before the regular staff which made no sense."
good,"My co- workers and managers were rude, unfriendly, and unwelcoming. It felt like I was back in high school, and was the new kid that nobody wanted to be friends with."
good,It's a nice place to work. The jobs are easy to learn. Great prices. All employees are friendly and get along with each other. Communication with managers is ok.
good,They ask for a lot and give a little.  Always want more out of you but when you ask it's always no. The manager has no leadership skills.  The Leaders are doing their best but the Manager keeps them under thumb.
good,"A typical day consistent with store oversight, projects geared towards what's upcoming for the season,customer service etc...Also handling incoming freight"
good,Good growth company however company culture is dissatisfying.  Room for advancement but limited to select positions only. Micromanagement from senior leadership.
good,"Poor Management, weekly changing schedule, below average  pay rate for the amount of work and expectations."
good,"Was a fun and busy place to work, however the communication from management could be better and the hour's that were promised we're both given, however the employees were amazing, always willing to help or answer questions when needed."
good,Full time positions are rare. If they had more security with hours this would be a great place to work. Keeping multiple people at part time is a way to avoid paying benefits.
good,"The pay is great, there is room for advancement, but only if you do not want to have a life outside of work. "
good,"I have been in several committees to help improve overall operations of the distribution center.   I have went through several training classes including a managing performamce"
good,"horrible management  i hated my job i was being called daily to the office and told that i need to give other employees up as if i saw them stealing, i used to tell the managers that i haven't seen anyone stealing or doing anything suspicious but i was told that i need to make up stories just to keep my job. only good thing about this job was employees getting 40% discount every 3 months."
good,"The position I was in involved coming in to the store before it opened to get my work done. The early hours and waiting on management to get there was difficult sometimes. Being able to work alone under very little supervision was a plus. I learned valuable skills from this position such as computer literacy and data entry. It is a fast paced, medium stress job though, as you are dealing with a companies money. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult management and there wasn't a culture for growth. But this varies from store to store. Overall though it was a good position for someone looking for something just to get by, but not stay forever."
good,Some coworkers understand my quirks and knacks when it comes to my interests when not on the clock and some do not. My language skills in both French and Japanese aren't paid adequately as well even though I possess these sought after skills
good,I loved a vast majority of my coworkers and we usually had a great time together and helped one another. Training could have been better but overall decent.
good,I used to work in the cash office and I found missing money in the safe and even though I was on camera and it could be verified I was taken out of the cash office and accused of stealing when I told her I don't steal and you're getting on my case we're having to stay longer then I'm scheduled but I found the money you were missing and instead of saying thank you get upset and cut my hours down to one day it took me out of the office
good,"If you need stable hours, don’t even think about it. The only good thing about work here is the discount and the flexibility. I don’t think that the management cares about the good employees. If you are ambitious and you are looking for benefits, good pay and get a promotion, this is not the place."
good,"the store was  great place to work.  The store manager had been in place for many years and knew her business.  Then a new District Manager came in,  one who managed by yelling at everyone whether they deserved it or not.  Many complaints were lodged across the entire district,  sparking investigations by the company.  It then seems that the 'confidential' information   gathered during the investigation was shared with the District Manager who then fired the store manager.,  followed by myself for his imagined complicity by me in the whole sordid mess.  So the good managers lost their jobs,  while the angry inappropriate District Manager kept his.  Very badly handled by the company."
good,"learn things, obtain experience, was a decent experience, not many hours, poor pay, large work load sometimes, free delicious donuts during inventory."
good,"Good place to work with lots of opportunities for advancement. Lots of benefits, insurance and direct deposit for paychecks. Provides double discount  4 times per year."
good,"Only good thing was the employee discount. "
good,"Although I enjoyed the job, I felt like I had very little support from corporate and upper managment. Associates are always favored over managment regardless of the validity, or lack thereof,  of their claims. There is plenty of education and resources for store presentation and other processes. There is no recognition for ""above and beyond"" work performance"
good,"The only big complaint really was all of the negativity amongst coworkers, always drama and gossip happening. As well as always being understaffed. Really takes a toll on you."
good,If u work for ross you will build outside of your comfort zone it's a very safe and secure environment so I always love to get up and go to work everyday
good,Only time they would approve overtime would be during Christmas or if you travel to different store with DM approval. I never got out on time and don't feel appreciated. Management tends to forget breaks and lunches which is illegal and I shouldn't be asking for it or when I ask its an hour over when im suppose to go. There is no leader and mostly they dont care about you.
good,"the policy is not clear, nor the goal of the same, with El Paso of the years I see that the working environment is maintained with a disaster, no good"
good,Its a pretty good environment to work in but unless you become thier personal sock puppet or are a female they will be a lot more leniant towards you.
good,"I was only here for a short period of time because there was no leadership engagement with associates. It definitely seemed like the management team had their favorites. I took it for what it was and tried to stay as long as I could, but eventually found better."
good,"Very busy lines, you are timed on how quickly you get customers out of checkout, two 15 minute paid breaks, 20% off all items in the store, friendly people to work with."
good,"Ross wasn't a terrible place to work at but 90% of the time I was stressed out since I worked in the stock room. Everything has a certain way to be done and not everyone was trained properly. If not lucky to be trained at all. We were really short staffed, thus affecting the work environment. Associates were constantly pulled to do other things, such as cashier, fitting room, give breaks. While also having really high expectations this could all be a lot to new associates. Only has a few issues with management."
good,I really like this job but I'm not getting the hours I need. The location I work at is high in shortage. Some of the employees there have attitude problems. Keep it professional.
good,Ross is not the type of job you can raise a family on. They expect you to work really hard but only pay you minimum wage. The management has favorites and give the difficult jobs the the new employees.
good,"They time breaks (which is normal) but ask you to do a perimeter check (for ani-theft) as you walk away for break....and they start timing you for break after leaving your register. Zero tolerance for being late even if it has never happened before. Favoritism was rampant at the location I worked at. Also, they can never keep the alarm pins off the floor and I stepped on a few which DID break skin. Manager was usually too busy to write any type of report."
good,"I have worked in retail for many companies, this is the only one that the standards or expectation are un-archivable. They expect you to do so many chores in so little time and with so little help or none at all plus provide customer service at the same time."
good,Ross dress for less would be considered a stepping stone while going to school and a job not career. It's unfair when you havd to come in because the person they hired never ahow up and barely get a wrekend off.
good,"Fast-paced retail store looking to move up there are opportunities long hours short-handed a lot of times."
good,"It was crazy on the amount of work there was to do with so little time, my manager was a very grumpy lady but this was a long time ago so maybe she changed."
good,"My location throughout always had a problem with favoritism when it comes to hours and promotions. I’ve been there several years and it took for me to hit my wits end to finally get acknowledged for my hard work and a promotion. Didn’t matter how many times Management was switched around, if you weren’t favored, the hours wouldn’t be there. As a part timer you’ll be lucky to receive over 20 hours. If you have another job, this would be a great place to work on the side."
good,they need to care more about the people that work for them. the managers need to think more about the associates development rather than just their own.
good,"Had 5 different managers in the 2 1/2-3 years I worked there. "
good,"I liked working at ross in the beginning until I started seeing unfairness and favoritism. I felt harassed by the store manager. Managers don’t know what they’re doing. You ask them a question and say “idk figure it out” or “you should know the answer to that” and they spend their whole day literally In the office and when you need something they take really long to come help, or they don’t help you AT ALL! Also gossip is a huge issue here so BEWARE who you tell your business too"
good,"There are roughly three different positions that one can apply for that aren't management. In my time of working there I had two positions, which are, sales associate and stockroom. The sales associate main role is to sort clothing articles into the correct size and aisle. The stockroom position required more skill sets. You were responsible for moving at a fast pace to unload all inventory items and sort them into the correct departments of the store. Overall, Ross is a perfect fit for someone who is newly out of high school. However, I would not recommend if you have bills and need a position that has job security."
good,"Showing great customer service, being friendly,and helping the customers get what they need. The best part about the job was the customer and how satisfied they leave the store."
good,I was hired as a seasonal worker.  I was told I would receive up to 25 hours.  That never happened.  I am a very sociable worker.  It seems I had to hurry up a do store duties as opposed to assisting customer with good customer service.  I love the store.  There was a click there.  I did my job was never late and am pleased to have accomplished the assignment.
good,A typical day was always challenging from freight being backed up due to not enough hours or employees not coming to work. What I learned was to do what you were told are you would lose your job.
good,"Ross Dress For Less is a great place to be employed. I really enjoyed working there when I actually worked. I was scheduled about on average 2 days a week, sometimes only 1. I was always on time and reminded my managers repeatedly about my open schedule. They still only scheduled me then same amount of days. I was scheduled 3-4 days maybe 3 weeks total from the time i started working there. I am a single mother with 2 teenagers to support. I was not even making $100 a paycheck so I was forced to find employment else where."
good,Was promised a promotion within 6 months of hire due to my qualifications and experience. Even after the promotion it was clear that it's not what you know it's who you know. Not family oriented or fair about work schedules of anyone but themselves.
good,This is a job for part time or high school/college students. You can come in work and be done. The skills picked up here are valuable as you need to be flexible and multitask to succeed.
good,Fun place to work they dont give many hours even when you ask though. They are not the best at schedule making either very incosistent but the stock team is a great group of people but managment there is terrible
good,"Working for ross store was pleasant until a new manager came. She just want to work with certain people. If you asked her for more hours she said she can’t do it, but she always give a lot of hours to some employees. The same employees that always take the lunch time to go to the parking lot to smoke weed and come back to work under the influence. She always is complaining about she is tired but she never do nothing. She is very lazy. The employees are unhappy but they don’t want to talk because they think she can fire them."
good,Pretty fast paced job with heavy traffic. Loss prevention always on duty. Environment is friendly and safe. Very diverse crowd. Nice selection of products in various departments.
good,"it was my first job, so i didn't realize until later how awful working conditions were.  customer service jobs always suck, especially retail, but Ross is still very bad. wouldn't recommend"
good,"I work as a Front End supervisor. My job is mostly to take care of returns and customer service. Making sure I give breaks and lunches to employees. Go backs are taken cared of. At closing time, I make sure that each section are neat and clean and ready for the next day."
good,It was an easy and fun job that taught me a lot about team work and organization but I couldn’t handle working overnight. My manager and supervisor were great. I really liked my co-workers too.
good,"Ross is Ross at any time, city, day.  It does not change. Stores are always messy. Not enough hours for employees to clean up. This is due to their projections for the day. Not enough hours, OK then we leave the store messy. It's an OK job but I wouldn't do this one again."
good,"Working with customers on a daily basis, returns, sales, pricing , inventory. Keeping the store tidy and clean. Helping customers find what they were looking for."
good,"it was fun while it lasted. Its just like every other job. worked with some great people who also no longer work there."
good,Not a very desirable job in terms of what was expected considering the low pay. My fellow employees were great and we tried to keep up each others morale. Many worked more than one job to make ends meet. Management wasn't always consistent.
good,A typical day working at Ross was scattered. I worked multiple areas in a day depending where i was needed. I was taught how to properly size and organize clothing based on gender and age group.
good,"Ross is very Flexible with your hours. All employees get along great. The only ting i dont like is they push us alot to finish work , when there is only one person doing boxes and not enough people."
good,"On your feet constantly, dealing with customers, products, questions, shrink, and management. putting things away, putting out new stock. checking customers out."
good,"I’ve work there for a bit of time , but you know from the start is a area we’re not everyone in on the same page even for costumer service, management is chosen by preference and not by skills or experience, everyone has an excuse for not doing their jobs , and the majority don’t do it well to."
good,Very fast paced work environment along with a lot of heavy lifting as well as a lot of memorizing is required on a day to day basis. You do get scheduled breaks and a lunch which is a big plus. Flexible hours and they will work with your schedule as long as they know in advance.
good,I was your average cashier/customer service person. I cleaned the store and helped customers. This job was really fast paced and exciting all the time.
good,Retail is all the same for the most part. Ross is better than most retail places I worked at. It was less stressful but I mostly just did cash office. I stopped working on the floor. Managers were easy to get along with.
good,"It got me by, but not a career maker."
good,"If you like retail jobs you may like Ross. They give a 10% discount for associates which you can use off the clock, and starting pay is $9 an hour. If you have good customer service skills you'll be fine."
good,Very different from previous assignments with similar companies. Lot of pressure with minimal appreciation.  Compensation is reasonable but bonuses are vulnerable and partially based on your supervisor's opinion rather than company performance alone
good,"Always busy, stressful. Most people are okay to work with. Management needs some work on. Benefits for full timers are good. Pay is reasonable. And scheduling is flexible"
good,The style of management here was stressful. The management cannot handle stress efficiently and would often times be heard yelling over an ear piece or even in the store. We were discouraged from talking or leaving our pods. Expectations from managers were inconsistent.
good,The location I worked at had only been open for about 3 months when I started. There was a very high turnaround rate for employees because many people seemed to be dissatisfied with the management/schedule. I personally was scheduled outside of my availability multiple times even though I had made it clear when I could work on many occasions. Fellow employees were fun to be around but we were understaffed almost every day.
good,Employees will create their own schedule which will result in less employees working during weekends. I will find myself being the only employee there during late evening until close and will be overwhelmed with duties. I had the opportunity to move up but I declined the offer due to not dealing with that kind of stress. If management played a better role then I would have stuck around a bit longer.
good,"Never a dull moment, always busy, most of the time overwhelmingly busy with too many different tasks.  Learning to multi-task.  Management was good to work with, but not consistent with what is expected of you.  Hardest part of the job was the hours they scheduled you, never the same each week.  The people were the most enjoyable part of the job, customers and employees alike."
good,this job more adequate for school student's that need a first time job and are ok with working part time. You stand on your feet the entire time that you are scheduled to work.
good,"Working in IT at Ross can be very frustrating.  The systems are outdated - very difficult to update. There are limited resources to help resolve the daily IT issues, which leaves issues unresolved for longer than 6+ months.  The focus on updating these systems in the near future is not very likely."
good,Management at Ross was consistently worried about the bottom line. There were never enough hours to do what needed to be done. You were supposed to magically make it happen.Store manager was only conceerned with buying things at the highest discount possible.
good,Ross pays way too less for the amount of work and effort that is required. Very short break time. Manager does not know how to help the stocker work effectively. Terrible training efforts.
good,Working in retail in general consists of all lot of productivity and constant daily work. I learned to multi-task and lots of customer service. The management was okay.
good,"Upper management (district managers) was ok, not personable. Quick paced work environment with high turn over rate. Challenges come with the limited employee work ethic and experience"
good,"Working in retail helps when you cannot find any job and you need to pay your bills. It is just temporary as a learning process, then, find another job."
good,"Ross is a good part time job. If you would in the stockroom, you should be ready to work. When the truck comes in, you will have to unload the truck and put the merchandise its correct places."
good,"Ross in general is a great company to work for, not going to lie but, it was often a stressful and irritating place to work.  Some managers played the favorites game and coworkers were dramatic and made too many excuses just to go on break and leave the team to struggle.  On top of that, customers were a real riot.  If you can deal with that definitely try to get that 10$ an hour."
good,"Great for students (College) or others such as retirees, veterans, etc. Wage is extremely low for quality and quantity of work associates are expected to perform. Most associates exhibit teamwork which makes the dream work! Some managers/supervisors are great tem builders."
good,The company continually changes policy and does not enforce equally. The culture is depressed due to lack of pay and lack of direction. There is also a culture of not promoting qualified personnel. It seems people are promoted as they are friends with management.
good,"I loved the discount! The worst thing was they never had enough cashiers, so the customers would get really angry. A lot of the time you had to  do multiple things at once. That's no problem though. All the positions are easy. However, it was stressful to have to do all the work by yourself."
good,This is a great job for anyone looking for temporary work. It takes a long time to get promoted especially if your a female. I got luck and was able to be promoted 3 times in 4 years and that is incredible rare.
good,"This position is very fast paced, especially during holidays and seasonal events like back to school. It is fun and you meet so many wonderful customers"
good,Ross is a fun but very place to work. You have to be fast and productive. Get along with co workers so time can go fast and you can enjoy your hours at work.
good,"Job was challenging, I lhad good store managers that were willing to teach the operations of the store. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers satisfaction."
good,"Ross Stores is about finding everything possible doing things cheap and fast.  They pay very low for what they what. "
good,Management changed frequently and I felt like I did a lot more work than I was compensated for. Also every week your schedule was different. You could go from 30 hours to 4 hours.
good,There was always more work then time in your day. I was constantly moving and always seemed way to busy for being paid part time. People who shop there just tend to do whatever they please but im pretty sure thats how most retail jobs are.
good,Ok job depending on the people you are working with. This job is for someone that is young with no bills or a retired person that is bored because the pay will not get you by
good,I worked at Ross for 3 years and never was able to get to fulltime hours. I applied for other positions and never was given the opportunity. I worked hard to prove myself but the manager had favorites.
good,"the management was not satisfactory as in they didn't clearly demonstrate to new employees the ""ropes"" of the store. it felt put together messily. i did not like it."
good,"A typical day at work, is to help customers with any questions or concerns. help them find merchandise. make courtesy calls. ringing up customers to a quick cheout"
good,You will deal with the most humble to the most irrate person in retail. A good place to start in loss prevention if you are afraid of tackling people . They are hands off security
good,Great stepping stone. But not the best place to stay. Staff does their best to work with the employees schedule. Good place for students to apply. Friendly staff.
good,They pay minimal for long hours picking up after others the entire day. You dont have a steady schedule so you cant really make any plans unless its on a week to week basis.
good,"Very little room for advancement. Average 20 hours per week, few opportunities to become full time. The most enjoyable part of the job is being a member of a team and working together."
good,"It is a decent work environment but depending on location and time of week it gets pretty busy and you have to be able to handle the pressure and work fast,"
good,"When I worked there, the management wasn't very good. You do have the ability to work up in your position if you stay determined and let it be known that's what you want to do."
good,"A typical day always consists of dealing with drama with the management team. Working here is like being back in high school, or maybe even kindergarten. Aside from all the drama, the job itself is easy-going. If management was run by more professional and respectable leaders, the job would be perfect."
good,I enjoyed working here most days. My coworkers were fun to work with and helped me when I needed them. The most challenging part of the job was getting the product out on the floor fast enough to the customers.
good,Ross is a retail kind of job. While working at Ross I was a cashier and customer service representative. Id say the greatest skills I acquired at Ross was learning how to work a cash register and customer service skills
good,"My typical day at Ross was mostly restocking shelves, being a cashier, organizing the store, ensuring the customers satisfaction and being a great team player. there wasn't really any difficult part about the job. Management was not very good."
good,"Customers are rude and indecisive, store is disorganized and managers are horrible. Very little hours are given . The amount of work that they not only expect you to do in the short shift is not only crazy, but theyre ridiculous."
good,The company has very poor management and overall customer service is very lacking. As an SPS (Store Protection Specialist) they ask much more of your job than they are willing to pay. They ask for military excellence in maintaining store security for barely over minimum wage.
good,"You make it your own. It's a lot of work at times if you're full time and some part time associates feel overworked. Management cares more about the company than the well being of their associates. Sometimes they work with you but more than likely if you can't meet their needs its like oh well with you. Not too hard to move up, if you overwork yourself."
good,"Overall company is good. The company have great programs in place to make stores a success, The issue is the company is running all programs at the same time .Often changing processes making it challenging for leadership to be on same page when it came to implementing programs."
good,Ross is a good place for a young adult to start out their career in retail. It would be a good please for a retired person also. The co workers are not so friendly even the mangers. You work in a very fast pace environment. Management is very passive when a problem arises. Ross is seasonal job nothing more.
good,"It was very easy to get along with all of the coworkers, but the store was not ran very well most of the time and there was not a whole lot of advancement within the store."
good,"I was a seasonal cashier a couple of years ago, and it was fine. I started at minimum wage. I wouldn't expect much more. There wasn't much training. I was just put out on the register, and I actually learn better that way, so it didn't bother me. For the most part, customers were friendly and patient. I greatly enjoyed my coworkers. The schedule was part-time, and not too demanding. Had to purchase blue shirts of any style to meet dress code, and I love blue, so it was perfect for me. The drawbacks: Low pay, not much room for advancement, micromanagement by management, but I find that's par for the course in retail. You're never trusted to do a good job. It was an OK experience, not horrible for retail. Would be good for a first-timer."
good,"Typical ross retail store. very busy store.  open till 11:30 pm."
good,"I loved working at Rosse's. It was a fun job. I also loved the discounts. Good work place. The staff members were friendly to the customers. We all worked together. The management would reward you for good work, customer service, and for being fast with working the cash register to get through your line."
good,fast pace good people not a full time job great part time place sometimes you need to do 2 or 3 different job.  you do work with good people mgr works with you they help you along with your training
good,Overall its a decent place to work because it works with my hours as a college student but the pay along with the minimal hours I get is not enough for anyone to survive off of let alone worth the gas to drive there.
good,"Typical day was delegating to associates on the different expectations of the store"
good,Not bad just management jobs aren't very good. They expect a lot &' the pay isn't good for all that you have to do. They have a policy to follow for every single thing.
good,"unorganized and not to fond of the management. it was great but at first but I'm definitely starting to resent working there, they don't give enough ours and always ""forget""to give breaks."
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross but the pay wasn't high enough, I needed more hours and they didn't give them to me and when I wanted to work in a different department, there was no room for advancement."
good,"Lots of turn over poor scheduling, etc. They don't make sure they are properly staffed and often and very short or over staffed so they make people leave prior to schedule."
good,A place to earn some money. A retail store so expect retail environment. Not a lot of advancement opportunity that is compensated accordingly.
good,"The stores management was not well. Stocking was very slow,employees were rude most of them didn't speak English so very hard to communicate. They were very picky between who they chose to give hours to.you were lucky if you were even on the schedule at all."
good,"typical day consists of clocking in and immediately getting to work, taking returns or purchases."
good,store was a mess all the time store manager could'nt have cared less. was forced to let shoplifters leave store with stolen goods.
good,"unfriendly working environment, limited amount of training and collaboration from coworkers. compensation is not good enough for the job tasks."
good,"The store and upper management outside of store are amazing! Advancement opportunities galore, I didn't have the environment I would like there. I wouldn't work at this location again."
good,"A typical day at Ross is fast-paced and very active. The staff is nice, and the hours are flexible. My co-workers are a pleasure to be around and management is decent."
good,The manager at this location was so condescending and so was the assistant manager. They don't care for their employees and that's one of the reasons I left.
good,"constantly asked for the hours that were available; but weren't given the hours as promised. close to home so distance of the location was great, but again no hours were given so wasn't needed,"
good,"It's an ok place to work. The people are nice and the customers are fun, but when we are busy, managers are not allowed to help us on the registers, so it get hard to mange sometimes"
good,overall the company itself is a great company to work for my only complaint is the management at my location had their set of favorite employees and the rest of us were unable to recieve the additional hours they got.
good,Its alot if work and even with moved up positions there wasnt a difference in my pay but more work for me to do. And i was working full time hours and it seemed like no matter how many hours i put in i never had a paycheck over 500 in a biweekly time frame
good,Management is never there when you need it. One time i needed help with a customer and the manager i called up to help me never came. She was sitting in her office eating chips. Hard to ever call off - even if emergency. They will make you feel really bad for it. Coworkers are great - management was the problem for me.
good,"Working here for a about a year I would say the hours may vary. And I can see favoritism. People only the ""like"" write True Cards to each other. This place is not a place you should be forever. But, it does help with having customer service experience."
good,Management didn't communicate amongst each other. Alot of miscommunication. However work was easy to catch on to. Hours were very slim. Checks were too small.
good,Ross was a good place to purchase from but working on the inside could mean another ball game. My manager was flexible but her assistant manager was really rude and mean.
good,"Good job, could be better pay. Lots of long hours during season, not a hard job just alot work. You will be working until the store is completely clean. And you can't leave untill all areas are finished !!"
good,"Ross's was a high paced place to work at. associates were great to work with, customers as well but management was never on the same page. hard to work under management that has their own individual agenda on how a store should be ran with policy's and protocol."
good,the hardest part was the overnight hours i couldnt get used to but the work was easy the supervisor was nice and helpful. it was pretty simple getting hired and orientation then training
good,"It was great working with other employees and doing work as a team, management was poor because they will not communicate well with employees."
good,"This a very fast paced company, focused on teams and development of its associates. Great 401k, and benefits."
good,"Ross was a great place to work the schedule was just not working for my daily life as a full time parent. I was liked by everyone, including management but when asked to step down because of my attendance I couldn't do it because it wouldn't be worth it for my family."
good,"Management does not seem to care about advancing or enhancing employee skills"
good,"Absolutely love the management team and the people I would work with, but the hours given were absolutely terrible. I loved that it was a very fast paced environment where you never ran out of things to do."
good,"You learn a lot about how to be a leader and self-sufficient. Clock in , start and finish your task, and clock out. It's not the best job but it's a job!"
good,"Ross  has no regard for associates personal issues in life when it has to do with health issues that may arise during your empolyment, should you develop a major health issue, as I did they had no no flexibility beyond you sick days or vacation days."
good,A busy work place with not a lot of help and low pay. The managers didn't know how to do there job very well. It wasn't a lot of teamwork with the co-workers. It was a lot of stealing going on
good,"I learned my cash handling skills here. Made a friend from a coworker. Worked really hard to move up, but never did. Good company to start with."
good,"Typical day at Ross included performing tasks way above my pay grade or opposite of what I was scheduled and being admonished for not doing them to management's liking or timekeeping. Everything is timed, and feedback is nonexistent unless you count eye rolling (TRUEcards and Employee of the Month is a joke and more of an afterthought than anything else). Way more stress than the job is worth but got me experience to move on in the job market. It pretty much did what I needed it to do at the time. All the full-timers offered management positions in my store decline because it is not the friendliest company to work for. The return policy drives customers crazy but the worst of it is that with a receipt within 30 days of purchase we pretty much have to take the item back even if it is used and gross. Not all associates are properly trained on what to take back and what to decline returns to and so we end up taking in items that are nasty and gross only to either MOS them or get mistakenly put back on the shelf (and sadly, it does happen because customer service piles up with returns, forgotten bags, broken products, MOS products not properly labeled as such and closing shift sales floor associates who have to run all of the go backs at the end of the night don't know what is what.) Really a lose lose for everyone."
good,"the store is always a mess, I learned that I wanted to get further, managers were pathetic no good leader qualities, co-workers were okay, hartdest part was dealing with favoritism from managers, the most wnjoyable part was break time"
good,"You come to work and deal with screaming children, rude customers, and a few managers that will try to coerce you into staying late. Ross is a place about major favoritism. To adavance in the company is rarely. Most employees start off as part-time and to move to full-time only if someone who is already full-time leaves the company. My co-workers, the regular customers, and the discount is what keeps me at Ross. Oh and the fact i need money. Haha!"
good,this place was a great work environment but the employees were very lazy and did not work together to finish any tasks at hand
good,"Overall management of the daily activities of the store, coach cashier, managing til registers, display merchandise."
good,"Opening the store and daily operations of the store. Inventory management, loss prevention, recruiting and training. Assisting in store remodels, openings and closings. "
good,Fun people and great employees not much of a supportive management. The hardest part was trying to keep up with everything in a short amount of time. the best part of this job was being able to have your own work place.
good,"The customers are the most difficult thing to deal with.  Ross is understaffed to keep the prices low.  Therefore the customers outnumber the employees big time! It also depends on the location. My location was out of control!  It was in a very diverse area some people couldn't speak English so there was a communication barrier and the customers were impatient and they would see it was only 2 cashiers working they didn't care they would curse and complain the entire time they were in line. They let their kids run wild, and they threw everything on the floor! The store had to be picked up all day long! It was aggravating. The best thing was the discount and employee appreciation weeks."
good,"Fun place to work, Great for a first job, Management good and nice people to work with. Fast Pace but good work environment"
good,"The Clothes are cheap so they aren't very organized, the management cares more about their quota then their employees. They work you to hard and long. When you first start you get 25 hours then in a month your lucky to get 8."
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers with any requests they had. whether it was finding the right outfit or helping them coordinate colors, I was always glad to help."
good,not a good long term fit for me maybe a good fit for others it fulfilled exactly what it need to fulfill being a middle manager at a fortune 500 company is for the birds.. little to no training.. finding out after the fact is no way to run a business everything is on the fly ..typical ??
good,"the hardest part with working for Ross is the type workers they tend to hire, which are people who really don't want work or don't care about the they produce."
good,"The position of front-end supervisor is okay. It includes a lot of work but if you are able to manage time well it's fine. Working for Ross was fun until we got a new store manager, in which i didn't approve of the way he handled situations."
good,Very hard to tell manager important things due to confidentiality being leaked through the company. Co-workers were great and some work more than others.
good,"Hardest part of the job is dealing with the favoritism and not getting paid enough for vigorous work. Fast faced environment. Coworkers are generally nice and helpful. Management could use some help but overall, this job has treated me decently."
good,"often busy like any typical retail job, the pay is not great but the job is fairly easy to learn and you are well trained to accomplish you duties"
good,"Management does not know how to train people. But overall people are very nice there. After you get the hang of it , it's a lot easier."
good,"The company is good, It all depends on the management. Not enough training upon hiring and to much favoritism with employees. to many rule changes."
good,"I like working at this job very much. I was hired as a seasonal employee so I'm not sure how much longer I will have the job, but for the time being I learned a lot of skills that I can use for the jobs to come. I learned how to process merchandise, which meant unloading the truck, organizing all the merchandise in the box from home goods, to food, to clothes and shoes for men, women and children, It's a lot to do and some times over whelming when you find out you have to work a 10-12 hour day, even though you were only scheduled for 4.5 hours. As you are doing your stock clerk duties, you're constantly being called to the floor to do what they call recovery, which is picking up all the clothes on the floor and putting them back on a rack, sometimes you have to showcase the jewelry to customers, and sometimes you are put in the fitting room for 15 to 30 minutes for the person to take their break or meal. If you are trained to cashier, you are constantly being called to the front to help make the line smaller and get customers out faster, Over all, I personally don't think the job is worth minimum wage because it is over whelming, but its not impossible. The manager of the store was nice, at times she would buy us lunch if we stayed late to get the job done. The stock room manager... well I'm not sure how she was hired because she didn't know anything to begin with. The co workers were over all nice, humble, but their were some who thought there was an I in team."
good,The pay is not all that great to start off. The hours seem to get longer the more I work there.
good,"I worked in this location for only 6 months before I began to notice that, more and more often, the management would schedule me for times I had in writing informed them I was unavailable. After being threatened with a write-up after declining to skip school in order to work a series of shifts, I left the job and focused entirely on my studies."
good,"clock in work clock out"
good,This job was okay they gave me a chance. I didn't find my calling here. I wanted more out of life and this place was not for me. It gave me experience and helped me gain necessary skills that are needed.
good,it was low pay and unreal expectations while in the stock room and my entire time there I was the number 1 worker as well as the stockroom trainer but I had 3 people who had never worked in the stock room promoted ahead of me as well as the would change your schedule on your off days and not tell you
good,"more than average work with a low salary, flexible hours. Nice people as coworkers"
good,"Fun place to work, good people. Not enough benefits for me and my family."
good,Working at dd's discounts was an experience... Pretty much what is to be expected from this type of environment.
good,Not  happy with this co. The coworkers were good. The sales floor was always kept clean.
good,"A couple of the area supervisors are very unprofessional, and the store system is very unorganized."
good,"Ross is a fast paced environment, and due to the opportunistic buying style, each day presents unique challenges in inventory management."
good,I enjoyed working  with the customers and meeting new people everyday.
good,Helping customer with their every day car needs. Unloading and stocking car parts. As well as helping customers in need
good,"Daily reports and training completed. Hardest part of job was when it was slow, most enjoyable part was the training. Management had poor communication and handled thing poorly but most of them did a great job."
good,"In store Merchandising."
good,"I would clean around my register, count the monies being placed into the register. I've learned to always keep busy,there is always something to do. The management was okay,never really had an issue. The hardest part of the job was saying goodbye to the customers. The parts I enjoyed most was being able to make customers smile."
good,"I tell everyone, understand what you are getting into. As a discount retailer, Ross is just that. Compared to other retailers, they do not compensate their employees to their skills. Also, as with any work place, politics are in play. You may be lucky to have a great store manager & district manager who are engaging and fun to be around that motivate you to do better, or you may be with someone that just wants to move up. I unfortunately experienced that latter. With this, comes integrity issues where things are swept under the rug and you are picked on for attempting to fix the issues. I have been a firsthand witness to cronyism and nepotism."
good,"Auidtors are generally left alone to complete assigned tasks as we have to discretely determine efficiency of personnel and procedures. At times we worked in pairs. The hardest part of job was the physical demand, walking, standing, lifting for 8 hours. The most enjoyable part was learning new techniques and teaching them to others. Management was sub par and inconsistent."
good,"job did not give me any benefits, my paycheck was always short"
good,Day to day is very simple. Basically a glorified door greeter. Management was good at my store. All helpful and kind. Co-workers were also very kind people for the most part. Hardest part of the job is knowing someone is up to something but not having the power to do anything about it. The most enjoyable part is physically catching someone in the act.
good,A typical day at work is challenging because of constant multi-tasking expected of me.  This job has taught me better time management in that I find myself doing more with less staff when others do not show up for their scheduled shift. I have found that some co-workers embrace the team spirit mentality while others simply don't. The hardest part of the job is dealing with demanding and irate customers but I have learned how to do this because of the many opportunities given at this job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the privilege to help the Senior community and their expression of gratitude for my assistance.  As for management....
good,"You put your stuff away and get straight to work. The management often forgets about breaks and you have to go tell them you need one. The people we get in the store are often rude and demanding. The coworkers and most of the managing staff are nice, but that depends on your store. After working there for 6 months, we were supposed to get a raise but it came once the minimum went up, so really we didn't get one at all, and the raise was only 10 cents. The hardest part of working was the customers. They would be right next to you throwing stuff around and placing some random thing from the other side of the store right next to you. While I was working there, multiple people came in after me, getting higher positions when they say they promote from the inside, not true. Honestly, there wasn't an enjoyable part to working there, other than the coworkers. We had lost half of our staff after opening the store, just from people quitting."
good,"Lots of work to be done, they will require you to do many job positions. The pay is ridiculously low, the work weak is minimal, But your fellow employees are very nice to work with!. The management can be nice, but! don't let that fool you!."
good,Very Fast Paced Environment
good,Its a small company and everyone knows everyone. A typical day is busy off and on. Its a pretty friendly place to work. My management is professional and all co workers respect each other. The hardest part of the day would be when it slows down. I love working with people so I enjoy that most.
good,"Whiel there is room to move up within the company, poor management and stressful work environments make this an unenjoyable place to work."
good,"Everyday was about the same. I was either in a department on the floor recovering or in the register. I would have liked to learn more. I learned how to count out the tills, use the computer system, shut down the store and manage the schedules. The management wasn't that great. Customers couldn't tell management from associates. The people were fun and friendly to work with. The hardest part of the job was the hours...They didn't give out much more than part time even if you put your time and work in. Again, I did like the people I worked with and the customers. They were always pleasant."
good,Working for Ross requires someone to be good with people as well as being able to multitask. Managment is not the best but everyone gets along for the most part.
good,I've learned so much in a year and few months. From part time associate in the fitting room to full time floor supervisor. What I enjoy are my daily customers that come to shop and ask me questions on what looks better or what should they buy.
good,"No good py or benefits for PT. I like working there, but only as a PT."
good,"Fun place to work, flexible hours, poor management, sometimes not professional, does include benefits for full time workers"
good,"I loved the people I would for, but I didn't appreciate taking on the responsibility of 4 positions and being paid for one"
good,Enjoy teamwork with co-workers to make things work and meet deadlines.
good,Speed unload merchandise and quickly run to sales floor. No time to stop and take a breath. Management very unorganized.
good,"Good Customer support and services, Loss prevention program is a joke"
good,"If you can bare with cleaning behind people who dont care or have the slightest hint of manners, this job is bearable. I worked for 22 months and counting straight without receiving a performance review or even getting acknowledge for my performance. Its usually after a year they review your performance and give you a raise based off of it. With this company you just feel like your stuck and undervalued. Also, working at target and other retailers, you get a 15 min break after working every two hours. But here at Ross they can schedule you to a six hour shift with no lunch and you just get ONE 15 min break. So they expect you to work 3 hours straight until your only break and the end of your shift. Its like they try to maximize how much they can get you to work rather than take into account your energy."
good,"On a typical day, it was very busy an always a high volume of people. I learned to deal with a variety of different people who came from around the world to shop in our store an I enjoyed overall the co workers I worked with they were very heart warming an helpfull when needed. The hardest part of the job was when it was slow an we would have very little customers at some periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact an meet new people an being able to help others when they needed help from me."
good,"Not sure about this job anymore, everything has changed and so has the staff."
good,I liked working for this company. Only downside is that they drop hours severally after seasonal.
good,"i like working their but want someting better, My coworkers are good people the employees that are company get treated better then us agency people."
good,"Great shopping area, Great prices, the hours are good if you are a flexible worker. Pay is okay. Mgmt are not too hard to work with."
good,enjoyed meeting new faces everyday and intercating with customers.
good,It's a okay job.. the discount is nice and working in a fast paced job is nice too.. the wages are a little iffy and depending who you work with.. overall it's an okay job
good,this job is very demanding for the the level of pay. they work you like a slave and no rewards. time you on getting merchindise to the floor not giveing enough time and write you up for missing time goals.
good,Managers are rude and pick favorites. Very messy store. Hard to pick up after customers because it's always getting dirty. You will almost always have to stay about 30 minutes to an hour after close to pick up items left on the floor because it is so messy.
good,They barely give you hours and trying to become Full time is near impossible. But management is fun and they make the environment enjoyable. A typical day for a part timer is usually 5 to 6 hour shifts.
good,"I learned how to work in a very fast-paced environment, and how to work under pressure/time constraints. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers, they made fun and interesting. The hardest part of the job was the customers, some were very entitled or rude. Overall it was a nice atmosphere but it was stressful and demanding."
good,"It's very physical work no matter if you're cashiering, fitting room, or management. Be ready to move.  I'm exhausted after a 5 hour shift in the fitting room! It's not just standing and helping customers in and out. Down time requires cleaning up and organizing lingerie, toys, and other tasks like putting out new clothes, toys, etc. If you work register, it's busy and constant customers, especially because of not enough staff working during busy times.  It's holidays now so the store is always a mess and not enough employees to keep up with all the work."
good,It is pretty busy and fast paced. No matter what department you are in; customer service is a must! You constantly have to interact with people- customers and coworkers. There is always something to do which makes the day go by fast. There are always great deals.
good,this is an ok place to work if your starting out no real growth in the company who you work with is a ]huge difference its a job cant say too much cause
good,"I like working at Ross, but the hours are terrible. They only give you 4 to 8 hours per week. If you want more hours you practically have to ask them every time you see a manager. Other than that, I enjoy working at Ross!"
good,"They didn’t work me nearly as much as i would have liked them too, but it was a pretty good environment and they taught me a lot about myself as a person, the staff was nice but the hours were not as i had hoped"
good,"Mainly worked the stock room. It was fast-paced and only had a day for training. Then I was expected to pick up everything by the shift. Corp. kept changing how we were to do things, which didn't always set well with the employees. The managers I had would penalize you if you called in sick or had any car problems by taking away some of your hours before they went back to normal."
good,"Focus on processes rather than the service level, not able to support incoming freight projections to any degree of accuracy.  Loss Prevention internally is very important to the organization."
good,It was okay working for this job. I quit only because they werent pay me more. But overall the company is great and has a lot going for it. If you want to go to school and work here it’s great for that
good,"Fun place to work.  Enjoyed the new campus, work environment.  Plenty of parking.  Security was very good. Enjoyed the new campus, work environment.  Security was very good."
good,"Ross encourages promotion from within. If you prove yourself and eager the learn new things from other departments, cross-training is always encouraged."
good,"Dan pocas horas, y muy mala gerencia y mucho favoritismo de amigos , no se si será en todos los ross pero esa fue mi experiencia."
good,"The only issue for me was the lack of hours. Almost EVERY position is part time, so the have like 1000 employees working 7-25 hours a week. One of my coworkers said that her pay check was only for 7 hours once. The ONLY benefit of working here is the discount."
good,The staff is well organized  and work hard to keep the floors clean and merchandise off floors everything looking nice and neat. Small place I worked at the warehouse .
good,"Most days were pretty great, but like most retail stores, rush hour was hectic. The scheduling wasn't so great, we were always somehow backed up, but we made it work, always."
good,"roll from fitting room and stock. Assist front end on register and roll any go backs, S.E.T. your department. Most difficult part of working here is dealing with difficult customers."
good,"At first, I enjoyed my job. The turn around is not great. While I worked there, we went through 3 different ASM and two different SM. It gets very busy, and more often than not, there wasn’t enough coverage. It is very fast paced most of the time."
good,Manager is awesome HR is slow. Also not many hours available. i noticed they hire in mass so hours are spred out thin. Great part time job. Not alot of room for advancements
good,"really fast enviroment, good managers nice coworkers, good discount but not good pay fro hours to much work. but overrall they were really good people i know now they pay much better."
good,The work is there but the management just put you to work with no help. They were strict on quota even on new people. It’s organized but there’s times it’s rushed and out of control.
good,Ross is a good company if you need a job that is production base I have been employed for one year because it was convenient for me and now I need to change of pace of something closer to hone I travel one hour fifteen minutes each way from concord nc to rock hill south carolina
good,"Its cute for a first job, but not as a career. Great environment for meeting different people from all cultures. The feeling is very rewarding when you help those out. Although, the environment was stressful at times, it was my co-workers that made look for a different position. Management was unprofessional same with co-workers. It seemed like they were more focused on workplace drama rather than the job itself. Every month, it would be something new that popped off. The managers were a joke, half the time they didn't know what they were doing. Some of them dressed inappropriately, a lot of them had foul language, the majority didn't know what was going on during the workday. It was getting so stressful, during the last month of my time there, my head felt like it was going to split in half even at the smallest thought of my job. That's when I knew it was time for me to go asap."
good,"Ross was an alright place to work. the hours and pay were pretty alright, and the job itself was not anything crazy. However upper management kind of sucked and made the job unbearable at times."
good,Working here as a manager is very unfair its about a dollar (of two if your lucky) above what entry level associates make for more than triple the work and expectations. You're given a bare bones team and expected to make miracles happen. A lot of good people work for this company and they make it a lot more bearable+
good,"its Ross, you can't really say much about it, I have jumped managers around 7 times alone and that alone shows a red flag for me, i had been there for only two months and a half and by the 8th manager, I was called into the office multiple times along with hearing from a co-worker that I appeared threatening to the manager , that he thought I would ""beat him up int he parking lot"". I would recommend it, but be wary."
good,Working with others and learning new things everyday. And learn things like cashier and fitting room. and working with good employees. And always made sure everything was clean before I leave.
good,"I worked as a store associate w/ Ross for nearly 2 years. The best thing I can say is they bumped up starting pay from $9/hr to $11/hr. Most retail companies do not pay $11/hr for store associates w/ minimal responsibility, so I thought that was great. However, management and certain employers at my location are corrupt. Drinking at work, taking constant smoke breaks, falsifying shift edits to cut down on payroll. If you are interested in being overworked and talked about behind your back don’t bother applying to the Quakertown location! I’m sure other Ross stores are great."
good,"Not an ideal main source of income. Hours are hit & miss, sloppy scheduling. Work 25 hours one week, 9 hours the next. Hard to communicate with management but workers make it a better environment."
good,"At Ross you are an employee number.  Once you are in the building you don't leave until you are leaving for the day.  You literally can't go outside once you are in the building.   Not to your car unless escorted to get something.  Even when you work mandatory over time, you still only get O-N-E 30 minute lunch break."
good,"As a store Manager,  i wouldn't get days off during holidays.  And if i do, i was told by my District Manager to come in after dropping my son off school to check up on my team. After the fact i communicated the lack of work some management would commit. Instead of support or partnership coming from Corporate,  my boss would just have me come in. I was salary based on 45 hours a week. I would work up to 16 hours a day!! "
good,they had no regard for working with someone's schedule. the pay was terrible. now real job security. would cancel shifts at random. my top management and district management was great. it was supervisors that were terrible.
good,"High paced working environment with a lot of stress and heavy lifting. Not for those that want to slack off, as it will most certainly get you fired from the store."
good,"Typically it'll be busy during the day.  Management wasn't all that good, they would have me all over the place. Sometimes I'll be on the sales floor, fitting room, and/or register."
good,"Not the best place to work. I work in the stock room and the only two things I can say are good are the people and the fact that we work early in the morning, which leaves me capable of attending school at night. "
good,"I enjoy working with my fellow co workers but the management has very poor communication skills and doesn't want to help collaborate with others. They try to be positive but when we don't produce of their standards, they'll be negative and talk down on you."
good,I like ross but sometimes there are days where i want to quit because management is so unorganized. Some days aren’t better than other though depending on who is there
good,"The store I currently work at (but will leave soon) used to be a thriving and successful one. I've been there for almost 3 years and we've been through 4 managers. 2 of them renewed the store and made the best in the district, but our current one SUCKS. She's the reason I'm leaving. She not a bad person, she's awesome, but as a manager she sucks. She was from out of company and she came in and flipped stuff upside down and corporate let's her get away with it... I feel like there's no structure.. And hours are always getting cut because we're not a high volume store, so there's that too..."
good,Its pretty good to work there i like working there is pretty stressful but people and co workers are nice sometimes. Whe coworkers dont show up their duties are given to someone working there
good,The job was great it just got really boring struggled to get people to show up for work always short staffed super busy at times a bit overwhelming a lot of standing around doing nothing
good,Just not into a very fast paced work environment such as this one. As a cashier they are ridiculously strict with making sure you perform up to standard.
good,"Its retail.  Hours are all over the place and no where near enough at my level to support myself, however, I needed to supplement my husband's income, and the discounts were nice.   Don't plan on getting a fair or timely review or pay upgrade at Ross."
good,Very unorganized place and employees are unprofessional and catty. There was no job training and I was pushed into the floor without much guidance and expected to work.
good,The colleagues and management team were nice. The pay was low for all the tasks we were ask to do. Overall ok.
good,"Boring, stressful, basic work environment."
good,Working at Ross has had it's ups and downs but mainly downs. The company itself does not care about their associates and the mangament is not the best I've seen. Personally my managers are great but while there are massive lines they sit in the backs and chit chat while we are slammed on the floor. I personally think that there is no place to grow with this store and there is no appreciation for anything anyone does. I've been working there for about a year and I also go to high school at the same time. This summer i am making a plan to work 5 out of 7 days a week getting two scheduled days off. Seeing how Sunday is the day that I practice my religion and it is viewed as a day of rest in my religion that i follow very closely I asked if I could get that day off and that would be the only thing I asked for. My management refused and told me it was my problem and I needed to figure it. That my religion is not a good excuse to have sundays off. I thought they would of noticed that it meant a lot to me to have that day off and would allow it but they simply refused. They don't try hard to keep their associates because they have the mentality that you are replaceable. I would not recommend doing this job unless you are willing to deal with the lack of professionalism.
good,"If you are looking for part time work it's not a bad place to work."
good,"I loved my coworkers to death and we all worked great together. Well it depend on which manager on shift. We had about 5 managers. Out of those 5 people, there was 1 person everyone had an issue with and it showed. I mean my goodness, I had customers complain about this specific MANAGER. It wasn't so dreadful unless this manager was on shift. They would make the entire shift so depressing and confusing all at once for everyone. I enjoyed my job,it just gotten to the point where I couldn't walk due to my injury, for one. (No I didn't get injured at work.) And two, the management was kind of all over the place. I need stability and order at a workplace. I like order."
good,The managers at Ross are rude and keep to themselves. Everyday I went to work happy and left work in a bad mood and stressed. They are always rude for no reason so there is no enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Pay starts at $11. There aren’t any raise opportunities unless you move up like to a Front End Supervisor, or area supervisor. The hours vary week to week if you are a sales associate. Sometimes they will cut hours and you can have 15 and sometimes the hours are decent and you’ll have 25-30 hours . (Speaking from a part-time view). Flexibility depends on the manager. You rarely leave at your scheduled time . It can be anywhere from 15-45 mins after your scheduled time depending on how busy the store is, the staff, the cleanliness of your area and the store. It can get a little frustrating to clean the store and customers will come behind you and dirty it up. Certain times of the year are busy ( I.e. Christmas, Income tax, summer)."
good,"the managers were nasty in most employees opinions, including mine, they dont really understand customer care there, and that is what frustrated me the most"
good,"Ross is a great place to work, you have to be fast at doing what you do. The pay is $11 an hour but you don't get much hours depending on how the pay roll is going. There are too many employees that don't get the hours they need. Your hours are not guaranteed, and they will not give you any hours if you ask for some. Overall it is a good place to work, but if you aren't getting payed enough for what you're working then the job isn't for you."
good,"Not bad if you need retaail experience.  I enjoyed working for this company, but the only down side is no full time unless you're management, and only pays min wage."
good,"is very fast paced when holidays, after the holidays they cut everyone's hrs and expect to have maximum 2 cashiers during the day and and about 3 people to close. very poor management"
good,"Did not feel safe coming to work most days. We are a store that does not prosecute so we have a lot of undesirable people shoplift on a daily basis. Have only four people working the store at once, always short handed, and weekly budgets limit the amount of people who can work."
good,"nice brake room with lots of room some times paid for lunch clean brake room with fridge not a lot of room in it though, old food did not get cleaned out"
good,I was a stocker for this company. the management was okay but the floor supervisors had very poor work attitudes. The company was pretty organized but the workers and supervisors were very unprofessional.
good,At Ross i would work in the stockroom and receive the opening truck. I was also cross trained to work the sales floor and also the registers on normal days as well as the busiest days.
good,"I Absolutely Loved Working For Ross Dress For Less; Mainly For The Little Discount We Received.. The Customers.. And The Location Of The Ross.. The Employees That Actually Cared About Their Jobs Made The Night Go By A Little Easier. We Can't Forget About Those Long Nights In The Dressing Room--With The Best Tunes Coming Through The Speakers! I've Actually Worked For Them A Total Of 2 Times My Entire Life. The First Time, I Had To Resign Because I Went Off To College. Lol Ross Has Some Really Great Patrons With Remarkable Stories & Adventures. You Always Tend To Make A New Connection With The Customers Over Colors & Patterns!  I'm Rehirable; So This Is In No Way A Biased Opinion.  "
good,I don't know what tell you about this job it was nice working there at one point but after awhile having to drive a 1 hour it no good on gas the pay is alright but not enough to pay all the bills. this job was really for me.
good,Management is very nice but even though we got extra raise this year pay still pretty low and corporate office is always requesting to cut payroll so the store is always short staff and you got paid less.
good,"The store is always messy no matter how many people you have working there. Sometimes you need hello t the registers and they won't go help you, which can cause angry customers. It honestly feels like you are getting paid to clean up after people and that is not what I was looking for."
good,"When I joined Ross, the company had just over 300 stores.  When I left there were over 1500 stores.  Changes are inevitable when a business grows, some are good and others are not, and Ross was no different.  Every fiscal year the minimum standards for deliverables was raised.  After several years the bar was set so high that making the minimum standard was almost impossible.  Long working hours and being expected to be available 24/7 were the worst part of the job.  Merchandising an ever changing inventory was challenging but very enjoyable.  Overall, unreasonable expectations, super strict dress and behavior standards (even in your personal time since you represent the company) created a poor workplace culture.  Working for a discount retailer did teach me a lot about problem solving, customer service and time management skills."
good,The store was ALWAYS messy which is stressful for me because I love organization. They hired so many people I could only ever get scheduled 1-2days a week and the pay was TERRIBLE.
good,"They expect more, for less.  Like most retail.  SMs are hands on.  Payroll budget vs, store standards are out of wack.  Terrible extended hours during the holidays.  Store open till 1am or later in December.  They have a huge emphasis on loss prevention, however do not give you the tools and payroll to reduce shrink."
good,The hours are flexible but managers would hardly review the proper availability of a person. Everyone is nice but the hours aren't that great. Hours will vary from week to week.
good,"I work on the Stock team at Ross, the duties required are very fast paced and physical. My direct supervisor is a very hard worker and truly shows the meaning of leadership. She is also fair and understanding. I enjoy the team I work with because we work together well to get the job done. What I least like is the hours are very unpredictable and can be very low some weeks. There are no benefits or paid vacation available for part-time, there is also no opportunity to become full-time on the stock team."
good,"They are growing quickly."
good,"My first store where I was hired was amazing.  Positive working environment.  Plenty of opportunity to grow within the company. "
good,I worked my butt off for this company and withing a span of a year only i was able to climb up quickly but majority of my work didn't feel appreciated by the company. You're easily replaced and they don't hesitate to let you know that/
good,Good place to start if your are looking to start off your career.  HR management is little up tight but for the most part good team to work around....
good,There is a buddy training system that is hardly followed for training purposes.  The chance for advancement is not much passed Supervisor.  Most management is outsourced. It's not really enjoyable to work here.  It's very stressful and you feel unappreciated.  I believe this goes up to corporate somewhat.  Full time opportunities are rare.  Ross has good benefits and offers 401K and shares in the company.
good,"fast paced, little hours, rushed, management  isn't so great. no benifits, can move up to manager but not worth it. if you need a flexible job with little hours ross is great."
good,"not so good they don't pay good and hours suck and lots of complaints about this job , don't recommend been here for a couple years and got a 20 cent raise and im a great employee customers love me"
good,"As an LP, it's incredibly tedious job. Alot is expected of one, all to not even be able to confront customers that are caught stealing. Also, 30 minute lunches are too little time."
good,Horrible communication skills here. I learned how to multitask and speak to customers. I allowed myself to put myself in the customers shoes to get the job done.
good,"I absolutely loved working for this company. I did not appreciate the manager who hired new people, asked me to train them, then gave the position that was dangled over my hear for a year to one of the trainees."
good,"Nice place to shop, nice people to work with, could do better as far as management staff goes. Fraud and theft is on the rise, so you gotta be careful of your surroundings and watch customers with returns."
good,"A typical day at Ross, Inc. is one that is of any retail place that you work for or deal with. You will have your days, where you will have good interaction with the employees and the customers and you will have the bad days where you have long lines, customers complaining when they come in the door. The best thing to do, no matter what position you are in the store, is to figure out where you can balance it out. I learned that in this business, you need to have tough skin and that not every day is sun shine and rainbows. The management staff where I was located was very helpful and understanding. I developed a good report and they were helpful in helping me get what I need. The workplace culture was one that was not very diverse. We did respect each others differences but the level of diversity was not that big due to may location."
good,"Job advancement is possible, like with every company your more likely to be promoted if your are relocatable. Average discount is 20% with 40% three times a year."
good,It's ok go through a lot of managers and lacks communication. When communications are good the store runs more smoothly and makes better work days. Love getting to know all of our customers as most are regulars.
good,Not a long term job unless looking for advancement or permanent positions in corporate. Heavy workload and not enough hours or pay to sustain day to day life.
good,A typical day at ross was very busy with limited employees. The line would be to the back of the store and i would be the only cashier. It was very stressful.
good,"When I first started there three years ago, it was a great place to work. We went through several managers and a lot of employees do not last long, i am on of the oldest who have been there. "
good,Lots of customer experience with this job. Management was not the best but not all stores have the same person. The hardest part of the job was working weekends.
good,My manager at the RISC was fantastic. The department was fantastic and couldn't ask for better coworkers. The hours weren't great but the opportunity was there.
good,"The training here is great when you first start and if you're placed on a team that is collaborative and fair, you're in good hands.  If not, watch out, you'll be micromanaged and the work/life balance becomes non-existent."
good,"At the beginning it was fun working at Ross Store, but later on everything changed, because of bad management the store was facing. "
good,"not enough work life balance at all, I did learn a lot at ross as a person, helped develop alot of people which is a great feeling, they really want to develop within the stores, hardest part of the job is getting others onboard"
good,I have been with Ross for 11 years and get paid $13.12 an hour on top of this low pay im a part of the manager team.................................................
good,"I ran the stock team for my store. I started as a part time employee. it was ok. But the pressures placed on you as a full time employee are a joke. But the pay was an even bigger joke. They expect you to perform miracles and not even receive decent compensation for it. I understand that its a discounted store, but come on. Its good as a second job or even for a student. But not as a career."
good,"very busy always. manager is always in the office. they'll cut your hours. very short staffed. I repeat, very very very short staffed. and even with short staff they still won't give you hours."
good,Overall I would say this job was pretty ok. It only got really stressful when they started timing everything you do in the store but other then that it was ok.
good,"The morning management was a bit of a drag. She didn't always have a professional attitude. You cant have a team orientated business, with a store manager with an ""on and off"" attitude."
good,"It's a good place to work at and there's room for you to grow. You can move from an associate to area supervisor in a matter of months, depending on your development. However, the management team always seems to fall short when it comes to dealing with problems amongst the associates. They're willing to listen to what happened but they won't do anything about it. They also tend to mess up the schedule but they are always willing to work it out with you."
good,"Hard stressful work "
good,As soon as I go into work is very busy nonstop working and very rude customer at time & I was very talkative to fix there problems or anything I can for them no matter what it is.
good,Good place to make your mark in retail along with learning the basics of running a store and making an impact on your crew.  The culture has changed over the years and customer service was not as important as it once was.
good,"The store I worked at did have some good supervisors and and managers. however, the supervisor for the overnight stock team was terrible. She made work almost unbearable. Staying in that work environment was not worth $8.00 an hr."
good,Ross is a face paced off price retail business with tremendous annual revenue growth. The business is hands on at all levels and you will pick up a lot of transferable skills if paired with the right leaders. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time to devote too training and developing your staff.
good,people are messy and expect you to clean up after them like children and dropping everything on the floor and ruining the merchandise and has to be thrown away
good,"Stock crew is very intense work and is extremely fast paced. "
good,I believe Ross is a very good environment for college or high school students who are looking for earing a little bit of money in their pocket and great discounts.
good,"Ross is a nice place to work. Time goes by really quick and there's always something to keep you busy. However, Ross has it's downsides when it comes to working there. Only a small amount of hours are given to employees during the week (anywhere from 4 to 9 hours per week). You are definitely making less than part time even though you are supposed to be getting 25 a week. Favouritism usually occurs in the work place"
good,"Ross is great to work for if your a student, Its not for anyone who needs full time. The pay is good for the area. The hrs isnt so good. 15 to 20 hrs a week if that, great during the holidays. Management isnt bad.  Just dont count on moving up."
good,"Ross was a very fun, but fast paced working environment, and isn't for just anyone, but for me, I loved working there for the first year and a half. The ability to be promoted did not rely on your experience, skills, or ambition and job know how, it was based on opionion of other employees and management that didn't always do the right thing when considering who was best suited for the job in question. The favoritism and opinion of certain employees influenced those decisions more than what really mattered."
good,"The senior leadership began to extreme micro managed every detail of daily operations. it did not matter how well you or you store performed they would still question every detail and require photo proof of compliance. They made up many new ""zone"" rules and added roll ups that were more labor intensive than could have saved."
good,the company was good to work for the co-workers were all friendly and understood what being a team is. it was fun to work there and only down fall to working there is closing and having to pick up the store and put everything away but that is part of everyday living
good,"Atypical day was folding and hanging clothes to be sold"
good,"Most of the people did not take pride in their job because of the wages that they were paid, so that made the managers lives difficult because of the lack of wages and pride."
good,"The schedules are up and down management only guides you enough to get the job done but not enough to excell to their level or beyond.Few managers are good and will stick their neck out for you, just not most.Dealing with thieves has to be the worst part on top of entitled customers.Theres's always room for advacement so long as you stay in their graces but those are just empty promises for a while from what I've seen and heard.Getting a raise is impossible and only come during your yearly review really.The job itself is very fast paced but can slow down and drag quickly, luckily upper managment always have a new movement or push going on in the store so it keeps you busy for the most part."
good,Seems like all they hire is ghetto people who do drugs. All cashiers have an attitude problem. Always asked to do too many things at once then asked why wasnt all of your work done..
good,"Ross offers 3 times per year double discount days.  daily discounts are 20%, for 4 days 3 times per year we are offered 40% discount as associates.  It is usually around a holiday so getting those great gifts are worth it."
good,"Shifts were often fast-paced, so it allowed the day to go by quicker. Unpaid lunches, but longer breaks. Employees were reliable and easy to work with. Management was fairly decent overall. However, I was not told until the end of my shift, and by a friend no less, that that was my last day on the job. Many of the employees were college students, myself included. Rather than asking when students were looking to move back, individually, we were all cut without warning, at the same time."
good,"The managers showed favoritism through how many hours they gave you and didn't recognize hard working individuals. They gave me only 8 hours for one week, which is hard to work with."
good,The employees were very nice. But some of the customers that would come in were very nasty and rude! And for the amount of money you get paid you shouldn't have to deal with that.
good,Ross hires too many people and give few hours.  If you can not give one employee enough hours why would you hire more staff.  This shows an employee that they are not valued.
good,"i was hired expecting to get at least twenty  hours per week ,they ended up giving one or two days out of the week for four hours each day,they stated off good for like a week and then downhill from there"
good,"Grants Pass branch was good in most aspects, however Ross as a whole has poor pay and opportunity for advancement. Management in Vancouver was horrible."
good,management is very disorganized and hours vary from 8 hours to 25 not very many full times slot open. but good for people with families and are in school.
good,"Management is fair,  clean and well taken care of,  they will work around your every needs,  they  give you special discounts that comes with coming to Ross which is nice , when employees come to shop on they day off."
good,"they are okay to work for,during the holidays its super busy but if you are lucky enough to work with the right people, its just like any other retail job."
good,"I work there for about 1 year in the night staff in El Centro , the management it's a little poor they give to much credit to people that doesn't  deserved and give very little hours per week like probably 12 if you are lucky , only in the Christmas they give good hours like 30 + but its only seasonal , good points are that they respect  lunch time, break I really appreciated that but overall its a good company if you don't have that much to pay , like if your still lived with your parents or a student and don't need that much cash."
good,All Ross associates get a discount of 20%. I take advantage of that opportunity. I am always shopping there and finding great deal for myself and everyone I know. There is also two times out of the year that Ross does 40% off for employees.
good,"Easy processes. Nice associates and customers. Very hard to adequately staff store with the payroll given. Unrealistic expectations from DM with no staff. As a manager, I am usually on the register or picking up thing off the floor. Very little management. Mostly just juggling numbers on a computer to appease the upper management."
good,"I learned how to work with computers and cashiers, how to orangize merchandise, how to set-up safety alarms. The management was good. The hardest part of the job was when the items came we had to open them and organize them fast. The most enjoyable was when we decorated the store."
good,I worked for Ross for nearly 4-years and I saw ALOT of turnover due to stress and other circumstances. Management was good to work for but I could tell just how stressful it got for them. All in all it was a good experience.
good,"A typical day at Ross would be hectic, fast paced but enjoyable. Management will always be on your case about you getting your job done to the T. The hardest part of the job is trying to do so many things as one person but the most enjoyable part of the job is getting through the day knowing that you did it on your own. You made it through despite all the things management asks of you."
good,It was a good place to work because i liked working with all my co workers but they do not recognize good work and dont like to give you a higher pay .
good,"The job was ok. It would be extremely busy sometimes, so you would definitely get a lot of experience. The customer were sometimes rude, but that comes with the territory."
good,Not the worst company but would be better if there were more opportunities for full-time and raises. Little to no bonuses. Low pay. Too biased towards female employees.
good,"I really have no positive nor negative about this place.  This place did exactly what I need it to do, get me back out on the workforce and build up my confidence level."
good,"Its a great job for someone in need of a job . Very busy, there is always something that needs to be done . On your toes a lot.  Meet a lot of new people everyday."
good,"Standing in front of the establishment monitoring all individuals. I learned that no matter what you think or feel about an individual, everyone is suspect. Management needed a little more work towards professionalism and customer service at that particular time. The hardest part of this job, was not being able to trust. Meeting new people is always enjoyable."
good,For the amount of work that is put on us employees we don't get paid enough. We are always short staffed therefore making it harder on the people at work.
good,"It was a good job, but to many problems among workers over who's favorites and who works less or who works more. Schedule was all over the place and didn't respect the availability I had."
good,Ross is a very enjoyable work place. Everyone is so helpfull and friendly to be with and around with. Got to expirience new stuff and meet many new people.
good,"its fast paced and also a little stressful not knowing if you're going to work the next week or not. not only that depending on the position mine, was stock not worth it"
good,"if a person is not used to working in a fast pace environment with very demanding customers, this place is not for you. if you like moving around a lot, doing recovery and always implementing new things, then it would work for you."
good,"Decent pay, great co-workers just a lot of useless things they throw in with your day to day. You get a great discount 20% off year round and 3 times a year you get 40%."
good,"Working at Ross isn't the best place to work at but it also isn't the worse. The job is very stressful at times and hours given to us are faulty. The reason why the hours are so faulty is because of ""payroll "" or at least that's what management says. I definitely could not make this a career job. This job is best if you just want a little extra money on the side that's all."
good,"The ross team is great, but pressure from corporate continually stress employees without providing adequate compensation. Those in positions of authority can be taken advantage of"
good,I gained experience supervising employees and dealing with inventory.   It was hard to get the hours I needed to pay the boybills.  They only wanted part time employees.
good,This place is fun to work at when you are fresh out of high school. getting to learn the work aspects and how the company works. Management is very informative and helpful.
good,Communication is key when it comes to talking to the manager and being very thorough about your work! I like working here and it has a very high security.
good,Ross was a great work opportunity to get the retail experience needed to pursue greater goals. The management was unorganized but overall it was an okay experience
good,Enjoyed my manager he always knew he could count on me. I had keys to the store and always had it ready to go in the mornings when he came in. I love the people that I worked with and felt the same in return.
good,"Decent job for students, but a lot of unprofessionalism happened in the work place. It felt like I was in high school all over again. Tip: Just mind your business and you'll make it."
good,A very fast-pace place to work at. Always on your feet. Moving from assignment to assignment. Have to get a certain high score on your cashier performance. The hardest part of the job is cleaning the store after a long day of being busy. Management is not exceptional but okay.
good,"Metrics above employees. Ross wants everything to be perfect when no payroll is allotted. This company has alot of potential to be a GREAT company, but Regional managers employ the wrong district managers which then employ the wrong SM which then cause low morale and high turnover in this company."
good,"Fun place to work, could be hard it time but I would already get though it and move on to the next thing. Left working there because I was going to have a baby. would of went back but I did not want to put my daughter in daycare at the time."
good,Well a typical day consists of opening or closing depending what my schedule calls for on that day. Also monitoring each associates work and making sure that each employee has been given all of their breaks according to the hours they work. Making sure customers have what they need and are being rang up properly and efficiently as well keeping up with the maintenance of each department.
good,Job expectations extremely low causing management to accuse of cheating when excelling at job function. Rollers and Conveyors constantly break down. Hardest part of the day is dealing with supervisors.
good,Typical day at Ross started at 9:30 a.m. and ends at 2:30 p.m. it starts with unloading a truck full of merchandise. We separate everything by their department. Then we run it to the floor and stock the shelves with the new merchandise. The management was terrible and there wasn't any chance for promotion. The job itself wasn't difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers.
good,"i been working there for almost 3 years and to be honest i dont know why am still there. i have been there since the store opened and i have seen so many people leave because the store is a mess. the managers dont know how to manage, its a mess. the only time things get done is when the distrect manager is in town. appart from that for get about it."
good,"To my knowledge most employees are part time or seasonal workers.  Work hard, fast and under a time limit as well as an allotted amount of hours.   Managers tend to be slack on some things were others are not, sometimes creating confusion in rules and other standards.  Pay was ok but not satisfactory current times.  It was difficult to get many hours as a stocker given an allotted amount of hours each day  based off an algorithm and not the amount of inventory.  Most people that worker there were good people and easy to get along with.  Employees that deserved to be promoted to higher positions but were looked over, and to see people hired for those positions outside of the store was very detrimental moral."
good,"the environment was very fun because of the employees but the mangers do not know how to communicate with one another. Also, you have managers that constantly talk about other employees business , and few managers out to get other mangers positions. As the new associates would get hired many would soon quit because they would be overworked and unsatisfied . To be honest the place is   understaffed and a mess"
good,"A good company to start with."
good,There is training for everything buit no advance ment opportunites or pay benefits. Also many people in this company act as if they are in hs more for part time or hs students.
good,"I would monitor security cameras ,train employees on loss regarding loss , watch for shoplifters ,watch for employee dishonesty, recorded daily ocurances , dealt with law enforcment when necesary"
good,"This company is fine to work for, but definitely not anything to write home about. I feel like there's drama everywhere. Our management doesn't seem to communicate well. Pay is decent but if you're part time you never know if you'll be working 20 hrs a week, or 5. If you're needing a steady paycheck PT here probably isn't for you. It's easy to get hours during the holidays or busy seasons, but come the slow times of year you may only work 1 day a week."
good,"I learned , how to react with different types of customer ,how to manage money during a busy setting ."
good,Sucks- not enough  hours for someone with a family.  You will def need another full time job.  icro management is crazy maks you feel like your not trust worthy
good,"Eventhough I like what I did I didn't like some of the people who got hired. But, however I remained professional and made sure my job was done and done the right way."
good,"It is constantly busy and our customers make a mess of our store. I didn't receive any training, however the job is fairly easy. Management is nice and so are my coworkers."
good,Theres always work to do so you never get bored. I learned a lot and they give you a 50 cents raise every year.The hardest part of the job was communication nd authority.
good,"Manager pick and chose who they enforce the rules on, and when they want to be strict. The hardest part of the job is having patience, and some co workers make it hard to get along with. The only benefit is they are flexible with your schedule. Ross is only a good job for the holidays and for a side money not as a full time job to pay bills."
good,"great nothingno neon happy fantastic It was absolutely wonderful. It was definitely nice at tiumes, I am not sure what else you want me to say All I anr"
good,Processed  and  place  the  merchandising  in its  correct  places.  IT was  easy  calm .days  even  on a  day  of  havoc  the  stock  crew  themselves  made the  day  . They  worked  hard  and  made  a  dark  deary  room  full of  new  things  fun  and  on  a light note. I can  only say  that  management  wold  not  follow  availability   even  when  going  to school. they  would  change  schedules  without  notifying  the  person  and  write you  up  for  it. Management  could  be  better.
good,when being interviewed for this job i was told i'd be getting 28 hours a week part tme. After working for several weeks the most i was getting was 16. I was very diappointed on how hours were managed and all over the place. There were days i only worked for fours hours.  overall not a good experience.
good,Everything is constantly moving and there is rarely anytime to try and finish one task at a time. I learned better money handling skills here. The management team is helpful but at times they are always busy in the office so you may not get to see them that often unless there are concerns. The co-workers are friendly there are some that can make the job more difficult at time though. The hardest part is not getting to complete one task because you are constantly being pulled different directions which means you will have to stay later by the end of your shift. The most enjoyable parts are the parties that are thrown from time to time and the end of the night clean ups because no one is there to bother you so work gets done quicker.
good,Overall Ross is a great place to work.  My store has seen in increase in theft and they aren't really doing anything to protect the workers. They don't pay that well. My safety and well-being are making me make the decision to find a new job.
good,"Great people to work with. Flexible scheduling most of the time, except in the busy season."
good,Not much to say. It is low end retail. The customers are the real problem. They leave carts full of random items that you have to sort and put back to the floor. They will constantly throw full isles of merchandise on the floor. They will ask to speak to a manager and when a manager shows up to address their complaint they immediately start snapping at you and being agressive no matter what you say they will continue to belittle you and tell you that you are not listening to them. Customers are overall probably the worst part of Ross dress for less. I enjoy working with most of the employees most are just trying to make a little extra cash on the side as a second job. Some are there just to make a quick paycheck. A lot of seasonal and temp employees like most retail.
good,Low pay and no room for advancement. This company is unorganized big time...............................don't waste your time
good,"Typical work day would start off,  by seeing if there was any incidents the shift or day before in my reports. take a brief walk through the store to make sure everything is ok. Management to me could of been a little better, seems like every one knew each other, what made it an lazy work environment, didn't really talk to coworkers because I was the new guy so it was hard trying to fit in., hardest thing about the job was standing in one spot the entire day and couldn't move. but overall it was ok."
good,It was cool working here but the pay should be increased we worked very hard not to be compensated the right way we even out the store together but $9 an hour is unacceptable
good,"a typical day was working as an associate putting clothing way from the fitting room and relieving the fitting room for their break, i have rang register and customer service, i have also done security for a little before i left checking employees bags before they left, checked for stashed items that people were trying to steal, and greet people at the front door."
good,It was okay...it was just a summer/seasonal job that I did when I was home on break from school. Great discount...throughout the year
good,"Teach you patients and customer service but everything else is horrible, its mostly the customer that make it that way. Co workers are alright. My AM was so dumb, didnt do anything ever."
good,"A typical 8-hour day including exerting myself with minimal recognition.  Received about 8 hours of training that did not cover essential information that I had to learn on my own. Three out of the six managers deserved the title ""manager"", the others seemed to take advantage of their high positions to participate in non work-related activities. At one point, the manager responsible for scheduling scheduled me to work a mere 4 hours a week for about a month.  For an independent, full-time student athlete, it was incredibly challenging to survive. There was much gossip and disrespect among the employees; some argued and swore in front/nearby customers. Co-workers would steal from other co-workers -- I was not aware, nor warned, of this occurrence and, unfortunately, paid the price by having money taken from my wallet. Co-workers would take advantage of my dedication and work ethic to leave their posts and participate in non work-related activities, preventing me from completing my assigned task(s). Co-workers would sometimes dress in inappropriate attire (i.e. black denim instead of slacks) and not be reprimanded. The one time I wore black denim was because I was unable to wash my dirty slacks and I was immediately warned by my employer to not wear denim again. There seemed to be much favoritism among employers and employees; those who got along with the employers were able to break rules with no consequences and received constant recognition. As an employee I worked exceptionally hard and received little to no recognition. The hardest part about this job was learning to cope"
good,"the team is friendly, the job it's easy, not much opportunity for moving up... The management team is a good team, my co-workers are very friendly with me and each other. The part that I enjoy the most at work is working in the cash office in the early morning and after that helping customers on the sale floor"
good,"This store really does carry good product at decent prices.    Makes"
good,"I like interacting with people, makes the job easier. It is great atmosphere, the only con is that the team management do not treat the associates equally. there is favoritism."
good,"worked in Assembly line for 3 years through DMSI at very low wages where no one was able to work under that manager and finally the CP of the ROSS appreciated my patience and changed my department where the manage was really nice and appreciative . "
good,Working there was always busy which i loved. I also loved doing returns and customer service. It was very unprofessional there with drama but other than that alright.
good,The job has no room for advancement. The managers are very selfish and the money you make bi-weekly is not the worth the time and effort you put into the job
good,"Busy retail position whether on the sales floor or warehouse."
good,"A typical day at work would be me clocking in, and after clocking in I proceed to the lunch room. when in the lunch room I  wait until all the employees from 1st shift have left, then I go to my work station, at my work station I wait until the bell rings and clock in. once everyone is clocked in were assigned a scanner gun and certain amount of trailers to load, and were begin working. breaks are given a 7p.m. and 7:30 p.m., when the 7 o'clock group gets back the seven thirty group goes. after your break you work our shift until its over go to your work station clock out and clock out at the door."
good,"I learned leadership, team work and ensuring customers a true shopping experience. my co workers are good people. management team is great. hardest part of the job is satisfying the needs of such a high volume of customers in a short period of time"
good,"Never wanted to advance... the management is to difficult to deal with,unpredictable. Just wanted dependable work five days a week.  seems  now they have cut back days and hours once we got the minimum wage increase. Do not any longer sufficiently train new employees...and it doesn't seem to matter anymore."
good,"I learned more data entry. My management didn't really pay attention to the associates enough. I heard nice and helping coworkers who helped me learn the process , the hardest part about my job was putting alot of pressure on myself to complete my assignment on time and correctly. My most enjoyable part had to be learning more thing , I like learning new things and the challenge that comes with it."
good,"My day starts off with doing my "" Start"" which is sizing, After I finish that I go into the back "" stock room"" and if there is enough time i run left over product if not i hop right to work on the hardline and begin sorting and placing items on their designated hummers and running them i continue to do this till they is no more boxes to be sorted or hummer to ran"
good,"Usually stays busy , Wouldn't be my first choice for a job, Not enough pay for the work you do , Not much appreciation , Will meet wonderful customers"
good,"No work life balance, Management were not open to ""new"" store employees. Horrible experience. I did learn about budgeting, store operations, and top of the line customer service."
good,"You start off with very little training and I notice this can either make or break you. If you stick it out then doing task over and over get easier. Alot of new people quit and coworkers tend to call out every now and then and that makes your job a little harder. It irritates me how they have you do the job of two people."
good,typical work day and flexible hours. busy weekends and normal retail experience low pay. benfits could be better but the opporturnity provide valuable customer service experiece
good,Not to keen on incentives for good work but if your only looking for a part time job this is perfect. Its difficult to move up but of course not impossible as long as you get in front of the right people. Which is considered a challenge
good,"Quite a lot of work to do in 5 hours but you have something to do. A typical work day is about 75 boxes of shoes to tag and put on the shelves, and around 30-40 boxes of furniture to put on the display stands. There is anywhere from 10-15 carts (3 shelves filled with merchandise) to put on sales floor. I learned that there is more to clothing store than just putting clothes on racks and shoes on shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job is my 15 minute break and 30 minute lunch, if I'm there long enough to have a lunch. The reason why is because my last job I worked 8-11 hours a day without a break or lunch."
good,"I learned how to hard tag the apparel. Put merchandise on the floor. Fitting room, help customers. Also, be cashier. Sort out accessories."
good,Ross has it's pros and cons. I am very grateful to be work for the company. Ross offers opportunities for anyone who is needs a second chance and is willing to work. The work and job requirements are definitely worth more than what the associates are paid.
good,would get to work early and go to back of the store and sort out clothes while putting hangers and hardtags on the merchandise and by the end of our shift we had to have all boxes done and put out on the sales floor.
good,"Working here ended up being more hassle than what is was worth. You NEVER get off work on time. Sometimes one hour over. It is fast paced, which is cool, but can become really stressful due to low amount of staff on duty at all times (besides holidays). There was no diversity where I worked. Everyone was black and a female (except there were 4 black males). They didn't even care that I had death in my family & secretly fired me because I didn't show up to work like they wanted me to (after I told them about the death in the family). Being fired from here was a relief, though. It was beginning to be too much for only $200-$230 every 2 weeks part time. I'm sure all of them aren't this way, but never again..I'll just stick to shopping there, not working there. I was there for 1 year."
good,Very little room for advancement. You are treated as a unit of production and not treated as person. The goal is to squeeze as much energy out of you in an 8 hour day.
good,"Cashier, size clothing, organize the retail floor.  Greet customers, assist them in fashion choices.  Organize and display merchandise."
good,I believe this company was a great part time fit for me they were a good company to work for but they don't back up there employee's as much as there customers
good,"If you are an SPS there... The pay is better and you do less work. Managers contradict themselves a lot. A Typical day at work is standing in your post for a few hours and watching to see if someone is stealing. Dog, I swear to God I do not feel like writing this review right now man, but I'm going to so that this thing can stop asking me to add more."
good,"Over worked and under pay. Lazy management"
good,Very rude customers at this location. I had to fix aisles and cashier at times.
good,"Clocking in and begin with assign assignment to organize sales floor for customers, then go to the stock room to help unload truck with merchandise boxes to get out to the sales floor as soon as possible. The majority of my co-workers are team players and help others without being asked or told. The hardest part of my job is that it gets intense and overwhelmed but I have learned how to overcome and deal with many different types of personalities while continue keeping calm and completing my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we keep busy so it makes the shift go by quick with an awesome stock room manager that shows great appreciation to her stock room employees."
good,This job was very stressful. I did not like it at all. I enjoyed my coworkers.
good,"Interesting place to work, great co-workers."
good,"I have learned a lot about managing and measuring work. The hardest part of the job would be time management, knowing when to let a task that is not so important to go, to make room for a task that can become more urgent. The most enjoyable thing about my job is the energy that my associates bring to work every day."
good,helping people find their treasures and seeing them smile. working in the stock room and getting treasures ready for the sales floor
good,"A day at Ross dress for less in my area is always a busy day."
good,"hard working, tending to customers, putting on and pulling items off shelfs, and running the register. organizing shelfs cleaning spills and sweeping floors. i have never had my patiences tried so much working at one store and the hardest part was overcoming the obstacles placed in front of me. Example is customers are rude and don't have any respect for the workers and treat the workers less then people should be treated. The rewarding part was working with the people and letting them see how much of a help i could be while still holding on the my integrity by not letting their problems get to me."
good,"assisting you with hard-to-find items, answering questions and ultimately getting you to buy what they're selling. They provide a variety of services, from helping you pick out items to ringing up your purchases. Like cashiers, retail sales associates use cash registers to process transactions and are responsible for keeping track of all the money inside."
good,"Long work sessions, Great hours, Not enough employees, Customer Service and handling good personal communication with other people all over the world. Short breaks not enough benifits/medical not enough percentage of employee for personal discounts"
good,"Fast pace environment, processing transactions and ringing up sales for customers, cleaning sales floor"
good,I love most the people I worked for and with. However I feel that the 25 hr mark is lame and doesn't let one who is part time live and the payroll cuts are ridiculous. I think anyone can have a future with Ross but you feel like you're nothing unless your full-time because it's true.
good,"I won't completely bash the company for its professionalism because I don't want to be bias. I've learned a lot from this company, most of my experience comes from this work place. Working through the agency the pay wasn't good considering how much work I did. Besides working as a Unit ID'er you are asked to do level 1 and 2 job assignments if help is needed. Level 1 and 2 jobs included offloading, marking, sorting, releasing, and even packing. None of these positions were bad of course because experience always good when advancing in or outside of the company. "
good,Never enough time to do what you need to do. They expect you to do the job of three people.
good,"They pay as low as possible, but if you worked hard you can be recognized/promoted quickly."
good,Ross was a fun store to work at the employees made the work environment very friendly and laid back. I loved the music the store would play while working gave me motivation throughout the day.
good,"Although it is a very stable company, I would say that the corporate culture is not very good.  Very old fashioned style of business, with not a lot of flexibility."
good,Helping customers and making sure that they walk into a nice a clean store where they are able to find things in the treasure hunt. I learned to make sure that everything has a purpose and all the rules and responsibilities are necessary. The store manager was very helpful with my learning abilities at the store. My co-workers helped me to progress and continue to accomplish everything that I had to. There was no hard part to the job everything was learn-able and the most enjoyable part was seeing smiles on the customers aces as they walked out the store.
good,Ross has some issues that need to be fixed within the company.
good,"It's a good job to start out at when you have no job experience but you don't get any hours & it's minimum wage unless you're a manager & then you get a lot of hours. They say they'll help you advance to be a manager but they don't. At least in the Panama City location. They know how to put you on a good guilt trip in any situation. Especially when the main store manager came in to check on the store. They were always on you about everything but they will forget about something important on your end. Also talk about drama....They would forget to give me a break at times. The benefits suck...It was always busy. Very, very busy. Had a huge cart of returns that always needs put away. It's okay when you're on a register & the day goes quickly unless they ask you to stay longer because there is probably ALWAYS someone calling off & it never seemed like just 1 person but 2 people. Doesn't make sense."
good,"Co-workers work well, "
good,"Ross is a company that has room for advancement, however the pay is a bit discouraging."
good,"Enjoyable experience, fast pace work atmosphere. It was nice."
good,"Typical day at the office- "
good,"Very hard work, you must have a lot energy to work here. Constantly Busy."
good,"a typical day at work involves friendly customer service, cash handling and doing everyday retail duties. This includes restocking, scanning and repricing returned items. Management is pretty easy going and so are my co-workers. The hardest part about the job is the small compensation as well as the fluctuating hours. The most enjoyable part about this job is getting to work near people and being in a busy environment"
good,When I came in I had to immediately begin working on register in customer service. Check schedule and hours and breaks to make sure I knew when cashiers had to be rotated.  I learned never to be under a new manager who really didn't know how to run a store of that size.  Co-workers were great some very competitive for your job. the hardest part of this job was never knowing what my schedule would be from day to day. It often changed in the middle of a shift without notice.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers.
good,I usually ran around picking and re-ticketing clothing that was thrown around the floor.I also was front end lead which meant I dealt with customers who had returns and most of the time who were angry. Don't get me wrong it wasn't that bad I enjoyed most days.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me preparing the deposit and cash registers, receiving stock, cashiering and supervising the cashiers, attending the fitting room, and recovering the store. I learned quite a lot while working here but the most important thing that I learned was to try to make the customer happy the best you can. Management was always friendly and always willing to help. My coworkers were amazing."
good,Ross is a good company. I enjoy working there. The management does a great job with this company. I enjoy my co-workers and for the most part the customers are enjoyable too. The hardest part of working at Ross would be the pay. 
good,"Managers show up late for work, making their employees late to clock in."
good,"Morning reviews with management and staff, complete walk-thru of store and storage areas. Detailed paperwork of shift and 100% customer service."
good,"Every workday started with a store meeting with all employees during the first 15-30 minutes of regular business hours. This meant that customers were shopping, asking questions, doing returns, and checking out during the meeting. After the meeting I would rally the stock team, which was typically under staffed each day, and advise them of the daily workload, expectations of completing that workload and assign each employee a position on the stock team for off loading freight. Management was overall friendly and supportive of the staff. Co-workers were typically upset with management due to lack of proper training, constant understaffing, misscheduling, and assigning employees to departments they were not familiar with. The mood in the stockroom was overall relaxed and very team oriented. Goals were generally met and the team seemed to be satisfied with their performance."
good,"I spent too much of my paycheck on product, and loved the staff."
good,allowing myself to grow in sales. dealing with great customers and difficult ones. learning great customer service.
good,not much room for improvement little to no compensation or benefits not a very flexible work scheduling
good,"Stock merchandise, cashier, loss prevention."
good,"During my time here, I worked mainly in markdowns. We would scan each item in the store checking to see if its price had been reduced. Occasionally, we'd help out in stock, unloading the truck or processing apparel. Back then, we had to dress up (skirts, slacks, dress shirts, etc.) and wear dressy shoes. It was ridiculous trying to receive a stock truck dressed in flats, a skirt and pantyhose! The managers were pretty nice, except for one who found a way to do LESS than nothing. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you're wanting to gain job experience or just want the discount."
good,A typical day at work:
good,"I learned a lot o f my management skills with them, and I also had alot of time to learn how to work faster and to help customers more"
good,Arrive at work and relieve the agent on duty and pass down
good,I dealt with consumers on a daily bases and helped with their store needs
good,"i enjoyed working here,minus the low hours and not so great pay."
good,"I have learned a lot about retail,how to deal with differcult customers,my co-worker are great,they all have good days and bad days .The most enjoyable part is when a customer is looking for a item they really need and I help find it,they just be overjoyed with happiness and their smile is worth a million dollars."
good,"I have worked here for 2 years, only a couple very little pay raises. The coworkers and and management are ok overall."
good,needs more organization but great place to work and advance to management.
good,It decent just a bit difficult and low pay for the ammount of work that you do and stress. It is a good starting job howerer in order to be able to build up work experice
good,"Great associates, fairly decent management, hours varied, family friendly environment, no benefits unless you were full time. Full time associates were only management not associates"
good,A good starter job for high and college students. Helps learn basic skills and learn to deal with the public. Learn communication skills and a basic of the retail department
good,"Not easy for advancement, or fairly paid. Rules are applied according amongst different employers. Handbook Rules changes from department to department."
good,I enjoyed working as a customer service rep. Helping people achieve that go to look and style was always fulfilling. Management seems to care how the employees are doing and don't mind jumping in if your checkout line is a little long.
good,"nice place to work, lady supervisor is very respectful, customer service is helpful, lots of product, great with help, employees are respectful an resourceful."
good,Managers and assistant managers are a joke hardly any training for associates and management dont last long...this company over works you with alot of expectations no pay and minimum payroll
good,"Overall, a really great place to work because of the nice things they get and a 20% all the time (40% on certain weeks)"
good,"I worked as a stock associate at Ross, the only good thing about the job was the schedule. I was usually out no later than 2:45p, which allowed me most of my day as well as time to play in a band on the weekends. Everything is else screams that this job is a good side gig you can do if you don't mind the fact it's completely disposable. Terrible management and organizing truck load in efficiently. Good people however, often those good people told me how they were never respected by management."
good,"The pay was good but management expects you to get the truck unloaded in a certain amount of time. The way they schedule you is also a bit of a hassle.. other than that, very great coworkers & the manager was awesome."
good,"Customer service, safety, respect for others, loss prevention and efficiency are of prime importance to Ross Stores.  How well they achieve these goals can be problematic based on quality of store managers and middle managers. Beware of poor managers.  There is an atmosphere of extreme control of every process, which changes on a whim or transient metadata report. Place is run by a bunch of bean counters.  Shareholders are very happy, lowly employees not so much."
good,The only thing I didn’t like was that it was just 5.5 hours wanted more hours. other than that it was an easy job. I liked it over all it was easy money. But now I’m looking for better pay.
good,"I worked hard and tried to help my fellow employees, especially because managers often didn't have the time to actually train new employees or tell them what to do. Customers treated us like dirt."
good,"managers are lazy, the pay isn't enough, they ask too much of associates, too many tasks for one person for example as the cash office associate and main cashier by myself I must process all transactions, clean front end, keep carts neat, vacuum snow mats, put food in queline, and put hangers back on the tree."
good,"Working at Ross was a part time job for me. I was able to attend school, bring in a little money, in my position I was able to keep people safe by providing a comfort level by being thereand I made some new friends."
good,"The culture in each division starts at the top - if your manager actively participates in work/life balance then you have a better chance at having it. If your manager works 12-14 hours per day then you will be there for most of it as well. The teams are not big enough to manage the workload which causes mistakes, double work, and long hours."
good,"It was a good company to work for, but the location that I was at was super fast paced and extremely demanding. I wasn't very many hours, and it was hard to maintain a consistent work schedule"
good,They are always short handed and they never seem to have enough payroll. They only give you a day or two per week and they don’t pay at competitive rates.
good,Working here its a good job to start out with but not to make it a career. of course the employee discount was great and i really enjoyed that but working there i could never save money because of that reason
good,"Though the pay was good, the atmosphere in regards to the people who worked at the location I was at was very poor. Always talking inappropriately and being rude to others. If it was brought to the managers attention noting was done about it. It could possibly be an okay job at other locations."
good,"Working here it is important to help each other throughout the store. If one person falls behind, so will the rest of the team. It is necessary to keep a positive outlook during your time here"
good,"Days here are stress filled. The environment is always MESSY all the way up until after closing. Very fast-paced, and busy especially on weekends. Lots of running back and forth from the cash register to set department. Lots of filling in positions for others, because they're understaffed. Poor one on one training, because they're so busy and understaffed. They change a lot of things in the store around. Just as you get used to where things go stuff gets shuffled around. There is also a very clear favoritism between the staff, especially managers. Lots of gossiping goes on all throughout the workday. The hardest part of this job is getting all of your tasks done while it's busy. They also like to add things for you to do when they cannot finish the task themselves. The most enjoyable part of this job is honestly the flexible schedules and benefits. Also, not all of the staff are terrible. Just a select few of them."
good,I worked the stock room. You are trained for about three days then expected to just keep up. Written and verbal warnings given. Stock room manager was very rude and condescending. Would show at scheduled time and she would leave me outside waiting for sometimes 20 mins.
good,Everyone you work with is so nice except for some managers. You think they are going to advance you and then management changes and you have to start from scratch again. Their turn over rate is very high.
good,Good job but they do not offer full time. This is something that did not work for me so I had to leave. The job is very easy and the shifts were short.
good,"Great benefits, career development and salary at management level positions and above but not at lower level positions.  "
good,"Been working for months and watch people who i work more often and harder than get promoted and all upper staff is female, and it seems they plan to keep it that way, i am the only male cashier we have and work as hard as 4"
good,not all associates are held liable. there are many that get away with breaking rules. management is lackluster at best and seem unwilling to discipline those who are caught breaking the rules.
good,Love working at Ross but they cut ur hours when they don't have the money I need more hours...in some of the managment is rude in I don't have time for that...
good,"I worked 3 years plus without incident, then I questioned productivity reporting.  I was then told I violated company policy.  I only made $8000 my last full year there.  Almost everyone is part-time with no benefits."
good,"Like any job, it is what you make it. The job is a fairly decent job. Stayed 2 years during college. I was promised a raise, but never saw it. They cut hours during the summer, but holiday pay is sustainable."
good,The working environment needs a lot of improvement as far as getting along with the coworkers and the amount of workload that is forced upon the workers is ridiculous.
good,It was okay but wouldn’t work there too long. The managers are not too bad but could listen to their employees more. They did have incentives a few times a month.
good,I learned many new things at Ross. I love the associates I worked with. I learned SPS. Many times we were under staffed. And there were several different managers. Glad they finally raised the pay rate.
good,I enjoyed working at Ross at the time I did because I was young and had minimal responsibilities but it was definatley not a place to be long term. I believe it was good for a college student or mom trying to make spending money. It great for learning retail and customer service but they do not pay enough to make a living. You'd have to work 40+ hours a week to barley manage.
good,I enjoyed working at Ross Dress for Less while I was there. I only worked for the company for a few months. I learned a lot in the few short months I worked for the company though.
good,"Team building was our goal."
good,Worked here when I was young so the lay was beyond minimal! You work in a fast pace but it does prepare you for retail so it can only go up from here I was suppose to be promoted per the district manager which my store manager never took it upon herself to do once they learned I was pregnant I was treated differently and slowly pushed out! So if you’re just looking for something small with low pay work here..
good,Not the best job. Not many benefits or opportunities unless you have a degree or worked an unwholesome amount of years in the company. It will help you get by but not good for living off of for long term.
good,"I have both loved and hated this job, and it depended on the store manager. When I started, the store manager appreciated us and treated us like family. When she left and was replaced, the new manager continually stirred up drama, would lie to turn other employees against each other, and was the #1 factor that caused almost the entire store to leave. Your experience will vary depending on your store."
good,"Pays good but stingy with hours, only able to work at the most 5-6 hrs a day and at least 3-5 hrs a day, a total of 16-18 hrs a week. Does not give enough hours to be able to live on"
good,"Great company "
good,"Just how toxic the work environment is a the Ross DC.  I loved my job, but after leaving there I realize it's because of my associates, not the company itself. Their starting pay is WAY below many other warehouses in the area, the benefits are pretty good though.  They are very very strict on their HR policies, there is no leeway for any reason at all.  I noticed a severe lack of care for their lower level associates, they have a ""there's 100 more waiting to get hired"" attitude.  Which makes for a very high turnover rate with entry level associates.  The supervisors are understaffed and the ones who really need extra help are left to handle way more than they should have to, then get reprimanded when something doesn't go right.  There is a huge lack of communication and comraderie between departments and even within the same department.  Not to mention the lack of cooperation between shifts.  It's a very chaotic and poorly run DC.  If they would put a little effort in to fix the problems they created it could be an awesome place to work."
good,"In my particular store location, health problems and work related injuries/sicknesses were not treated properly. Management would ignore serious issues."
good,"You will definitely need patience for the job. Not a lot to do, and honestly end up counting the seconds til the end of the day comes. And at the end of the day, we can't exactly do anything to prevent a theft, so really your job there is to greet and call out anyone that looks suspicious. Great career advancement if you are an upperclassmen in college or already have a degree."
good,A good level entry job for a teenager. The work is kinda boring. You can tell management’s favorites had the best opportunities. For some reason the only people allowed to work full time were the managers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross Dress For Less I we’re give. An opportunity to grow as individual. I express great customer service skills , I were passionate about my work and were very responsible at all times."
good,"Great people to work with"
good,"Shifts are either 8 hours or 4 hours and it gets very busy on certain days and of course at Christmas. Supervisors are generally helpful as long as you are doing your job well. I enjoy my co-workers and we work well together for the most part. No benefits except sometimes we have food in the break room and we get 20% discounts on merchandise which is great.  Pay is average for this kind of job. You are paid biweekly.   "
good,"After working there for 2 years we went through at least 3-4 Store Managers as well as even having points of no store manager. It made it hard on all the staff to stay consistent when new managers would try to implement new changes, but would leave shortly there after :(."
good,"I worked part time, at my previous job I made 10 per hour so the drop to 8 was concerning for my income but i needed the work, i had 2 days that I could not work every week, every week the manager would say ""i understand you cant work this day"" and every week i would be scheduled and forced to drop that day/hours. So what would usually be a maybe 20-25 hour week would be maybe 16 hours a week. I didnt get to make up that day, and sometimes if i didnt complain early enough i had to find someone else to take that day for me instead of it just being dropped."
good,I’ve been able to move up quickly which I loved - I became a manager there & been able to further my career in different aspects of management which gave me a lot of experiences.
good,"Ross is committed to creating value for our Associates and our communities, and doing so with a high level of ethics and integrity. Also your colleagues is what makes going into work worth it."
good,"It wasn't terrible for a first job but I did not feel welcome as an employee, nor did I feel I was trained well. Everyone was on edge all the time. Not a good work environment."
good,"They are very flexible with everyone's schedule. Since its only part time, there is not any benefits besides few sick days . It can be stressful and not worth the pay for the long run. I would always get great reviews on my yearly performance as an employee but they would say that I still couldn't get a raise even though I was an excellent employee."
good,"As a sales associate, we have to give great customer service as the same time we do our daily duties in a really fast peace. Is nice to deliver a great customer service for the clients."
good,"you can work your spin off at ross, either in the stock room sals floor do managers alot of favor like come in at 3:30 am to save their behinds to run whatever was not finish from the unload in the truck, go backs and still get fired for prize modifying one 11 dollar product with the permission of your supervisor, but LP has to catch someone you become the scapegoat... do not work here they will stab you in the back and give you little hours this included DDs discounts as well."
good,"Good place to learn different type or jobs and how to be a multitask, you need to work fast and with a limit period of time. You have to deal with a lot of customers"
good,"When I first started working their I loved the work place because we had a wonderful fair, looked out for everyone manager. We ended up getting a new manager and everything just changed. I was moved up to a Front End Supervisor for 30 cents more. Being that Ross offers a dollar increase to everyone there a year when they moved me up they only have me 30 cent extra and told me I already got a dollar increase for the job. I was really confused being that EVERYONE that was there a year got the dollar. Treated unfairly by different managers, you get timed on the cash register, you get coaching a every week for it. This is called your CPR,  It has to be 95% and higher to scan and bag and get to your next guest. If you plan on going to college and persuing or getting a better job, don’t overwork yourself here, you shouldn’t have to break your back for a job paying$9 to $10 a hour. All in all it’s an okay job, after the different opportunities and experiences I wouldn’t ever go back unless I HAD TO !"
good,"I loved working at Ross because of the quick paced, always on to go aspect of the job. When you were done with one thing you were onto the next and were always given a project to work on. Dealing with customers was always a blast and the employees are very helpful and relaxed about most things. I always felt like I had been productive at the end of the day."
good,"During the Time I was at this location, the store manager went through 4 assistant Managers in a Year, that was extremely high turnover Rate. He is a stooge for the district manager, who's only concern is money. Not how the store looks. Store continuously looks horrible due to the fact there are usually only 3 employees in the store on the floor."
good,"Associates are helpful and friendly, managers don't like to help associates when called to help with long lines, associates deserve better for holidays cause there is no appreciation from management"
good,Safe Location to work pay was raised to eleven dollars per hour good co workers. 15min breaks with my very four hour shift. The store had good hours 9am-10pm
good,"I would love to work at Ross again, I loved the employees, and managers, but didn't care for the head manager. "
good,"The job was fine to work with as long as you can deal with customers. Most issues involve conflict resolution or disputes over purchases. Management overall is alright. They do like to hire from within. The coworkers have a great attitude. I got along with almost all of them and became good friends. The rules are loosely followed, but as long as you complete most tasks you will be ok."
good,Really fast pace me was the best cashier. Was lead here stared as a seasonal worker became permanent. Would recommend this job too a high school graduate.
good,"Working a Sales Associate job at a Ross Dress for Less is typical and just what you would expect. The normal work day consists of mostly cleaning and organizing along with customer service. The hours were very flexible with my college class schedule and homework load which was convenient. Workplace culture was one of the reasons I stayed for over five years with the company. The employees made it worthwhile. The hardest part of the job was trying to please the customers rationally and maintaining an organized store. The most enjoyable part of my job at Ross was learning how to sell the products in the store the most efficiently (marketing), and also how the productivity of the store played into daily projects and assignments the staff must do. Moreover, I really enjoyed organizing the displays to allow for easier shopping. I learned the communication, marketing, and service skills I needed to hopefully pursue something else with my Bachelor's degree."
good,"i work in the stock room and the work is fun but the environment isn't. no matter how well you work, management is always dissatisfied. It's more like cliques than management and employees. extremely stressful and management isn't open to feedback."
good,It’s a good place to work unfortunately the management wasn’t ethical unorganize the manager weren’t happy to work overnight  they couldn’t properly magane a shift would always complain about the store manager.
good,Ross is a store where you can rise into various leadership roles if you're willing to travel and put in the work. The store is very demanding and due to the lack of formidable assistance within the store majority of the workload falls on the shoulders of Management.
good,"Good place to work, but its always messy very busy store. Need to have a lot of patients. Its better to work there part time so you wont be stressed all the times."
good,Good part time job that has flexible scheduling and allows you to do various tasks. Job is stressful most times and is fast paced. Management varies from store to store but is always changing. The ability to move up in the company is very easy as long as you do the work and show constant improvement.
good,"Working at Ross was ok, if you are part time, you are lucky if you work 4 hours a week. Sometimes you might not work for 1 whole week. Then the next week you work 18 hours."
good,"Management fails to say hello, how are you, how's it going.  Management fails to give notice when schedule is changed assuming everyone comes in daily and see a schedule difference."
good,It was mess at Ross when i worked there and the pay wasn't enough..The management to me was horrible. I got hurt one time i had to call corporate because the manager really didn't care..
good,I feel that there's no chance of going further in the company or hourly wage. I feel the amount of work doesn't coincide with hourly wage. You have to work harder for that extra incentive to balance out. Competitiveness is ridiculous. I couldn't see myself retiring with the corporation.
good,Ross was my first job. I feel that it was a good experience for me and helped me learn how to be more multitasker. The Co workers and managers were friendly and were there if I needed help. I definitely would say this is a quick pace work environment.
good,A typical work day consists of things a monkey could do. The worst part about the job is that not only are you doing the job you got hired for but you're also doing the job of loss prevention and working the floor and anything else needed.
good,"Great customer service experience . Interaction with customers and employees, flexible hours, discounts, good place to work and shop. You can set your schedule as desired but most be free during weekends"
good,I enjoy the environment some days. Fast paced and customer service is what I enjoy and that is what they and myself provided. I feel that a company should value a good employee and see the willingness to learn and grow. The previous companies I have worked for seems to only go off of seniority not productivity. I am committed to learning and I need to grow with a company not just work for one and build a career and a place I would like to call my second home.
good,Sure there is an opportunity to advance within but a little slow going. The rate of pay is low and the work is hard but entry-level retail is always a struggle.
good,"I have worked retail for over 10 years. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and supervisors at Ross. I recently observed a trend where fewer staff members are being utilized and each is required to work harder. I understand some downsizing has been done since the recession, but our current Manager is utilizing the minimal sales staff, even during the holidays. This has created a very stressful environment. I understand the changes, due to work culture and the changing times, but for me, it was time to walk away."
good,This part time job allowed me the opportunity to continue college classes. As a security protection specialist allowed me to have flex time to obtain my library technician certification.
good,"This was a great store to work at, however there were a few individuals in higher position who felt it was necessary to be bossy. The overall environment ot the store was great. The store employees was very diverse, but when you have certain members of management pulling hours from loyal employees to give to hired family members it causes tension amongst employees."
good,i loved running the cash office and working with the customers. the staff was great and the environment was fun and fast paced most days. I learned a lot about myself working there.
good,"My work days at ross was long and hard. The people I worked with was really good people, and then you had some that was not so good. The hardest part of my day was closing."
good,I really enjoyed working there but I was let go after I was in the hospital. I went in because I showing signs that I had cancer. When it was confirm. I've told management that I wont make it for a couple of weeks until I received my first round of chemo. She told me that it was best that I don't work there because of my illness.
good,"While the work was not difficult, anyone working in retail can tell you that it is hard work.  Dealing with customers for more than a few hours at a time can be stressful.  Some of the managers were very kind and understanding while others expected too much from their staff.  Overall it was an easy place to work at and would be a great first job or for someone that is going to college and needs a place with flexible work hours."
good,"Friendly and comfortable place to work at, team work, fast paced, cooperative, great managers and supervisors, respect among associates, flexible shifts"
good,"Come in did my work good training, the only i didnt like is some days no work if the truck didnt come in. Clean work area and lunch room. Fast pace no slow time which i like"
good,"This is a very fast pace environment to work in. If you do not know how to work quickly and efficiently, do not even bother applying at Ross. Ross pays very little for the amount of work that the sales associates do."
good,I got this job out of high school and didn't really try to succeed at it due to me not knowing what I wanted to do with my life at the time. Other than that it was an alright job.
good,"Things tend to move at a pretty fast pace more often than not, and wires tend to get crossed between supervisors from time to time. This can result in needlessly repeated or confusingly different directions to the same associate. Stable enough position, however."
good,"Job was easy but the pay wasn't great. No room to grow and no benefits. Some managers were great, pretty easy job for a college student, just keep in mind pay is minimum wage."
good,Ross is a great place to start a career or even work part time. It is great for a young student starting their job careers at a young age. there is a lot of heavy lifting at times and bending and stooping. It is easy to train and maintain.
good,"I had a hard time getting the hours I wanted. I requested and was promised 20+ per week and ended up with only 5-10 hours per week.  I did not feel heard by management, we were always short staff. I always worked hard and tried to get done as much as possible, but it was never enough."
good,You won't get anywhere at Ross. The people who have been working their for more than 5 years make the job have less excitement. Everyone tends to be serious at registers or there is never enough people at registers because there is not a lot of employees.
good,"working at ross was a very different experience, the management was ridiculously childish, higher above was rude. i loved the customers and fellow associates."
good,Upper management does not return your call. HR is horrible and never get back to you. And Usually side with associates before even calling the manager to see what the issue is.
good,"It's a fun place to work for if it weren't done for a living, something that high school kids or retired people can do to make a little extra money on the side."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the customers loved me! I still get I miss you and are you coming back from the customers and associates when I go in to shop."
good,I enjoyed working for Ross Dress for Less Stores Inc. It was very fast-paced and fun. The management was awesome. All co-workers were easy to get along with and always helped each other with whatever problems may have arose. Excellent on Team work. But only part-time positions were available. Not enough hours and low wages.
good,Expect to work 60+ hours a week during the holiday season with no additional compensation. There is also constant turnover due to low compensation. The culture is adequate.
good,With ross it is a very fast paced environment and you shave to be able to keep up f not they'll just cut you loose that was the most common problem we had they constantly want more out of every one and it can be overwhelming at times but you'll have great co workers that want to help you and the discounts are great to.
good,"It's an okay place to work. A typical day at work depends on where they schedule you. I learned to be patient, ignore rude customers, and to develop communication skills."
good,"A day at work was stressful with other employees"
good,"The job is so much fun. The staff there are amazing people. It was a place that provided a lot a learning. Management was always unstable, however, and they had a difficult time releasing the schedule in advance. If you like a very spontaneous environment, this is the job for you!"
good,A typical day at work would include either to greet and speak to customers as they walk through the doors while working registers or communicating with customers while tending to the fitting rooms. The hardest part of the job may have been remembering everything that you learned.
good,"6am truck unloading, scanned into the system, then pushed onto the floor. Part-time for everyone on the floor, not a great deal of time for comraderie.Since I was fairly large, I also saw some duty as backup for loss prevention personnel."
good,"ross is a very good job , associates are nice managment is a little off. great breaks and schedules for workers , fun and happy place to work at . best discount ever!"
good,"over work you for less pay, the real ross slogan is do more with less.Bonus is trivial, they care more about internal theft than anything else, the zone director is a bro and if your not a bro he has problems with you.sub par place to work."
good,"Every day is the same when working at ross. it gets kinda boring. its an easy job, but management can get rude to both customers and their employees at times. which is why I left, i just didn't want to work in an environment where the managers talk bad about their employees to other employees. It was Like working with high school students starting uanessacry drama all the time."
good,"If you like jobs that require a fast pace and quick hands then this job is for you, management always had a positive attitude to brighten your day and keep you going, the most difficult part of being in stock is the truck in the early mornings, you're still fighting to stay awake but you gotta be quick otherwise you feel guilty for letting the team down, the best part of working there was how unbelievably accepting and nice the employees are"
good,"I did not like their Management. I was wrongfully fired due to being pregnant. I was shocked I got the unemployment. The management was constantly changing. If you did not have work for your area they would move you elsewhere. They made sure you have to keep up with a certain percentage, and with being tossed around the warehouse it would effect your paycheck as well."
good,Ross has every oppurtuntity to be an oustanding place to work but the stress that is put on each individual is not worth the pay provided. I work harder at Ross and make half the money I did at my last job.
good,Very slow place and chill environment. The employees tend to keep to themselves for the most part. There isnt very much supervision and overall the store just wasnt ran very well. Very simple and basic entry level job.
good,"I didnt have any regrets about the job, I wanted to see what else would be out their new opportunities so I found something else The pay wasnt all that great."
good,No career advancement and inconsistent hours. Alot of work and not enough money. But if you just need extra it is a decent part time job. No future in this company
good,"Aside from  Corporate and District managers forgetting people are human beings and not their studges . The Store manager was very nice and a pleasure to work with as well as the area supervisors. "
good,"An average place to work. Nothing really to say about it. Clock in, meeting, work, break, work, lunch, work, break then go home. If we didn't work enough we were old to work more ."
good,"Management was not that great, hired too many people which meant less hours for everyone. some people were getting five hours a week. well the Manager was scheduling herself way more hours than needed."
good,It's a fun place to work at if you get along with everyone. I wouldn't work here as a career job because there is not enough benefits and it's hard to move up in the company.
good,If you are lucky enough to not end up in the high volume store and have a good management team; Ross is a good place to work. There is the great need for team work and plenty of opportunities to advance  in position and skills.
good,At Ross customer service is very important and keeping the store clean was our number one priority at Ross Dress for Less at Jacksonville Beach Store.
good,stock position is always fast paced. depending on the manager on duty it can be very chaotic or easy going. overall it was enjoyable because you're constantly moving
good,This was a great place to learn to be more social with others while learning how products are stocked and placed. They moved straight to the main customer service area because our secret shoppers would always be 100% when I was up there compared to others.
good,Ross is a good company to work for. There is always something to work on. Never a dull moment. Always receiving new inventory. Discount is better than other company's.
good,"This was a nice place to work, and there are many nice people that work there. Although I did enjoy my time, it is difficult for me to work until almost 1am everyday."
good,This company isn't so bad. what makes it bad is the bad management that manage awful or don't know how. Otherwise great to start off from the bottom and work your up the rankings and it is pretty easy.
good,Lets just say the people were amazing to work with. We weren't paid well enough for the job that we did. Most of these people work their butts off just to get paid minimum wage which was ridiculous.
good,"This position requires you to make each minute count. There are no excuses. At my particular store, my biggest issues were scheduling and under-staffing while MOD. There have been so many days where I close and open the next day, giving me little time to rest. Also closing with only 1 associate for the rest of the time doubles the workload. Not all stores operate the same way, it depends on the store manager."
good,"Stress full, hardest part of the job is attempting to meet company demands, with low resources and no flexibility to work with, while in a fast paced environment."
good,"fast pace work environment but it lacks the management skills to make it great, none stable and the costumers are the worst. needs to be more organized"
good,"I need something more stable and permanent.  certain parts of the year they were slow on work and will have you drive 30 minutes to work just to be turned around to go back home, and wasn't paying enough at the time."
good,"Ross would be a great company to work for because of the flexibility of hours.  However nights and weekend work is required for most positions, also holiday work is required."
good,"Typical day: Get there, tolorate customers"
good,"- early morning shifts are best"
good,"I am a Store Protection Specialist at Ross, therefor I have to understand theft trends, knowledge on high theft departments, communication with supervisors on current shopping trends. I have to understand reports based on shortage in each department. I am a multi purpose employee that can work in the stock room, cashier, and be a back up Manager on Duty. Each part of the working experience is different based on what your doing. Cashiering and the stock room are hectic and very fast. You have to understand the customers point of view in order to help them properly. Understanding the regulations at Ross are not very difficult, learn as you go environment. High turnover for managers."
good,Direct supervisor and other employee spent most of the working time complaining about the job and discussing other places to apply. Complained about the management and how the store was being run. Discount was worth it.
good,"It's an okay company to work for very easy working in the stock team, loss prevention also what I didn't like is that you couldn't confront a customer for stealing. Customer is right and customer first before employees that's they way that company is."
good,"It has its good days and bad days it all depends on how you look at it and what manager is there at the time. If they are having a bad day you are going to have a bad day."
good,you only received 20 hours per 2 weeks. when your 20 hours are up then you wont have work for a week. no one person and survive and maintain a house with hours like this.
good,"A daily routine of either doing cashier or running go bags. Learned to manage money and work at a fast pace environment. Also , communicatted in different ways with guest because of language barriers."
good,"A typical day at Ross would be that I would time in, make sure to have the stock report for the truck were getting ready to unload. Make sure my employee's were all there. I had to make sure that we were as efficient as possible but also doing the job correctly. "
good,"You only get 15 hours a week, we will show up to work and be told to go home. Most of the managers are more interested in being friends with employees, then being a leader. I would only work here as a stop gap to another job."
good,This was not an easy job. Is very fast paced with a lot expected out of you. The employees that you work with are Extremely helpful and would say they are one of the best parts of the work experience.
good,A typical day at Ross usually consists of unloading a truck and putting all the merchandise on the shelves. I learned how to stock shelves correctly and especially food the older food goes in the front and the newer in the back. Management keeps you on your toes at all times. There will never be a time where you will have nothing to do. The culture is somewhat relaxed on slow days. On fast days its very quick paced. The hardest part of the job is trying to find room for everything on the shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job is being a part of a team. The employees work together as a team.
good,"Management is tough on the little people."
good,"Unfortunately there isn't much growth with Ross unless your willing to give up your life for little or no pay and expensive benefits. Other than that it's a great pt job. Unless your in management you only receive part time hours and pay, not at all beneficial to providing for yourself or a family."
good,I've worked at two separate Ross' and they both had the same issues. The management was aloof and not on the same page. It made for a confusing and stressful work environment.
good,This job requires a lot of patience. The pay to me unfortunately isn't worth the frustration that this job comes with. Dealing with certain customers and managers that really don't care about their employees
good,I didn't last long here at Ross. The amount of hours i got a week was 15 hours and every time they called me in I always showed up. I didn't feel like i fit in and to get more hours and better pay felt like you had to be the managers favorite.
good,"Ross was not a typical retail environment.  It was a fast-paced environment with a minimum staff.  A typical day started with cash management and banking procedures.  Store maintenance was a daily challenge due to staffing.  Processing the truck was always the priority.  There were always several audits that managers are responsible to complete each day.  The work culture was not as compliant as I have been accustom to adhering to, which made this job especially difficult.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making the employees feel valued each and every time they came to work."
good,if your looking for a part time job that can eventually turn into fulltime then Ross would be good for you.  They have decent benefits when you reach fulltime.
good,"Easy place to move up, just let management know of your intentions within the company. Most of your shift will be on the register, other part will be recovery."
good,Their policies were outdated and the system could use a lot of improvement especially the pay. Manage could have listened better. It wasnt all bad I have met great people.
good,"Ross provided a diverse supply of skills applicable to the retail and sales industries. Although assignments were very chaotic, I would recommend this job for temporary employment."
good,"Small store, a lot of customer service. Learned about cake decorating. The manager very nice to work with. Good hours to work. Workplace very calm and clean."
good,Work was pretty boring for me. Long days when finally scheduled. Management was serious business. I overall wouldn't recommend this store because it is so boring.
good,"restock the floor for when customers enter store they are able to shop comfortably and not have a hard time find things that they need, alble to help customers find things"
good,"overall good company, great benefits, store culture. Only issues is creating new programs and processes running to many programs at the same time, Often changing processes making it difficult for leadership team to be on same page when implementing programs."
good,Ross is a great store but they aren't considerate if you're a student. They keep you till 1am or later. Managers can be rude sometimes. It's not a fair job for students.
good,No growth advancement in this retail field. Management doesn't do their job as they should. The wage is below minimum. There's so much work to be done and daily cleaning up for the wage is not what I would prefer.
good,Its not the best or the worst place to work. You do more than what you get paid for. The employees are always thinking about gossip. They try to make sure you do something wrong so they can get rewarded.
good,A typical day at Ross can be stressful. Management tries their best to create a fun and effective work environment. You will deal with a lot of difficult customers and a lot of theft. Frustration is what I think of when I head to work.
good,This job is based mostly around customer service. It is very fast paced and has a high customer basis. There is a good selection in merchandise. Starting out a lot of employees with have to work late at night.
good,"If you like retail, this is the place for you.  Good company with advancement to grow.  However, the pay scale is not up to par since they are a ""small box"" company."
good,"The discount is really good. We get 20 percent throughout the year and sometimes, 40 percent. Not many promotions or raises."
good,I think the CEO need to come in and talk to the employee and see the things that's happening. People are getting fired just because they don't like someone the managers are not trying to help on training the staff.
good,Difficult to maintain a work life balance. Company puts an emphasis on it but doesn't allow much time for it. The company itself is a great place to work for the most part and salary is very comparable to most places but you work a lot of hours. Upper management is often not trusting of you to run your team alone without their interference and programs change so often it causes frustrations amongst associates. In recent years you have noticed many changes in order to cut costs and make a buck often hurting us at the store level.
good,"If you a re retire or just finish high school is a great place to work but if you depend on the income don't work there."
good,"I learned that customers are very emotional and need to be tended o in a very sensitive professional way. My managers were very nice, and got the job done. My co workers I loved them. friendly atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was dealing with aggressive customers, they were a lot physical, and the customers with cold,, never really covered their mouth. What I enjoyed about the job is the it was family oriented. we  all looked out for each other."
good,I took my customer service experience to the next level. I was able to work in all the different areas there are and be able to learn different things. My co-workers were kind and fun to be around.
good,"Is a good place if you are not looking for much money, they usually hire with agency so you cant spec much pay, their OT is on one of your days off usually Saturdays."
good,"The jobs are manageable and a percentage is required.  management is all about insiders, people don't move up unless they know someone, not by their own accomplishments."
good,"Always short staffed. Very tasked oriented. Spend way too much time dealing with shoplifters. Inconsistent with direction, reward and consequence. Shifts are short so it's hard to keep quality staff."
good,"While some fellow associates make this job worthwhile, the expectations set by the higher managers that don't understand what the job entails creates a stressful workplace where there is no room to grow and make a career."
good,"Not happy with transfer in, management made promises and didn't follow through, advancing workers with lower CPRs than others. Giving hours to new employees instead of established employees."
good,"Ross dress for less is a pretty good company. A typical day at work is pretty much just stocking things, tagging items. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the customers."
good,Great employees they will show you what needs to be done around and for the store. Management can come off as treating adult employees like children and speak to employees in an offensive tone
good,"I used to love working here, but now I don't. Management needs more training. They are sometimes very unfair, but the job is pretty nice."
good,"Ross is a great place to develop some basic skills in customer service. As a cashier, I learned to multi task and work in a fast pace to give the customer a speedy and friendly checkout. As a sales floor associate, I learned that having a strategy is key to finishing all your duties on time. The hardest part of the job was working in the cash office. Having a multiple assignments due at a specific time was challenging almost all the time. However, I learned to manage my time and find the best methods to be the most productive. On another note, Ross does try to make work enjoyable for their employees. Every month there was fun activities that everyone could participate in. Whether that was wearing a Disney shirt or crazy hat day. Ross was a great stepping stone to my future career."
good,"This was a great job but for the hours and pay rate with no beneifts, it wasnt working out. I felt as if i was being ""Overworked."""
good,"Always a new challenge every day. Meeting new people everyday."
good,"The management and staff are great. The management tries to make working their fun. they bring in food every once in awhile and listen if you need something. However out on the floor there is a big theft problem that you have to watch out for, and the amount of customers that seem to be under the impression that the store is in fact a day care are astounding."
good,"Worker early in the morning un-loading the truck,un packing the materials.Organizing and stocking in the right place in the store.Ive learned to work well with others.The hardest part was not having much time to unload and having huge amount of materials.The most enjoyable was getting everying off the truck and everything in its right place before our time was up."
good,"Typical retail environment, lenient management, lazy coworkers. Corporate doesn't want to deal with lawsuits, so little to nothing is done about theft, no benefits, part-time."
good,"1) Clock in, greet every customer you pass, do your start, [Ross have a ""Start"" (15mins when you start your shift to organize an assigned section of the store)] go to your appropriate department, make sure your department is clean, clear, and neat, go to break, go back to your assigned department, help clean up the store throughout your shift and when the store is closed or towards the end of your shift, and detail everything as much as possible before clocking out."
good,"You got your breaks, always late."
good,None of the managers could agree on the duties that needed to be preformed. Other employees left things for others to pick up. They did not do their job but were not spoke to by managers.
good,Very faced paced work environment plenty of co workers to help out on projects together. Management works around your schedule. The hardest part of the job would be closing a big department when its very crowded and busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers have a fast and friendly check out.
good,"Management was not good. "
good,"Easy job, but the culture of the store is extremely demoralizing, management did not know what they were doing because of inadequate training.Other employees did not care about their job and it was easy to tell."
good,i worked there for a few months and the postion was a joke. standing in front of the door. managers not doing their jobs well. supplies are never stocked.
good,The job was not a bad job. Everything was fine until the managers kept messing up my schedule and not contacting me with information that I needed to know.
good,"this job is for a college student, they would work with your hours and were good about hours. But would never give you more than 24 hours in a week. Sometimes you go in and all they gave you was 6 hours for the week. Management insists on everyone sizing when they first clock in and then tell you 2 hours later it was not done properly. In those hours customers have messed up what you sized earlier and you get fussed at for it."
good,It's a great starter job for anyone straight out of high school or anyone over the age of 18. The managers are amazing and the work environment is welcoming. Teaches great people skills and other remarkable skills to have like on the cash register. Only downside is the longer you have worked there is you may either get more hours a week or less hours.
good,"This job was fun. I liked working there. However it did get boring at times. It is not a fast paced environment most of the year. The biggest issue with this job is that it is a corporation. Therefore, there are rules that are silly and little chance of advancement."
good,"Fun place to work,and some of the managers are very nice and help you in anyway they can. The most enjoyable of the job that i enjoy is the customers and seeing that the customers are happy, and pleased and working with me colleagues. The hardest part of the job is not having the staff being upfront and honest with you , and no room from advancement."
good,"Good place to work with good management. Scheduled and placed on specific department of store where needed. Generally good with availability. Simple but hard job as you have to deal with customers all day long, have good customer service, and maintain the store organized and clean throughout. The part I enjoy most is working with my fellow associates."
good,"Enjoyable workplace. Started the day with an area to pick up for 15 minutes then got to the main job. I learned to be patient, more kind, and how to run the cash office. Management was okay they always seemed busy. Co-workers seem to all get along and were supportive of one another. The hardest part of the job was sometimes there were irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the amount of recognition I got daily."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting and assisting the customers needs first and foremost; picking up merchandise from the sales floor; managing the front end from cashiers to breaks and fitting rooms. "
good,"An average work day would consist of making sure employees have done their starts and daily duties, covering breaks and lunches in most departments, answering questions co-workers may have. I may do a pull (take money out) or two from the register/s. I may run stock if need be. I also assist customers in helping them find what they need or answering questions. This is just to name a few of the duties I do on a daily basis."
good,"Enjoyed my time within the company, I met many wonderful people and had the opportunity to help many over the years.  As a result, I felt that my efforts were valued, its just sad it was mostly from an associate or peer level that it was voiced."
good,"I was a fun workplace, due to the fact that I got along with just about all of my coworkers.There was always something to do to keep busy. I also appreciated the nice customers."
good,"Customers care, making sure store is clean( one of the top stores in region.Management is good. Company hires way to many people so employees only get 3- to 15 hours a week which very every week.  Hardest part of job is only having one manager, one cashier and on fitting room employee work a busy shift. hard to keep up with customer service and theft issues."
good,"Greeting customers, cashiering, off loading the truck. Processing and running out the merchandise, It's fun when the store is fully staffed. We can actually get our jobs done."
good,"Involved in all aspects of daily operations.  Constantly balanced the payroll to match trending sales (add when sale up, cut when sales were down and hoped your forecast was correct) to be on budget."
good,VERY poor management. The store is a mess and is very unorganized. Everyone has an attitude for no reason. Managers aren't fait nor sympathetic or understanding.
good,This is a very warm work place. The employees and managers are caring and understanding. The only con i can say is that they do not give you enough hours. I understand this is not their fault and it is due to budget cut and hiring more people for the season.
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent working at Ross. A day at work consist of providing customer service, writing incident reports, observing and maintaining a safe and secure environment. I've learned to be more vigilant and that preparation is very important. I enjoyed my manager. It's important to work with someone who understands what it takes to run a store. I can honestly say that I've worked with some very nice people. Some, not so nice. Many people go to work to make friends and Ross was definitely the atmosphere for that. However, sometimes people didn't take their jobs seriously. The hardest part about working at Ross was the organized groups of friends. Such groups caused conflicts because someone favored another person more which equals more benefits. One thing I enjoyed the most was my manager's personality and eagerness to teach."
good,The time I work at ross I learn more about customer service there was lack of management at the moment but is a good place to learn and challenge yourself to get better
good,"Counting all monies in registers, bank vault. "
good,"Mostly great co-workers, management and really simple work. I enjoy everything about it, its fun and fasted paced just one downfall is the pay. And management are very understanding."
good,Every day is a challenge that requires a lot of time as a manager. Not a lot of work life balance. There is a need to be a very passive but committed mgr in the role to run this business.
good,ross was an department store for people to come out and shop for high price clothes which was discounted for sales. I enjoyed working with others there at the company because I love helping people.
good,"Love working with great people in a fast pace job. Ross need to give more hours and better pay. i was in charge of homes department, i love what i do for Ross but they need to show more appreciation for their employees."
good,It's not a recommendable place to work for if you are looking to grow up within a company. The salary is minimum and the scheduling is bad.
good,Not all stores are the same. need to find a store with a great management team.
good,Management is okay. My co-workers are fun to be around and some feel like they're like family. The hardest part of the job is making sure every task in done within a certain time.I love the discount off the already great prices.
good,"Ross of course is a clothing store and it isn't up to part and organized like other stores; however, I love working there it's never a dull moment I like to stay busy."
good,Restocking merchandise and cleaning work area. I've learned that its always good to work as a team. Because when someone calls out it is harder on everyone else.
good,I loved working with the management team everyone was friendly and knowledgeable of the job they were doing
good,"Working at Ross Dress for Less was an experience that I enjoyed half of the time. The customers were good to work with along with my co-workers, but the problem came when management got involved. None of the managers got along and that affected the associates in a negative way. I was never completely sure if I what I was doing was the correct way to do it."
good,"Working for Riss was quite an experience. If you plan to be a sticker expect to wake up at 5am & be at work 10-15mins early or the manager will get upset cause she doesn't want to open the door. Stocking involved being in the back opening hundreds of boxing & hanging them up while standing the entire time. You will be rushed & expected to do a certain amount of boxes each day. Around noon you roll racks out to put on the floor. Fitting room attendant is pretty much self explanatory, pretty easy as well. Cashier is pretty self explanatory as well & easy. Sales is pretty easy as well. Working there you get to work many different positions which I find beneficial if people call in but you never get to pick what position. Assistant Management is good, however the main manager is horrible. She talks to you like an animal & acts as if she is too busy to help you."
good,"team work with multiple employees, check out customers promptly and accurately, counting currency quickly and accurate."
good,hel;ping customer gate thereis needs returns and sales floor
good,"Before walking into work I needed to mentally prepare myself for the duties I had in stored for me that shift. The store is usually busy non stop from opening to perhaps an hour before it close. When I was hired here I went form sales floor, cashier, customer service, to front end supervisor within 7 months. It was the first job I learned how to be organized and specific to were certain item belonged in the store, made sure if they were stored properly, and always assist the customers with any questions, problems, and concerns they had. I had to be responsible to make sure my drawer always had maintain its correct balance, open and closes cash drawers, as well as relieve my fellow employees for their breaks and lunches. My fellow co-workers usually complained a lot about the amount of work they were given and not necessarily the nicest but when it  was time for them to clock out they were the most jolliest they could be."
good,"My day would typically start around 8-8:15 a.m. and end around 6-6:30 p.m. "
good,"I have learned to communicated effectly with customers, peers and management without becoming domineering."
good,Was at the store before it opened to receive truck process it and put it out.
good,Having the position that I have now is fun to me. I love the simple fact that I can learn so many things about the store. Leaning the shortage and all the numbers help me to be able to do the job to the best of my ability. It also makes me want to go further down the path that I am in now.  I love my co-workers to death they are all like family to me.
good,"very fast paced customers were rude, but management always backed up their employees 100%."
good,"Your typical retail job."
good,"Flexible Hours"
good,This company is very well structured. You are provided with well laid out training and the is a good support system.
good,"I loved the people. Everyone was always so nice to each other. A typical day consisted of stock room, go backs, cashier, sales floor, and dressing room. I learned how to do all of these jobs very well and efficiently."
good,"unload truck"
good,Ross is a growing company with great senior leadership. The leadership in the particular zones depends on who you are working for and can be very political. They expect a lot of their store managers and all employees who work for them.
good,"Part-Time hours varied"
good,Do not attempt to make this a permanent job. They don't offer much.
good,"My time working at this store wasn't a good experience for me."
good,A true building experience from a previous work field that involved remaining at a desk.
good,"Ross has been very accommodating for the several years that I was in school and flexible with my schedule. Ross provides a fast paced, fun working environment that allows for exposure to several different personality bases. Upper management has demonstrated a knowledge and appreciation for those that opt to further their futures through secondary education."
good,A typical day at working is I come in clock in then get with the supervisor to figure out where I am placed for the day. Then I walk already the edges of the store (highway) once. I start picking up where I was placed. I learned how to move rapidly while working. I feel my management was good understanding people because of my schedule I was working & going to school they worked with me. My co-workers where very sweet and helped me out a lot.
good,"-Great customers."
good,I had an extremely hardworking team at my store. I enjoyed working with my direct boss and co-workers. Fast pace with barely enough payroll to work with. Upper management needs to provide support and treat all stores the same. Upper management favoritism is hard to avoid in the retail environment. Too many changes in a short time and piling on more work for the SM and ASM managers.
good,The job its self wasn't too stressful.Just the people who were supervising became a hassle
good,"The job overall is easy to do when you are not being barked at to go faster and being talked down. You do not have to be talked to crazy in order to get the work done. And also there is a large amount of favoritism, which there is usually always some in every place to some degree but this is going waaaay overboard."
good,"•	Provided materials and assistance to customers, other employees, and maintained a clean store."
good,"where i worked in the stockroom at dds discount, and i am to lead by example, but yet my stock lead doesnt do nothing and the team does and she gets mad when we are not completing the  task for the day but we are all part time, and she is full time, so wat we dont finish it is her job to do but if you are not doin nothing all day, what do you expect,  hard work low pay"
good,"At Ross there is an awesome amount of team work for the most part. The people that work at Ross are super as well. I don't like however that we are over worked and under paid, part-time associates are only given a max of 25 hours a week and they are split up into four hour shifts, you are put in the store without really any training and expected to be doing par if not better then your peers, and the security is tight in the store however they are not there all of the time and that is what is making are shrink go up"
good,"we have to tray to work most faster possible reicibe,process, and take out the sales floor the items,we most to work in a team work to finish the job in less time possible."
good,"I loved working with coworkers, It was always a lot of fun at ross just had to always had to be prepared to WORK. I learned the ins and outs dealing with being a front end supervisor. the hardest part of the job was the hours and cleaning at the end of the day."
good,A typical day at work consists of helping as many people as i can on the register by staying on process and working with a sense of urgency. I learn how to deal with all kinds of customers and assisting them any way i can so they can have a good experience. My management team really rely on the associates to be productive and efficient with everything they do. They do no do a lot of coaching but I learned fast. The hardest part of my job is trying to make sure other associates are on task. The most enjoyable part of my job is just working as a team to bring the store together and help our customers.
good,"I loved working at this store, I learned how to to things I have never experienced. My co workers were amazing and I looked forward to coming to work daily"
good,Its a good job to start with but it is little room for growth and the management could really be better.
good,Requires you to brown nose to be promoted. No consistency through out the company. DM will tell you to post a fake schedule to make it seem like you are hitting payroll
good,"A fun place to work, love the atmosphere and the environment."
good,The company itself was not bad but my management was slightly racist and would not let me advance. They made me feel unwelcomed. The best part was the industry party invites and they close down for a week during the holidays. 
good,"typical day involved stocking, re-pricing merchandise. Management needs much improvement. Co-workers gossiped too much."
good,Learning to drive the heavy equipment was the best thing that could have happened to me at Ross.
good,"Amount of work doesn't accurately match salary. They work you to death at the beginning, but eventually you'll find your niche. Long story short, it's for people who want to make a career at Ross or those who are looking for a temporary position until something more appreciative comes along."
good,"It was a fun job, we just went through so many managers that nothing was stable."
good,outstanding co-workers and well that`s all the good things
good,"it can be better, managers sometimes don't know what they are doing.."
good,I was going to school and working after school. I was always tired but i had to do what i had to do. The management suck they always was worried bout themselves.But the job was easy  
good,Very flexible with schedules for all empoyees. Needs to offer more benefits for part time employees.
good,Fast paced and requires good time management skills. Not very many hours with minimum wage.
good,Very low pay 7.79 and when they say part time they mean it 17-20 hours a week . This is a job for somebody who does not need to worry about their bills . I would love to work more hours but instead they hire more people and give less hours out so they do not need to pay benefits or anything and if your not manager forget being hired full time they dont do that. The only good thing is they are flexible with your schedule and the discount is good .
good,"Most of the people are friendly and easy to get along with, the pay however is not so great and neither is the training. You never work in one depart you are supposed to be trained in all areas of the store but it is more or less given a sink or swim approach."
good,Early days and late nights are in store when working for this company.
good,Love working there for love working with people. My boss is very understanding however there are others too groupie and young. Not a professional atmosphere.
good,"Employees made working there a great experience, upper management did not appreciate front line workers which resulted in high turnover rate."
good,"Normal Manmagement Duties, Depends on Current District Manager........Just Get Ir Done"
good,"ROSS may be a great place to shop but if your looking for steady employment that actually pays then its best to keep looking. The pay is terrible, the customers are worst and management is more concerned about watching the employees rather than prevent thief and fraud"
good,"It was often very hectic, the management was not helpful or fair to the employees at all and often left all of the work up to the stockroom crew that I was working with. My team was very fun to work with, and seeing them became the reason I went to work everyday. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with the store manager and his laziness, on top of his tendency to get into the personal business of others."
good,"a fun, friendly enviroment, meeting new people, able to see new merchandise that arrives at the store, plus the employee discount is the best. ive learned (MOD) manager on duties skills, co-workers are great to work with, hardest part of the job is dealing with frustating customers and working late at night to recover the store"
good,"It was great working at Ross, Ross provides all the tools needed in order to keep moving up the ladder."
good,"You may not have the need to go to work because of how the job is, the manager, and emplyees. I learned to control my temper at all times and to stay showing a smile on my face. The manager is very nice whenever she wants to but she will get on you about the most smallest things. My co-workers were kind, sweet, and nice to talk to they will even have your day at work be the best. There really wasn't a hard part at work for except for the people working in the back room sorting out the clothes,shoes,and accessories,and even picking up boxes. Most enjoyable part is being around your associates having a great time."
good,Very busy and fast paced environment. Staff is mostly on minimum wage so it's imperative that there is consistent training and providing of direction.
good,"I didn't like the rules that the company had, and management was ok . They could be quite rude to customers. It was a retail job so I didn't expect much."
good,"As a MOD my job is to coach, recognize, and observe associates."
good,Dealing with the craziest customers in the world. Spend most of the time cleaning the store just so that it can get destroyed.
good,My typical day at work was working the sales floor adjusting the merchandise and making displays look neat. I learned how to markdown items when the were on sale. The managers there were ok to work with. my co-workers were fun to be around. There was no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
good,"Full time Job, Hours Got cut back, became part time job."
good,I work with a lot of great people. They make my day go by smoother and easier sometimes. Being in the stock room can be hectic. Understaffed and not enough help. People not doing their part to help out sometimes and the list goes on. It can make your day very stressful.
good,a typical day at work fun
good,Typical day at work involves a lot of rotation of work assignments. If you are not busy they will put you on the floor or whichever they need you. Work hours are fluctuating too so it's only good for a part time job.
good,"Management was ok. The workers were great though. Everybody had a great time working with each other. Supervisors did their best to help, but the hours scheduled was very low."
good,"The pay was TERRIBLE. The hours were long, and the management was overbearing. No advancement."
good,i deal with my dayly work Completed all of my duties
good,It is very stress enviornment to work in lots of miscommunication.
good,It was a good place for maybe a first job. There is a lot of cleaning involved but with so many people coming in the store it doesn't seem like you cleaned at all. The shoes are the worst.
good,The supervisor and other employees were very friendly and easy to get along with. I was only hired seasonally there but enjoyed the work and my schedule.
good,Great experience for those interested in retail. Ross allows its associates to work every aspect of the business.
good,They do not observe or manage the staff much. They do not allocate the work fairly or assess well the output of the individual employees. Some of the other employees are either unaware or do not care about harassment or disrespecting others and the management does not address it.
good,"Management are to much of a hardass, you go to work not even wanting to be there. Why is some many characters needed to do this? 150 is a bit much imo"
good,Supoort from management was very little at best. Issues would arise for some one from management level to assess and repair and they nade me as a supervisor deal with them even though they were definitely above my pay grade and requirements for the job.
good,Definitely has some management problems but overall not too bad. Managers definitely play favorites at times & don’t always recognize those who actually do their work well. Nothing too extreme just frustrating at times.
good,a typical day at work for loss prevention is dealing with drug addicts and thieves on a daily basis. there isn't much for loss prevention to do than to stand by the door and observe
good,"This is my first job and I loved working there at first, Now it pays the bills. With correct management, this place would go back to how great it was like when I first started. Get better managers, all I have to stay."
good,"I was working two jobs, this was a nice side job with easy income for the work. Definitely don't work here if you don't want extra stress lol My co-workers were pretty cool to be honest however I was way too stressed to have two jobs. Many opportunities for advancement and extra hours if that's what you're looking for."
good,Ive learned alot from Ross. Always busy wirh customer's. Friendly place to work and the discount's were good. They only offered part time hours. Flexibility wirh the hours worked out great. Management pushes great customer service and a well kept store. I enjoyed my time there. But needed a higher paying job.
good,"I was a part of SPS (Store Prevention Specialist), and it was an ok job. Hours were pretty much the same most of the time, the pay was ok, management was a little off the hinges sometimes, and breaks/lunch were always strictly enforced which was good (which means you didn't have to work through them or cut them short)."
good,They will put you on to wrk and not tell you then you get a call the next day asking were are you when you checked lastnight you were off but they put you on after you leave without telling you
good,"It's a very profitable company, upper management leaves a lot to be desired. Company can be a little pushy at times for results then changes directions at the drop of a dime. This has happened on more than one occasion in several different departments."
good,"Though the ross facility maintains diversity and equal opportunity, the associates with seniority favor themselves. A strong sense of divide between the team that's there and new employees make it difficult to grasp the ""life game"" that is presented. It is openly difficult to maintain a healthy balance between home and work. Educated workers find ways to bring about your personal life without you knowing how. And it continues if you try to talk about it. Also ESL to keep secret activities afoot threw the work day, to confuse you about whats happening around you. Isolate you to your one task. Like you arsnt part of the team."
good,"It was horrifying to see all the mess"
good,"Each day, used to be easier. When you first learn the job, its great if you're focused on one area. You learn to ring up customers, clean the store, restock products, rehang and organize clothing and putting items back to their right place. A typical day is literally just cleaning and reorganizing the store to look clean and organized by categories but its gets messy really quick due to the flow of customers. When working on putting new products out, there isn't enough time to place everything out. When the store is quiet and slow, its easier to have all available associate to start cleaning the store and organize the clothing sections. There will be days a manager on duty will be ringing on register for hours straight cause there is a lot of customers to be checked out. "
good,okay place to work for. It has literally no benefits. you also only work a couple hours a week if you are part of the stock team. This place should offer more hrs to employees
good,"This is one of the easiest jobs you can have. However, the people made the experience dreadful. Other than the people, we were barely ever given any hours making for a low check at the end of the two weeks. If you're looking for an easy job then go for it. If you're looking for a career then look somewhere else!"
good,The atmosphere makes the moon God I you don't even wanna be happy to work there amount of clothes lack of staffing managers is sitting in the office no good
good,I loved the discounts..  hours were great and the fact that it was a mon- fri job. With steady hrs. U had peak season but they informed u 2 wks ahead so u can arrange ur daily schedule to theirs.
good,It is very fast paced and you are given a certain amount of things to do in a certain amount of time which can make it stressful and then there are some days its not so fast paced.
good,everyone was very friendly and welcoming. the hours weren't bad. Everyday was pretty much the same routine. my favorite part was unboxing everything from the truck.
good,It’s good place to work. Most of the time you’ll be under a fast-paced environment so patience is very important . Definitely not a place to stay for ever.
good,Typical day is either working on the sales floor or being a cashier for the night. It is a fast working place. When on the sales floor you would be SET your department in the style you were trained to. The hardest part would be when inventory is around.
good,"management was lacking and associates had to pick up the slack, was a good place to work besides their drama.  easy to learn the ropes and do the assigned work."
good,"Ross is a good retail experience, but the management has cut my hours a lot and i only work 4 hours a week now. Overall management is good and nice except one of them who will not be named."
good,The work there is pretty easy you just have to make sure to always make a good percentage.its a good place to work at if it's your first time working because they train you and give you some warehouse experience.
good,Ross Dress for Less is a good entry-level job but is not a good place to make a career. The pay is really low and raises are rarely offered. External hires are often paid significantly more for management positions.
good,"It’s okay and not bad , I benefited a lot and how to help customers. I practiced more English and improved it , I also made many friends , I got a lot of experience whenever I contact with different people and ages"
good,"The environment as an employee was not always professional and advancement was highly based on favoritism rather than work based. Regarding management, it was extremely hard to have a one on one conversation that was not used against you in some way or had some information released to other coworkers."
good,I am learning time management from a different perspective.  I am learning not only to better manage my time but also to coach people in managing their time to better assist the needs of Ross Store.  The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with satisfied customers.
good,Its a good place to work if your a college student or live with your parents. The pay isn't good enough to live independently. There is a lot of favoritism when it comes to career advancement. The manager only promotes who she likes instead of who can do the job. Customer's are complete idiots. So if you don't have patience this isn't the job for you. Coworkers are amazing and you have fun moments and teamwork.
good,"Not a bad place to work but they do not pay enough for the cost of living, it’s an ok place to work if you are a young and in high school but I wouldn’t recommend it for an adult who has bills to pay."
good,"They have an extremely high turnover rate, no real deterrent for shoplifters (if anything they make it easier for them), and all employees are treated like numbers and variables vs people. Unrealistic customer service requirements, management is either left to do it all or others were lazy and overworked employees. Needs were barely accommodated to. I ended up being stalked by external security guard and told HR. The company not only did nothing, but they disregarded the trauma and the situation almost entirely."
good,"Great discount for employees. Perfect place to work part-time for those who want only a few hours and are able to just go-with-the-flow with no expectations. "
good,"Unfair managers don’t address the issues the associated inquiere about "
good,"I worked at Ross for over half a decade"
good,"All stores a different, the store I work for as poor management. The managers have favorites and let them get away with just about everything. Ex. you tell them someone isn't being a fair co-worker, they do nothing about it, but as soon as that co-worker says something about you, they are quick to say something to you."
good,Easy to get job. Managers were nice. Closing is not the best. Easy to move up in position. Have to be okay with being under pressure. Being quick with hands will help a lot when setting
good,"Hours are good if you put in the work. (They're willing to try and keep to your availability). Revolving staff, management doesn't discipline so staff gets away with too much"
good,"*Fast pace environment"
good,"I honestly feel like they don't pay you what you're worth, the managers are unprofessional and messy. The hours are up and down, never consistent....."
good,A typical day working at Ross entails that we cash out customers efficiently and in a timely manner. We were also required to ensure that the store remained tidy and always being there to answer questions for customers.
good,The customers you get to know make it worth while going to work. You develop a close relationship with alot of workers due to putting so much time in.
good,Ross is a very strict company that has everything down to a science. Everything is timed and driven so hard. Working there hasn't felt like a second family to me even though I want it and do what I can to make that piece a reality. I feel slowly drained every shift and work has become my life. I don't do anything else cause I'm always at work or recuperating from work.
good,Very fast paced. It’s hard to fit in your breaks because of how busy it is. Customers are always rude and complain about things I can’t control. If it was a different environment I would of stayed
good,"Typical day. You'd get mob of people at random times. At times it can be slow, but that can fairly quickly. Lines can be short or very long at random times that it would surprise you. You just learn how to be quicker at making count of the money and being able to memorize things pretty quick."
good,I was in all the positions on the sales floor also stock and cashier. I’m a quick learner so I’m glad there was friendly employees there to help me after all
good,"Watched the sales floor and protected the merchandise."
good,"Management was often sick making it difficult to work. I was promised to be mentored by the manager instead of my job coach, it did not happen. Breakroom was always unclean."
good,"Like most retail stores, it gets messy. Customers destroy the place, and usually the night shift has to clean it all because the day shift is too busy helping out the customers in line. Other than the mess,the staff is nice. They are very flexible with the schedule. If you are going to school, or have another job, they’ll work with you which is great."
good,working at Ross is stressful most of the time because one person do 100 things at the same time and sometimes the manager doesn't do anything . the employed got to do everything is suppose  to be a team work but is no like that. About culture there is no Latinos at work only american black people because a manager decide it like that is a lot of discrimination just in some stores.
good,Wonderful coworkers everybody was friendly and nice even the managers & leads was respectful and helped me a lot while I was there with this company ...
good,Ross Dress for Less is a good place to work for anyone who is looking for a part time job. I am a full time student who needed flexible work hours and i was able to find that at Ross. This job helped to work and practice on my social skills because i had to communicate with customers and my fellow associates as well. The hardest part of my job has been Managers not being considerate of issues and tension going on within the work place.
good,"Employees work hard to get their jobs done in the best possible way"
good,"Ross gave me the opportunity of growing in my career. The environment was hostile at times, but that is the only negative thing I noticed at Ross. The company treated their employees well."
good,"I generally like my coworkers and managers. There is a good balance of challenging elements to easy routine. It is fast paced - especially when part of the stock team. If you work there, expect to have to keep track of your own training and remind managers sometimes when they have not gone over protocol. The job becomes much easier once you are familiar with where everything in the store is located, and how to secure the merchandise. Seems like a decent job. Draw back is they don't have full time positions open very often, and at times hours are hard to come by unless you are able to snag shifts when people call out sick. Schedule is not super predictable."
good,"Basic minimum wage job. Flexible hours, job culture is okay, management is fairly nice, associates are a mix. In general, the people are nice, customers are nice, some customers are aggressive and rude (but that is all retail). If you do not want to deal with customers, I recommend to apply to the Sales Floor, Loss Prevention or Fitting room position, and not the cashier position."
good,"I worked here for a job not a career. It was part time and honestly not too bad. I think my least favorite part was that we had to be suspicious of everyone (they tell us to be) But really I liked the people I liked the work, there was only one manager that I didn't like. Learning to use the cash register is the hardest part but really it's not that hard to pick up."
good,"It is very fast paced on the front end when I was a supervisor, especially during the holidays. You learn to be quick and make decisions as often times customers will try to bargain for discounts on items along with learning how to keep an eye out for trouble makers in the store."
good,"Management sometimes was unaware of how to do things causing a lot of confusion, but were great people, always cared for each employee and if you needed help they would be there, just unorganized"
good,"It was long hours, and also vigorous and strenuous. You have to have a strong mind to maintain a healthy work flow. Much strength is needed for the boxes are very heavy."
good,if you are just trying to find a side gig but i dont see many options to advance and become a long term worker there. its more for like a flexible job for students.
good,Ross was a great place to work great opportunities to interact with different people a great way to help others and learn about different clothing brands and others opinions. Able to help customers when they find an item.
good,"Ross is a fantastic store with great savings, but it's Management lacks and certain job positions get paid more to do less. Job advancement is very rare and takes a while, and pay raises are miniscule to none. Great benefits and great people is what makes this job worth it."
good,"I worked in stock and used the cash register. In the stock room , you get there at either 7 or 8 in the morning. It is fast paced but there are very fun tasks. Cash register is fast paced as well but you could take your time a little more. The hardest part about working at Ross for me, was being switched and having to learn the register. Over all, it was a great job."
good,Ross would have to be your first priority.  With me being in school I can't do that. So that is part of the reason I choose to look into something  different.
good,My overall experience was okay worked here for 4 years it's hard to move up past supervisor because they like to play favorites there is not good training for new associates there is always payroll issues so they end up cutting half your team the area supervisors always have to close the store you don't get back to back days off and they expect you to slave for really low pay you never get the bonus they say you can obtain and the raises suck.
good,"If you like the helping customers aspect of working, you do not really get to do that in this company--which can be great for some people! I do prefer conversing with and helping customers in the other job I had when working here, but then I had this one that you did not as much. So, the two jobs being different in their approaches to customers, it was kind of a good balance for having two jobs. It just stunk that people would call off work and I would get called in a lot. I can't say no to people and since I worked two jobs, that stressed me out."
good,"As an employee at ROSS:"
good,It became a great plus fun experience meeting new people /customers and associates while working in a fast paced friendly environment. Learned new skills that helped me work my way up from part time to being promoted to a fulltime position as a Supervisor.  Gained a lot of training and Supervisor skills which enabled me to train other associates on a regular basis. I enjoyed being on a leading team.
good,Ross taught me the fast-paced retail industry. I can't really give a fail review as I wasn't employed with them for very long.  I enjoyed working with the staff
good,"Not a bad job, but some of the higher ups lack empathy a lot when it comes to  having to call off for family issues. The pay was nice, but the shifts were kind of eh."
good,"I loved working with my co workers. I love meeting and greeting different people everyday. I think they need a little more organization in each department. But when you work with people you get along with ,it makes everything run smoother."
good,They contradict themselves because they want the organizing done right and when you are doing it they say you take too long so do you do it fast and messy or do it right?
good,"When working at Ross, I received low management, barely any hours a week, and constant workplace drama. Managers would spend hours in the day talking poorly about the workplace if they could."
good,"I worked in receiving/ putting product out. Fast paced and a lot to remember, managers didn't want you to talk while your monotonously hanging up clothes or placing product on specified shelving for hours at a time. managers were always expecting you to get more work done then you had time for. If they didn't make enough money or there wasn't a truck they would cancel your shift and wouldn't always give you a heads up, you would come in and have to go home. during slow seasons they would reduce your hours to practically nothing, hours that only stay at home college kids would be able to work with. Hours were fairly flexible."
good,"while my direct supervisor was a kind gentlemen, and i did enjoy working with other departments occasionally, my manager was less than honest and often talked about other employees to various individuals and had no real professionalism, its an amazing place to shop, and some employees are genuine, but i wouldn't go back to work at that particular location again."
good,They stretched their employees as much as they could money wise. Work was ok just a lot of annoying kids/ some rude customers. Overall it was mildly stressful with no progressing.
good,"I enjoyed working with all ross employees  , But wish management was more present and understanding. The hardest part about working here is during the holidays. Too much work for not that many employees ."
good,I like this job even though it was a part time job I was able to advance to a key Carrier. It was nice having a staff that believe in you and your abilities.
good,"Not much teamwork. No benefits. Poor communications. Rules not applied fairly. Lack of training.Revolving door for area supervisors. Never fully staffed so the burden is placed  on the few good workers, while the poor workers still get paid when they cannot perform their jobs."
good,"Very busy especially during the holidays, expect long nights sometimes did not get out until 2 to 3 in the morning because we had to stay behind and reshop and tidy up the store"
good,wish management was better. also wish you got to leave at the time you  are scheduled to leave because there's been occasions i've had important matters to attend to and was late because of the job.
good,"Very inconsistent schedule, policies, and pay increases. Management doesn't care about employees. Loss prevention policies focus on employees rather than customers. Can be a fun workplace, but the cons outweigh the pros of working here."
good,"Company works on production, if you don't meet goal you will get demoted."
good,The store manager is pivotal to how the morale in the building and they can make or break the culture of the store. The benefits are not bad at all the company vison is clear. The company has only grown since I started there.
good,Very fast paste environment and it sure does make the time pass by. The workers are the best part they keep your day going and positive on every shift.
good,Fast paced work area worked with friendly co workers i received  good job training and a good working environment good supervision and help on the job
good,"Depending upon management the company can be a good place to work for. "
good,"Typical work day at Ross is quite. Customers come in, shop, purchase and leave most times. I learned how to deal with customers and employees on a management level. Workplace culture is clean, neat and organized. Ross is big on acknowledging employees for achieving goals. The hardest part of the job was motivating employees to work hard to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job as an Area Supervisor, I was in control of when I went on break."
good,"Ross Dress for Less works you to the bone! They ask you to cover shifts due to frequent call-ins and people coming in late which is fine every once in a while but you do it once and that’s it, you just became their go to person. Ross never lets you make any overtime, they are stingy that way. They make you clock out if you get close. Absolutely no medical benefits. They don’t pay you enough for all that you do. The constant upkeep of the store is overwhelming. You will literally do it all! The only great thing about working at Ross is the people that make the time fly by and the 40% discount they give employees 3x’s a year, that’s it. Their starting salary is almost an insult with .25 cent raises annually."
good,"On a typical day at work, we are always limited to helping out the customers. At times we are under staff and can seem to get customers checked out. The manger does a good job at getting people to work, but needs more help on hiring new people to reduce the gap between associates and cashiers."
good,"Job is easy and I mean real easy, as easy could get. Just organize, pick up after lazy costumers and walking around. Its not a bad job if your coworkers are pretty cool, but that is usually random depending on the store."
good,Part-time shifts are usually about 4-6 hours per day and usually 10-20 per week. Very diverse work environment and flexible hours. Hours are not always guaranteed because hours have to be cut for payroll very often. Pay rate is decent for someone looking for a part-time job or a college student. You won't get full time hours unless you have a managing or supervisor position.
good,"I used to hate working at Ross because of how I got little to no respect from customers, employees, and employers, but the new management is making a slight positive change to the store which is good. But there’s still a lack of communication between employees and management and there aren’t enough store meetings. There are never enough people on the sales floor and the people that are hardly do their job and sometimes don’t even come in to work. I also dislike how corporate cares more about how fast someone is on the register vs their customer service. The people with the nastiest attitudes are kept on the register because they get the people in and out."
good,"The company is good. The managers they hire must go thru certain training, because some of them, really, did not know what they were doing. "
good,"A typical day at work includes completing SET assignments, and helping customers when assistance is needed. Keeping your area clean and neat is a necessity and following protocols to identify shoplifters and notify managers."
good,Friendly place good for team work and flexible hours.I was stocking and keeping company organized for next business day. Providing accurate pricing of merchandise
good,Its okay Its very messy. They dont have bags so you can actually but the customers items in due t management not ordering any.  They dont train you very well either.
good,Very stressful and draining majority of the staff does not care enough to put forth the effort. I believe if the staff was paid more or at least get a minimum of 30 hrs the staff would care more
good,"ok if you need a job fast to pay bills, have to work fast and meet a percentage. They let people go fast. No benefits and you are considered a temp worker but they did not tell me that right away. Gotta move fast and they will cross train you for other areas of the warehouse in case they need you there. Can be cool to do if you like the new job but it is hard when you do not do well in it."
good,"A typical day for me at Ross included straightening assigned sections, putting go backs away and cleaning up sections. I worked the dressing room, security, and the cash register. The management when I left was just barely starting to get itself together. When I began working there, there were almost no policies. As employees, we were told to put things taken out of the packages, back into the package and put it back on the shelf. We were even told to do this with broken items until they got a manager in that knew what they were doing."
good,"I learned  many things at dds  but they do-not support there store leaders and associates but I learned to work high volumne  sales and cashiering, merchandizing,"
good,"it was okay, not my favorite. Its a place to make money as a first job, I definitely felt taken advantage of, i did my job while others that had been there longer would just sit and talk."
good,"Understaffed daily, huge workload daily.  Under-appreciated by management. Constantly pulled from one area of store to another to assist with clean up leaving little time to complete your expected tasks."
good,"Ross is a good place for internal promotion if they don't interview the candidates based on ""Mouth Interview"". Rather than that, it is flexible and busy place to work."
good,"It is a good place to start your career life. The hours are flexible and if able, employees can pick up more hours. I encountered people who I now call my friends; it is a friendly environment and everyone was helpful. I would recommend this business to someone who is looking for an entry job."
good,I helped to restock the sales floor and also make sure the entire store remained clean by picking up clothes or even shoes and putting them back in their appropriate areas. I learned that this type of job can be very stressful at times but when being helped can be fun.
good,"Strict rules but not the best job training. Work pace can be either slow paced or fast paced. Typical day at work is pretty unset, you could be set as sales-floor associate then be called to register and remain cashier for your remaining shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the conversation with customers."
good,"A lot of the coworkers are really fun and nice and will help each other out. The management is not so great. Sometimes your breaks get looked over because they are always ""busy"" doing something to let you take your breaks."
good,"Pros"
good,"Good first job. A lot of different departments, my coworkers were great! little to no hours, pay kinda sucks. Good experience for customer service. Need patience."
good,Hours range between your availability but sometimes based on Payroll. I learned that you never take things personally and always serve with a smile. The system to learn either Register or fitting room is easy to learn. And most of the associates are friendly and willing to help you if you have any questions. Overall a decent place to work.
good,It was relatively the same every day and it was never too strict. You would arrive and clock in and then un pack boxes in the back and sort them before taking them out to the floor and placing them in their designated areas.
good,Fast paced workplace. Hard to move up in the company for certain people. Good team work as long as the store manager is a willing participant in the team effort.
good,There are a few difficult people to work with but the majority of the management do not care for their employees and hardly care for the store. I would recommend as a part time job otherwise you might end up doing most of the work as a hard worker.
good,working at ross can be okay it has its advantages and disadvantages like they really don't give their employees a lot of hours i was working about 8 hour every two week wich is literally nothing also when the holidays come they make you work into 4 in the morning and they give you about 30 to 40 hours a week which is good but in the holidays its a lot of work and i feel its not fair what they pay us i believe that in the holidays we should get payed more due to the amount of work their is to be done in the store. but overall all the manger and the employees make it a friendly and relaxing environment to work in
good,"There'e favoritism within the store. If there's a favorite that wants you gone, your gone. They play like they care until they get enough from you to hold against you. They manipulate people to get a laugh out of people. Not going to drop any names of management, but they're very unprofessional and they start a lot of rumors. Nothing is confidential, so keep your outside business to yourself. All in all fun place to be but don't dedicate too much of your time working here."
good,"had a flexible, working management staff that was involved with it's employees. were open to adjusting schedule for school and also to give extra hours "
good,I loved working and helping people find things I have my honest opinion I like telling people they look good I loved stocking and reorganize and working at the cashier
good,"Great company ,trending is very well in growth in higher brand clothing ,lack of communication throughout dm and zone adamin and hotline  great sales ,"
good,"I basically work a manager job, but im not getting paid for it. It's a decent retail job, but it would be better if raises were given every 6 months..."
good,It's a difficult jobs the hours can come and go when. It's a physically challenging job from time to time especially during the holidays. There are so benefits for working there whether you are part time or full you get a major discount.
good,"I didn't learn alot from this job, the management was so laid back the let the associates run the store for the most part. Alot of the associates got away with doing whatever they wanted with no repercutions,"
good,was a nice work experience but in need of better management. co-workers were really nice and work was nice and easy in itself but time clock and other factors were really annoying.
good,"Ross is a good for young adults, anyone who does not currently have serious bills, or anyone looking for a second job to have extra cash in their pockets. Management contradicts each other by the second."
good,"When you get off at 10 but you dont go home until 12 sometimes 1, not fun. I loved the discount but dreaded coming to work. I did have a few friends so you have to make the best of who you work with."
good,its a very organized place. the hardest thing about working there is that it can get hectic if other people arent doing their job because it makes your job even slower and harder.
good,i would only suggest anyone to work at ross cause of a handful of managers i use to work with. ross had its fun moments but overall i think evryone was there just to get a paycheck.
good,"There is ALWAYS something to do at Ross. It is almost always busy, lots to put away, lots of customers, and little time. The pay is minimum wage and they want everything to be perfect. Even though it never is. ALTHOUGH the managers are wonderful and I mean the best I've ever had. They get the work done and have a good time with it. They care about both the customers and the employees. and if you give it a chance Ross is a really great place to work. It just takes some time to get used to. But, so do all jobs."
good,Discounts where great. Every 3 months for 3 days is our 40% employee discount for employee appreciation. I always look forward on those special days. Also when markdowns are marking down tickets are great for really cheap bargains
good,"for one of my first jobs it taught me you will have to work hard in this world to advanced. it was fast paced a lot of hour, gave me a glimpse of what real OT is"
good,"Flexible hours for school or another job"
good,"I really enjoyed talking to customers when I was working as a cashier, however I feel like the culture of the store was more fast-paced which I didn't enjoy. A lot of coworkers looked like they never wanted to be there."
good,I would tell anyone about this job. You’ll definitely learn more about this company as days go on. It’s a great place to work its just like any other job you have to be on your toes and reach production. But besides that the staff and management is cool. It’s a very professional environment to be in. And you can definitely move up in you career with this job if your serious about what you want to do. You’ll have many positions to choose from that best fit you.
good,"Help customer find items, maintain a clean and orderly work place, and assist customers with purchasing items. I learned a lot about the cashiering system. Management was always so understanding and friendly. I had great fellow employees. The hard part of the job was not being able to work more then 25 hours a week, but i enjoyed the environment of Ross!"
good,"Everyone was kind of lost."
good,It's a great place to work very peaceful and your pace work and friendly people. You'll love going to work everyday and its a fun place. They have a great break room with many types of foods.
good,Ross is great for someone who is looking for a job that does not dip into your own time. You will not take work home with you. Very customer services based job.
good,Would not work here ever and would not recommend.  Did not like sitting in consultant area on benches instead of cubes. Not a desirable place to work in
good,"A typical day at work was almost like coming into to work watch out for any suspicious activities with the customers. What I learned from this job is building better communication skills with the customers and associates as well. Also, building a healthy work relationship with the store manager. The workplace culture was very much relaxed, although some days it would be slow on the weekdays but completely fast and competitive on the weekends."
good,"Ross Dress for Less is not bad place to work, but when working in retail one need to consider a lack of hours given. A person can not manage their life if they are given 9-12 hours a week and paid bi-weekly. How can someone manage their bills? Other than the lack of hours and pay, Ross is a good job."
good,"For as much work that you do and what is required of you, minimum wage is not enough. It can be very exhausting continually organizing shelves and clothing racks. I enjoyed working in the cash office mainly because i was by myself for the majority of my shift. Was also proud to be considered for the position but there was no pay increase."
good,"a typical day at ross is putting out clothes all day long staying on your feet most of the time. ive learned how too be a good team player. the managment team was very nice and friendly. workplace is casual dress code. hardest part of the day was nubbing all the hangers with s,m,l,xl. having fun at your job is the best thing you can do."
good,I like the company overall. I do think they need to work on a better loss prevention program and give more payroll. I feel like there are a lot of favoritism going on in some districts.
good,"This job is perfect for college kids, high school kids or for someone with a second job. You will work min, wage and get about 25 hours on average working for ross, and sometimes less than that. Stock team is a lot different (at least the one I work for). We are 100 percent family and it kills me cause I can't afford to work a part-time job and live off on my own. If Ross offered fulltime jobs to the great employees they had, they wouldn't have such a turn over. I love my job but the only thing I hate about it, is I cant afford to only work 25 to 30 hours a week."
good,"no matter what position you are, you must do everything. they have this hotline that would get the best managers fired and not even DM and store managers cant help. theirs never payroll and every year they want to cut everything and give managers to do everything as if you were just a regular employee."
good,"Hours were good, good management, just not my type of job. I enjoy feeling productive and of good use to people. Me checking out customers buying socks and underwear just wasn't my thing."
good,"I originally applied for overnight shift because of school and at first the shift hours and environment was okay but then they started expecting you to pick up other staff members slack and stay till things were finished. The companies expectations were very high and as a result we could never get the truck finished. When my work schedule started interfering with my school schedule I knew I had to search for something more flexible, reliable ( started cutting hours) and less stressful. On a positive note the staff were very personable."
good,Company expected a lot out of us for not much compensation. Co workers were the best part of the job. Most workers never got raises unless necessary by law.
good,"A typical work day would involve making sure the customers were satisfied. I assisted customers, stocked shelves, and made sure other sales associates were up to par."
good,"This is a face-paced job, your shift will go by quickly. Working at Ross, I learned so much about working in a sales/retail environment. However, just because it is a retail position doesn't mean the job will be easy, you will be expected to do everything fitting room, register, sales floor, etc.. You will be expected to work at a very fast pace, in multiple departments. If you've ever been to a Ross you know that that store is very scattered and very unorganized, so covering multiple departments is very tiring. Working here you are always racing with the clock to get so much done in a little time frame. Every time my shifts ended whether they were 4 hours or 8 hours I would get home very exhausted. I worked at other retail stores and the workload was not as demanding as Ross' expects from its employees. If you work at Ross be prepared to work very hard!"
good,"A pleasant place to work. While with them I learned basic costumer service skills, money management, cash register, and some supervisor procedures. During the time I was associated with Ross it was under what I would now consider poor management. However that was almost nine years ago."
good,when I first applied for ross I applied for sales associate when I went in for my first day of work I actually was in the stock room when i was not told that i would be starting in the stock room
good,"Really poor management, always scheduled understaffed. Long hours. Hard to advance. Other than that meet very cool people that worked there. Would recommend if first job."
good,"Loved it here, something different, I like retail but not so much. Everyone was so nice and caring. I was always busy. I was there for a month and then got bumped up to front end supervisor."
good,"I worked there for almost a year, as one of my first jobs in an actual company environment. I learned a lot and take what I learned with me, but was working manager position jobs for minimum wage while I was still in high school. I worked way too many hours, and tried to get less but kept getting scheduled. It was very understaffed and unorganized."
good,"Even though i worked as a janitor, i felt like there wasnt respect amongst the employees niether torwards the Employer. Meaning that professinal relationship towards each other when and when not to joke around."
good,"Always busy, many customers, main focus is making sure the store is up to part for a good shopping experience for customers. Not much stuff, huge work load."
good,"You have to constantly be on feet and standing, sometimes walk long distance to get to your area that you work in and it takes up all your lunch break but if you can do it then good for you."
good,I liked working there just wish there was more hours  and better pay. I especially loved the discount and all the friendly employees. Very good first job
good,"Ross dress for less was a good company over all bit a few minor things needed to be addressed. Employee  appreciation and advancement is just one off the top of my head ,in my experience a leadership position was promised and dangled over my head over a year ."
good,"Personally i have noticed that each Ross store is different, they all have different type of management and work experience. When i started working there i can tell many people really disliked the job, you have to deal with rude customers on occasion but this is normal in retail.The job felt very repetitive and didn't feel rewarding at times, i worked as a Loss Prevention, most of my time consisted of greeting customers, watching cameras, monitoring registers and coaching associates on the stores monthly top 5 which basically meant the top 5 areas of the store with most loss, the associates are required to remember these top 5 areas along with other things like the monthly safety topic and knowing the number to report in-store theft. The most annoying part of the job is doing a self rating at the beginning of your shift with the area supervisor, this was honestly so repetitive and honestly seemed useless. its 5 minutes of repeating the same information every single shift and you are rated on your self rating which ranges from 1-5. 1 being the best and 5 being the worst, no one ever got a 1, the average rating was always a 2. The self rating consists of many things little numbers and percentages they expect you to memorize, 5 minutes of pointless repetitive information, Ross needs to change this self rating and implement something new, other than that if you dont mind standing all day and being insulted once in a while for following customers then this job isnt so bad for you, at least they are flexible and allow people just joining the workforce opportunities to gain some experience."
good,"I was hired because a new store was opening. My first and only week was 6 days of hard work and overtime. I was hired assuming I was a valued employee that would have the opportunity to advance.I was let go after working Grand Opening because ""the store was expected to meet certain requirements but had to let people go because they were unable to"". I was hired solely to set up the store. The manager never bothered to learn my name and say it correctly."
good,"It was a good experience and I enjoyed a lot my job and learned a lot of things in this store. However, the schedule did not match with other activities that I had in that moment,  because my schedule was very varied in the store."
good,"Had several positions.  Got to use my customer service skills often.  Training was minimal, lightweight customer service training.  Frequently changing schedules, often with little notice."
good,It's a fun workplace it's just not enough hours. I need a place where I can feed my family and still maintain a fun workplace. They dont want me to leave but I need a new job with more hours.
good,"Decent enough retail job. Customers are horrible, the store was messy all the time, coworkers were rude, management played favorites. You spend your day working on the floor cleaning up the same area 100 times, and then getting called to cashier every 10 seconds. Workers used foul language and played like it was a playground during work hours... embarrassing. If you can help it... work somewhere else."
good,"I interacted with the public, I ran racks, I organized and cleaned the store daily, I directed to people to the right areas and worked a phone. The hardest part was dealing with a lot of people, it can get overwhelming at times. The most fun part was meeting new people and finding out what we had in common and making new friends."
good,First Job. Worked the sales floor and also did cashiering which taught me how to handle money. I also helped with loss prevention by tagging necessary merchandise and letting my supervisors know of any suspicious activity.
good,"Working at Ross Dress For Less is a stressful job. It is almost inevitable that I will get yelled at by a customer every day that I go to work for a policy I didn't create. The hours are very unstable, and it is difficult to work a schedule that changes from week to week."
good,"Great team work, impressive management. Trainers were very good & thorough. Reasonable breaks, Nice break room. Great store opening, & very successful."
good,"Never a dull moment. Business has always grown over the years with the great prices. Management team is always on the go and always multi tasking. If you seek a lay back job, this is not for you."
good,"As a manager there was never a dull moment always something new happening each day. Had to always adapt to certain situations such as is the truck full of merchandise on time, did we get the floor move done on deadline, is everyone hitting their productivity, are our customers being greeted by our SPS team, and so on and so on. I've learned a lot about retail and how to please a customer. The hardest part of my job was letting an associate go. The most enjoyable part of my job was when we were able to get together as a team and celebrate milestones of goals we were reaching together."
good,"Fun workplace with a nice blend of students, young and older adults of different cultures and backgrounds that help makes Ross a comfortable environment for Associates and customers. I deal with difficult customers, no different than any other job, but also encounter lots of great people. I've grown and learned a lot in more ways than one during my time there."
good,"Worked here for about a year and a half, has job security but depending on the season you could get cut hours. Overall youll never be bored, and great staff!"
good,"I rated it a bit low on the scale, but that may have just been my personal experience. Hard work tends to go unnoticed sometimes and it's a minimum wage entry level job, but advancement is possible if you know the right people and work yourself into oblivion."
good,"My review for this Ross would be fair. It is good job for college students, but not for a career. You have to be a very people oriented person to work in retail. Ross would be a good start."
good,"opening exercise in group; report to station and do production work until break/lunch time. "
good,"A typical day starts at 5 am, have to get there earlier bc it takes the managers a while to open the doors for the 5 am team. I learned that they value speed over those who've been there long enough to reward the ones doing the job fast enough. The hardest part of the job in the 5 am team, is that we get left with the bigger boxes that the 1 am team chooses not to do and stack more clothes inside and we are pressured to get it all done because there is a cph, which means there is a certain amount of boxes one must complete by the hour, and if you do not meet that requirement they will cut your hours down. And most of the 5 am team are not able to meet that requirement, and there is also no supervision to help change racks and give more hangers like there is for the 1 am team. I have worked only 3 hours a day and that was it for the whole week, which the manager had told me they wouldn't do that, but was a total lie, and it takes me 15-20 min to get to work and home. To me, that is not worth the gas and time. But the most enjoyable part of the job for me was the 5 am team members and how much support we got from each other."
good,"A Night at work is another busy night lots of customers on a daily. what i learned while working with Ross is time and Productivity."
good,This job is a good part-time job.  You get a discount and can choose your availability.  My store manager tries to address and accommodate all employees.  The discount you get as an employee is the best benefit for this job!
good,Ross has a great model in the products that they provide.  Products do become damaged and the site managers are able to drop prices as needed to sell the product.  The job is what you make of it.  There are no political posturing within the management team which is refreshing.  Managers truly try to help one another in making the job easier and they support each other beyond what I have seen at other retail giants.
good,"Feels like they want a rotating door for employees. Hours cut from 33 to 12. Then, I got cut down to four hours. New employees are getting double what I am getting, and I have been there for almost two years. Feel like I am getting forced out. Feel like I am not valued as a person. I can't live off of forty dollars a week."
good,"Very Busy, face paced, holidays off are great ! The management wasn't so well but it is a great company. Friendly people."
good,Great place to work with great people. Work load is a lot considering the pay. Employee discount is great. Being part time is great because they work with you.
good,Ross is crazy but then you love working here. The managers all always all ears if you have an idea or a problem. You always get recognized for the hard work you do.
good,"As an employee of Ross the work environment is positive but you work ridiculous hours and is constantly busy., You truly is overworked with little pay."
good,"A typical day of work involved writing detailed logs of any and all events that took place in the store during my shift rather it be a routine perimeter check or suspicious activity. "
good,"Ross has many opportunities to work in many areas of the business, however the culture is competitive and sometimes political."
good,The employees were very friendly but the management was awful. it is a very fast paced workplace the only thing I didn't like was working in the dressing room because hispanics would come and you had to try and translate to help them because you had to take their clothes and count them and they wouldn't let you and you would get in trouble if you didn't take their clothes and count them.
good,"This company was designed and implemented by a group of stock investors.  It was designed to run lean, with little emphasis on customer service, and lots of emphasis on low prices and sales."
good,Oriented and daily changeable work place.  Things are constantly changing so you're in an environment to learn new things everyday.  The particular store I work at has a friendly environment but refuses to abide by and follow through out their own policies and rules.
good,I like the management and the work isn't hard. The store is just very disorganized because of the multiple change in leadership roles it has gone through while I have worked there.
good,"Fast pace at work, stocking shelves had to be done as quickly as possible in a timely manor. People I worked with not to friendly nor helpful. Training was not much helpful, and did not get that much hours to even cover any of my bills. The hours were not guaranteed."
good,I have learnt that I have to be accurate in everything that I do. Respect the management and be a team player to my co-workers. Is to always be on guard for stock that comes in and out with no mistakes. Is when the management gives me a positive feedback for the good service that I have rendered.
good,No room to grow within the company and with the little bit of room management have favoritism. Management doesn't ask several employees to see who fits certain position.
good,Some days the work would be okay and enjoyable but other days I would feel like i don't wanna be there. Some of the managers were good they helped me when i needed it and they were understanding when it came to personal things. But others were not to helping when it came to personal things and even when i had questions about the work.
good,"A typical day working at Ross is always busy, and tiring. I was always moving, there was always something to do. Which is not bad, but I do think the employees deserve more than nine dollars an hour. Management was good, I could never exactly see the work they did, but I'm sure they were working hard. Co workers were for the most part easy to get along with, but the attitude of most workers gave off the idea that they did not want to be there. I would not say it was a place I looked forward to going everyday, but I appreciated the job. The hardest part of the job is definitely being on the stock team. I would know because I pretty much did every job possible at Ross. Cashier, Sales Associate, closing the store, clothes team, and stock team. I had to wake up at 3am to be there at 4, and during the holdiays we had to be at work at 2 am. The store is always messy from the night before, and we were timed. We had to get all the boxes out by the time the store opened, and a lot of the time we were unable to get it done. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people I met while working there. Overall, I don't wan't to look down on Ross because the employees work so hard. But I would not recommend working there."
good,"The hardest part of the job was the timing required for the Stock Team. No benefits that I can recall, but definitely a fun work environment and loved my assistant manager!"
good,It was a good place to work. Was treated fairly and given time of if needed.  Hardest part of the job was unloading the truck.
good,"I Enjoyed working at Ross it was hard but I like the Associates and the customers. The Value was good. Store recovery and merchandising daily,cleaning, cash control, just some of my shift responsibilities."
good,"Give or Take... it was lacking hours and days for me."
good,I worked at two different Ross Stores. The first store was such a pleasure to work for. The second store....not so much. It had to do with different management styles. There were a lot of inconsistencies with the second store.
good,"A great place for customers to shop for great deals, so there was a lot of foot traffic. The goal was to make the customer's experience as easy and friendly as possible while also getting a great deal"
good,"They'll push you to be as fast as possible, if you're fast, you get rewarded extra pay, if you're slow, you'll get fired."
good,"While working at Ross, I started off as a cashier but was quickly promoted to the stock room. This position is considered ideal since it is the only position in the store that has set hours. I would work Monday-Friday from 8am to 12pm, unless otherwise asked to stay longer this was my schedule. I learned what is was like to process clothing in a fast pace and efficient manner. The best part of the job was the teamwork there was between the stock team and the sales floor team. This is a high volume store but we worked together to ensure a neat and organized store was always available for the customers."
good,I like working at ROSS but I don't like how many hours you get before and after holidays. The coworkers are great there and extremely helpful. Management could be a lot better though.
good,"At Ross we do all jobs for Fitting room, while answering the phone, counting clothes in and out of the dressing rooms as well as helping with any questions customers may have. As a cashier I scan and bag each item, greet customers, handle money all while keeping a smile and being friendly to everyone. On the sales floor running racks with clothes, helping customer find items and being back up cashier all at the sametime. While in stock I help go through at least 100 plus large boxes of mechandise and sort onto heavy shelfs that roll around to put merch out onto the floor as fast as possible. In a typical day I could be in stock then go to the fitting room then end up at the cash register at the end of the day."
good,clock in and look on the daily assessment to find out the days plan and department I would be working in.. Go to the depart begin organizing and picking up clothes. Help assist cashiers if the line exceeds the average limit.
good,"Ross is a great place to worked. the management team work with your scheduled and you are a part of a team , but the down fall off everything is the hours are bad and all the part timers are barely making 15 hours a week. chance of growing within this company is being close friends with one of the management teams, not your work performance."
good,Dds discounts was my first job in 12th grade and i liked it. I got promoted quickly so that was a plus for me because they noticed my hard work and dedication.I stayed there for a year.The only reason i left was because i found a better paying job that also offered alot more hours.
good,The place was always messy and dirty. Most customers were rude. you were timed at the register on how fast you could check someone out and alot of drama with former employees. And for all the work you did the pay salary was horrible.
good,Fun place to work the ross process on the other hand isnt very well thought out. Good opportunity for growth but the whole corporate view they have on the company labels it as a thrift store.
good,"It's a very comfortable, friendly and energetic work place that you will see or interact with a lot of different kind of clients everyday."
good,"We are the buying office for dd's DISCOUNTS, a branch of Ross Stores.  I assist the SVP of the East Coast Ladies Division.  I am responsible for; scheduling/calendar, expenses, coordinating trend sheets & weekly sales reports & all travel for her & her entire east coast ladies team."
good,"This place will astound you day by day with many things. Your typical day is a part time shift, varying from 4-8 hours. Sometimes they provide pizzas for lunch which is cool."
good,People are nice to work with and always very helpful. The store is very busy sometimes but the managers always give a clear guide and are patient.
good,"I loved the but some of the management team was good at first and then, management started an relationship with each other and that's when it be came to much because if you didn't do something a manager asked you to do because she was going with management she would tell he and when they made the schedule he would than cut your hours which wasn't right."
good,"I would either open the store and designate employees to get the truck unloaded and merchandise sorted and put out. I took care of all monies in registers and safe, other times I would close out the store which meant, counting and logging money, getting deposits ready, merchandise put up, store cleaned. I delegated jobs to employees as needed on a daily basis, handled various situations w/ clients. "
good,The management team i worked for was great. But the company does not pay the employees for all the work that they demand. Moving up in the company is easy and they work with you. However you get stuck at a certain spot for example supervisor and dont move from there.
good,"A typical day at Ross can be very enjoyable. I loved all my co-workers who were friendly and very helpful. My managers were great. I loved coming to work until my hours got shorter and shorter.  I wasnt getting enough hours to take care of my son's need, so I quit and went job huntting the same day."
good,"Great pay, nice company gym, and awesome Cafe. Nice place to work and nice perks. I really would rather not write this review."
good,"Ross was a steady and consistant place to work,there were a lot of fun, friendly,and energetic people to work with.Everybody worked very well together as a team and gave great customer service."
good,It's exactly what you would expect. Shoddy wages but the best part about the job is your coworkers. Managers are typical managers - they need to fill the scheduling gaps and will do what they can depending on how hard you work and how often you're late. Flexible with school because it's a college town. Dress code is kind of tacky but it's doable. Team building is kind of a joke within the company.
good,"A typical day of work consists of at least two angry customers. You'll be stuck on the registers most of time. The company went public not too long ago so there's budget cuts everywhere. Less staff, less pay, but very easy to advance within the ranks. If you don't have a college degree, I'd work here as a manager and move up to assistant store manager."
good,"I worked around Christmas season so everyday was very busy. I have learn so many new great experiences by working with different people. The management at Ross was good, they were caring and willing to help with any issues. The job was very easy but I had to do a lot of stuff at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking and helping customers."
good,Hardest part about the job was figuring out when to shift from the assembly line to building boxes. I learned the importance of getting to work on time and the value of hard work.
good,"a typical work day would be very fast paste, i learned how to use gladiators which are hand held computers and scanners. management is okay, my co workers were very hard working , hardest part of the job was handling the work load. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting incentive at the end of the day."
good,a typical day at work would include greeting customers in a friendly manner. work the cashier if needed or scheduled to. plenty of team work. staying extra hours just to help out if someone else doesn't come in for their scheduled time.
good,was a very crowded environment but all fast pace. was never cleaned up and had a staffing agency inside so people where getting hired and fired daily. was a good place for me to get a glimpse of how warehouse work is
good,A fast-paced work place. Being able to multi-task is key and essential. Having fun working together as a team. Greeting and offering help to guests.
good,kind of fun to work there fellow co-workers and customers were the funnest part of the job. go into work clock in find my register for the day then start taking purchases when we would sow down each employee had a section of the products they would clean up mine was either the mens shoes ot mens clothes. continue through the shift taking purchases.
good,Every day was a busy day. We would have to unload and merchandise an incoming truck every day. We were to stick to a very tight schedule and adhere to it based on sales and time of year. There was always something to clean up or to improve in the store.
good,"5 years-Retail associate "
good,Fast paced with continued changes of plans daily. People skills are invented in this company and needed to be successful. Management team are supportive and associates were aggressive to attain company goals.
good,"I love buying stuff at ross also love to work there. But I have seen a store that needed help bad. It was scary working there the head employees was talking trash about the new workers. I was not involved in their rude conversations, very over the top aggressive assistant manager that yelled at a customer. Even though I seen bad stuff the pay was worth it."
good,"This is a very fast paced, busy store.  Being close to an international airport brings people in from many countries.  The language barrier can be quite challenging on some days. "
good,A typical day at work would be to help maintain the store and help customers.  I learned what it takes to stock shelves and learned more about responsibility with it being my first job.  Management was alright just didn't like my job being held over my head if I could not complete an impossible task.  Great and fun coworkers enjoyable to be around and work with.  The hardest part about this job was having to be awake at 3am in the morning.  The most enjoyable part of this job was closing the store and making sure everything was set up and ready to go for the morning crew.
good,"I have been working at Ross Since August of 2013 and I don't have any major complaints other then the pay. I honestly feel that Ross is a great secondary job. They work around your school schedule and are really good about trying to give you up to 25 hours on your schedule if you ask for it. However if you want to go fulltime, I have noticed that they ask older coworkers before the college kids simply because I feel that they feel college kids aren't as dependable and responsible, which in general they aren't. So since I don't plan on working retail for the rest of my life I don't take offense, but I do have bills to pay, which is why I am looking for that secure 9-5 job."
good,considering that I love working here ross is really a flexible job and everyone's really nice. It really helped me become a great employee.
good,"As a Manager, a typical day at Ross was coming in and performing opening procedures ( checking emails for company directives, checking sales from the previous day, Filling out the MOD checklist"
good,"A typical day can consist of anything from being on a register, running fitting room racks, which is a rack filled with clothes customers decided not to get after trying them on in the fitting room. Recovering a assigned section of the store, covering lunches to running go back, which is items customers decided against at the register. its a great way to gain customer service experience and build communication skills. However the pay is not enough for someone with a lot of expenses. There is a 25 hour per week cap for part time employees and the pay is minimum wage, with no possibility for a raise in at least a year maybe more. This is a great 1st job for anyone just entering the working force, preferably teens and college students. The hours are flexible and they work around your available schedule which is great. You get to meet new people everyday and you can meet some great friends while working there. The customers can be a bit rude at times so self control and anger management and patients is a must for this type of work."
good,it was a great place to work but the hours were too short and the A/C was never on
good,"Enjoyed working with people. Good Co-workers. Always something to do, and I loved that!"
good,Meeting different people everyday was exciting but not enough organization within the place
good,"Ross is a good company to work for, just not at the moment with how sales are going. A typical day at work for me consists of; helping customers on the sales floor, stocking items, being a back-up cashier (if needed), and working the customer service center. I can't really comment on my co-workers because I only see two or three other employees working on the day that I get to work. There hasn't been a hard part of my job except for when we are understaffed for a day and I have to jumble everything with a manger."
good,"its ok. its not really fun.its just a job. you work 4 hours at a time. I learned to not expect too much. management was ok. my co workers are fun. the hardest part was fitting room and that sucks.'"
good,Fast pase buying office.  You need to be energetic and be able to multi task.  You need to have an understanding of consumer you serving and develop good relationships with suppliers and coworkers to achieve your goals.
good,"Monitoring entrances/ exits and sales floor for potential theft by identifying suspicious behavior."
good,Overall Ross is a good place to work. They have an excellent benefits package for their full time employees. You get a discount on purchases and additional discount 3 times a year.
good,Management is friendly and work well on minimizing operations of shortage.
good,"On a typical day we come in and do our ""start"" for the day, run any go backs, greet customers, and provide customer service."
good,"Fast paste work environment, associates enjoy the benefits of employee discount. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people."
good,It is a type of job that you will work hard and have fun. you can find some great people from all walks of life to work with.
good,Same thing different day. Boring and monotonous. Little pay and horrible hours.
good,"Ross has great people and is also fun."
good,Frequent advancement opportunities.  Company definetly promotes from within.
good,"When I first started here I had no idea what I was doing, I had never worked in retail before. My first day was chaos! When I walked in they just expected me to know what to do and where to go. I had to track down a manager and ask what I was supposed to do or who my trainer was. He looked at me like I should already know what I'm doing. There was no trainer which made it harder. Thank God for other employees who helped me out."
good,"My work place is a fast paced environment. As loss prevention I've learned how to demonstrate a command presence as well as communication and observation of internal and external theft. My co-workers are fun to be around its probably the best part of work, the worst part would be the angry customers. I handle the angry customers best i can trying the ensure they leave satisfied."
good,"learned many things, great discount , poor scheduling, and poor pay"
good,"I learned how to deal with angry customers and a polite manner. My managers were tolerable, they wasn't the best. Some coworkers were cool to be saround."
good,I had  no employees problems with other co workers. The biggest issue is with Ross and the scheduling. I was extremely flexible. I always was taking up other people shift and most of the time it was last minute notice. The problem was that management would call you in 2 hours and need to rush to get there. I learned on if i ever became a manager what not to do on the managing of short notices. I learned  a lot of different things and much about retail as whole.
good,I want recommend any one to work at the Ross Distribution center unless you are hard for cash. Its a lot of hard work with very little pay. You only get one break which is your 30 min lunch break.
good,This company has very low pay for the work you have to do. the discounts for the store is great but it is a great part time job just for extra money.
good,"Although the job is pretty self explanatory, it was a bit difficult due to the mess that accumulates throughout the day. Especially for evening shift, as the work load at the end of the day can be a bit much. It was fun working with customers and handling the clothes and shoes as well as all products sold there. It just wasn't for me."
good,Al ot of stress but had a great time the time i was there.  Really strict on the cashier part.  The stock room part was great.  You always knew what to do and always had something to do.
good,Very easy work experience. Most enjoyable part would have to be customer service.
good,"Average days here were the morning shifts, if you work the mornings then your days are bad. Managament exspected for regular crew to perform their duties and that were not in job requirments. Only thing that you knew was they day stayed busy, whatever and however you are doing things. Hardest part of the job was to tell a customer that the merchandise that they paid for yesterday is not going to cash for return, due to the item being on clearence today... Last minute for a lot of notifications."
good,A usual day would be me standing in the front of the store for hrs at a time. Greeting customers as i take mental pictures of everyone. Every hour i would take a walk around the store while checking all the exits and storeroom. As the day progressed I would write everything down and check everything off. Most workers are friendly and caring. management is good. its a busy store so i know they get stressed out. Hardest part was the whole standing so long in one place for so long. You definitely need good and comfy shoes. i enjoyed the occasional chats.
good,"Ross Stores as a company is great. Always productive ,co workers are awesome and always flowing with customers."
good,"the management here is poor, but the store itself actually isnt too bad, wouldnt recommend anyone being here for too long"
good,Days are usually long and tiring but my co-workers were awesome.
good,"Don't get me wrong, the employees are fun to work with and I made a ton of friends there, which made the job a lot more bearable. But the customers were rude, the store was a mess and we were always understaffed when we were closing because we were never given enough hours. Corporate would come in and make unnecessary changes which would only mess us up more, so it was always a drag when they came around."
good,alot of work to do with little pay and on busy business days it can be rough
good,gave me working skills that i will never forget but the compensation for the work that i endured while working here was not what i expected after working there for so long and they are liable to lay you off without any warning at any time 
good,It was a different type of feild working with all types of people
good,A typical work day began at 9:30 am with me opening the store. I first checked the EAS system to see if it was working properly.I then gave out walkie talkies.
good,not a bad company to work for. so of the management in some store knows few about running department stores.
good,I was management so I had to adapted to 46 diffident personality's.
good,Typical day of work including working long hours without breaks
good,Everything was sloppy and unorganized . I felt like i didn't get paid enough for what i was doing everyday . There was different managers every month .
good,A typical day at work would be on the register constantly getting the long lines down which was tiring.
good,"Come in, open boxes, categorize contents of boxes, stock shelves"
good,Its very similar to working in a bank. The company has no tangible culture. There is very strong growth potential.
good,"Management doesn't communicate very well. Co-workers are great people, energetic, and enthusiastic. We love to work as a team. The hardest part of my job is saying no. The most enjoyable part is, well apply and you shall see. Ross is enjoyable place to work. My manager is great about working around your availability which makes it better."
good,"Although it was a good job to have with another job, alone it would not pay the bills, the managers didn't communicate, so every manager (usually 2 on at the same time) would be barking commands at you to do at the same time, however the 2 other managers were amazing and very friendly! They did change the schedule randomly and expected all employee to stop by daily to re-check it."
good,"A typical day is coming in going to the back to put your things away putting your name tag on and going to the salesfloor to find the MOD, then getting stationed somewhere"
good,open to close walking around the store ensuring safety and customer satisfaction. Friendly co-workers.
good,Most empolyees leave after a few weeks. Management not so good will not give you breaks/ lunches on time but will ask u to stay overtime.
good,A typical day at work is to start taking our truck around 10 10:15 we unload boxes on to hummers separated in category's (bed & bath /home/toys) we also get accessorys that we seperate in blue bins (men's/kids/womans) after unloading someone will start hanging clothes and the rest of the team will run hummers and blue bins after that another person will hop on clothes as the others start to process shoes stock lead will usually process purses and comforters after all is processed it is audited by the stock lead and ran by the stock team. Management will help if needed and are a great support team.My coworkers are easy and outgoing we all get along great and when u get along u can get things done fast and accurately.The hardest part of the job.theres nothing hard about it it's a simple easy and fun.The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and greeting new people.
good,"bad management team, the managers were very unorganized."
good,"Job was easy, and all the co-workers was nice and easy to talk to."
good,"I enjoyed coming to work when I had to just to involve myself with customers. I'm very friendly and easy to get along with. Being as though i can help others, makes my day go by. The work was easy and wasnt as challenging because I'm a fast learner."
good,Couldn't take all the changes in management. The customers were rude and there was nothing you could do about it. Loved my co-workers. They became like family.
good,"I it was a really great work enviorment. I loved working there but i simply could not live off of the pay. starting i only made 10,000 a year."
good,"A typical day at work involved checking customers in and out of the fitting room, maintaining a professional attitude, and being dilligent to avoid loss prevention. When items were given back to me by customers, I hung them on a rack and put them away. If I was working the closing shift, I had to organize the lingerie section and help any other section that needed it. I learned how to deal with loss prevention, and how to be patient with customers. The managers were ok, however, they were not forgiving with school and other activities when it came to my schedule. My coworkers were hard working and dedicated, with a few who were not as hard working. The hardest part of my job was handling having so many associate managers and dealing with impatient and rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make a customer's day by being prompt and courteous. Overall, Ross is an ok place to work."
good,checking daily budget making daily adjustment from truck unloading to daily sales floor operations closing store nightly. Being the only manager at store 4 nights a week.Greeting customer and provide them with the Best customer.
good,The typical day at work is very busy atmosphere and i was able to pick up and the learned the task real quick. My co-workers were always on my side as a team and working as a team. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up the store around closing time picking up all the merchandise or any clothing that wasnt in its place. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday that came into the retail store
good,My shift varies between 4 and 7 hrs per day.
good,"Easy job but you do have to like to clean up after adults and listen to their complaining when they want a already discounted item for practically free. I didn't completely hate the job and it can be fun at times! I loved the Tuesday's , Senor discount day. Although I had a discount I only bought two things out of the year I worked there. I think its a 20% and twice a year you'll get 40%( spring and winter)."
good,"Not so good hours, managers are nice and understanding, but the hours are not so good."
good,"Its a very fast pace enviornment in the stock room. I enjoy the fast pace and the people that i work with. i have learnt alot of things while at my time at ross stores such as speed, accuracy and the importance of customer service. my co workers are easy to get along with and we work as a team."
good,worked several jobs worked with a blended crew the most enjoyable part was that i was able to get free lunches
good,"Worked at this company for 3 years and I have seen employees come and go, many have quit because they weren't receiving any hours. There is hardly ever enough employees scheduled to work. If you are seeking job security or financial stability then this is not the company unless you are a full-time employee. It has a great employee discount and a great place to shop for some of the best brand names clothing."
good,"This store is overall a great job for college students with a low chance of being promoted to a higher level. Hours are not guaranteed, but you are given a decent amount each week."
good,"I disnt mind working here I really enjoyed it but I worked at one pon the strip so there was a very big language barrier that made it very difficult to really help customers to the fullest, but over all it's a good company to work for."
good,Management failed to provide direct guidance to ensure success.  Management discussed the performance of associates with everyone except for the individual that was being discussed.  This caused a toxic work environment and the inability to trust management.
good,"I got payed $11/hour in Idaho. The managers were amazing and willing to help with personal life problems. Everyone was so friendly and unique."
good,Work was nice everyday. the people and the atmosphere was just delightful. i really enjoyed my working experience there while i was there. it was sad to go.
good,Management cares about the cleanliness of the store and the employee second. Shifts can be short or long depending on the amount of employees seasonally.
good,Ross dress for less a typical day for me was quiet and very slow what I leaned was to take control  of all types of situations store management was fair the work place cultural was rough the hardest part of job was dealing with customers  the most enjoyable part of my job was my CO-works
good,"Working here you always have something to do, I gained a lot of experience that could help me at a lot of retail jobs. The management is always changing, they weren't very flexible with schedules and gave write-ups for things you had no control over. Other than management, I enjoyed showing up to this job and the co-workers were always willing to help and guide the way."
good,"There is little to no skill required to work this job, but the way people are treated by the customers is ridiculous. This job is good until people show up with loads of attitude being rude to everyone they possibly can."
good,"The job at ross was good , everybody was really nice and always had a good attitude. Everybody got along with each other. Everybody worked at a team and always try there best to help others"
good,I've have gather so much experience and learned alot of new task especially at back room also I operate the back room was fun to work at the stockroom.
good,What stands out about the company is meeting different people. The customers bring out the best within the company they my job a lot easier. The bad is the management.
good,Nice people good manager I love the pay time was nice I am looking for more working time and somewhere closer i am a good work hard working and on time.
good,"Working more Saturdays than I would like making hard to make any plans on the weekend. Expectations are not the same across the board. If you work hard and care about your work, more is put on you compared to your counterparts with no real compensation."
good,It's always busy.  Customers can get rude and impatient. There is often instances where customers steal.  The days can go by quick if it is busy.  They will hire anybody to be honest.
good,I learn a lot from them but I knew that I was going to look for something else. All the time I spent there I learned a lot about the perimeter of the store. Places to keep my eyes on to mitigate theft and fraud. I also had to make sure that employees were do thing to keep the store clean and understand the mitigating theft process.
good,"The pay was good but when it came to my department which was unpacking and shelving shoes, we were understaffed and expected to do too much.  At first, they wanted seven boxes per hour then it went up to eight, when it was clear no one was reaching seven boxes per hour. After that, they changed how to unpack and secure the shoes, making it even more difficult. Very unstable!"
good,"The hours are very flexible to work, and the work load is not hard at all. I really enjoy the people. I just hate that the pay is bi-weekly. Other than that I have no problem with this job"
good,Mostly there was a lot of work to do every night unloading and stocking for the truck. The store was alway under staffed putting a lot of pressure on its crews. However that lead to plenty of hours for those who were productive and wanted to work
good,"They give hours if you need them. But if they don't need you, good luck getting them. When I did get hours, it was a pretty easy job, but the managers were the type to want you to do 50 things at once."
good,"Descargar el camión, Falta un poco mas de organización,"
good,"They come on with a family friendly work life balance talk, but it ends up being retail as retail can be..... HR is way to soft and doesn't allow you to execute accountabilities in order to purge your team of incompetent members....."
good,There was a lot of great people but management was not great. Manager had favorites and it was not fair. Mangers where never held to the same standards as employees and it shouldn't be like that.
good,"Great people, fun environment, the pay was not so fair but it’s been yearsss!! And u find great bargains while at work was the best part! Shop and work it don’t get no better!"
good,"PROS :"
good,"Working at Ross was a experience for me..it was a ok experience first time Workin in a clothing store, a bit overwhelming for the job and low pay as well, sometimes it can be a bit busy and crawded other than that it was ok."
good,"It was a nice job but they fired me because I was misunderstood by a co-worker, answering a co-worker honestly about what I did when not at work because she asked I wasn't gonna lie."
good,For the most part I enjoyed my job. I liked the busy part of it. For it made my shifts just fly by and I liked that. I would much rather be busy than standing around slow and bored. As for the management team and co-workers. Management sucked while I was there. The store had no structure or organization what so ever and it was constantly a disaster. Inappropriate behavior and language by employees infront of customers.
good,"Work here is hard, they want everything to be perfect but honestly you cant if there's not alot of people working especially at night time. This job is ok not so great."
good,"Its fun an all but the management team is horrible they do not want to take time to help you fix any issues your having, some of the employees have left since store opening."
good,"If you like helping customers & seeing them smile from satisfaction because of your great customer service and rapport with them, then this the place for you."
good,"Day goes by fast..."
good,Ross was a good job. They would also work with you with being flexible with the scheduling. They worked with when you could work and it was a friendly environment
good,"I learned alot with the company, but did not like that fact that I was put in unsafe events with no back up. The company should of have better practices when customers would get violent."
good,"Changing schedule without notifying employees, some managers treated employees poorly, Store was always busy with no managers to help out employees, and Half the time no one got breaks."
good,"Productive, fast paced environment. Opportunities for advancement are easy and limitless. Laid back atmosphere, but nonsense is intolerable. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with people of various backgrounds."
good,I didnt get much experience at this job because I did have to move country. I was only there for a month or so but it was overall ok. The hours is what sucks but the job it's self was okay
good,They are pretty flexible but will not give you a lot of hours so a lot of the employees there will often have a second job just so that they can support themselves.
good,"Working as a Stock Associate, can be stressful. In the store I work in, management does not stress merchandising so the floor looks sloppy and I'm one who cares about merchandising because that's how you attract customers to buy."
good,Ross was a very hands on job with alot of time to interact with customers and co workers.   Alot of cleaning and organizing of clothing and materials.
good,"I worked in PTL for a year and a half and it was amazing. Shipping is a nightmare because of the supervisor. The supervisor in shipping will throw her employees under the bus to save herself. Example: will lie about things you did to get you in trouble, give you false information etc."
good,"It was really nice working there, I wanted to go full time but they just didnt let me, to be honest I dont know why, then they started  cutting my hours."
good,"This is s great place to work for part tine, and aldo if you like working in as fast paced environment. You get discounts on several items of all types"
good,working at ross as a loss prevention specialist was like being a Walmart greeter. I just said hi and bye to people and occasionally checked for stolen items.
good,Dealing with customers can be quite stressful. Management required us to deal with those customers and wouldn't help unless we asked them to. People can be rude
good,This company is no too bad well they need to open more store in the area i hear customer asking when they try to open new stores in the county because they have to travel long distance
good,Past paced always putting on new products. Always recovery in the stores cus customers tend to be messy. Customer service there isn't really any.no organisation of were product should go
good,Ross Dress for less is a cool store for the most part. It is a store where you can get more for less and is a store that you can be well pleased with.
good,"ROSS could be a great company to work for, depending on which district you are in, which makes a big difference in your lateral success. "
good,A typical day at work is that I clock in and I clean up my part of the section that I've been assigned for the shift. I interact with customers and help them in what they need.
good,Good work. Must be willing to be under pressure. Fast paced environment. Many opportunities to move up you just have to put in your own effort. Good benefits.
good,They can pay some of my bill but all. I only all 40 hours if it's like special events. Basically it just Christmas. The 20% discount is good but not enough income.
good,Good but not great it was okay it got the job done and helped me grow my professional career and gain the experience needed to pursue further endeavors
good,Is a good job if you are looking for a part time job. You have to work the fast as you can because everything is about time. Is a fast paced job. I like to work in the stockroom.
good,It was a stressful day at work and they wouldn't give me enough hours to work. I was always stressed and unhappy. I hat to resign and focus on my studies for a better career as a medical assistant.
good,"Always try to stay on time."
good,"It was the most lamest job i've ever had. It was my first job and i did not enjoy it. They cut off my hours, made me lose motivation because i would only work two days a week,so i quit."
good,Managers worked against their co workers although there is q policy that states the manager shouldn't get involved with their work. Don't mix business with pleasure. And that happened.
good,"Working here it is important to help each other throughout the store. If one person falls behind, so will the rest of the team.  It is necessary to keep a positive outlook during your time here."
good,You can start by working there and be okay I wouldn’t retire there though I would definitely work for a year or two  Manager are cool Not all of them.
good,Great place to work. You have to work hard and fast. The job is overnight so you have to plan out your day and try to get rest before work so you would be able to perform at a high level.
good,The managers at the time were both very uncaring. One of them was very rude to me in front of customers and embarrassed me. Another kept us working into the early hours of Thanksgiving morning. One of my coworkers at the time was going to the bathroom to throw up over and over that shift and she wasn't allowed to go home until about 2/3 am.
good,"First off I hate working you don’t get pay enough, they cut your hours, they call you whenever they want and they don’t have a set schedule. So I don’t recommend this job"
good,"Working there is great as it has it's pro and con. The pro is that everyone is nice even the manager. the con of working there is the rude customer, worker calling off a lot, and manager not wanting to do there job or don't know how. "
good,retail is always stressful to work at but if you have a great personality and are willing to deal with customers you will do great in the retail enviroment
good,"As the first person the customers approach, I project a professional appearance, positive attitude and informed associate who will assist their needs."
good,"If you're a student or want a part time job, Ross is flexible and is generally low stress. It has a very corporate atmosphere which is a bit stifling but if you're looking for extra spending cash, it's not the worst place in the world. Not recommended if you are adverse to fluorescent lights."
good,"To work at Ross...although it was about 5 years ago for me, so I'm sure things have changed since then, but it was a very fast-paced and high energy environment. I wouldn't say i necessarily enjoyed my time working here, but it was definitely a great first job for being fresh out of high school."
good,Ross was a great place to work. They really take care or there employees. Ross cares about the welfare of their employees their safety. Ross has great benifits.
good,They expect too much from people. Must do 2 boxes of apparel per hr. They time you to do everything. Dont give so many hours they change the schedule every week. They dont give same hrs when they hire you and keep saying thry dont have enough money in pay roll.
good,good  enjoyed working there had good relations with customers     they were good with me with my time schedule   got along well with my coworkers had a great time while working there
good,Shorts breaks! I THINK THE Breaks could've been longer. it's good on Saturday they feed you also can earn blue chips for more money in some departments
good,Great place to work. You work with people who cares. Can be and is very stressful. Not enough payroll to complete the job. Customers can be extremely messy unlike other off price retail store.
good,Overall the store is alright very fast pace and a high demand on product in the store. So if your looking for a fast pace work environment I suggest you apply for Ross!
good,"It's a good job for a few years. At my store, we have great managers and supervisors. The other co workers are great and work hard. The training process is great but it still takes time to get as all jobs to get it right."
good,"I wouldn’t recommend working here . They are unorganized, my hours were all over the place . I didn’t really care for the job . I love shopping there how ever but work wise I probably wouldn’t go back"
good,For high school students. always changing rules or guides they never want to explain the new process the managers depending on who they hired and location will play favoritism. its messy and more or less a hand me down store. Slightly stressful during holidays customers are rude.
good,"Monitors entrances/exits as well as sales floor for potential theft by identifying suspicious behavior."
good,Cant say much just started not long ago and so far it's been ok good pay for the job but could be better too much standing and killer on ur feet lol but fun
good,Very easy very fast paste it's a good work environment sorting and packing wasn't hard at all I didn't really have to much complications It was a very productive work place i've been there for a few months and I would recommend it to anyone else the pay was good and the hours went by quick ...Ofcourse there's alot of standing but you'll get use to it eventually ..The breaks give you enough time to rest and relax until it's time to get back to work then before you know it it's time to head home
good,Customers act as if they have to throw thing on the floor. You spend hours organizing just for every thing to be a disaster when you turn your back for 5 minutes.
good,the environment is very fast paced. you can not afford to slack off. the work itself is easy. the dress code is pretty self explanatory. the management needs work
good,I was there for less than three months- the workplace was fastpaced and messy. You have to work together to get things done and put. Its a job I'd recommend for those who are new in the job market with no experience.
good,"Managers were not the nicest, not very flexible or willing to work with you on any occasion. Best part was being able to see the awesome merchandise before it hit the floor"
good,"They really kept me occupied when needed. I always was working and i got the hours i wanted. If i could work there again i most definitely would. I just didnt like how assertive the managers were , the job paid well they just made me not want to come into work sometimes"
good,"My responsibilities included checking people out and making sure the received the best customer service. I love working with people, customer service is something I pride myself on. It is always my goal to find ways to better assist the customer I am helping. I utilize strategies of attentiveness, clear communication skills, and knowledge of the product. Customer service is a goal oriented focus for me. It requires tenacity and a willingness to learn."
good,"As a cashier you had a timed log-in and it would log you out after a few minutes of inactivity, sometimes even during transactions, causing you to restart all over again--but they wanted you to choose that option over the ""keep me logged in"" one because it reflected poorly on you if you didn't do a certain amount of transactions over a certain amount of time. "
good,"It's a good company to work for. The down side to this company is after working there for four years they still had me as  part time, they do give a good amount of hours if you have open hours, but if you have fixed hours of when you can work they cut your hours giving you very likttle to none."
good,"A typical day at work would sometimes be busy. I like how they offer a discount to senior citizens on tuesday. They are giving back to our elders. Management was okay. As far as the store, it had its days to where it would be a complete mess and unorganized."
good,I have been at Ross for over 12 years and merit or performance raises aren't given consistently. Management is not organized nor prompt in providing hours scheduled for the work week causing a negative impact in work-life balance.
good,"Ross Is A Very Popular Discount Store That People Love To Shop At. During The Holidays The Sales Floor Empties Fast. People Love Discounted Clothing, Toys, Furniture, Electronics, Cometic and Some Grocery."
good,"The job was okay because there were a lot of rude people in the work environment.  But, sometimes the coworkers would cheer you up. Overall, the job payed will."
good,I was pretty much stuck in the fitting room. I did cashier occasionally. I had to ask many times to be put on stock team. There was a lot of favoritism among employees and managers.
good,A typical day at work includes responsibilities and duties based on your position scheduled. Schedules and team were very manageable and agreeable. Management was professional and hard working.
good,"Ross is always busy, messy, and a lot of work as they do have really nice and affordable clothing options. If you do work hard enough there is the opportunity to grow in the company if that is your goal."
good,Location makes for many customers with no intention of purchases. Difficult customers make larger messes. Often surprised at how other Ross stores are very clean.
good,its a pretty decent place to work. once a person is hired you're trainned via video and expected to know exactly what to do once you hit the floor. more one on one training should be done.
good,"Working at Ross is just like working at most other retail stores. The typical clientele is a part of the lower-middle to lower class. The stores get messy quickly, the people - though not unique to Ross - can at teams be incredibly rude, but often times fun to engage with. "
good,"The company is great, The staff is friendly and the hours are very flexible. Depending on the location of the store you may experience busy days. on Tuesdays, expect the store to be busy due to ""Senior Discount Day""."
good,"A lot of work and always asked to stay past scheduled time. Worked there 8 months and didnt receive any salary increase even though they raised my position to supervisor. Managers also wont send workers on their last break if the store is busy."
good,I'm very not caring when it came to this job. It was just a job I didnt see myself growing there I didnt see advancement opportunities it was just another chapter in my opinion
good,Enjoyed my job till the manager added the jewelry /perfume duties.  My left hand was extremely over used.  Couldn't do any work. My original position was put in jeopardy.
good,"Working at the Ross warehouse was fair work. They offer a unique system that motivates you to work hard for extra pay. While product moving in may slow down they always find something for you to do. Despite the job being more focused on packing and shipping various products, there seems to be a competitiveness to it."
good,Nice place to work but very slow pace and not enough hours. The mangers are amazing very understanding with you schudule and I never encountered a ride costumer
good,"Kind of a mess but was the epitome of the retail business. Enjoyed some managers, others were incompetent and did not belong in a management position."
good,Ok place to work at if you need a job. Changes happen frequently and has a high employee turnover. You receive an extra 20 percent off discount every 3 months.
good,Decent job but very little advancement. I started as a cashier and working in the Home supplies. I eventually worked as a customer service provider. I also worked in the cash office preparing the bank deposits.
good,"Average work environment. Customers were usually friendly and employees were nice to work with. First time in loss prevention as well, so it was a good learning experience."
good,"Although my position in the store is what they consider one of the most important, I would say that being Loss Prevention at a discount retailer is nothing more than a decent part-time job. It did what I needed it to do for me throughout college and that was provide me with sufficient cash flow for incidentals and miscellaneous expenses. I would not consider this a career move however. The pay is not worth being forced to stand in a small area and risk constant back pain and foot pain. There was no dynamic to the job. Essentially you are a store greeter given the task to people watch and relay the message to MOD's if there is a potential shoplifter. Being that it is a corporation, there is a lot of red tape, therefore there is no apprehension aspect to the position. Even though you might find someone shoplifting, you are NOT allowed to pursue or detain this person. The uniform for the position in uncomfortable and paints a big red target on your back. A black vest with gold lettering with ""LOSS PREVENTION"" emblazoned across the shoulders allows for ridicule from customers, etc. At the end of the day, Ross is a good part-time gig. I would never consider it for anything else."
good,I worked at ross dress for less for about over a year as a sales associate. My experience working there was a roller coaster but ultimately a good experience.
good,It’s was a good place to work and also I learned a lot in this company.i became a trainer after 3 months working there. And also I did the stock room and the bitting room
good,A typical day a work is when its very busy and we have most of the sales floor associates on register to help everyone as so as possible the hardest part of this job is closing because that is when we have to pick up clothes and toys up to make sure the store s nice and clean.
good,They are willing to work with your availability as needed and the discount is good. They were considered about my school schedule and helped me balance work and school.
good,"Ross Dress for Less gives GOOD employee discounts 20% off everything except cologne and jewelry which is 10% then 4 times a year for only 4 days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Ross will give 40% off everything except jewelry and cologne! "
good,"Fast paced setting. You must have a great customer service attitude to work here. In most cases the customer is always right. "
good,Working overnight was the hardest part of the job. The management was mediocre and they weren't helpful at all. The hardest part about the job was the unloading of the truck with all the products. The work environment was awesome and I had great co-workers.
good,Easy work done at your pace. The faster you work the more bonus you can receive. Friendly management. Other employees are very helpful. Receive hands on training.
good,"Ross is ok to work at. The relative flexibility of their scheduling is a big draw for most part timers, which is what 90% of the staff consists of. Unfortunately the unrealistic demands made by regional and zone directors make working there a nightmare. There's NO CONSISTENCY as far as freight is concerned. One day you don't have nearly enough associates, and the next you have to call off half of them to cut hours.  "
good,"Ross is alright it’s just hectic at times not that I can’t handle it I just want to do something else, and the hours are not consistent I’m in college so it’s hard"
good,"The Ross in Lake Worth, TX was a beast and people just act crazy at discount stores. There was a lot of opportunities to grow as a leader and learn from your mistakes. I was fortunate enough to have an amazing management team to support me. The environment is very fast paced and often requires split second decisions. You have to know what's going on at all times in every department of the store. It is stressful, and the pay is low, but you'll learn a lot about the kind of leader you are if you have enough support from your team."
good,"Stocking, hanging, and putting merchandise on the floor is a good area to work in. If you're hanging you have to complete a certain amount of boxes when you're done with your shift, so basically you have to have like 5+ boxes completed."
good,im allgemeinen war es eine tolle zeit wenn es die Subunternehmer nicht gegeben hätte
good,Great job to have if you like working in retail.  Fast paced and very tight work area. Organization is very hard to keep up with. Try to keep less items at the cash register.
good,"Coordinated activities for front end clerks"
good,I am here part time.Planning to look for another job. Good job if you are still attending school. Good for a while not a lifetime. Its an emergency job .
good,"Management will schedule you to work different shifts. For example, you'll work mornings one week the graveyard the next. Some times you will work graveyard then morning the day after."
good,"I like helping customers the most because it was the most fun and full of energy. the only thing that was somewhat difficult was the other employees, they were always spying on each other. they made working there pretty difficult. I was only there for a holiday job. But I ended leaving a little early."
good,okay starter job great room for advancement very fast paced and can be annoying at times because items are always all over the place great management.
good,not enough hours for tasks that have to be completed work was always busy and pay wasn't enough for work that was required to be done never really had an official title for employment.
good,"The main takeaway from working with Ross is being able to deal with change and people. Working in an environment where nothing is ever stable for long. The store is constantly going through re-structuring following a floor plan that changes per the season, dealing with customers from different socio-economic backgrounds, and making sure LP is on point and focused and ready for duty."
good,"A typical day at ross consist of many activities among the front end such as hanging up clothes picking up items off the floor, pushing baskets, organizing hangers and much more"
good,Flexible work hours especially if you are in school. Management changes often and turnover is quite high. Employees not showing up or calling in sick happen often leaving the rest of the employees to fiend for themselves. Customers are not very nice.
good,"nice staff, faced paced work environment. As a cashier your timed with how fast you ring up customers so you can't be very friendly with customers puts a lot of pressure on the workers."
good,Check out customers in a fast and friendly manner. Unload truck and stock product to the floor. Help customers locate items they are in need of. relaxed and not a hard job at all.
good,"front end supervisor cleaning "
good,"I enjoyed working my first couple years over at the Chino location,  had some cool managers that were pretty fun to work with when I first started working there and had some pretty positive customer service experiences. Once I transferred over to the Montclair location my opinion on the company changed. Management was never on the same page and there were constant issues due to lack in communication."
good,I worked in the fitting room and had to greet customers and provide customer service by assisting the customer. in trying on their clothes.  The management team was nice and attentive.
good,Ross needs to invest more money in their employees. I feel like during the review you are not graded fairly and they do this to limit your raise amount.
good,Some of the managers are great. All of the coworkers were great. Customers were stressful. Senior day was the worst. Got paid $9 an hour my first month into the job.
good,The upper Management are very hard to work with. They do not give enough help to run the store. They stay open to late. Associate do not have enough time with there family.
good,"First retail job so I didnt know exactly what to expect but I do know it should have been more organized. I came when a new store manager came. Didn't get the right training, it was messy, and it was like I was not their like they just forgot I was new because how hectic it was and all the changes being made. So I was a bit clueless but did my best and let the new manager know. After awhile I got the hang of it but not with Casheir... Not going to lie, that was really hard for me but if I had better training I believe I would of done a little better. They left me alone way too soon. A few employees were very helpful and a few just looked frustrated after I said I was only trained once. Despite all that, I feel like I had more confidence and started to get the hang of fitting room, stocking, recovery. I know It was me too who had to improve as well. Every one starts off as fitting room mostly even if you applied to stock or cashier. Hours were really random for me. I would have busy weeks or one day out of the week witch sucked because my schedule was everywhere sometimes. Also, alot of people would call in so I'd stay longer or when I wasnt working I'd get called in alot. As for customer's with cashier's.... good luck with that!!! People are ridiculous. But if you done this before and have more confidence and patience then you really got this. One last thing, The managers were so helpful when I asked for it tho. Some would give me tips as we worked too"
good,"Perform stockroom assistant duties in warehouse setting. Responsible for the flow of merchandise from a central point of delivery to the retail sales floor. Responsible for receiving, unpacking, processing, organizing, storing, packaging and labeling merchandise."
good,Had to patrol the store  twice per hour but mostly standing near the front entrance. Made sure area and vicinity were safe and secure. Help staff with money drops.
good,It would be nice as a part-time. There's no real room for promotion. Everyone seems to have been there in the titles for years. Promotions are rare...
good,Stock merchandise on floor. Receive incoming shipments ever morning. Organize clothes and miscellaneous products. What made hard for me is that I was the only one in charge of the stocking.
good,i liked the diversity and my fellow employes the job was actually fun i enjoyed coming to work with friends and doing my job but if you have a fun group of coworkers it makes the day go by faster
good,Seeking better opportunities . Spent to long there without moving up.  Decided it was time for change. Leadership was falling apart due to new changes occuring in the company
good,What I will take away from ROSS is gaining the patience to deal with all types of customers. They showed me how to provide the best customer service under very bad conditions with customers.
good,"It’s was like slavory "
good,"t seems like it is alright. the pay isnt the best , but i feel like i do more than i get paid. fridays there are free bagels, yogurt, and fruits. which is nice"
good,I enjoyed working for Ross for the most part it gave me experience in the clothing part of retail. I enjoyed that the company sent all store managers to a meeting every year. The only reason I left was I enjoy hardline more then soft lines and the main reason was I had to drive from North Cape to Naples every day and at the time I had two young daughters. I did that drive for 2 years..
good,Certain are managers are not considerate to other employees. Yell at or critique others in front of fellow workers. Find long way to do tasks than the shorter more desirable route
good,"it was okay at times busy and at times very slow. supervisors were friendly. provided me with training. sometimes lunches were free, paid training overall a good environment to work in"
good,Fun workplace. Fast workplace. Employees  are very friendly. Some times very busy. I like busy environment. Prices for dresses all class people can afford.
good,"A typical day at Ross stressful, . Physical tasks. Maintaining production level . Everyday different"
good,Ross was a very boring and stressful job. The management was not the best and nor was the customer service from the other employees. Everyone seemed they hated it.
good,"Working at Ross Dress For Less is laid back. When you're hired, you're given a specific title and sometimes they might have you do other things, but most times you're doing what you came on-board to do (Ex: cashier). It's also a fun place to work depending on your co-workers. The cons of working at Ross is the change of managers and what they bring to the table. Some new managers are great, but unfortunately we get some that like to change everything they can about the store. Also, the hours fluctuate a lot. I wouldn't make Ross a main job, but it's okay to have if you're paying a phone bill, gym membership, or any non-serious bills."
good,I enjoy working at Ross. Now I'm looking to expended my skills. While working with Ross and DD's discount I learn costume service and organization skills.
good,"Ross is a good company that works around your budget and good fashion, you also as an employee get a 20% discount card after your 30days working there."
good,Great first job. days off given if you give them 2 weeks notice. Great people and management is typically friendly and understanding of any situation that tends to come up.
good,As an area supervisor a lot is expected from you but you aren't given all the tools to achieve your requirements. The employee's feel like they are expected to to do more than others and the closing employee's are held to a higher standard than daytime employees
good,I worked here for a summer job between school years and it was only worth it because I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I would feel bad for those that try to make a career out of it
good,"discounts on all items, overall fun place to work as long as you don't have to deal with too many rude customers. they're pretty reasonable with scheduling."
good,Managers and Assistant  Managers seem to have problems with having to communicate with each other and being honest. They also tend to talk negatively about their employees over their private life as if it were high school.  Some are also carefree and share their deepest secrets to who ever they like as if they're suppose to care.
good,"Worked at 3 different stores. Environment depends on management and the people that are hired. High turnover rate. Always short staffed and stores always short on payroll budget, leading to minimal staff at the end of the month. Hence, leading to mad customers due to being short staffed."
good,"Overall, I think Ross is a decent place to work.  It has a warm working environment where you are friends wth everyone on the team.  It was almost like a family.  It was the management that needs to improve."
good,"It's nice to be a part of a team that shares the same goals. Unfortunately, not everyone will always pull their weight and you are often the one who has to pick up the slack."
good,"could offer a higher pay, better management that don't expect that your working for a high fashion department store. and loss prevent don't just stand at the door being Wal-Mart greeters when they're suppose to PREVENT theft"
good,This is a place where you can meet alot of different people and it a  place where   fast pace is need on this  job. This is a nice place for students that still live with someone so that they can save up some cash to move up to a better job. This is a place where you can have fun with the stocking shelf doing the holiday seasons.
good,Not a very good place to be lasy gottta always be on feet getting work done. You also got be fast on cashier and quick with ur customer to make sure the other customers are never waiting that long.
good,"Sometimes you work longer than your scheduled shift. "
good,"In my experience with Ross, things just continued to get worse the longer I was there. Over the course of my years of service to them payroll was dwindling resulting in consistent coverage issues, meager pay raises, and ignorance of cost of living adjustments. Upper management seemed ignorant of the various concerns coming from the store level. The store had numerous members of upper management micromanaging and giving directions that conflicted with each other, resulting in an inconsistent work environment that was always changing but never right. Despite my many criticisms, my store was a fast paced environment generally with flexibility in regards to scheduling and hours. Staffing was so low and turnover so high that if you wanted more hours or a specific schedule, you could attain that. As stated, turnover was high primarily because very few people could keep up with the issues regarding upper management. While I enjoyed my time there and appreciated the ability to set my own schedule and hours, the environment itself was hypercritical due to constant shadowing by upper management. If and when upper management changes, this will be a great place to work retail."
good,"This was a fast paced place of employment.  It was good in the beginning.  Loved the motivation I was able to provide, the excitement of advancement opportunities was great.  I began there n the stock room and was promoted to lead in 3 months.  The promoted to area supervisor, then to manager training.  A typical day was mixed with all types of things, the most rewarding part of this job was the satisfaction of providing good customer service.  The atmosphere was ok, the employee turnover was not so great. A little more attention from the district manager and higher would make for a better workplace environment."
good,Ross can be very stressful during the holidays keeping up on the floor can be overwhelming if you don't work at a fast pace some more slow you work the more the floor packs up with items that need to go back on shelves
good,Work was stressful because of how messy the place would get. Management was okay just didn't have a consistent schedule and were not flexible with changing availability. I learned how to not be shy and to talk to more people.
good,"Ross isn't a terrible place to work. Like any company, it needs its improvements. The hours for the store are ridiculous though. Overall it's an alright place to work."
good,"Ross was an enlightening experience to the horrors of retail. As an asset protection agent, my job was to monitor customers and employees for theft. It built skills I didn't know I had for observation and understanding of how the crowds of people might operate."
good,"It was ok. I would just say focus on doing what you have to do.  As long as you do your work, you shouldn't have anything to worry about.  The pay could be better but it's decent."
good,There was a lot of lifting with this position but that is to be expected for a stocking position.  One aspect that made this position difficult is that the pay was not adequate and there were not enough hours.  My only summation is that they wanted several Part Time stockers so that they can have the floor stocked but not have to offer any benefits because we were all part time.
good,I would get to work and clock in then I would go and put clothes on the rakes and I would also cash people out when they needed to be. management was okay not the best
good,"na , its good place to work and good people, but its shor hours for who needs more hours.good managers, good pay. good discount. it was great experience ."
good,The Store manager here was by far the best boss I have ever had. The customers were probably some of the worst I have ever seen. Coworkers were so-so. It was pretty much just keep the store clean and smile
good,"it was part time work not many hours, switched from security to cashier to get more hours. assistant manager was amazing and working two different stores."
good,It was a great opportunities to interact with different people a great way to help others and learn about different clothing brands and others opinions. Able to help customers when they find an item.
good,Ross dress for less no paid vacations days   . No paid lunch time.. they paid low salary and no benefits . Nice coworkers .Small work area and low safety in the area
good,its good place to work in if you are new but not for future or if you have expenses to pay. as i mentioned before its stress place to work in and they are a part time positions no benefits
good,"A typical day at Ross could involve many things.  As it was an open environment type store, there was no set position and one could be expected to perform a myriad of duties in any given day."
good,"Great work experience, everyday was a learning experience."
good,The worker there are good people. The problem i had at my store is the management don't work well together so there are problem. My store are way under staff so i have to do multiple job. There is no training by the company and the old employee don't know how to train new member and is a stressful job so most people quit.
good,I enjoyed working here just needed a more secure career and left when I found one. I learned a lot of cashiering and customer service experience. I would work there again
good,I work as a Retail Sales Associate at Ross for more than 3yrs close to 4yrs and it was nice to work there. Co-workers are great and they offer great discounts.
good,it is a typical retail outlet job  nothing special to say. you will give up weekends and holidays and be called on to cover for other workers constantly
good,Would have never left if it wasn’t for a few things that went on while I was there and nothing was ever done about the problems I brought up. More could have been done and I would of never left
good,"It started off with a good manager. She really understood how to treat her employees as equals, not as underlings who do her bidding whether we liked it or not. The next manager was awful. Totally the opposite. Really, it depends on the manager."
good,It was just a average job to me i went to work and went home it was part time and it was one of my first jobs. Good job for your first one Customer service could be better at Ross but other then that everything else was fine.
good,Hours of Business are unnecessary. There is no need for a store to be open until 1130p during the week or 12a on the weekend. The company needs to have more full time positions available for associates.
good,"I loved the job itself,but once they got to seeing how great of a worker i was they started over working me.Then they started cutting hours and hiring more people so i needed something new."
good,"Review e-mails from corporate and store partners, respond immediately. Follow up on closing manager communications. Analyze previous days business, note and write of daily strategy to address deficiencies. Review and address dashboard and all sixteen metrics. Prepare daily break schedule and rally meeting notes. Walk sales floor for recovery adherence and maintenance cleanliness. Verify cash office. Walk stockroom for daily truck receiving set up and address any issues from previous day. Learned apparel business and designers. Management needed to be the servant leaders to the associates, treating them with the same respect they were expected to provide our customers. The workplace culture needed some attention. The hardest part of the job was controlling shrink in a dual entrance building and no store protection associates."
good,"working for this company i learn a lot that made me a better person, such as managing a group of people and also teaching and training new and old team member on becoming a better person."
good,"Always kept busy "
good,"For a person who likes to learn, there is the opportunity to learn about retail. The work day is filled with a lot of expectations that are not always realistic. As a Stock room Lead, I had the opportunity to manage people. Managing and training associates was both the most challenging part of my job as well as the most rewarding part of my job."
good,I love ross. the customers are sometimes funny and very friendly. my coworkers are a thrill to work with.  Im part time and work night shifts and I love it
good,"I'm going to be honest, the thing I miss most is the employee discount!!  Pay wasn't great, but not surprising for a bargain retail store.  A lot is expected of the Front End Supervisor, but the company doesn't offer adequate support or pay for the actual job duties.  At least it was usually fast-paced which helped the day go by faster."
good,low pay i did not enjoy going there every day. I love ross very much but will never work there it was very boring omg...its a great place to shop indeed nut just do not work there . they also do not care about your advancement
good,"I really enjoyed the amount of development this company offers. Talented individuals can seek advancement in the company. You are able to learn so many managerial duties and you work alongside a management team of 4-5. The hours are doable since time goes by fast. The challenging part of working for Ross is managing payroll. Sometimes, I'm more of a cashier than a manager."
good,"Cashier, Closed and sometimes opened.Greeted customers, counted money, cleaned organized, executed other employees in assignments, worked 8 -10 hours on my feet"
good,"I liked this job but, the location I was in was a rough part of town. The managers were rude and not helpful. The store was very disorganized. The work was easy though."
good,"A great first job, thats about it. Easy work. Hanging hangers all day. Busy during holiday season. Plenty of children to mess the store up for you to clean after."
good,"Lack of communication,  little hours...  Unfriendly place it feels like....  It's a place to work if you are a school student. It's a good place to shop"
good,"Ross is full of very fun and great employees who come to work and make people's days better. Some of the best managers I've ever got to work with, they care about the individual not just the job"
good,"You have to be mentally ready for this kind of job , customer service skills at a all time high And alot of patience and drive be upbeat and a great personality and you'll be fine."
good,"if you are very flexible with your given schedule,it shouldn't be  a problem. if your lacking hours also, they'll be able to help you. the benefit is alright but it sucks when you double job and loose track"
good,Managers get personal instead of being just about work. ... day to day operations should be about work bot personal life. Not harassment it just makes for bad environment.
good,its really stressful due to the place i worked at because there was a lot of people that would come from across the border and they would just throw everything in the floor is was always a mess no matter how nice you would fix it. they would just end up all in the floor in less then 5 min and they pay wasn't worth the job you were assigned to.
good,They are very good with hiring new people. Not an ideal work condition. It can be very stressful and unrewarding. There is a lack of growth in the company.
good,"I worked there for some time, it was interesting. I learned a lot about customer service. It gave me the knowledge I needed on how to handle certain situations."
good,Loved working there .always very busy and things to do.Good discounts for employees.usually nice crew and management.Good functioning company with room for growth.
good,I enjoyed working at Ross.  My managers were great and fun to work with. I really enjoyed the people I worked with at Ross.  The work was heavy for the staff per work shift - would have been helpful to have a few more people.
good,Ross is a very busy and fast paced workplace. Sometimes you may not be able to leave at your scheduled time due to the lines being backed up or stock not being 100% done.
good,"Demonstrate respect, friendliness, and professionalism at all times "
good,"Greet customer, answer all questions, cashier when needed, complete all paperwork as it relates to receiving, training new associates, and assure that all steps are being followered according to Ross policies"
good,Ross overall is a decent company to work for if you are in buying and planning and went a corporate environment. The work flow and hiring process is fast and they have a great intern program.
good,"My experience working at Ross Dress For Less hasn’t been the worst but also not the best. They do offer flexible hours and they do have decent benefits for full-time associates, but overall the store is not ran properly in my personal opinion. Management is corrupt, the store is in poor condition and nobody does much about it. A lot of the area supervisors are not fit for the position, many of them are disorganized and unprofessional. Some don’t follow company policy and manage off retaliation. Others are disrespectful towards certain associates. I’ve tried to reach out to corporate and not much was done."
good,Ross is a fast-paced high-pressure environment that is operated with slim margins and tight expectations for performanc. The business is run on little to no payroll with with expectations exceeding the ability for leadership to complete daily tasks.
good,I've only begun working here.  It hasn't been long enough to get to know the manager or colleagues.  I do think they gave a more indepth training session.
good,"if you are only looking for a part time job with very little hours, then this job is for you,its not a terrible company to work for but the hours and pay are horrible and customers are crazy too. Always short on help even tho they have plenty of staff. Managers don't schedule enough"
good,Hours per week are not great at all.   You get paid every 2 weeks.  Can not support my daughter in this salary.   I need to get another job.    Good part everyone is like family.
good,The typical work day is easy because its not really a busy store. I learned that people like to get more for their money so they shop here for the low prices. The management is actually good because they're very organized. The workplace culture is involves a lot of young people. The hardest part of this job is working with other workers who give you a hard time. The most enjoyable part of this job is making the customers happy.
good,"It's a good starter warehouse, there are going to be ups and downs. Depending on how one takes criticism will ultimately determine the outcome of ones stay there."
good,it helped me gain experience on customer service and provide guess with the right attitude it was a fun job overall great team but I really did not see a opportunitie to grow in the company it was really limited
good,"Hard to find a job were you are constantly working with younger generations and they dont have the motivation to work, makes being a tream difficult when dont have everyone wanting to drive that positive attitude like everyone else"
good,"I work so little for this company it was a temporary job. it was a busy store that's what i like i prefer a job that is busy than slow.   "
good,Cool job. Great first good. the pay was good. the people i worked with was really cool. You can move up. The hours are good. Good place to work if your still in school.
good,expect 15 hours per week. Only 2 full timers not including store managers. 40 percent discount in the summer for employees. Flexible hours. Everyone is underpaid.
good,"you have to be able to stand on your feet because its a lot of work with picking up clothing behind customers and putting them back, also I would prefer comfortable shoes."
good,No comment to be given on this company. No more to say on this company. This was a part time job that was adequate.  It filled my needs at the moment and worked for the moment.
good,"When I first started there was a lot for me to learn. However, I caught on fast. I became customer assistance and worked my way up to stock team manager."
good,"At my time of employment it was very unorganized. They offered flexibility for our schedules, yet it was not met if we had other jobs or could not work certain shifts. Not enough coverage when cleaing, stocking and closing up the store. For holidays, they would expect us to stay and work until 2am."
good,Fast paced environment. The customers are the hardest part of this job. Procedures are clear and detailed information is available along with training
good,Working here was not that great. At times customers could get rude and management was awful. They play favorites a lot and they don’t treat all associates fairly.
good,Typical day at work was fast paced but not stressful. I learned how to get a lot don in such little time. Management could have been better. Everyone was friendly and fun to work with.
good,"Helped customers "
good,the worst part of my job at ross was the fact that i would get paid so little and it wouldn't help with my expenses. it sucked that there was NO full time workers really. besides management and some of the old-timers
good,"make sure you have good shoes, working at ross your constantly on your feet, i liked working in stock rather than up front i found it i was able to learn a lot more working in stock. pay was not so good"
good,"While working at Ross I experienced quite a bit and learned new things. I was not trained by any of the managers, but SPS trained me and taught me everything I needed to know to continue on with my job. I enjoyed my time there learning how to work the cash register and organize the shoes and clothes."
good,"I just am not getting enough hours to make a living. Working there is fine, I do not mind it I want to keep working there , but I don not get enough hours"
good,Good work inviroment helps me manage time and teach me good multi tasking skills .also a good place to build a retirement plan before im ready to retire
good,This job wasn't great but not terrible. Fairly boring. Mostly stocking merch and keeping an eye out for shop lifters and running the registers. I did like helping customers find things though and organizing racks of shoes is a strangely zen experience.
good,Easy going job. Worked several departments and the feel of the job was that things seem to be fairly easy. Management team worked well. I feel as though maybe a little to lenient with some employees and their habit to call in or be late.
good,"I was over making sure no one took from the store. I was always moving and watching, which was something I liked. The Assistant manager worked with the team, the manager was hardly ever seen."
good,It’s a fast paced working environment . No idle time you gotta keep moving and working constantly.it can get extremely busy . It can get extremely messy most of the time but team work is the key .
good,This job was good for a weekend job because they don’t give a lot of hours but works with your schedule.. so if your a student or have another job ross works with whatever schedule you have
good,environment was excellent met new people. I learned how to make deposits over the phone. I learned how to do overages and shortages.  Maintained book logs on employees.
good,"A typical day might be very busy around the mid day shift. I learned how to do the fitting rooms, stockroom, cashier, and SPS. Management was ok, but they changed too much."
good,Good place to work in but the shifts are too long to work in as a student in college. Great part time job for seasonal staffing and easy way to earn some extra cash
good,Great place to work if you have good customer service skills. Great discounts. Found it to be somewhat stressful at times. Would like to work there again and would recommend it to friends or family.
good,"Worked for this company for about a year and it was ok. South Florida is a busy market and it makes for a busy day. but if you like fast past and high stress during the holiday , then this is the job for you."
good,"This job is good to start with customer service, of knowing people, and different things in store, befits you and others to the store and learn new things"
good,"Like most of retail stores they are more part timer place to work, very stress full when it comes to deal with customers of different culture, inconsistent hours of work for not reasonable paid rate."
good,"This was my first job, and was excited to begin with but I wasn't getting much hours. Some weeks I only worked like 8 hours but when someone called off they would call me last minute. Whenever I would ask the manager for more hours she would say that the company doesn't have enough money yet because it was a new store opening. When I would do go-backs, she would say to me it doesn't matter if the clothes were in the right section just ""make it look nice."""
good,"I think that Ross Department store should let there employees know before they hire them that they all work have to work at a fast speed, before trying to fire them."
good,Management always asks too much in limited amount of time and even more limited staff. Customers tend to disrespect the store as a whole. Physically demanding. The only pro was muscle-gain from tasks.
good,I stocked shoes onto shelves. I also put on censors and helped unload merchandise on nights when the truck would deliver items. it was ok cause I got discounts
good,"perks was the discount, cons not knowing when you are leaving because they wanted all the truck processed, and out onto salesfloor no matter how big the truck was sometimes not enough help to make it happen. Changed alot of managers and district managers"
good,"Always pulling unnecessary overtime. I learned that it's very important to understand all cultures, when working in a mixed cultural environment. management were all for self. the hardest part of the job was helping my associates become successful with no assistance from management. My authority as a supervisor only went so far. The most I enjoyed was the drive and ability to assist with the different cultures to make sure all my associates were experienced and knowledgeable of their work."
good,"Hectic, Fast Paced, Lack of Support from Corporate, Low hours given to maintain store appearance, low pay, Work-Home balance not good. Overworked, lack of training"
good,Ive worked in several different Ross stores in various counties and states with a few different titles and they all vary so much. Some are great places to work and some are not it’s very hit or miss. If you’re competent and available at their every beck and call you’ll be promoted from within quickly.
good,good deals and the days were usually busy with the stock room because all of the clothes that had to be taken off the shipment truck. it didn't pay too well.
good,"The time I was there it was a very decent job. The only thing I did not like was they did not give many hours to work, I lived 30 minutes away and could only work maybe 4 hours a day"
good,Ross gave me the opportunity to branch out and learn about the departmental stores. it gave me more knowledge of what goes behind the scenes and what it takes to keep a  store stocked and how much of a demand there is for certain items.
good,"I enjoyed working there at first. I worked while being a full time student and was happy they had flexible hours. I had a problem with management before I left. However, I feel like it’s worth it."
good,answer the phone and answer questions and date entry and mail out documents and received documents in the mail and help walk ins with the questions and
good,"I worked their a long time ago, so things might have changed, however, while I was working their there it was just a mediocre job where the guests were completely ridiculous."
good,Team works collaboratively to get work done in timely fashion.  Back-end area is fast-paced.  Great place to work for college students and/or first time workers needing to gain solid work experience.
good,Ross dress for less is a very chaotic and disorganized store. It is a discount store so it is more known for being like this. The managers all say different things when it comes to similar tasks.
good,This was a good agency when I got there. The purpose was to help the low income community with housing and benefit.   I resigned form that position because of the favoritism and misappropriation of government funding by some of the employees.   I cannot work for a organization that has unethical practices and deprives citizens that actually need the help.
good,"The discount is great no doubt, but the Ross environment is not one that makes you excited to go to work. For a company that makes so much money, they seem to always be short on payroll. Not enough coverage at times and will even cut payroll to punish stores for things like customers stashing merchandise. Front end supervisor makes 50¢ more than associates which is nice, but still not worth the stress that is placed on them. High expectations and anything you do that is right is still not good enough, and need to move faster. Everything you do is timed. It's a fast paced environment, but if they want happier customers they should make their employees happier by giving more hours to those that want them rather than hiring new people. They are flexible, and will work with your schedule, but somehow still not enough hours."
good,"stock room was very fast and competitive, had to get ship in and sorted out within a timely manner. cashier you had to be fast and meet time goals each week"
good,"You can make good money. A lot of the positions offered are production, meaning you have an opportunity to make a bonus every week. There is consistent heavy lifting involved so if you can’t lift at least 30-40 pounds this is not the job for you."
good,It’s Really boring. It’s Super slow. And it’s Extremely repetitive. And there’s always a baby crying and the people that work there are super crazy too
good,the job was ok but not where I wanted to be the pay was poor and the staff was rude. But it was a paycheck none the less. the environment was fats paced.
good,"Upon arriving I would clock in. Begin greeting customers. As a line forms I would ring on a cash register. As the lines slow down I would restock shelves, show jewelry, or make sure the store is tidy."
good,I enjoyed the team I was working with we got to know each other during breaks. I learned customer service and how to work with other people this will definitely help me.
good,The experience of working there was okay. I was given few hours and not really taken seriously so my opinion of the job is just satisfactory. I would recommend it though.
good,"Short days , flexible hours , nice people , not very hard work. Anyone can do it. Hours are hard to get most of the time. Great for teenagers. Stay to yourself coworkers are messy."
good,"I learned that ross is a decent starter job to get some retail experience and learn to get comfortable talking with people, learning to use the cash register the basics pretty much"
good,"Your typical day involves constant movement; between running back products, cashiering and additional tasks, you are always working."
good,"Typical day to day work , Involved with your team and team leader to consault about work and work methds to solving and completeing task.While maintaning a  timley fashion."
good,"This was my very first jobstraight out of high school. The location had a heavy traffic flow. Which was great for business, but extremely scary for a new employee!"
good,"Great fast paced environment that allows you to pick up shifts so you can work more hours than you were scheduled. It is an easy job that has you doing several different positions such as cashiering, fitting room associate, and sales floor associate."
good,"I was a happy employee there as far as employment was concerned however, I was not too happy with the promotional possibilities hence why I decided to go back to School."
good,"Very old-fashioned workplace, not very challenging. They are not thinking about how the future will shop and are very focused on bricks and mortar, it is just okay to work there"
good,"It's retail, people are rude, they do not value the company and treat it like a zoo. Working as a Front End Supervisor means you make sure transactions are running smoothly, any customer complaints or cashier complaints go through you and if needed get escalated to a manager. Working here I learned to have patient."
good,"not enough hours, management doesn't work closely with staff , rate of pay could be better. "
good,I started with the company when I was in high school opening the store I really enjoyed the job. I was a school to work student so I got to work here full time and moved up to an area supervisor. I left my career here to go back to school and start a new chapter in my life. I really like it here tho.
good,"under the direction of the store management, the Front End Supervisor is responsible for the protection of the company assets. I have dealt many unpleasant customers which was the hardest part, having to keep a safe and secure environment."
good,Great place to work  but they did treat the supervisors with enough respect. The supervisors always seemes to be overworked and stress sue to the workload and high demands.
good,"Typical day at Ross includes , sales floor recovery and merchandizing ."
good,Discount is cool. People are 50/50 to work with. Customers suck they're are a lot of people stealing from there. It was an okay place to work for. I got into management fast.
good,"Not something to make a career out of unless you want to manage or lean towards loss prevention. Tasks are basic, NOT FOR THE TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPAIRED. If you cannot handle a fast paced environment, it is not for you. You need to learn how to be fast and efficient on the cash register which is a touch screen with a keypad on the side."
good,"while working there at ross, I found myself wanting to advance into the company, but no advancements were available, was always wanting to leave the current job to look for a higher paid jobs with more benefits"
good,"very fast paced"
good,"hired a whole team, trained, and then decided to halt the project.  Poor planning on their part.  I left a job for this and then was put in a hard position"
good,"A management that does everything for an employee, most of the employees will respond the same way but with work effort. Sometimes an employee does not provide a great effort when management is not great."
good,"The company Ross, Inc. Is a good job. I was there almost 12 years at the same position. I am a very good and hard worker. Very clean and organized person."
good,"Ross Corporation is very simple and easy.  Get everything of the truck and put it on the racks or shelves.  You don’t need a degree for this job, yet they are trying to recruit college students to intern with them.  Your degree is not relavent, unless your planning on being in the corporate office.  If your going to work in the stores  your wasting your education on this simple work."
good,I liked it at first until the they switched management then it went down hill. But it is a good first job or for someone trying to earn some extra cash on the side.
good,Good place to work I just had a spending problem seend everything is so cheap so I never brought any money home and that was a problem staff is great to work and clean place
good,Good workplace  high energy work involvement in joyed the staff members and they were very helpful to me in showing me around the workplace I would love to go back
good,"Ross was a store that had a few problems with security, which is one of the reasons I received the job. I learned the ins and outs of the security position to help the store. Due to the staff being younger the store face many problems with attendance as well as attitudes."
good,"At Ross Dress for Less, we provided great teams and partnerships.  Employees provided excellent customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with our customers."
good,"typical retail job"
good,"I enjoyed most of the aspects of the job, there was a strong team dynamic with all level of employees. People would help each other no matter what position they held, good rapport with most management."
good,It was a fun and relaxed lace to work at. Had fun but got the job done. The supervisor was very helpful with any questions anyone had. Everyone was nice and very helpful.
good,"Ross Dress For Less Stores is a pretty nice store to work at. Decent Pay, nice managers and co workers. Althougb the scheduling could be better for the most part good place to work."
good,Unorganized work place with management that asks a lot of the their employees for how little they pay. Hours and not certain and no set schedule. Hard to be motivated.
good,"A typical day at work was most of the time good. One of the managers that work there is a bad apple. Is not friendly and does not know how to communicate with employees. The other management was great. Most of the coworkers would work together to get the job done. There was a lot of discrimination and racial talk in the stock room, between the coworkers. I learned how a stock room operates in retail stores. Recovery and sizing the merchandise to ensure a neat, clean and organized store. I learned about mark-out-of-stock policies and how MOS works. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the flow of retail and company policies."
good,"Pay roll is based oftf the profits of the store. And even though the store is very busy, theft is very high so profits do not reflect it. Low profits=low payroll which means cuts in hours."
good,"Early morning shipment receiving, had to work fast to get product on floor before store opened. Depending on the size of the shipment didnt always mean we were done before the store opened. Thus aggressive means to get things done were ordered."
good,The store is a busy environment. The Store is a popular shopping store and brings in many items popular to the customers. Handling different types of customers daily and different needs.
good,"lots of work, little recognition"
good,"Working at ross was very laid back, slow on a good day it would be fast paced, mainly slow, store was always kept up according to store layout. I learned to work in a more slow environment."
good,"There were many great people who worked at the store and though I will miss them all, we all deserve better. The management is a joke and no one ever took their job serious. I would go in every time I was asked for over a year and I was being paid less then people who have been there less time than I have."
good,"a typical day at work was busy and loud "
good,Fast pace job always busy. There is alot to do in the store. Management is always everywhere. Sometimes not enough resgisters open and lines get big. Good prices in store.
good,"you have a chance to advance very quickly, lots of hours , the hardest part of the job is finding the place to put things store has a lot of stock its like a treasure hunt everyday, discount is great."
good,A typical day working at Ross was fast pace like any other retail job. Ross is a great work place for college students or people who needs a part-time job. The hardest part of the job was keeping merchandise organized and in place. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees.
good,"I will say this I enjoy shopping at Ross, well certain locations I should say.  This store is a complete cluster F..k.  Really messy, horrible selection of merchandise.  It is so bad and dirty inside, they should just close the doors. Then hahahaha no surprise here same issue a many of their stores huge huge lines.  So I will say this again and again there is nothing I need that darn  bad to wait in your ridiculously long lines."
good,"This is your typical retail store. Shifts and schedules will vary based on the needs of the store and the managers. The staff will vary depending on the store, and management sets the tone."
good,Working at Ross was a fun family environment.  Many hours were worked to meet deadlines.  The team worked together to ensure all deadlines were met while maintaining great morale.
good,"Loved working here but the only problem is one week you'll have full time hours and the next you'll be working part time... I really thought that my hours would be set but it doesn't matter if you have rent to pay or need money for food the job can easily give u less hours without u knowing until you walk into work the next day. I definitely would like it if ross had stable hours that I can depend on. Because of that I have to find a new job... great team, amazing managers, and a great place to work but not for me because of their scheduling... will surely miss them"
good,"All Ross Dress for Less management cares about is the money that they make from illegal immigrants than their own employees.  Would work till 2am most nights cleaning the store.  If you go to college and live near the border, DONT DO IT!"
good,This was a decent place to work i mean its retail so theirs not much in it. But its a regular job i liked how fast paced it was and i really enjoyed working their.
good,Trained on cashier but still have to pitch in for the entire store. Always a lot of go backs and tidying up. All and all it was a good experience but the pay is the bare wage.
good,"I liked working at Ross cause it kept me busy from the minute you clock in till you clock out, there was always something to do, and very busy atmosphere."
good,"It's unorganized, and management isn't fair to any of it's co-worker. I'm working there just for this season until my license gets transfer from my home state. Overall, I think that this Ross really needs a lots of improvement. I like how the company has it's standard, but I think it's just the management don't take it serious about their co-workers."
good,Great temporary job. There are a wide variety of positions you could be placed into. Be patient with HR they tent to be moody at times. Have a great time working there.
good,Mangers always try to make you feel welcomed and a part of the team. Great communication between employees and employers. Team effort is used on the daily.
good,"Good place to work for students or retail beginners. Working here can be stressful and not fun a lot of the times. Management wants you to be as fast as possible or else you’ll get in trouble. Sorry, but I’m not a robot! I’ve been here almost 2 years and that’s definitely enough for me! I’m either going to quit or just come one day a week for a little bit longer after the holidays. I really want to go somewhere else. I love most of my coworkers and the double discounts are awesome. I just don’t agree with the policies. I think it’s stupid that carts can’t go outside or customers need to show their drivers license when they’re returning same day purchases. It seems corporate makes things as hard as possible on their poor workers. We work too hard, but aren’t paid enough. For some reason, Campbell only pays $10 or $11 per hour and other Ross’s in San Jose offer higher pay. And also, the Campbell Ross charges 25 cents for paper bags. Everything is ridiculous!"
good,"A typical day would be to get to your positions and get to work. A simple average regular day at work, nothing special, but you are expected to do 110% and if you do you get promoted eventually."
good,good company great coworkers great management unfortunately you work to much and it is not worth what they pay you.otherwise it is a good company although they do need more cashiers at night
good,"This company has a fantastic culture. The benefits were great, but their was a lack from upper management that left the store manager on their own for months at a time."
good,"Theft prevention, made sure isle were safe and made sure that customers did not leave the store without paying for merchandise.  manger was fair.  the hardest part of the job was the slow days when hardly any customer were in the store.  the most enjoyable part was greeting the customers and no theft."
good,"I enjoy all work skills I have gain at this job. this job is very hands on and help me learn more about costumer service. A typical day contain your set assignment which is 15 minutes before you go do your assigned department. My job is the home section in the stockroom. After the set assignment I get all the carts, blue bins and feel up my hard tag bucket  I need before unpacking boxes. Next i unpacked the boxes while reading each price ticket which tells me where to put on the cart or bin. When the bins or the cart is filled it must be ran. When ran on the sales floor you must put the correct items in the correct place on the floor. So customers can find what they looking for easily."
good,"While working for Ross Department Store, I worked in the warehouse of the store. Day would start with of unloading product from the delivery truck. Management was good, and treated me fairly."
good,"Upper management was horrible,never listened to any of our concerns! They only cared about UNITS/FINISH THE BAY! They had a great attendance system,and benefits/store discounts(20% & 40%) were great!"
good,Be fast and friendly with all transactions. Have great customer service skills. Always lead by example. Greet all customers with eye contact and a friendly smile.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at DD's Discounts. The managers are great with the exception of one, who was dealt with, and is no longer employed there. It is a fast work environment and it is not for the weak willed. They always worked with my schedule and were very respectful. I always go back to work holidays when I am in town from school."
good,"great work environment with friendly people and management, great vending machines, full of snacks. Great place to learn further knowledge of current career choice."
good,Typical day at work was helping open the store. Working with customers and management. There were times that I was frustrated about things not being done correctly but was able to communicate with management to get things fixed.
good,usually you start out in the stockroom as they are always looking for people that are quick back there. Or you will be mainly cleaning up the sales floor or cashiering.
good,Unknown to what people want to here. Nothing negative nor positive. I refuse to put down or praise a job that I have worked for. If it was a good fit for me it may not be for someone else. If It didn't work for me who am I to say it won't work for someone else
good,"Ross is what you make it. It is a quick paced rtail store, in which if you like working in retail, you will love Ross Dress for less.It also has beautifuldiscounted clothes for its employees"
good,"1 closing shift per week, 1 weekend off per month, 3 Sundays off per month.  Process driven environment, unpredictable shipments make it difficult to be proactive.  Pay for supporting managers is weak making it difficult to recruit top talent."
good,"I enjoyed very much working for this company its just that i was only hires for seasonal and wished that i would of been kept, i know i worked hard and fast but also the hours were very little but other than that its a fun place to work at"
good,"i worked 3rd shift and even i was working late night that job has a lot of production going on in different areas of the warehouse, stressful but sometimes fun."
good,"If you have the right manager, your time at Ross can be exciting and fun. You must be able to multitask and get the job done as quickly as possible or face the consequences."
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for a part-time job."
good,"busy days, never enough people"
good,"Working at Ross is an okay job. I would recommend anyone to start here, but that is about it. The pay is good for entry level retail work, but the hours are not consistent at all and everyone is part time."
good,"great place to work. great locations fun people. get to work with diverse population. easy schedule. clear job expectations, multiple advancement opportunities"
good,"I worked at ROSS Distribution Center not the clothing store. As a Loss Prevention worker we did more than what the job title says. The organization itself I like. If you are looking for quick bucks, this is the place to go. If you like warehouse work, this is the place to go."
good,holiday seasons especially christmas get extremely busy. stores become packed and you have to be on your toes. it is very stressful and you will be exhausted.
good,Ross was more complicated than straightforward for the most part. Management tried their best to ensure that it ran smoothly but a lack of adequate leadership plus slack enforcement was its downfall.
good,day begins with meeting and workload delegations. i learned to delegate to get the best production for the company and my team. a plethora of individuals from different cultures.
good,Poor management. You have to work your job and others just to get by. Everyone will put everything on you. I dont know why i have to write this review
good,although the pay is great the our are horrible you will not get full time hrs. unless you have been there for many many years the management is never on the same page
good,"The lead cashier position is responsible for maintaining guest service as per company standard, is responsible for the efficient expedition of all guest transactions as well as ensuring guest satisfaction at the service desk and proper control of all cash and media materials in a superstore."
good,"as siting customers while maintaining clean work environment. working go backs, check outs, dressing room. sizing clothes recovery process and bringing out new merch."
good,"I actually loved working here until our new store manager got hired. In the beginning he promised that we'd be working as a team, but as time went on I didn't feel the teamwork at all. He said that we could work out scheduling issues but it never happened."
good,"Anybody can do the job, but it takes a little time to learn how to do everything. During holiday season there is  ALOT of boxes, but that is when you get more hours. I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"Fantastic people, fascinating industry, fast-paced, high level of employee engagement. As an employee, you're able to have a significant direct impact on the business and the company's success."
good,"well dealing with the customer on ever day pace, learn how to deal with people an the management was ok that all I can say.workplace culture is what it is"
good,working at Ross at times was very stressful but sometimes you have to bite your tongue and just do what you have to to survive. i wouldn't recommend this job to anybody but if you need the money its ok i guess.
good,i regularly worked weekend and as i arrived i would stock up the store and sometimes un load things from the truck with fork lifts. nothing was really hard about this job except dealing with all the attitudes.
good,Good people good co-workers and working on Saturdays gets u a free lunch. They provide the free lunch so that's perty cool I think. They also have a blue chip program that gets you more money if your work productivity is above a giving number.
good,Ross was a wonderful place to work.  The shift hours for me were perfect but I just did not get enough shifts.  Management was wonderful until the last month of my employment.  I was on a leave of absence due to a surgery and during that time management changed hands.  When I returned the environment became hostile and the new management would not work me within my restrictions.  I loved the work.  It is fast-paced which made the day go fast.
good,"A typical day at Ross consist of scanning, taking off censors, and bagging each individual item at the register, in that particular order. Each employee is timed for each transaction, referring to the customer performance rate. It is your duty to maintain a certain percentage every week. Therefore, overall, this job consist of working at a fast paste, along with providing great customer service at the same time."
good,"Its a good first job, and decent pay. I really liked being on register and organizing departments. Hours were always changing and I didn't have a set schedule. Closing shifts were tough because some days we wouldn't leave until 2 a.m. I did like being on register but you're constantly being timed and its hard to keep your CPR up. Organizing was fun to me, but since were always being pulled off our department to get on register, we would take longer to recover which means staying later than we needed to."
good,"Customer service, give customers information on orders,sales,warranties,credits. ensure shelves were stocked to store plan. Recovery, dressing room ,maintain cashier and help train new employees. At the end of the day recovery can be stressful when trying to leave on time but the best part is sale quotes and meeting goal target."
good,"it was always very busy. I loved working in a clothing store. it was fun. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to talk to the customers, serving them and creating a good relationship."
good,"working for ross was  pretty good, the people are nice, you get to meet different type of people, the management is really "
good,"The employees here all get along well and are always willing to lend a helping hand. This position can become quite stressful however, as Ross does not schedule or hire enough staff, especially when busy."
good,"Stressful and fast-paced on some days, like weekends and holidays and in the summer time. There are times when business is slower, which gives associates a chance to slow down and take a breather. Managers are laid back, and flexible. People care about each other here. Not too many reliable people in management, however."
good,Make sure you know your job because it can get pretty face back their in the stock room. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes you will be on your feet all day.
good,"I liked working at Ross, but honestly I wasn't trained enough and nothing was really taken seriously. There were a few and the managers did try, but there was definitely a lack of communication amongst us all. "
good,"Flexible hours. Must be able to work in different areas of the store. Have to be able to work under pressure, especially at the register. Good teamwork is essential."
good,"As a manager you were suppose to know your schedule at least two weeks in advanced, however that was seldom the case. Often called in on your day off."
good,"very busy no payroll to do what you had to do, stores were very messy and had to spend more time cleaning due to lack of payroll. I did learn from the company."
good,"The job was easy and relatively low-stress, but there's no reason to work here when you could make twice as much working part-time at a restaurant somewhere."
good,"Pay is not that great, short hours and shifts, average employee interactions, unproductive staff and managers, rude customers and short/ minimal breaks."
good,"I worked as a stockroom associate and everything we did was timed.  I never had any complaints about my work, only praise, but the fast-paced nature of the job can become somewhat stressful over time.  The hours weren't that great and they paid minimum wage (not quite fair considering how much work is required to be completed in a short amount of time)."
good,i was not thrilled working at ross just for the simple fact that when i was hired on as an employee the manager and the district manager was informed of my personal family matters that were going on at that time and i was not treated professionally.
good,"Great starting point for someone just entering the management "
good,"I like ross . I worked the floor and worked as cashier . I would picked up cloth from the ground and hang them up , I would also work as a cashier  it"
good,"I was an intern store manager for Ross and my experience was good mixed with bad. My assistant store manager and softlines lead quit within the two months I was there. Several employees walked out the time I was there as well.The customers are very rude and degrading just because it is an off price store. SPS team should persecute potential criminals because there is a lot of theft and their practices are not helping them improving their items. Although the district ALPM was very competent in training at the level he was in. On a good note the stock team was best in practices how they would say. The store practices were followed and the stock room leader had a good relationship with their team through effective meetings. Learning about the store practices in the fast paced environment at Ross was the best experience. I was fortunate enough to have a high volume store which is ideal if you want to learn and grow. I learned how to manage payroll, a team of 50+ associates in a shift, analyze reports/data, and meet store standards."
good,"Ross can be a very good place to work. However, certain supervisors can make the time there bad for everyone. The way some supervisors speak and act towards employees can cause great conflict within the team."
good,Was a typical customer service cashier job.  The floor layout was changed about every three weeks.  I felt this made it difficult for employees as well as customers.
good,I had a very good experience with Ross perk ever week enjoyed my co worker's we made it fun to come to work  daily. But it was alot of walking and rushing to your work areas.
good,"Cash management, cash office responsibilities, stocking, register work, customer service, organization of store merchandise, dressing room responsibilities."
good,not really a bad place to work the supervisors and managers were good on directions and giving hand on jobs to do that didnt require alot of instructions. pay was okay if you like minimum wage.
good,its not for me its up to you but if you like slow pace work ross is for you i was just standing around most of the time customers are rude but that doesn't affect me
good,"ross is a busy store so you will definitely always have something to do. it is a very fast past environment, and the pay is not that great. they start at minimum wage"
good,"I worked here just after graduating high school. It is a nice place to work, really nice staff, and overall not a difficult job. The company gives employees great discounts but getting time off is difficult."
good,This company believes in running a shift with one less person then you really need. there is more work to be done then there is people to do it. the customers trash the store on a daily basis with no regard for the people that work there. The management is disconnected and tends to stir the pot. plus the pay is way less then in other stores and management makes less then some associates sometimes. the crew was great and everyone did their best to work together.
good,Meet and greet customers. Observe store for suspicious activity. Communicate with management on potential safety hazards. Convey safety rules to employees
good,The other employees were nice to work with. Management expected too much from employees. The location I worked at customers were the worst. They made a horrible mess of the store. we had a short time at closing to recover the store. Every one was assigned more than one department to recover.
good,Ross is a good place to work if you are looking for extra cash in your pocket or a job that can be used as a stepping stone. You have to have a lot of patience for this job.
good,At Ross you are able to learn new skills and be part of team player enviorment.  Manaagement needs to learn some better coaching sklills but overall was happy.
good,"Good hours, but sometimes we never knew what time we would be getting out. It was never organized and many people didn't do their own jobs at the store which left the store looking poorly."
good,"I like working for Ross, they give us free lunch sometimes and we will have days like you can wear jeans or sports day. On Halloween they let us dress up."
good,"sometimes they take you for granted and don't appreciated your work, there are people who don't do nothing but rely in everyone else to do there jobs for them"
good,I have learned that a process that has worked for many years is a great thing.  I am a process oriented person and therefore my employ is a match with this company.
good,Ross is your typical job environment. Nice clean store. Always seems a little under stocked. And they are serious about their garment limit in the fitting rooms. Checkout is almost always really slow.
good,It is a fun place to work. It can be stressful as it is very fast paced with a lot of customers. It can get very messy too. It is nice having a 401K.  The associates are usually friendly. They have very good prices so they can get a lot of customers. A typical day at work is clocking in on time. Then being available for a register when needed.  The store has to be continually straightened up with Ross goods put back on the shelves. We have to do sizing in a certain department usually every day we work unless it is too busy. The management is usually understanding as it is a very busy store. The hardest part of the job is trying to get your job done without the associates talking to you all the time which they love to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is initialing  all the jobs that I got done.
good,Es muy mala la paga pero es muy fácil el trabajo ???
good,"The workplace was fun and was mainly about trying to keep the store organized.  The employees were great to work with, and the store manager pushed us to be productive."
good,All about efficiency and driving consistent processes. Difficulty depending on market. But great growing company with lots of passionate leaders.  Truck processing too difficult due to lack of payroll.
good,"Great place to get experience from , also a very fun place to communicate with others and learn patience. Great to get some costumer service experience."
good,"Work pace differs from day to day. Some rude customers but for the most part friendly. Hours suck, the max they are allowed to give is 25 hours a week and they only hire part-time. Only way to move up/full-time is if someone steps down or quits. 20% off of each individual article of clothing is maybe the only good consistent thing about the job."
good,"You don't really get much hours, mostly worked one or two days a week part time, really friendly environment, constantly gets dirty, busy on weekends."
good,"A typical day at work is fairly consistent, management isn't too concerned with associate's availability. There is room to grow within the business if you want. Best and worst part of the job is the attitude(s) of the customers"
good,"One of my very first job I ever had "
good,"Ross had good employees, but there ways of doing things were inappropriate. They had unnecessary precautions. And the environment was hostel at times ."
good,Working at Ross is being like with your family. The day goes by quick and doesn't require much headache. Ross has good benefits and can be a easy company to grow in.
good,"It was a good job where I learned a lot about administration. While I was working there things were a little sloppy, however the managers and co worker were very kind."
good,"Got paid terribly though. As a former coworker said ""they pinch pennies but lose people."" It's stressful work with a high turnover rate. Constantly understaffed and good people never stay"
good,A typical day at this job consisted of moving a pallet with a jack from one side to another and placing items to be shipped in designated boxes.  I learned how to work quickly and fin my own rhythm.  It was a very diverse culture with the language barriers being the most difficult part to conquer.  I enjoyed learning to use the forklift and hand/jack pallets.
good,A typical day at work if I wasn't in the stock room was slow and boring. I was constantly trying to find something to do because there was never anything to do!
good,"typical work day was stressful, turnover was horrible , my location could not keep a store manager , everyday we had a different person from a different store overseeing us"
good,Organize the store and help on register when needed. Make sure all the clothes was organized .Management was really tough on all the employees. The hardest part was pleasing all managers to their liking.
good,"It's an ok job to have... If you need a job or need an in between job until you find something better... it's not a bad job to have... pay is ok not the greatest, but also not the worst."
good,Applied for retail associate.The only position they had open was for the stock team.Stock was okay very rountine.You open merchandise from boxes and shelf them all in the department theh belong.My co workers were very nice.The only thing i didn't like was when you worked as a stocker they schedule you for a certain tim to get off but that is not always the time sometimes you will get off at that time occasionally earlier but their were times i didn't get off many hours past scheduled time and the hours are very unpredictable you can have a certain amount of hours one week and can get scheduled barley any the next so another job is recommended if you have the one and need to make cash as means to pay for bills.
good,Team players sometimes under staff but friendly overall managers always listening to feedback forecast can be wrong at times on the truck alot of young employees
good,This environment can be very stressful if you do more than just the stuff in the stockroom. They are very demanding and the pay isn't great so I wouldn't recommend it as a forever job...
good,"The job is good, the people are ok, it's the management that sucks. I've worked at two locations and each one has brought in new management that is just awful."
good,"very fast pace. typical day at work is pertaining to the customers needs, cashiering and merchandising. hardest part of the job was a busy and crowded day. enjoyable day was a busy and crowded day as well"
good,A lot of jobs you learn hence a lot of cross training great deals will develop a shopping problem working here 30 min lunches lots of mangers fun team
good,The job was a seasonal job but at the same time I got a chance to get more experience in retail and customer service. I got a chance to learn interact with different people.
good,A very fast paced job. The managers change all the time and there's always something to do. Hours tend to vary A LOT so it's probably best to have another part time job.
good,I loved the experience I received working for this company really taught me more in the field of retailers I loved it  the co Worker was nice the  facility  was Clean
good,"The workers at Ross were great. However, there are never enough workers to get the work done. Everyone including management was very stressed and it showed."
good,When I worked at Ross in 2014 they were only paying minimum wage of 7.25. Sometimes I would only get 18-19 hours a week. What really made me leave Ross was when they scheduled me 8 hours for one week and my check did not even reach 100 dollars
good,The fact that ross is really small leaves a small amount of growth but being there for years allowed me to grow and love the oppurtunities to futhur my education and work at the same time.
good,it was my first job it was busy and crazy but it was fun. management was good staff was good. great first job pay was average no benefits really and no room to be promoted.
good,"I was a cashier at Ross, getting paid minimum wage, found out this job wasn't for me I did not enjoy working there. Typical day: clock in, you get assigned a section of the store to clean up after about 20 mins or so you go to your register and scan and bag."
good,learned a lot of different thing here I was able to apply to my future jobs. working here helped me to communicate in a calm more professional manner.
good,This job is annoying and mind numbing but hey you get a discount on already discounted clothes and get to see the inventory before the customers do to get a head start on cool stuff.
good,It was okay for the most part just ready for advancement and better opportunities they customer service was great they had a lot of people always coming in very great atmosphere
good,you work hard for little pay and company values the dollar more then there employees. They allow there customers too run the day to day operation they give there employees policies to adhere to but if there question they don't stick to there policies they let there customer run over there employees. And destroy there stores making there employees job harder.
good,"At Ross, my days felt very short because of how busy I was every day. It is very fast paced and detail oriented. Only few mistakes can be made but because of it I know how to work with customers at a fast pace but also giving them good service. "
good,This is a great place for someone who is just joining the workforce to learn about customer service. It is a place where you will never not have anything to do. You will always be running around the store helping keep the store tidy and assisting customers.
good,"Very great place to work, the enviorment is calm and gets busy during some hours but thats the best time to help and get costumers what they need to make them happy."
good,I love working at Ross everybody is nice and welcoming the managers all have different personalities. They have different departments for you to work so more then likely your able to work where you wanna work. The hardest part i think is being in the stockroom because everything is timed and you have to meet the times same as for cashiers you have a scan and bag process and you are being timed for that.
good,"Good workplace"
good,"Many standards held for individuals working there with very little training and a lot of criticism from district and store management. is getting better but only if you are a sales associate. When in management a lot falls onto you and there never seems to be enough hours in the day. only 3 people working in entire store at one time, even on busy evenings and weekends."
good,It gave me an opportunity to go to school and work at the same time. they were open with my hours and were always willing to work with me and my schooling.
good,This was awhile back. Things have probably changed. There were good and bad things. The low prices are attractive and the merchandise is of good quality. Enjoyed the people I worked with
good,"Overall laid back, but management is not always on the same page. There is no store prevention people steal often. Pay is not great worked partime at 9.00 got promoted to full time only to get .50 on the hour more. It's a cool job for college kids or some one who is looking for partime work. Flexible schedule"
good,"A typical day at work is fairly busy, you must have good multitasking skills. Every couple of hours Ross allows you a break, which is nice. Managment is good when organized, in my experience there was a lack of communication between management and employees. Difficult to move up, and compensation is a joke if you have any retail experience prior. Regardless,worked with some pretty cool people."
good,Working At Ross Was A Fun Work Place Everybody was helpful when I first started. The actually to their time to help out all day when they was suppose to be on there post
good,"Minimum wage stockroom job. What else is there to say? "
good,I worked in the stockroom and this was the first job that I actually liked. The hours were great for the first two weeks but after that I was only getting about 8-10 hours per week. That is definitely not enough to pay bills.
good,fun workplace great if you are now just entering the retail scene easy job long hours sometimes low pay though you work with a lot of younger people but not bad for first job
good,"quick paced , sometimes the workers do not finish their morning work and then throw it off to the night shift. then you are required by management to do double the work and you are not allowed to leave until you are finished even if its 30 minutes past overtime. yet for the nightshift once you go past 12:00am it is considered a new day and you do not get your overtime, even though you were there over 8 hours"
good,"Fast work place"
good,"It is a high energy fast paced environment from the moment you hit the floor. Company goals is to bring the treasures out tot he customers in the shortest and most efficient amount of time possible. Heavy emphasis on driving for results, efficiency, merchandise handling. High stress environment where multi-tasking is a must."
good,"Good company, not so great pay. long hours.Friendly manager, Good skills to learn. Hard work, good food. Clothing discount. Not flexible house. Job security not"
good,"Welcome costumers into the store and helped them locate items."
good,It was a fun place to work and the day goes by fast. I liked working there and there was always something to work on and it was fun. There was great people to work with.
good,"Ross is a very fast paced working environment. The store was busy almost always and there was never a dull moment. I am trained in markdowns, stock room supervisor, every department on the sales floor, cash office, fitting room, front end supervisor, and area supervisor. I also helped open two new stores, that included training all new employees and fully stocking and setting up for grand opening."
good,"Typical work day is helping customers inside of the store, organizing the store and maintaining a safe and secure environment in the store. While learning about the people you ay work with and about the company itself."
good,You have to have excellent organization skills. There are many departments and operational duties that you must maintain. The workplace was fast paced with deadlines which was required to meet.
good,it was decent as far as the job culture and people you had to work with. but all of the clothes and items everywhere was very stressful and took a long time to do because of different things being out of place.
good,Working for Ross you will experience a fast moving environment where you are expected to keep up. Productivity is very important. Unfortunately they do not allow you to get extra hours.
good,"High stress environment where you are expected work extremely hard and constantly pick up after customers. Jobs like these further spoil Americans as they feel entitled and go to any place and trash it."
good,"this was a good job while i was in high school but after that things got a little rough but its a good place to work the hours are flexible. management will be there for you 100%, you just have to stay on the ball and you will be good."
good,The hours that you work are pretty crazy. Most days I wouldn't get off until one or two oclock in the morning. The workload is pretty big too considering we were always understaffed.
good,This was a nice place to work for young people. If you work on the truck they work you to death and it is fun but hard work. They try to keep everyone at 4 hours per day so that they don't have to give you a lunch.
good,"A typical day at work at Ross, constitutes of assisting customers, and provide friendly customer service. Recover store continuously."
good,Overall good experience staff was alright but rude break room was clean and comfy easy job overall and management were helpful and helped with questions
good,"A typical work day would consist of greeting customers and finalizing their purchases, supervising my cashiers/sales floor associates to ensure they are performing their duties as required, making sure they take their breaks and lunches on time, and assisting the Managers whenever required. I've learned to have a lot of patience and that hard work really does pay off. I moved up multiple times in a short period of time. The hardest part of my job is making sure our customers are satisfied during the holidays (mainly Christmas). The store gets very busy and our lines get very long. I enjoy meeting new associates and training them to be the best they can be. I also enjoy adding to the customer's shopping experience by ensuring that their checkouts are fast and they leave with a smile on their faces."
good,a typical day at work was running the floor putting things back helping in areas that need help and also the cash register. Provided answers for customers and showed them were to find products.
good,I enjoy working for corporations who respect and value the HUMAN SPIRIT!  Having lateral lucrative upward mobility enhances the retention rate of phenomenal employees while strengthening weakness of ALL employees.
good,It's nice to work in such a friendly environment. the schedule sucks. some weeks you can not work more than 10 hours in a week. clean and happy environment.
good,"Started out as a great place to work but throughout the years things and people change. Benifets are good, discount is great.  Room to move with the company."
good,Ross  is a good place to start working if you need a job. I enjoy it because I get the chance to go to work early in the morning and go to school. It works good with my schedule.
good,"There is never a typical day, you're always busy because if you are not than you are not being productive. Managers like to see that you are doing something. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, it's not easy being nice when someone's being rude to you so you just have to be the bigger person. I loved my new friends I made."
good,"It's very quiet and everyone kind of keeps to themselves. I didn't get a lot of guidance when I was being trained, and I was taught different things. It was very dull to work there."
good,great employer to work for. training is available for those who are seeking advancement within the company. store takes time to implement programs for safety and training programs
good,"A typical day Ross is when a customer enter into the store with a attitude and you can uplift there spirit with a simple hello, smile or how are you doing today. I really enjoy working with different culture because a great opportunity to learn something different everyday to help you on your journey."
good,"Early hours and short days."
good,Working at ROSS was a good experience. I really enjoyed working with my associates. My supervisor was so awesome. The employees stick together on everything..which is ideal when you're back up with stock and customers in the store!
good,Overall not a bad place to work. Upper management seem to be fair and helpful. Work can be repetitive at times. Equipment is old and outdated. Some stores need to be remodeled. I would recommend this company to those who are interested in getting into the retail industry.
good,I usually work in the fitting room.  I have to count all the garments that each customer takes into the fitting room and recount the garments when they leave the fitting room.  Every Monday I do markdowns which is when I reduce the price of the clearance items.  I love doing markdowns.  I t is my favorite thing to do at Ross
good,Its an alright career for particular individuals. I would recomend it to someone who needs a quick 3month job while applying for other occupations.
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on your position but customer service is key in every department."
good,It's a good working environment. Co-workers as well as managers are very friendly and helpful. The only issue I have would be not enough hours
good,"Use to Un pack boxes, fold clothes, stack on racks. Fold tables, handle sales if the store needed help. Set up dapartment in the store. Clean up the store before leaving. Take out trash from around the whole store."
good,The only complain i have is that i got hired as part time but then they said i was seasonal. They're great on breaks but they also need manager improvement.
good,There are many different positions to work at Ross.  If you do not like your position there is opportunity to try out other positions.
good,"The management and co-workers made this place worth working at. The customers talk down to you because you work retail but once you're used to that then your days are pretty good. My store is opened from 8:00 am to 12:30 am Monday through Saturday. On Sunday's we're open from 8:30 am to 12:00 am. The store hours made it difficult to have a regular sleep schedule, especially when I was in school. The company does NOT listen to you when you voice your opinion against it. Check the store hours before applying. When there were call ins we wouldn't get out sometimes until 3 or 4 in the morning."
good,They use a ton of paper and are not technologically updated. They still use office 2010. They need to stay updated in IT and start moving forward.
good,Prep clothes to go out on the floor. Hard tag clothes and make sure that they are ready for customer consumption. Nice co-workers and and OK work experience.
good,"Customers would leave things all over the floor and wouldn't bother picking anything up. The kids shoes, toy aisle, and towel aisle were the worst, but overall the people that worked there were very friendly and good people."
good,From start to finish just a overall busy work environment and not too bad on getting things in and out the building when everyone is on the same page.
good,"i worked at two different facilities and both were ran very different. the pay is ok not the best, they are flexible with your schedule most times."
good,"Ross overall is a great company to work for with all the benefits they offer.However, management only seems to care about themselves most of the time and no one else. Co-workers are fun to work with and are hardworking. Hard part is constantly cleaning up after messy customers."
good,"Dealt with a lot of difficult customers, learned how to talk & deal with them. Management was alright. Hardest part of the job is cleaning up after customers make a mess."
good,Easy to learn. Perfect first job. I had some great managers. Had some fun coworkers. Great learning experience for future  knowledge. Loved learning how to stock.p
good,"This job is very easy. Great around the holidays, very busy. if you like clothes and cusomers then you'll love it. this job can be fun and very intertaing at time. employees and managers give lots of comploments and realy appreciate their workers/ co workers"
good,The job was ok nice people but they didn't train me very well on my first two days and they score us alot at the front if you didn't go fast enough they would write you up
good,I haven't worked at ross for long but I enjoy it when I'm there as long as I don't work too much per week. You might not get the amount of hours you want per week.
good,"A typical work day is busy. If your work is done, they find you something else to do. Co workers are usually friends. Some of the managers are good to work with, some aren't. The job isn't too difficult and I enjoyed stocking there."
good,"Awful management team"
good,"A great company to strengthen your business acumen. Company is growing! Good benefits, 401K, Stock purchase plan. Upper management offers little support to store leaders."
good,"Management was good at some point, then it went down hill. They didn't seem to care about their employees as much as the year went on and they began to learn the people who worked there."
good,Unloading 100 plus boxes from the merchandise truck and displaying the items on the sales floor was a major part of my everyday work. The management was easy-going and my co-workers were pretty friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting off either before or around the noon. The hardest part was waking up at 4 in the morning to get to work on time. I learned that you can work fast and be efficient with minimal error.
good,"The short time that I have spent at Ross has been very interesting.Management has been more than friendly, they have great people for management. The non management associates on the other hand have low morale. They have no motivation to finish their jobs and are not the greatest with the customers. I've learned a lot about management in the short time that I have been here. The hardest part of the job would be getting the associates to  be friendly to customers. It is hard to get them to feel motivated. The most enjoyable part for me is helping customers and knowing that I am providing great customer service to them."
good,"I loved working with the evening crew, my co-workers were very helpful and reliable.  I learned the true significance of working as a team at Ross Dress for Less. The staff if very friendly and helpful."
good,"My Functions in Loss Prevention was Monitoring, prevent incidents of the employees in the DC, checking for safety conditions of the employees, inspecting work's stuff, PIT License, making reports, frond desk and relative functions... Check in/out transit on trailers in the RDM system... enjoyed the part where i could interacting with all Ross DC environment, Departments, because i could secure my communication skills, and my work with computers, because i brought back knowledges and aptitudes that i already had...hardest part, i think was Code 50s... means when i was at the front desk side i had check in and out the associates preventing loss...honestly i wanted to change from job's position, because i felt that i was not doing to much there, and i want to do that i really know and like"
good,This job is actually not that bad. The rules and regulations are followed correctly. The only bad thing about it is the pay.
good,"Afternoons, weekends and holidays could get hectic, it's get a bit challenging since most of the time some stores are short on employees or hours and the job still has to get done. For the most part it's a friendly environment"
good,"On a typical work night it's okay. I wish they work on applying more things to help keep us awake. It's as if Ross forget humans are working overnight from 12-8 am. Also some of the workers and management need to be retrained, this would help get everyone on the same page. Ross can also improve on teamwork, making all the work done in a timely manner. The hard part on this job is at time you work with unmotivated people, I get that your tired, but lets get the job done. An enjoyable thing about this job is you can work without people getting in your way, so thing tend to move faster. It isn't a bad job, but it's not a dream career."
good,I met a couple of best friends working at Ross. I had a lot of fun working with them and also met a lot of customers that became friends as well.
good,"Learned how to receive freight, process freight and place it on the sales floor in the appropriate shops. Learned cash register operations and cash handling."
good,"It was fast paced restocking and the process of behind the store scenes. All the employees were women. Lots of fascinating products and merchandise. No lunch room, but the employees were nice and shared their car space."
good,"I loved working for this company, but due to the relocation for school, unfortunately I had to resign. I opened the store in Tyler Texas and the experience was great! I loved working with different people and also learning more about retail."
good,"a typical day at work is to process the products before taking them out on the floor i learned that you should be happy at your job no matter what the management team is respectful  my co-workers are the best they can be they listen to you and tried to help you the hardest part of this job is trying to finished your task before leaving but you do it the most enjoyable part of the job is fun activities with back to school, boys and girls club of america, Halloween, thanksgiving, and christmas"
good,"When I was hired on for this job, I was told that I would be a regular employee, not an employee that was part of the construction of the store prior to opening."
good,"Cross-performs in all assigned areas to ensure that merchandise sizing, ticketing and presentation are to company standards. This includes processing and bringing new receipts to the sales floor using company best practices and meeting productivity standards, merchandising all items to the Salesfloor Presentation Guide and maintaining merchandise/brand name familiarity within departments to assist customers"
good,The time I spend developing associates to the next level. Watching those associates become confident and successful and moving forward in their careers.
good,Loved working at Ross and helping people pick the right fit to make them happy. It was a short experience but I learned alot by working there.
good,"Ross provides a flexible schedule and is willing to work to your needs. I would recommend everyone experience a retail environment because it builds your people skills as well as patience and conflict management skills.  As a bonus, all associates get 20% all purchases. For the most part, associates are friendly and I have made friends with many of them. Sometimes, cliques can form though. "
good,"At Ross Dress for Less a typical day at work would involve me working in different departments such as: stock, register, fitting room, and sales floor. Each department teaches me to move faster each day. When in stock I learned that the important thing is that we meet goal and to meet goal you have to work at a fast pace. When working the register I learn that the faster you get the customer out the better you are doing with productivity. In addition to, working the sales floor and fitting is all about pleasing the customer and moving at a fast pace to do so. The hardest part of the job is maintaining speed even when its slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming in seeing the co-workers that you build a bond with and being able to joke and still get the job done on time."
good,I used to work at Ross Dress for Less in the Metro Atlanta area in the Edgewood Shopping Complex. It was a nice location. the job was fun
good,I was the FES and I learned a lot being there but the management didn't do everything that they should of. They pushed a lot of it onto others.
good,"Working at Ross was an eye opening experience, and was also my first corporate job. A typical day at work for me involves a balance between being both efficient and thorough, whether I am cashiering, re-stocking, or just organizing the store after a hectic business day. Management plays a minimal role during shifts, and most of deciding how the daily workload will be distributed throughout the workforce is up to the store team. All of my co-workers including myself work together in order to ensure that everyone is given an equal portion of work, while taking into account each individual's field of expertise. The hardest part of the job was dealing with slow work days where not many customers would come in. On these days I found it hard to pace myself and my workload in order to stay adequately busy all day. The most enjoyable part of working at Ross has to be successfully helping a customer with a problem that is out of the ordinary. Solving new problems that I haven't dealt with before gives me a feeling of satisfaction that is uncomparable to doing mundane tasks for hours on end."
good,"good first job to have..esp of your fresh out of high school, friendly people and managers. very easy to understand how to use registers or also how to stock the store coworkers and managers are very helpful."
good,It was a pretty descent job I enjoyed working there. I learned a lot about computers and production work. There was no hard part to the job. The co-workers were great people .
good,Working as group and presenting customer service. I've learned to deal with different type of people and how to deal with them. working with different kind of coworkers which is really good to know different people and work with them.
good,"good workplace, dont like the issues that associates are having, there is too much favoritism and sometimes your being overworked cause of that"
good,Managing staff and working to develop a professional and productive management and associate team that positively impacts store sales and service.
good,I enjoyed working with customers and learned a great deal dealing with different people on a day-to-day basis. I worked with a great team also.
good,i didnt have any problems working here. the only thing i didnt like was the pay and that they never gave any raises or promotions. and they only gave you about 8 hours a week
good,"Great environment. You get discounts on all items in the store. So of the people where friendly. The pay wasn't great, but hopefully it got better."
good,"awesome for a first time job"
good,"once you clock in, you meet up with your group so your supervisor can send you to the desired department. once you are told you immediately have to start working until your break or lunch. coworkers were strict, you would have to work how they work, but they were friendly to a certain point."
good,"Ross values strong leadership and encourages a creative approach to business management. I have had the opportunity to create a strong team culture in my building, and mentor a team to be more business savvy and shortage focused."
good,"Very focused on customer service, cleanliness, organization, and loss prevention. Communication and cooperation among coworkers and supervisors is important."
good,Ross is about teamwork as well as fast and friendly service. Management is friendly and always looking for ways to help their associates improve.
good,I wish I could have worked there a little longer to get the out of holiday exsperiance .The pay is decent starting off for the work that is done for this job. I wouldnt mind working there again
good,Going in to working giving it a full 100% learn to work well with others able to manage over 6 employees at a time and run a store co-workers are being managed well when Im on the shift everything falls in order dont have a hard part of my job everythings works well when you have a awesome team most enjoyable part of work will be working in a great work environment
good,I love working for this company the management is super friendly and also very helpful. this is a job i would reccomend to anyone who likes having fun while at the same time learning something new everyday.
good,looking for steady work and decent pay that includes overtime? look no further. if you can get in stay there while you further your education.
good,"I love the discount program. The merchandise is reasonable, and salary. but the job work/ life balance is horrible. you are always at work"
good,The only downfall to Ross is that you have to do the work of 5 people in you shift.  They only give up to 25 hours a week and full-time work is far and few.  It is a great place to lend some hours too if you don't need the hours because the pay per hour is great.
good,Working here helped build my stocking skills. And taught me how to be more of a leader as we rotated leading the line of duties as when unpacked boxes and prepared them on hangers to be set out on the floor in timely manner. You always work on building your timing skills due to you having to have the stocked items out on the floor a certain time.
good,The discount was great...I enjoyed that much. Schedule and pay were okay. Managers tried to be flexible with schedules.
good,"Trainers need training from associates in departments and to work in them before training new hires. They don't know enough to teach enough to those who start. Those who start still learn about there job months after starting."
good,"Working in a warehouse, working in a fast-paced environment. I learned how to tag clothing. The management was not nice at all. Co- workers were very nice and laid back. The hardest part of the job was when a high production of clothing and home decor etc. came in. There was not an enjoyable part of this job."
good,"thoroughly enjoyed working there, great co workers, great supervisors and managers and benefits are really good also"
good,Enjoyed my time with them. Wish them good luck. Provided me with a lot of knowledge in retail management. I wish everybody nothing but success.
good,Walmart has many positions and opportunities for people who want them. From a cart pusher to a store manager you can do many things in such a large company.
good,fun Job get to interact with customers  you would get to look at the many ways of theft and make a way to stop theft i would also look at the employees for any sings of theft any other duties.
good,I liked it but I was dirty a good part time job I would work there again just at another location but the workers were nice and welcoming but I just didn't like the fact it was always dirty the bathroom mostly.
good,"Provides prompt and efficient responses to customers at all times."
good,"A fun place to work as a team member from cashiering to sizing and store recovery.  It does become irritating when the patrons just totally disrespect the store and all our hard work to keep the store as clean and organized for their shopping needs, but it all works out in the end.  We laugh here and there and just do it all over again and again with a smile here and a laugh there while doing our duties."
good,I don't hate the job but it was easy to get along with most of my coworkers but then there's the rude customers who cant follow simple rules. From time to time I do bump heads with some of coworkers not all of course mainly just one. The store is an easy place to work at but most people don't do their part and expect more.
good,It is an okay place to work if you are a college student if you are not in management. The pay is not anything you can support yourself on if you are out on your own.
good,"The company has many valuable tools in place to help its associates better themselves not only in the workplace, but otherwise. Unfortunately, many of these programs, while wonderful ideas, rarely trickled down to the associates at the bottom. The managers that I had were wonderful, supporting and well trained, but other associates were not. The training system is not conducive to training good, hardworking employees. New hires were asked to watch videos on how the company runs, how to sort the shelves, how to sort the fitting room and other tasks, but since there was no manager oversight, employees would sit and play on their phones on company time, instead of paying attention. "
good,"Management were really nice people, i learned a lot. coworkers were very understanding and very optimists. the harded part of the job was to see people doing wrong things in the store. the best part of the job was to interact with people."
good,"The people here are great but if you are not an sps, or some sort of full-time, or management you might have to fight for your hours. There are some associates that get eight hours and have to call everyday to see if they need someone because many people call of a day."
good,I started as an unloader which was okay but i decided i would try another position so they put me as a loader. I felt more comfortable doing that position so i remained doing it for the rest of the time i was their.
good,I started officiating soccer when I was 13. It taught me responsibility and how to deal with angry coaches and fans. I learned how to be self confident and manage myself.
good,While working at Ross Dress for Less an employee was stealing from other employees and there was nothing being done to figure out who was taking things and how to stop it from continuing. As loss prevention we had to memorize an entire statement and bullets howerever there was nothing we were required to do to prevent loss other than greet whomever is stealing. None of the duties actually prevented loss. Loss prevention was mainly greeters and employees sent to locate the evidence of stolen items.
good,"I wrote my review under my Store Protection Specialist listing, I was just promoted. Same store and nothing has changed."
good,"Work is work, come to work and you go right to work. You get an assigned function than your trained. After your trained you work. The place is a cool work place to work with ross team."
good,I learned alot working for this company. Had some good day and had some bad but we still seems to manage and finish our day. They are not always easy!!
good,"I enjoyed working as cashier, but the store got really messy really fast and they were really low on staff so there was double the work load."
good,I learned the in's and out's of how department stores handle their inventory on a daily basis. I had to check in the inventory that came on the trucks and then process all the items that would be put out on the sales floor.
good,As a sale associate and cashier we had daily areas to manage throughout the day. The best part of the job was meeting new people and keeping customers in touch with the latest fashions.
good,"Get in what you put in."
good,I gained experience at Ross and it was very productive. This is my first job in retail. The people were very nice but its a lot of work and stressful on the body.
good,"this place was cool , I don't regret working for them I just wasn't cool with the pay for the hard work I put in. I learned a lot about how warehouse jobs work , and about how to operate a forklift"
good,"fast maintenance, clear understanding of what roles and responsibilities were. management lacked communication and was unfair"
good,Success depends on location of store and support provided from upper-management. Hardest part is being able to accompilsh duties while dealing with a gossip-filled work environment.
good,"Great place to work,I have learned how to handling money!"
good,"I have no  complaint about Ross, if you work you work if you don't you leave, its  a great place to work part time to get some extra cash!"
good,I go in way before the store opens to help maintain the merchandise and clothing. I clock out 3 hours after the store opens and its an easy day.
good,"-On a typical day at Ross, assist patrons, employees would manage      the cash registers, tidy up the displays and merchandise, attend the dressing room, place return items back on the racks, and answer phones. "
good,"Worked closely with management and associates to maintain a safe and secure environment. Every month we get a new set of shortage departments and we have to study it learn it, then pass it on to the associates. Just to make sure they keep a close eye on each department we have shortage in."
good,"I mainly did cashiering, if I wasn't on the cash register, I was usually putting merchandise back where it belonged, helping customers by answering any questions they might have & just making sure they found everything okay, didn't have any trouble shopping. I even worked in the early mornings sometimes with the early morning shipments before the store opened with stocking the shelves with new merchandise, and putting hard tags on everything. "
good,Did not really enjoy any part of this job.  Company is good but the atmosphere was messy and chaotic.  Always a mess and co workers did not seem happy to be there
good,i learned how to deal with all type of different customers and i also like how fast paste things were .i loved the discounts and how i could always keep myself busy
good,"There was always work to do and help with. The customers were usually friendly, and my co-workers were not troublesome or unhelpful. Management did it's best to please everyone."
good,"Decent first job. People can be very demanding or impossible, but that is everywhere. Not very organized workplace. They are good at giving your desired hours."
good,Friendly work place. Great Holiday Pay. Flexible with your life Schedule. Always something to do inside work place. Clothing store just like a library.
good,Ross got good benefits but no good long hours. Good place to work at if you are an good skillful person. You are timed to do everything. You must be fast and must be on timed
good,If you move fast at check-out you'll be praised. Show good organizational skills and you'll be put on fitting room duty. It's best to get well rounded with the entire store. Gets old after 7 mo.
good,ross is underpaid because they make you do so much for min. wage but the discounts are very great. The hardest thing about working at ross is closing because it requires a lot of bending down. Co-workers were friendly sometimes.the most enjoyable part is the holidays when you get 40% off all items.
good,"-i have been here for almost a year now. "
good,Ross gets real busy during holidays but other than that it is a real lead back environment. The people are nice and pretty good discounts.
good,"Overall, working at Ross was ok. It is a lot of work. There are a few time through out the year when you get a double discount. I remained friends with many of the associates."
good,The workplace was fast paced and busy most of the time. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. Training could have been more thorough.
good,"Daily Operational activities, management, customer service"
good,"Provided opportunity to learn customer service, money handling and inventory management. Recommended for students in high school seeking first time employment."
good,"too much work for the minimum wage"
good,"This job was overall a great experience for me. Even though management is different every year and it makes it difficult for advancement. It provides you with real life experiences. It is great for a first job, people who are trying get their foot out the door. You will truly learn about how the working world is and get prepared for future jobs in any field. They are very flexible with work scheduling, so it is also good for students and part time employment. The most enjoyable parts are working with your co-workers. Mostly all co workers new and old were a joy to be around. Typical day at Ross is felt with laughs, team work and handwork."
good,"great discounts, fast paced , diverse , friendly co workers and fun environment, supportive management. unfortunately understaffed so greater work load"
good,Enjoyable environment but employee quality of work would seemingly be better if the starting pay was at least a little higher.
good,I like working with customers and making the work place a pleasant experience. I worked all areas of the store. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I was able to share ideas for a more productive flow of merchandise.
good,This is only a temporary job for me. I dont  get many hours. And they call me everyday im scheduled off. but the day goes by quick and its not hard work
good,"trained to work as a team, hence moving the company forward plus the management and supervisor being supportive. Always given the opportunity to grow and advance. the most amazing part of the job is the rally meeting which is held most often. In the meeting company's goals target is emphasized and  as an employee you can share ideas and thoughts of how the company can forward. Ideas are always welcomed."
good,you do to much work and not getting enough pay. timed on everything you do. Not enough people to get the job done. They have a really good job culture.
good,a basic minimum wage job retail job with minimal job advancement opportunities...full time work isn't usually likely. Good as a 2nd part time job or for students
good,i liked it alot. but it was not enough hours. i had to find a better place of employment with full time and better pay. i went straight to pemco after ross
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace environment because it made the day go by fast. However, there didn't seem to be enough hours in the day to recover the merchandise strewn carelessly across the sales floor by customers. I enjoyed selling clothes and household items."
good,"In a typical day, I supervise 12 or more associates. I recover and merchandise the sales floor, create room for extra merchandise when needed. I cover associates' break times which includes working in the fitting room and on the cash register. As a member of management, I try and make each day fun and let associates know they can come to me if needed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the variety of projects I get to do and who I get to work with. The hardest part of the job would be being stern but still making a fun atmosphere."
good,If you are just starting out in the customer service field this is a good place to start. A fun and upbeat environment and great staff is only the beginning of the things this place has to offer.
good,A great place to start in the logistics field. The daily delivery of merchandise and the staging of items before it goes to the sales floor is not so complicated. The co-workers here are friendly and enjoyable to work with.  Management tries hard to make the environment great for everyone.
good,"Co-workers and staff are fun and friendly. The stock room is fast paced and requires hard work, but it is manageable when you work with a good team. The only problem was no full time schedules are offered."
good,"Didnt work there long but it came very naturally to me. Met a lot of great co workers, always seemed very busy. I also love dealing with customers."
good,"Hardly got any hours because they were always hiring new workers. Policies kept changing without any notice."
good,"good work place, great benefits! its a great to work besides the management, is worst than politics but over all is a blast"
good,"I was a front end supervisor and instead of getting paid minimum wage, like most employees ($7.25/hour), my 'increase' due to my job title and experience was bumped to $7.75/hour. Schedule changed often, sometimes without notice. Enjoyed working with the other employees and meeting new people."
good,Productive work place with a lot of management. Independent zone. Now being timed and Overly Supervised within the company. I enjoy putting a smile on customers face as they walk throughout the store. I love to work the cash register and deal with money.
good,"This company needs a lot of improvement done to their employees."
good,"The workplace was friendly the work there was easy the co-workers was quick to help when needed, the management was awesome."
good,Lots of customers throughout the day. Always plenty of work to do. A good team of co-workers who have good work ethnic. Have learned a lot more about the retail business from working there and the challenges that the company have to go through.
good,"I unloaded the truck at the start of my shift, unloaded the boxes and organized them by dept. I then put the merchandise away in the appropriate areas of the store."
good,A lot of busy days so you have to be quick. The staff was friendly always helped me out when i needed help. Sometimes there was too little staff and a lot of customers
good,"Basic pay, lots of work, plenty of breaks and great customers. Its wonderful part-time work when you need it. Not a lot of room to move up within the company."
good,"learning how to control sales and payroll and develop teams is nice, however everyone hates their job and complains constantly. Have to deal with incredibly annoying customers who destroy your store every day without fail or care."
good,"Ross gave me the opportunities to grow. They develop people to success and make the ross a career. The most challenging part as a manager is to work under staff, trying to find replacement when you have an associate calling out."
good,"this wpould be a better company to work for if we had longer shifts, longer breaks, and a management team willing to work with us and when posittions are open we be picked based on experience"
good,A busy place to work at. I enjoy the people I work with. I enjoy the customers I interact with. Very fast paced. Supportive management they help in every way possible for personal growth within the company.
good,Given the location of the store it will be a very busy day at the store. Located to serve several surrounding communities insures that your workday will be a fast paced experience.
good,Working at Ross gave me great experience working as a team and individually. You can really build good work structure by rotating positions and helping your team members throughout your shift.
good,"I worked 3rd shift it was easy most days. I didn't like being stuck on 2nd level sort because I wasn't making the ""units"" we needed to get  the bonuses everyone on pallets got. Also working 3rd shift some days there was no work and we were sent home."
good,we used to work their for so many hours and the pay is only 9 dollars per hour.good place to work part time when going to school.
good,"just a part time job. easy, and fulfilling to help customers on the floor looking for specific items. people I worked were nice and friendly"
good,"Great learning experience, became a better buyer, however extremely micromanaged. Never praised for accomplishments/hard work. Stuck in same position for two and a half years."
good,I have worked grocery retail and clothing retail for many years. You generally stay very busy. The day goes by quickly. The location I work at is very close to home.
good,Enjoyable work place where one can develop and grow their interpersonal skills. Friendly coworkers and wonderful customers that will make your day.
good,"There was never a dull moment. I was always running around trying to take care of responsibilities. However, I think they are underemployed because I was called in multiple times to cover other people's shifts. I won employee of the month on the first month I worked there, which wasn't hard because I felt like I was the only employee giving the job my full attention."
good,"very fast paced always something to do. weekends off. cashiering sometimes. early shift, only thing I did not like was hours were seasonal, holidays were our busiest times"
good,"My day as a stock associate/sales associate included preparation for new stock truck, prepping stock for the sales floor, placing stock in appropriate areas, and being a back up cashier or fitting room attendant on the sales floor."
good,"A lot of work , Not very much advancement . A lot of cleaning and staying after your scheduled work hours. Staff is super nice."
good,Looking for my growth within a company. Safe work environment. Typical day surrounded around customer service and operational responsibilities
good,Self-motivated worker searching for a rewarding position that will use my education and experience while expanding my professional horizons.
good,"Compensation is low, but the managers are very nice and friendly along with the employee's. Other than the compensation there are no real issues or complaints about the job."
good,"More of a job for a high school student, or college student looking for summer work. Not very good management, unclean store."
good,"Ross is always a very busy work environment. I have worked at Ross stores for 14yrs. I have learned and gained the experiences as a supervisor, cashier, and a great customer service representative."
good,"Working here was good, management wasn't the best. Co-workers were very friendly, i cant say that i've ever had a problem working there."
good,"A typical day at Ross is fast paced and full of challenges. There is no typical day, but that is whats makes the job interesting. The culture there is focused on teamwork and developing associates to the next level. One of the most rewarding moments is seeing your team grow. The hardest part of the job is transferring to impact the company further. I really liked the diversity of people I came across and trained with. I learned a lot from several store managers and district managers that mentored me."
good,"While the coworkers and managers were kind and understanding, the retail environment was very demanding. Since it is a discount clothing store, many customers stopped by, and often we were understaffed. I learned how to manage my responsibilities better in such a hectic environment, and also how to keep up a positive attitude when serving  customers."
good,It's a very busy place to work for but at the same time it helps you gain experience. Co-workers are a great help at the store
good,"My daily tasks at Ross changed every few days. I was mainly a cashier, but would also be exposed to working the dressing rooms, stock, and the customer service desk."
good,I work 10 hour days or 45 hours a week typically.  My shifts change and days off are usually split and we do not work a set schedule as management.  It is very demanding but can also be very  rewarding.  The best part are the associates who work for me and the customers I have the opportunity to meet.  I enjoy the challenges the company has for us and the new programs we learn then train.  I have learned that mistakes can be opportunities and being a manager means I lead by example.
good,its nonstop. you definitely learn how far your patience can stretch and then you learn how to make it stretch further. it teaches you the importance of order and how the customer is always right.
good,"It was a good place to work. I loved the people and customers, even the rude customer it made work that much more fun. I'll tel anyone in the future to work here. A good company."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of customer service and operating a computerized register (cashier) greeting customers coming and going   and cleaning and maintaining the store. I learned how to interact with new people and work in a positive environment. Management was fair to all employees and respectable. Co-workers taught me a lot about the job friendly and reliable when i needed help, helped me adjust to the new work environment. The hardest part of the job was pleasing customers who were unsatisfied with their shopping experience. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to interact with new people and improve my social skills."
good,"For a first part-time job, I gained a lot of experience.  Learning how to run a register and proper customer service is essential to future jobs.  The hardest part of the job was during the holidays, keeping the store clean and organized seemed near impossible at times. Employees and most customers were friendly.  I enjoyed my time there and miss the staff."
good,"I had fun at ross all the clothes and shoes it was like heaven to me, I got a nice discount and the yearly discount of 40% amazing"
good,"It's a nice and friendly place to work, but I would prefer a different job in my selected career path. I would like to move on in the world instead of just being content with where I am."
good,"This is a good place to start off if you have a first job or no experience, loved checking people out at the register, loved to clean and maintain store."
good,Ross has a very good business model that protects the company financial and on that promotes upward growth as long as you are willing to do it there way.
good,"Not enough hours, overworked, messy, rude customers/coworkers, and a depressing environment. They are annoyingly busy ate every location."
good,"•	Responsible for all phases of store operations"
good,"A great place to start your merchandising career if you intern with them."
good,I would help customers find what they would be looking for. Deal with customers over the phone. Unload the truck when that would come in.
good,"I enjoy my current position, but I do not make much money. I started part time hear while I was finishing college. It is a good transition job until you can get your real career off the ground."
good,this job was fun we had to do a lot of bending stooping and a lot of climbing. my coworkers were outstanding as well as management. the thing I enjoyed about working here was we all got along very well
good,"Simple job. great for high school students, teachs the basics of a job, but it does get a little to personal but it might have been the personalities working there"
good,"I learned to be more focus in the fitting room area."
good,"My day started at 9 am with unlocking of all doors and a store safety walk. Next I check notes from the night before and corrected anything needed written by other team members. Once notes are done Id have a quick 5-10 min talk with management about store topics or issues. What i'm use to doing with other company's in the past wasn't required so I couldn't showcase my almost 10 year LP experience. Then the remainder of the day I would take notes on what took place during my shift, greet customers and checking workers in & out. My customer service skills really improved my time at Ross and my adjustment to younger co-workers got better as well. I love people so the interaction with all of the customers i was allowed to have was great."
good,I learned how to use the cash register which I found to be very easy! It is a very fast paced work place but unfortunately my co-workers never seem to stay the same.  They are constantly hiring new people which I constantly have to learn new names.
good,"Hard work, I think is a great company, but there is no leadership in the store I am used work, "
good,"The priority at Ross, is customers."
good,"good company to work for with a great opportunity for growth, good benefits. Management is supportive of growth and opportunities are provided"
good,"I love Ross and all my co-workers, but management is awful. We've gone so long without a store manager or assistant supervisors who know what they're doing. Only one of the managers truly works hard. I love the fast pace environment, and interacting with the customers. It's the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. Terrible hours are given. For example, you can have completely open availability, but an employee who doesn't and goes to school full time still gets more hours. Nobody does the scheduling correctly. Your requests for anything are pretty much denied. If the store was run differently with better, and PROPERLY TRAINED managers it would be the best store on earth. I shop at Ross more than any other store, so to work here is heaven. However, when the store isn't ran correctly, and you're an employee it's a nightmare."
good,It was a very busy job sometimes could get scary at times dealing with negative customer. I didnt like the fact the we as loss prevention agents wasnt able to carry weapons because you never know who or what someone else had if they were trying to steal.
good,Their is nice people to work with there but the management is not good there they don't care about anything.
good,"Operations/ Merchandising ASM, co-managed a 13.5 million dollar store. Employee management, provided leadership, coaching and process improvement. Implemented structure to ensure high delivery of customer service standards. Ensured compliance with corporate and enforced all policies and procedures."
good,"Many new employees get lost in the shuffle at Ross. One only receives training if the other employees help them, to be honest. If your boss is nice and understanding, most employees enjoy it and do well. I did for awhile, but after not being able to move forward in the company after being trained for a few promotions, I was frustrated. It isn't a forever job, but it's a job."
good,I was hired as seasonal help so I didn't get to stay at Ross very long.  I worked mainly in the fitting room so I was on my feet a lot and the shift went by fast.
good,"A typical day consisted of cashiering, and having a specific zone to fix. Management do not really talk to each other so if you need something you have to go to the head boss, or tell them all individually. The most enjoyable is the discounts."
good,okay place to work at just didn't like that they didn't change me positions
good,It was fun while I was there learning new and fast ways at the register. I loved meeting and bonding with all the new associates.
good,Unload trucks and put up stock. Different jobs. Some managers were great. Co-workers were funny. Putting up all the merchandise. Closing time.
good,"daily work consisted of change runs, cleaning, stocking, ordering, hiring/firing, basic retail work"
good,"Overall Ross is a very great store to shop at. Working there is fun sometimes however, I need a job that is more related to my career goal so I can surround myself with patients, and medical field related stuff. I also need a job that I can be independent on. I do not want to depend on someone in the future. Ross was never guaranteed hours."
good,"There is a lot of knowledge required to preform all of the required tasks at this job. It is very versatile and works well with your schedule, It can teach money handling, customer service, and how to work in a stockroom environment. The management is not the best, they don't really respond well to problems at the work place, they would much rather avoid it. The co-workers were all nice but a lot of drama."
good,I maintained myself as occupied and efficient as possible. I wasn't in agreement with some management and co-workers behavior so I kept to myself but never forgot to provide great customer service.
good,"Very slow at first and it will eventually pickup with customer."
good,"I work in the cash office. I prepare daily deposits. Since this is a retail store I do not get many hours. I am only part time, I love my job, but I really need more hours."
good,"a typical day would be to come in and most likely see a long line with 2 cashiers at register because management would want the sales floor organized which is virtually mission impossible sometimes with all the customers moving everything. I learned from this job that you can only trust yourself and look after yourself ( not trying to say that all your co-workers will be jerks, some are really nice and helpful) because the same person who smiles in your face is probably the same person who will be telling on you to management for accidentally not cleaning your hangers or running the go-back fast enough or being too slow at the register. The management are not all bad , just communicate with them and make sure that your schedule is not changed without you knowing. The hardest part of the job is learning to do go backs or stressing out when your the only person at the register processing transactions but the most enjoyable part is shopping on day off."
good,Working for this company was a challenge for me as i continued work with the months time i've learned something everyday to make my job more enjoyable and helping costumers .the challenge became no more as i thought the hardest job was a peice of cake..I love meeting & helping customers
good,My days at work requires smiling and making sure the customers have a memorable shopping experience. Management are very nice and understanding. I wish that all work environments would be the same. I've learned a lot working customer service and I plan to use all the skills I developed working in customer service.
good,"you don't get benefits unless your full time, the coworkers are ok , not always the best ppl to be around ."
good,"A pretty simple job depending on where they have you in the store. I did almost everything except Stockroom. Most of the time I was Customer Service, I rang people up and processed returns. Nothing was too hard about this job in fact it was pretty steady and stress free. However, if you work customer service you're up there by yourself most of the day. You have a backup cashier but they will not come unless you call them. Otherwise, you're on your own which can be a little stressful if you have a lot of work that needs to get done in your downtime. Management at the time I was working there wasn't the greatest. There were a lot of people neglecting their jobs and playing favorites and that made the transition throughout the day pretty bumpy."
good,I like working there great people and great managers and loved the customers. Rung the customers up and also greeted them and stocked the shelves and did markdowns. Trained new employees.
good,Working in retail is interesting. You learn to deal with all personalities and try to make all customers happy. Being able to get along with all personnel and coworkers make the days go by nice and smooth. Not being able to work full time is the hardest. The environment was comfortable.
good,"I was placed in the company as a Dispatcher, which I had never done before but with the training I received, I truly enjoyed this position."
good,"Working for Ross Dress for Less was fun. I learned how to unload the truck, tag and sensor merchandise, as well as knowing where to put the merchandise after they have been tagged and sensor."
good,A typical day at ROSS. Well for starters if this is your first job you will learn a lot from the ones who have been their for years. The environment is great and their is never a dull moment. ITs fast pace on weekends but slow during the week.
good,Company new to Midwest and still growing!! Gives new managers a chance and will give internal employees advancement.
good,Returned and exchanged any merchandise customers were not satisfied with.
good,"Helped unload and sort the truck, took the merchandise on the floor and stocked it. Greeted customers. Answered any questions. Worked front end. (register and phones)"
good,"It's Fast pace."
good,The management tells you what you are going to do. All day standing up around the store running go backs and doing recovery.
good,It was okay for a part time job. High pace environment. They are a famous retail store.
good,"Fun new merchandise daily, customer excitement was contagious"
good,"Strong compensations and fast paced. Great Compensation and growing rapidly. Opportunity! High Turnover, very structured."
good,its a job not the best job ever but i learned a lot of new things being a front end supervisor and a sales associate
good,Friendly co-workers! Professional busy to relax environment.
good,"The Area Supervisor is a member of the Supervisory Staff who is responsible for a specific, assigned area of the store as well as the general operations and supervision of the store when functioning as the Supervisor on Duty.

good,I had fun working there. It was very fast paced but they worked around my schedule.
good,"In my experience here I learned how security and loss prevention work together to make a safe shopping enviroment for customers.I also learned how to train new associates, be a leader, and have better awareness of my personal surroundings. The co-workers are friendly and trustworthy. There is a very healthy competition amoung the loss prevention officers. Although the job is boring due to the fact that 90% of your shift is standing upfront watching cashiers and greeting customers as they come into the store to shop, the other 10% is spent walking the floor and ensuring customers are not trying to steal. The managent team is pretty consistant and very flexiable and understanding. The training is also very good. For the most part the trainer is consistant and even is you are trained by someone different the information is the same and the job is easy to understand. On the other hand the job only has one full-time LP and 5 Part-timers, who usually average around just 15 hours per week, while the full-timer averages 37-40 hours per week. At $9.25/ an hour I recommend that a person considering this position have a full-time job that comes before this one."
good,meet new people everyday.  People travel for hours to come to ross. Managers and employees are great.
good,"A typical day was to open the store and assign everyone to a department, check on customer's and stock the store.  The hardest part of the job was always trying to please the Manager.  The most enjoyable part was the customer's."
good,"I was 18, worked there. Wasn't bad its a wire company. They give you 40 hours. There's not really any advancement opportunity."
good,Ross provides a comfortable work place where the work load is not extraneous.
good,No information to report on this employer.  It was a job I work hard at everyday
good,"To be productive, to greet and assist each and every customer, co-workers are very pleasant and helpful when needed."
good,I really ejoyed the work place. The store was going through a lot of changing. It was hard to teach co-worker how to work on production. The manager was a good person and I felt like the associates took advantage of her. Everyone was for themselves and no team work.
good,"5 - 1:30"
good,"A typical day would be working the fitting rooms, the sales floor, or the back room."
good,A typical day is very busy. The hardest part of the job is the down time when everything is completed.
good,"face to face with customers. store recovery, flexibily hours..."
good,I have a busy day at work all the time I learned how to multi -tast managing 20 cashier answer phone dealing with customer complaints and making sure customer get what they need.Most enjoyable part of work is telling customer they have to leave the store for bad conduct.
good,A great company to work for. Very family atmosphere oriented.
good,Working at Ross you see many different people come in for the same purpose; To save a buck. Ross has great merchandise for a very reasonable price. The customers were the main focus. In-house management could have been much better but you cannot just judge the whole organization by one store. Communication is key. Without it the workplace is chaos.
good,I helped to unload the truck in the mornings. I process all the freight and put alarms on the necessary items. I help to stock the freight onto the sales floor.
good,"Typical day consists of daily stretches, announcements and finding a good working computer. Next, the supervisor informs you where to begin your day. I've learned how to use Oracle, an RF gun, and other technological instruments needed for the job. Management is great, friendly and always attentive. When paired in groups or more than just me on a bay, co workers are very friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job would be trying to find work when it is extremely slow."
good,"I learned how to schedule, hire, and train all associates.  I learned time management is key to success as well as organization.  The hardest part of my job was leaving it everyday because there was always more stuff to be done.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working close with all associates and being able to train them and be there for them with any issues."
good,"Store Manager of a retail establishment"
good,"Atypical day at work consisted of me coming in in the morning and working the fitting rooms and the register. I learned how to access the register in no time. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of our customers but i always handled the situation with ease, but don't get me wrong i also enjoyed dealing with my customers i learned something new from each and every one of them every day."
good,this company is very busy on an every day schedule. management is always giving us extra stuff to do when a busy time period takes place.
good,"Fast paced, challenged daily. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude individuals, otherwise i enjoyed every aspect of it"
good,"On a typical day I would receive and put out new merchandise. Although not very involved, my manager was great. I adored all of my co workers."
good,"Hardest Part of the day is having to be at work at 5:00AM. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and knowing the other associates. You are cross-trained on all jobs and every week you rotate to a different job so as to not lose the ability to perform that job properly. Also if the shift is short associates, then step up and fill in that job without missing a step or slowing down production."
good,Good for an in between career job. Job is probably best for young adults and college students
good,Only complaint is that Ross does not keep enough staff. The payroll allowed is very low and does not give them managment staff the correct number of people to maintain the stores properly.
good,while employed at ross dress for less i was required to unload merchandise from the truck to the store shelves. i was also require to work at a fast steady pace while helping customers.
good,"im just trying to post my resume so that i can get a job, apparently it wasnt thast great of a place to work because if it were i wouldnt be here trying to find another job"
good,customers can be rude and downright disrespectful but management is decent
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, and the discount, but management isn't very professional."
good,"not my cup of tea."
good,"Very much a company willing to help you grow, but eventually you reach a plateau and almost become stuck there. Downside is the raises are difficult to earn and some hired from outside will be made more than someone promoted from within. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,4 hour work day. co workers very rude. no hard part to the job just a lot of work in 4 hours. cant advance in company. only 25 hours a week. This job is a perfect fit for a High school student that wants extra money.
good,"ross is a great place to get started if you have never had a job, its flexible its reliable and it helps developed your work skills and experience."
good,All my coworkers were friendly and the management was awesome.
good,"The days depend on what time you are working. Some days are slow, but the fast days are blistering. The coworkers and managers were cool because everyone tried to make the best out of the days."
good,"Working for Ross was an interesting experience. It was fun to bag the customer's items and to organize everything, and scan products, but it was just draining my energy everyday. I wouldn't suggest working there unless you're a fashion or business student."
good,"Very fast pace. Great customers, but constant clean up. "
good,"I have managed to upscale my position to one of a supervisor's, enjoying and learning much along the way."
good,"You are over the front end, which consist of cashiers and sales associates you are in charger of making sure they have everything they need to get their job done."
good,"very fast pace environment,i loved to work the computers because they challenged me everyday"

good,"Management was ok, not the best. they let me go before my time was up."
good,Fellow associates were great to work with but the hours especially around holidays were not fun at all.
good,"Fun Workplace, a typical day of works depends a lot on how busy the store was."

good,"Great Employees and Management. "
good,great customer service opportuinities. also great work hours
good,"I enjoyed my time working here. Productive staff, employees and management."

good,mostly did alot of stocking and handling money also greeting customers showing merchandise and selling merchandise
good,"Fun Work"
good,"I usually work 4-6 hours in stock and try to do as much required work as I can. I didn't learn anything at this job but how to handle customers and how to work fast and efficiently. The management is usually nice but a lot of times make a quizzical schedule. All coworkers are super nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job is that a lot of times people call out and we usually have no back up which means it's a lot more work for us and I the pay isn't much just minimum wage, it only increase per year and if you get a promotion."
good,enjoyed fast and friendly customer service and help solve customer's problems.
good,i operated a cash register and checked customers out in  a fast and friendly manner.
good,"typical day taking care of customers needs and wants, learned the fitting room and how it works and the back room, i had good co-workers and met new people, management was good, enjoyed working there, nothing really hard bout the job"
good,I was responsible for managing the daily operations of a Ross store. I learned how to coach and train employees as well as delegate work. The hardest part of the job was further developing experienced employees. The best part of my job was interacting with people in a dynamic environment.

good,a day at work sometimes are easy and then it can be hard i learned how to tolerate different attitudes from customers and associates my managers were very helpful in every situation there was no hard part about my job except stopping thieves from stealing the most enjoyable part was having a good team around like a family
good,"hard and fast.co-workers were good people.management was real nice too,"
good,"On a daily basis I am required to coach other team members on safety topics as well as other rules for the company. Co- workers either know the information or they don't. It is my responisbility to make sure everyone is informed during the time I am on duty. This is an example of the new safety topic. Ladder safety- Be safe while using the ladder, make sure it works properly, and do not use the ladder infront of a door that is not prompt."
good,"Not enough hours, management works with your schedule, co- workers are nice, you get a discount"
good,"na/ not the best employer, management was awful, i wouldnt return"
good,"It was a good job, the management was great, the hours were flexable."
good,I would work with another assistant teacher and it was just a nice fun job. I learned at that job to have patience and how to interact with kids and how to find ways to teach them through fun easy lessons. My manager was very nice and considerate. There was no hard part to this job it was just nice and fun. The most enjoyable part was to be around the kids and just to interact with them everyday.
good,"A typical day at work I would go in speak to my employees and managers. I always made it to work 15 minutes before I had to clock-in just so I can get a head start on Counting the Inventory and seeing If I have everything I need. I would take out all of the trash and then I would unload the delivery truck, unpack boxes, run the product to the floor, and Stock the items on the shelves. I learned something good everyday. My coworkers and managers were all great people, everyone seems to get along with one another perfectly. The hardest part of the job was when three or four delivery trucks would come and I would have to unload all of the trucks at a fast pace. The most part of the job I enjoyed was when it was slow and I was all caught up on my work I would go help my other employees if they needed help. I enjoyed being on the floor to help."
good,"Confer with customers, explained products, participated in all locations of the store to help meet store goal and deadlines."
good,"I learn a lot of the retail industry. The hardest part of this job was closing, not enough employ to clean departments."
good,"Co-workers are great to work with, fun job. Not enough hours."
good,"Arrive at Ross about an hour and a half before my shift starts, I liked to be prepared and set up for my associates before they get in. The job it self is not difficult, just the hours a difficult as i no longer have a home life but for the weekends. I think the challenges are my most enjoyable part of the job. It seems to keep me on my toes and my days fly by."
good,Working at Ross is all about speed and production. In order to make production you have to work at a very high speed
good,Very low pay for all the work that needed to be done. Overall fun place to work at.
good,easy enough to get along with people but the pay leaves a lot to be desired.
good,Friendly and helpful Co-workers. Manangers always available to help. A typical day at work was fast paced and busy. Hardest part of the job was focusing on one task when there was so many things to do. Most enjoyable part of the job was the overall enviroment.
good,"Nice set schedule Mon-Fri, 10:30-6:30 daily tasks usually the same. Co-workers probably the most enjoyable part of the job and with employees coming and going you get to meet a lot of different people. Couple of things I've learned is that change is inevitable and how to deal with difficult situations involving customers. The hardest part of the job would be the workload and outrageous expectancies. Also, management is constanely changing."
good,i liked the hours they give us but the pay is nothing; the labor is tough and the production has to accurate. its an ok job.
good,"Organize shelves and do inventory in the stock room. I learned team work. Management wasn't helpful, the co-workers trained each other. Hardest part was cleaning the fitting rooms and the best part was organizing areas of the store."
good,"Great benefits, terrible pay rate, good advancement, management not too bad..."

good,"Ross is an organized work place.  They have statistics for job performance and standards.  They have high expectations for management and associates.  Ross is a highly diversified work place.  The hardest part of the job is learning all of the standard methods and procedures for each job function.  They have a predetermined way of dealing with issues as they arise.  Ross is associate relations minded, and try to maintain a low turn over rate for temporary associates.  The most enjoyable part of the supervisors job is to assist a new hire in their job functions, and watch them become high achievers.  Associates and management receive bonus incentives for high work performances, which motivates it's work force."
good,stand guard at store routine checks and ensure safety of customers and employees
good,"The management team were never on the same accord, therefore the rules were always mixed up and misunderstood"

good,Works around students schedules and the overall work environment was great. Had a great time their.
good,"fun and fast paced working environment."
good,great first job. Very easy to understand what is expected. Cash Register and Fitting Room are the best places to work in the store. Gets boring and repetitive after awhile

good,The most enjoyable part of the job was creating relationships with your colleagues and clients. You were able to learn a lot about the business because of job rotation.
good,It wasn't to bad of a place. You could move on up and learn different things if you wanted. They took the time to train people right. I enjoyed working there.
good,good store if you want a part time job while your in school. Good if you are under 18.
good,I interact with customers and assist them with their needs. I provide great customer service.
good,"Great people to work with, although a little bit hectic. I did schedules and made sure any company directions were executed in the store level. Budgeting and sales forecasting was also part of the job. The best part of the job is developing associates to get ready for their assessments and get them promoted to the next level of management."
good,poor management with unreasonable expectations and limited advancement opportunities
good,A typical day at Ross included a lot of costumer interaction with a lot of movement through out the store.I learned to do back room for the first time which includes unpacking truck loads and preparing them for display in the store. My co-workers were a lively bunch always on the move but always knew how to have fun. The hardest part I would say was trying to keep the store clean at all times in such a busy store. The most enjoyable was being able to supervise and guide a great group of people.
good,"A typical day at work would be, assisting customers in the fitting room and giving fitting room tickets and organizing clothing, I learned how to organize clothing by size and brand. co-workers were very friendly. the hard part was at times organizing clothing, I enjoyed working with clothes."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the new merchandise.
good,"I learned patience working in the fitting room, making decisions. I also learned to work with a younger group of co-workers. The hardest part of working at Ross were the changing hours every week."

good,Working for Ross was a very fun experience. My managers were amazing and fun to be around. My co-workers were also fun to be around. everyone would talk to each other and laugh and always had a good time while working.
good,"I enjoyed working at the Ross store I worked at, but it was neato."
good,I recieved employee of the month for my good deeds as an employee.
good,"Little hours. there is alot of rules in this job There are stuff you cannot do. So really, there isnt much to do just memorize alot of stuff and report writing."
good,not a good place for stability but a relaxed place to work for a side job.
good,Ok place to work and cool people. The hardest part of the job is working on the weekend.
good,I went into work with a smile on my face and left with a smile on my face simply because I love knowing that I helped a customer go home happy. The hardest part bout the job was to dealing with angry customers who just refuse to understand the situation that was at hands. While working at ross I learn to be more hands on with people.
good,Its your typical cashier/retail position. Doesn't pay very well and not a lot of opportunity to advance. I recommend this company for people who are seeking first time employment. Great for the high school/college kid looking for extra money.
good,"Unload a truck, sort out product, management was good, co-workers were nice, hardest part of job was to much stuff. I enjoyed the meeting new people."
good,"Retail store always busy, I work with a diverse culture. It is fun to work with different people. I'm there to protect the merchandise as well as the associates and customers. I enjoy working with people and helping customers and/or associates. The hardest part is observing the whole store when it is real busy. Have to keep watch on the cashiers, customers, and look for any theft indicators or suspicious activity.Overall it's a good place to work and I enjoy my position."
good,"Working at Ross was not the best experience. Constantly busy with too many expected tasks for little pay. There are not a variety of job promotion opportunities available. Management is flexible with your schedule, however shifts were only four hours long. Constant employee turnovers, resulting in short notice call ins. To add onto that, the store is always a hectic mess and customers are impatient and rude."
good,The lines are always long which makes the day go by fast. But the down side is how messy the store gets.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of entering timesheets information into data base amongst 4 clerks according to departments, running production, importing production, reviewing for accuracy, saving reports daily and weekly. Communicating throughout the day when a department is finished, had problems with, etc. Performing payroll weekly. Assisting management with adjustments, errors, missing timesheets, etc. Hardest part of the job is keeping records up to date when supervisors turn in so many late timesheets daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly employee atmosphere."
good,Its an okay place to work but I wouldn't recommended it for everyone. All thou the people and employee you work with are great to work with and make going to work a enjoyable time. while I was working there I always felt they were understaffed when it came to getting all the responsibilities done.
good,This job taught me a lot and gave me opportunities to move up.  I enjoyed working with the customers.
good,"stocking, front end cashier as well as delivering excellent customer service, not much room for advancement nut management was very polite.. i love interacting with the customers"
good,great first start or job while in school. Flexible schedules

good,"University of North Florida                 Jacksonville, FL                       Junior year completed"
good,"It was a ok place to work the people for the most part were fun, just had some minor issues with management but who doesnt."
good,the only reason i was excited to go into work was to see my coworkers other than that it sucked
good,It was very good pay for a single parent. i enjoyed the hours. they just didn't work well with family issues or anything that didn't have to do with the business.
good,It is fast-paced work place. Company is big national chain store. The company sells many merchandises at low-cost.  Management personals are great to work with.
good,"At Ross it was a great experience, I learn a lot over commercial store. Working with a lot of employees has its positives and negatives. Working with  large amount of peoples too has its positives and negatives. I learned to keep a optimistic. It is for the best to have a positive attitude, the day goes by smoother, I am able to help customers better, and my positive feed gives great feed-back."
good,I work with Ross distribution center and I get 40hours a week. I have worked and trained all around the warehouse and it is time for me to advance to something new that will connect with my educational goals.
good,Always up beat mood at work. Learned how to manage tasks within a work shift. Co-workers were always friendly. The hardest part of the job were the holiday rushes. Enojyable part of the job where the fundraisers we had against other stores within our region.
good,"On a typical work day, I come and find what section I'm in, I go to that section and recover as well as fix whatever part has been shopped hard. If needed, I go to the register for back-up if the lines get long. That's pretty much the entire day once we close I do what I call a hard recovery which is detail cleaning the entire section until management is finish counting down and closing registers."
good,"If you like clothes and the discounts for them, this is a good place to work. "
good,Usually dead in the mornings afternoon comes gets busy managers are all not on the same page some more than others workers are fine to work with just the he/ she said problems 
good,"Ross has a great atmosphere of customers. Everyone is always smiling. Here I learned to markdown merchandise, tag and hang clothing. The hardest part was unloading trucks in the heat. Although, I did enjoy seeing all the latest styles."
good,Late start at night. Time would go fast. The task where always different but keeps you busy. Good people work there. Management was neutral to everyone.
good,"I gained a lot of experience in the warehouse environment,  i enjoyed working at this company ."
good,"Meeting new people was nice, Management was nice. It was a fun environment."
good,I come to work and scan all the products that need to be scanned in the different departments. If prices change then i change the tags. Co-workers were not to friendly in the other departments.
good,"Help customers with whatever they need, clean the store, help at the cash register. Managers were always teaching us need things and technique to bring more customers. Hardest part was not having enough hours. Best part was that I worked in the morning."
good,"I have been with Ross since October 25th of 2012 and a lot has happened between then and now i started out having a set schedule until about february when the manager left to start a new store at a different location since then the store has been going up and down here and there and my hours dont add up to my bills its hard to find a second job and provide for my family......i just want to find a better 2nd job and still hold on to this one if i can if not i will let it go......a typical day at work for me are mondays i do markdowns and or i come in and do the fitting room im rarely ever a cashier but other than that i feel that i have mastered all the pros and cons of those 3 workforces"
good,There was never a lack of anything to do. A typical day was working on the register about 60%b percent of the time and the rest on the floor making everything neat.
good,"While overall the people working for the individual stores or a pleasure to be around, the company appears to lack any real direction. Almost seeming lost."
good,"A typical day of work at Ross for me would be running a cash register and a lot of customer service. It would also include doing returns and maintaining a tidy work space. "
good,I learned how to run a fitting room.  Management is good they are always there to give some help if needed.  The same for the co-workers. Looking out for theft in the store.  The customers.
good,"Friendly workplace, would help costumers with returns and questions."
good," Floor cleanup along with customer service. Duties included answering questions that customers had, "
good,"the day starts off with receving the merchandise and then putting it onto the sales floor, but most nights there isnt enough co-workers to help with the truck, so it is pretty hard to put the merchandise out when there isnt any help."
good,This is a fast paced and high energy business. I did enjoy working here. 
good,Working for Ross Department stores was a very hands on company that allowed for their managers to have input in their individual stores and customer base. It taught me how to become a self starter and how to best motivate employees to do the same.
good,The job is a great place to work. It is more set up for a first time job.
good,Whats a lot for just little pay. My co-worker were great to work with. You meet lots of good people.
good,"I got the job thinking that I would be working at least 40 hours a week, since they told me to expect a lot of overtime. I have been called off work nearly every week I have been there."
good,a typical day involved putting clothes out on the sales floor maintain the fitting room and greet customers
good,"Fast pace customer service store, lots of interaction with customers and stock and cleaning of store."
good,"Like most retail places, they start you off at minimum pay. If you're fortunate to get a consistent schedule, then you're lucky. Aside from management, the only consistent schedules are for the stock team. In stock, you're expected to move at a very rapid pace. You help unload the trucks while sorting the merchandise into the appropriate bins and carts. During this time, you are subject to many injuries including cuts, scrapes, pokes and bruises. You're so rushed to get through each box that you dive your hand inside only to crash into some broken glass, for example. The management is awful. The assistant manager and area supervisors are good for absolutely nothing. In our store, at any given time you can see them talking (usually non-business related), laughing together or texting on their phones. Totally inappropriate. If we need help, forget it. Look elsewhere, because they won't help in the stock room. The store manager however is not like that. He does his best to help whenever he can. The other ones evidently are too above that. Corporate has concerns with the most trivial things yet overlooks more important issues! Totally not worth the headache! The people that work there are mostly a great bunch. Friendly and welcoming. This is a nice place to work for a little (and I stress LITTLE) extra income or if you want something to occupy your time. The discount is nice, 20% everyday and 40% three times a year. I would strongly advise looking elsewhere if you want to look for a career."
good,I enjoyed working for Ross. The management was helpful and the employees were easy to have a team attitude and get the job done.
good,I come in take a routine walk aroung the store the check-in with the on duty sps then relieve them of there duty. i learned that never to underestimate someone. management there was okay a little loose but sharpe as a knife i loved my co-workers they was the best fast and reliable. The hardest part of my job was standing 9 hours straight in dress shoes. But i really enjoyed meeting new people that was my most enjoyable part of my job to me .
good,It was easy work but hard to make production. Easy to keep up.
good,"Advancements within Ross Dress for Less are not difficult. The company does provide all the tools necessary for advancement as long as an associate chooses to take the step. I was promoted twice within four months with help from my management and advice from coworkers. The work is challenging, as Ross does have high standards. I learned to be results driven and how to adapt to an ever-changing work culture. Also Ross gave me the chance to work with several different personalities. In hindsight, I appreciate the exposure to different groups of people. I have learned how to exercise customer service and team management in different ways. The hardest part of working with Ross Dress for less was adjusting to the different work cultures and cultures of different people. I did enjoy being able to work with management to work toward one common goal of loss prevention."
good,For the most part people were fun to work with. A great place of employment if you're truly interested in retail/sales positions.
good,I love assisting customers with their shopping experience.
good,great second job if you have the time. but definitely not a primary job.
good,Providing proper care of infant and toddlers was wonderful I deal with my co workers on a professional level. The hardest part of my job is to see a child being neglected by there guardians. Ther is 0 tolerance for that!
good,Fast paced environment that offers good benefits. The employees are fun to work with. Never limit yourself because in this environment you can excel and advance to an higher level.
good,"I've worked at Ross for almost two years and the only thing I've grown to love is some of my fellow work mates and my customers. Now a day at Ross spells hectic but I've got excitement for the fast pace so I love it. As far as management, I think all the managers should be fired and the search for new ones should begin. The managers show favoritism and are very unethical and make it hard for you to work your way up the ladder in the retail world. If it wasn't for the babies, wonderful people, and my favorite customers, i'd quit a long time ago."
good,"This place is just ok to work at, but I would prefer a IT related job related to my B.S. degree."
good,"A typical day at work would involve remerchandising of the apparel pad followed by complete sizing and flexing. i learned that you have to have alot of patience to work in retail. The management staff was very hands on with all projects in the store as well as helping out when needed in the stock room. My co-workers were a pleasure to work with, they were very hard workers who got the job done. The hardest part of the job was having that one difficult customer who just wouldnt let up, even after we had fixed his/her issue and given that person a discount on their purchase. The most enjoyable part was getting to work with my co-workers as well as receiving a generous discount."
good,Starting position was a Unit ID and what I did was create descriptions and prices for the tickets for the merchandise that was being received in this distribution center. I pays to be creative
good,"temp job, difficult with highschool, owners are friendly, and willing to work around school hours"
good,"Greeting customers, providing assistance, and deterring theft were core responsibilities. Learned how to anticipate needs of customers, and how to spot potential theft indicators. Management was awesome, along with co-workers. Difficult to confront shoplifters, but felt awesome deterring theft."
good,"Was a good job, a lot of recovery and busy through out the day during holidays. Was only a seasonal position so I was not there for long, but the co-workers were all great to work with."
good,"The Ross store that I worked at was always busy. start of shift consisted of trying to straighten up a section of store that you were assigned to, making sure drawer balanced before you start. If I was on the register, it was trying to ring up, bag and cash out each transaction efficiently and accurately. after shift was done cash out and then everyone was assigned a section of the enormous store to straighten before the next day. Hardest part of the job was keeping it clean and organized while customers just tossed items all over. Most of the people that I worked with were nice. Most enjoyable part of the job was making large sales."
good,The main focus at Ross was getting the merchandise to the sales floor and presenting it in a shopper-friendly atmosphere. Associates greet each and every customer and assist management in maintaining merchandise standards.
good,"It's an easy job overall. The hardest thing to do is stock because you have 15 minutes per hummer. Fitting Room is by far the easiest and sometimes very boring,all you do is take clothes from the customers and hang them up."
good,"I had a lot of fun working there, a typical work day involved being on both the cash register and out in the store helping customers. I was given a few days training when I first started, and afterwards I learned from experience. The store manager was very supportive as were many of my co-workers and many helped me to figure out some of the more harder tasks. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember where certain items were that weren't clothing. The most enjoyable part was probably just being out in the store putting things away and helping customers."
good,"A typical day at work involves overseeing the markdown team, receiving freight and managing the store. Also, maintaining smooth running of the store, and logging call in and tardies. I have definitely learned how to work with people that are not used to change. With this being a company that is always making changes to better itself, this explains why there may be somewhat of a higher turnover rate within this company. The hardest part of the job would be trying to mold the people in retail to adapt to the change in order to have longevity and promoting from within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting many people throughout the time that I have been employed with Ross."
good,It's a job. You have the ability to move up in the company but the pay and the amount of work you put in aren't worth the stress.
good,"This was a seasonal position, and it was just that. There is a lot of Drama among the employees, and I would not have been able to handle it more than just a season."
good,A typical day at work was always busy.
good,"It was a fun place to work, but upper management didn't evaluate properly."
good,"A typical day working at Ross for me would be a closing shift. I usually work evenings/nights in the fitting room then move to a specific department to recover once the store is closed. There's usually two people, myself included, in the fitting room during the weekends because it gets extremely busy and one person wouldn't be enough to keep the fitting room organized, safe and run the racks. During the week I usually run and close the fitting room alone and when I need a rack to be run, I call the MOD to hold my place in the fit. room while I run it since the associates on the floor need to get a head start on recovering the flood. After the store closes and I run all my racks, I help with either recovering or go backs. The most important thing I learned is how to be fast. I recognize items and know their exact spot by just looking at them, not the tag. I learned how to be patient with customers as well as with new coworkers. Many times I train new employees on the fitting room and soft lines and not all of them are easily trained, which I think is the hardest part of my job. On the other hand, I enjoy constantly moving and making small talks with customers. The managers and the rest of the team are outgoing and understanding."
good,"Fun, fast paced environment that constantly needs to be kept up."
good,"While working for Ross, I have learned self-confidence. I have learned to multi-task and easily learned how to do all the skills that Ross had to offer me. There was no such thing as a typical day at Ross. Different things happened on different days. Since I picked up every skill Ross had to offer, some days I would work in the cash office and then on the register, and some days I would be a store protection specialist making sure everything was going smoothly. The hardest part of the job for me was wanting to please everyone and I learned that I couldn't. Not everyone can be pleased. There will be some days when customers aren't happy with what you tell them and you can't let it get to you. The most enjoyable part to me was getting to know different people. I got to open another Ross in Wichita, KS and I grew up when I did. Ross isn't afraid to send it's people to other places if they want to go."
good,"Constantly handling large amounts of cash, counting tills for thirteen registers and preparing deposits. Set up cash for each till. Balance safe, tracking all shortages and overages. Assist and direct up to five employees and trusted with Front-end Supervision duties. Advise and direct floor operation from unloading stock to markdowns."
good,"Typical day, come in head to the back lock up my personals. Then dash out to my register. Depending on how busy we were once I jumped on the register there was no guarantee to when I would catch a break. I learned to be fast and friendly. Once your customer steps to you regardless of their demeanor facial expression or attitude ALWAYS SPEAK POLITELY. You never know whats going on with someone. My managers there were exceptional. I had amazing co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to keep the store clean and lines moving in a timely manner during rush hour."
good,Very great opportunity to express your great customer service skills.
good,"didn't work there long enough to be able to write a review. i only worked there for a month or two. the manager that worked there at the time i was, was decent. he listened to his employees and tried to help them as best as he could."
good,"working here was unstable, people were untrustworthy, and things were never really good. I didnt get paid enough"
good,"The day goes by so fast, your constantly busy which I like. I did learn that sometimes no matter how nice you are, some people are not going to be kind in return. The only thing you can do in return..Is to keep smiling. To do anything else just makes your day twice as long and you look bad. Opening the store and starting a new day is the best. The worst, looking around a ross at the end of the day and seeing the mess people make."
good,Ross is an okay place to work. The stockroom is a fast-paced area to work in. It's hard back there and really hot. I have learned the value of teamwork.
good,My first security job i learned to be more observant of my surroundings
good,"A typical day at work for me includes processing new freight and running it to the sales floor. Some days the trucks are very small, other days they are very large and it can be tough trying to get it all done with limited employees and a small, cramped stockroom."
good,Advancement is a given if you let management know you want to climb the latter. But compensation for your efforts are very small.
good,Ross is a growing company with a good business plan. It is going through some internal changes so that it can keep its business model fresh and relevant to its current market.
good,For the most part I liked working at Ross. You can get a little positive from any experience because you can learn from it. I provided excellent customer service.
good,Great products and deals but lacks organization. Overall good company to work for.
good,Typical work day was getting all projuects done and delegating out to associates. Management was fair and hard working.
good,"Working at Ross was a great place to work, I worked 40-45 hours a week, I enjoyed learning the different area's of my job as in Processing payroll, planning weekly schedules, shipping and recieving merchandise, couching and developing new and old associates, and accounting. It made become a more experience manager. My associates and management team was like a family to me.The hardest part of my job was having to leave my Ross family behind, do to my father becoming ill, I had to care for him.."
good,i was just a year but i did like it . i worked in the receiving dept where we unloaded trucks and processed the freight
good,"Enjoyed working at Ross as my first job, also enjoyed making the friendships with fellow co-workers."
good,"Everyday you learn new things as to how to accomodate customers needs, meeting their needs is the most enjoyable part of the job. Preventing the company any loss is the hardest part due to their policies; however, the management is very good and makes everything easier."
good,"The Company as a whole was okay to work with. The branch that I worked for had one manager working in the store when there was supposed to be four managers at all times. It was a very unorganized store, with products just thrown everywhere on the shelves and hanging racks. I worked in the back for awhile and had a set schedule but when I asked to switch to being a cashier at the front, due to a needed schedule change, the manager told me that was fine. When I started I was on a set schedule Monday through Friday, but when I changed my position to work a different schedule, I was not put on a schedule. I had to call the manager everyday to ask if I would be working that day. It went on for three weeks, with me having to call everyday to see if I was working. After three weeks of still not being put on the employee schedule I left."
good,Working on the floor separating colthes and assisting customers
good,Nice store.. fast learning.. meeting new people... differnt experince.. new crowd
good,"Managers are ""bogged down"" covering for hourly workers who don't come to work & customers feel ""entitled"" when they shop there. Managers change so frequently the employees can't build a repoire."
good,"At first i loved working at ross they were sweet & kind. Then they just started taking advantage of me. And the hours were horrible, 12$ an hour is great an all but only if you have the hours to work. I was always scheduled 7:30 am - 2 pm but most days got off at 10/11 am."
good,They were very flexible with my schedule due to the fact i was in school. The pay could've been better because they had me working multiple positions at once. They never denied time off and never scheduled anyone to work on their birthday.
good,"For part time associates the schedule is very flexible. Makes it very easy for people with multiple jobs or students. They offer some benefits to part time. Store managers are required to work 5 ten hour shifts per week. Many weeks it can be more. This makes it difficult to have a life/work balance, however the pay was great."
good,This job was okay I mostly worked for the first 3 years if college... it was minimum wage so you can’t really complain too much they didn’t have hard work to do
good,"Good bunch of people to work with, great pay, convenient location.  Flexible hours and great discounts.  Most managers helpful.  Most staff decent to work with."
good,"Loved working here just feel like I wasn’t getting paid fair, I would bust my butt for minimum and never got a raise in a whole year, by the way this was at Ross distribution center in shafter."
good,"It was very fun to work there, everyone made you feel included. There is always work to be done so there is never a down time really. You are constantly moving and on your feet. Everyone works together and the stock manager i had at the time was excellent and always went out of her way to help and get things done. Most enjoyable part was the people you got to meet while working there"
good,When you first start it will seem a little difficult and confusing the things you need to do are important but the way you need to do them and the time limit on them are strange. you'll get through them though and usually get the timing down perfectly. until someone leaves or a new manger works with you then everything goes in the dumpster. you won't always have enough of what you need and during Christmas you'll get more stock than you have room to put out. but hey at least they sometimes will buy food for the breakroom.
good,"Store manager comes as goes as pleases, store reflection is given to the store manager but not the accomadating staff. Overall the company is good, offers alot of benefits. The structure system is lacking and the turn around rate is unreal."
good,Working at Ross distribution center was challenging giving the ratio of English speaking to Spanish speaking individuals. Even more challenges with the work loads from week to week.
good,A lot of walking good exercise and time went by so fast got paid weekly so that helped manage my money better the only thing bad I could say is that I didn’t make enough money
good,"The company it’s good but the service and the manager have  to get better in customer service and management, the quantity of what you have to do  it’s a little much for one persone. The pay it’s good and the discount are great."
good,Ross is a great place to work that is very flexible with your schedule. The management is sometimes not good at remembering your requests. My coworkers and the benefits I get are really what made the job worth it.
good,"use the RF scanner, release boxes to assigned destination. The management was okay, the workplace was like a high school, there was not really anything hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping others."
good,"You learn a lot about running a business but you are definitely overworked. So many expectations and not enough recognition from corporate. They never give you enough payroll so you're always struggling especially when people call out, it just adds stress on the entire team.You never have a set schedule which means you basically have no social life. They always try to promote the importance of SAFETY but they extend their closing  hours every year until 1am which means you have homeless and intoxicated/drugged people to deal with at the end of the night."
good,"Ross was a  fast paced job. Sometimes it was hard to keep up with the cleanliness with the volume of customers. My nights would go by fast. The managers wanted to make me a supervisor for a 50 cent raise. I was making a little more than minimum wage, and didnt feel like a 50 cent raise was right. I went on maternity leave and never went back"
good,For being my first job I say it was okay but I did have a difficult time with some of my managers. A lot of favoritism but the pay was pretty good. It’s easy but it comes with some challenges like the customers for example a lot of them felt entitled.
good,Its ok team is good but moving up in company is not easy. They pay u less and make you work harder than they are willing to give in pay.  It is a challenge to move up
good,"For the position that I am currently in, it's not that all productive. It's a very easy position. Some days were good, some were very slow. Not a very high paced work environment."
good,"The pace was really fast but yet manageable. I’m use to the fast pace environment and working under pressure. It was a fun experience, I had so much fun learning new things."
good,"If you have issues being on your feet don't take this job... you will be walking and bending a lot! I took this job when i was in collage and it was perfect because they are willing to work around your schedule. If you work hard with this company they will promote within. I was promoted once and promoted agin but I did not take the last promotion. "
good,Had an constant steady going work environment and always busy always something to be done through out my whole shift. Was good at my performance as a leader over the stockroom I had certain job duties to accomplish everyday and everyday was different duties
good,"Doesn’t give many hours weekly, all employees are only part time with the exception of management. No consequences for managements actions, very little training provided when first starting, very little access to management outside of the store, lots of rude customers."
good,"Enjoy working at ross..it is fast paced and.busy. customers are happy to find such great prices!"
good,I like working at ross because of the people I work with mostly. It isn’t too hard of a job and the hours are flexible. The managers are understanding about if you need time off and are always helpful.
good,It wasn’t bad working for Ross. I would like to have had been compensated a little more for part-time work. A bit more pay. A bit more hours. Benefits for all employees would be nice whether full time or part time.
good,"Pays less than other companies, work more than your pay grade."
good,I learned alot from this company in regards if my job position. I have had great experience but I do think lake if hours have been the only issue I have had with this company and in order to get those hours I would have to move up to a higher level of management that I don't see happing in the near future
good,"Ross is busy and fast paced, and requires you to be energetic through entire shift.  There was a lot to learn and I accomplished a lot during my tenure.  It was fun and associates were often times hardworking and managers were dedicated to completing assignments and tasks"
good,They did not work well with the employee at all. They employee turnover rate is due to the schedule. If your work hours make it to 20 you may be cut  back on hours.
good,"It's nothing to write home about in the job itself. But there is room for advancement."
good,The manager was rude. I would regularly get mixed direction from different points of authority. I had a hard time getting anything finished because i was always being sent elsewhere.
good,"i had a hard time understanding the directions I was given because they were at most times, different from the video instructions you receive when you first start employment. All other aspects of the workplace were enjoyable and we had very friendly co-workers."
good,"it's a fast paced job, everybody is friendly and helpful. the hard part is remembering where everything is and keeping the store organized. the employees and the fun little activities offered is wonderful. its happy and very upbeat, which helps get the fast paced work done"
good,"I was at Ross for the better part of a decade and have had to withstand quite a few changes to my direct management. I have had wonderful managers, but I have had even more terrible managers. Like, really really terrible managers. The kind of managers who do not embody their own expectations for their direct reports."
good,For a first job Ross was a great working experience. They work great with your schedule. I was going to college and working part-time. It was hectic during Holiday Seasons but what isn't during that time.
good,Ross is a great company to gain experience and utilize as a step stone to your career whether in or through other company. Personal concepts of competencies skills and management skills
good,I liked working here. The discounts were great and the work was really easy. There isn’t much bad to say about the store and work; it was the customers that were the most difficult part
good,"Ross is a solid company with excellent benefit packages. I would recommend individuals to review opportunities within Ross Stores."
good,"it was fun working with all the people there. they do help you when you don't know what to do, the team work is one of the best. and the front line do help a lot too."
good,"So depending on which Ross and your job title, it can be different."
good,This is a great job. Depending on what shift you work. Most of the time the store is always filled with customers and a long checkout line. Management is great and easy to get along with.
good,It was an ok job it paid the bills sometimes we get a 40% discount on close i didn't care too much for the supervisors or managers because they didn't are for us
good,I learned a lot with customer service. How customers react when they cant find their item. Around holidays when people's emotions are high. Multitasking from the going from the dressing room to cashier to help people get the jewelry they want.
good,I think it is a fun part time job but it is very difficult to get full time opportunities. I enjoy working there but it is difficult to get hours because they are always hiring people.
good,I honestly liked Ross but sometimes the managers could be a handful and the amount of work you would have to do alone was overwhelming but other then that it was a good job .
good,"My associates were some of the best friendships I've ever made."
good,I had my mix of good management and bad. They had very unrealistic expectations of buyers. There is way too many layer of management which made things difficult to ever get finished.
good,"Only worked at Ross for a full week before I turned in my name tag and said, “I’m done.”"
good,"I loved working at ross for the 8 months I was there. The only issue being that it was all girls and all drama, and the management of my store didn’t do so well at making sure everyone was acknowledged. I’d say with the right manager it’d be an amazing place to work"
good,"Not Scheduling enough people to work. Unorganized, customers are opening merchandise. Overall it is an amazing place to work because of the friendliness of fellow employees."
good,"Should let people have a chance, paid vacation and some great paid sick days but you get point for it and some great place to work and good wages but some place ain’t the one you want to work in...."
good,"Se trabaja por producción, rapidez, etc. Por lo regular no dan mucha s horas."
good,"Working for Ross Dress for Less was more or less a good job, with some good and friendly employees, and a pleasant atmosphere. The only downside was the little room for advancement. I was lucky if I could get 16 hours a week, and there seemed like no possibility of advancing to a full time position."
good,The lead manager of the stock room is not nice but the new manager of the store is great along with the new assistant manager. The stockroom lead is very unprofessional and mean. Rude to mostly everybody if your not her favorite. She basically shows how she really feels about you rather than keeling it professional at all times. It's crazy and makes working very uncomfortable. Overall the job is easy and most of the people there are nice. The the manager is nice and so is the assistant manager.
good,"Ross is very good with in house promotion, very easily to get promoted as long as you’re interested and can do your job with very little management. So far as pay they suck, you do way too much work for so little pay. They want you to remember an entire book worth of information. Although I did hear they are going up on pay but still not enough for me personally."
good,"- Sometimes there would be fast days, some would be slow"
good,"I'll keep this short. I worked at Ross for a bit over 4 years. In that time, there were 2 complete management changes, 3 different store managers (with a 4th new store manager coming in the day after I left), and a parade of ASMs and supervisors. New managers were nearly always from outside the store. This is clue #1 of Ross' issues."
good,A fast paced environment that will teach you the skills you need in customer service. Hours are very flexible except if you work in the stock room. Discounts are available. 20% every day and every 4 months you get 40% discount for employee appreciation week.
good,"The pay was alright and the benefits were minimal.  I am personally not a fan of retail. The fast paced environment and dealing with a multitude of customers who often spoke different languages was a little irritating. However, if you're okay with retail the job is not so bad. They often need workers and hire relatively quickly."
good,"If you have a family and bills you would need to work this job plus pick up another job to be a financially stable, only if you are part time but I have also seen full time associates struggle with Ross pay"
good,"Went there for my first day of training only trained for 3 hrs and they through me on the register. You only train for 1 day and they expect you to know the register as well as all the unnecessary stuff Ross do. I would not recommend this job its like a fast food restaurant.You are timed on the register,the employees can be rude at times and they're always serious!"
good,"The work place was very friendly and peaceful to work in each day, that's why ill perfer anyone to work there on any given day. It was just a quick job for me that's all."
good,"i wasn't working in the store i was actually in the warehouse, but was a nice place to work, very fast pace during the holidays, decent pay but i was only part time"
good,"Ross Dress for Less is a very fast-paced job. This job requires a lot of recovery after customers, late working hours, and long standing times. The job required long shifts due to completion of recovery before leaving."
good,"I worked my way up from a stock clerk and was able to learn almost every area of the store within a relatively short amount of time. They strive for a culture of recognition, and it can be a lot of fun interacting with your regular customers."
good,The store i worked at was friendly. Management was nice and supportive. Training was done well and everyone was willing to help out one another to get tasks done.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Ross solely because of my co-workers and management team. The company itself is very flawed. There are so many contradictions I can’t go over all of them. The sales floor/cashier position is relatively easy but be prepared to deal with frustrated customers and theft every shift.  There have been many times I was stuck at the front desk with no back up and a line full of angry customers wondering why I’m not calling anyone. Overall, if you can get along with your co workers and have deep wells of patience  it’s a chill job."
good,"My time working at Ross was ok. I did learn a lot in this position, learning VBA for Excel report automation and how the retail industry allocates product to stores. "
good,"management is very helpful and understanding other team members are curtious and always have a smile for the customer, the hardest part of the job i believe was the rehanging of the merchandise. its a typical retail customer service position."
good,"Communication was really poor between teams and made it difficult to find out how to achieve process correctly. However, I did learn a lot of valuable skills with the company, and they did try to develop me as a team member, but this is very rare and achieving promotion is based around luck more than personal skill."
good,"Clean and organize the store just for customers to come and terrorize it. There are 50/50 percents of pros and cons at any ross. Either it has to do with customers, management or advancement."
good,"very busy"
good,Ross has advancement opportunities but the pay scale is very low. If you are looking for somewhere to get retail experience and management it is a good place to work. They do have a high turn over and management could be better.
good,This was a good over all company. It was a dead end job because everyone who was in upper management wasnt going no where. The pay was decent not enough I like the job just wish it was better pay.
good,I think that Ross Corporate is a good company to work for and be employed. My department has good work life balance and Ross Corporate is very supportive of their associates.
good,A typical day at work there is like managing a zoo.  Customers are hateful to the associates which in turn causes the associates to react.  Making your job a battlefield.  When you attempt to reach out to support factors on anything it gets deferred to someone else.
good,"Associates are awesome people to work with. Some of the management can use some work. But over all a good place to work, you meet new people and learn to be patient with not so easy customers."
good,I've seen many grow with this company and they often hire within which is great for a motivating culture & work environment. There is a lot of management so there is often lots off hands on help available
good,Just know if you close they tell you to leave at that time you can’t leave till everything is done. You can go home but it don’t look good if you work a place and everyone is working to leave and you get your things to leave.
good,This job is extremely fast pace and they expect you to be efficient on your own. The job consists of keeping the store clean and maintained. You also have to make sure you're reaching sale goals and you are reaching personal goals daily. You also have to make sure the store is set to store guidelines.
good,I loved working at Ross but did work there for 7 years p/t only one position that i applied for witch was the position i was in for 3 years customer service cashier supervisor i did work on the sales floor for 4 years and also the fitting room.
good,"It’s a faced place to be, always something new to learn, people would always try to get a bigger discount than what’s already applied, had to clean up certain accidents which was very sad for the person who found it."
good,"They work with you about your availability, I was in school manager always ask me how many hrs and days i was available for work very nice enviroment,and also co workers."
good,"A typical day consisted of printing reports, distributing to the appropriate supervisor. Scheduling meetings, expense reports.  "
good,"A typical day at work would be covering other shifts for the ones who calls out or just doesn't call or show up to work. I've learned how to work a cashier and in the stock room. I enjoyed working there, the employees were friendly and easy to get along with."
good,It was a good place to work .people are very nice possibility to move up if u want loved working and meeting new people every day. Upper management was nice
good,Good place great discounts. Some management wS drama fun job always something to do. Fun to see new items. Could use a little work in organizing chain of command
good,Ross is a chill place to work. Stock has to unload a truck just about every morning. Heavy lifting is a requirement as well as cash handling as a cashier/stocker.
good,This is a good first job. It was my first but outside of that I wouldn't suggest getting comfortable. The employees can be catty and management isn't the best.
good,"Productive and fun to work. "
good,"The campus is HUGE and beautiful all at the same time. So far, I have had excellent professors who willingly assist and challenge me in the aspects within my major. Therefore, I am assuming that has the best management out there, and there are even different kinds of people too."
good,I couldn't imagine working here long. Had several different managers within 2 months and hours are not the greatest. Couldn't imagine having a family on this pay rate.
good,Fun place to work at and you meet very interesting people there.Good discount. The items in the store are a better prices then most stores. You'll even find great deals on awesome products. And over all a nice retail store to work.
good,"Enjoyed working at a fast pace and keeping my area clean and presentable for customers.  Customers were friendly and had a great management team that kept the store and team members updated on store displays and new merchandise.  The pay scale started low, but after a few months was given a raise for my dedication and commitment of always showing up for my work schedule.  Being a team player was important in order for the daily task to be accomplished."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was when they made me try different positions at Ross."
good,"One thing I like about Ross is their double discount for employees that took place 3 times a year. Everything except electrics will be 40% off for all employees. Because of the discount is main reason I work there, but overall I would not recommend this place for anyone. Management is very bad, but it also depend of the manger as well."
good,"During my time at Ross, I helped get the store ready for the grand opening. There was a lot of room to move up the ladder. My supervisor was compassionate and understanding. I learned a lot everyday with the fast paced work."
good,"Fast pace, friendly environment greeting customers, opportunity for advancement, friendly Staffing management even the customers are great, Ross Dress for Less gets a thumbs-up."
good,"Very fast paced, you will always be on your feet. Great place to work for seasonal employment. No advancement available. it is hard to move up. You must be flexible in your hours to work."
good,unprofessional at times . but very flexible schedules . nice environment. . great place to work when looking for retail assistance. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"communication was key in this position. i had to make sure everyone was on the same page when it came to loss, if it was internal or external. if ur not a social person you were not thriving."
good,"I would help bring the truck in everyday. Assign my team the jobs that they were to perform through out their shift. Perform audits to ensure that my team was correctly processing and securing our merchindise. I also maintained my stock room to ensure that it was a safe and secure enviroment.  I have learn how to manage my time to get all of my required work completed. I also learned how to be approacheable by my team so they feel safe to come to me about any problems they are having. Our workplace culture is an open one, we have no problem communicating between each other and asking for help when needed, my team is very helpful they drop whatever they are doing to help each other. The hardest part of my job is managing the amount of hours I recieved to complete a truck, making sure that everyone productivity is up to par. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers. My coworkers are very friendly and open, at the same time they are very focus. They make me want to come to work everyday."
good,"I only worked there for 2 weeks. I had never been in retail before and Ross makes me never want to be again. Everything is just thrown onto shelves, nothing has a place, so when you first start out it's a bit overwhelming if you're the type of person who has to have organization. If you have a question, you're probably better off not asking because everyone, even one of the managers, looks at you like you're stupid and you should know how to do it. The first day I went in for a shift I was thrown on cashier with no experience and definitely no training. I guess if you want to call someone explaining each thing for 10 seconds and then checking it off as if I'd learned it training, then yes, I was trained. The most enjoyable part of a day at College Station Ross was probably the 15-30 minute break I got for lunch. Oh, and they offer good benefits if you need that sort of thing."
good,"It is a good place to work at all you need to do is make your availability strict and respectful to the managers, if that's not what they need then is better if you look for another company."
good,"it's a retail position how enjoyable can it be? Typical shift is 4-6 hours cashering, fitting room or sales floor. The hardest part about the job is having to clean up after people all day."
good,"This was a very challenging job, you had to learn to learn to adjust to all the different cultures of the associates, we didn't discriminate in the hiring and made sure we hired people of all race. I was responsible in keeping the energy of the associates up and making sure they didn't get overwhelmed. Hardest part of the job was trying to be available to all 90 employees and making sure their concerns were addressed in a timely fashion. Most enjoyable part of the job was the rush of the fast pace of the store, working with a great team that supported management just as much as we supported them."
good,"Generally slow paced job outside of holiday rushes. The hardest part of the job is standing around during slow periods, and handling angry customers.."
good,It was a quick paced and easy job to do. If they have more than one job for you to do. Do it it'll keep you busy and on your toes. Be honest with your manager and he/she will help you with whatever you need.
good,It is a fast paced environment and you must have patience. You have to be quick on the register and maintain good customer service. The time usually goes by pretty quick.
good,"I do recommend Ross for anyone who like to start to start their carrier in retail, but you gonna have to be stronger to deal with so many things in order to move forward and don't expect to be paid the way they want you to get the job done ."
good,"•	This position provides a visible presence at the store entrances/exits, mitigating theft and fraud while maintaining a safe and secure environment for associates and customers."
good,"Great values and product. Fast pace work environment. Daily receiving of merchandise which is to be processed and put out by end of business. No customer loyalty program, credit cards, or coupons."
good,"Management isn't great. Schedules are flexible. Coworkers are great. Customers are rude. Not strict on uniforms. Prices are great. Discount is good, double discount days are excellent."
good,The work load is very rigorous. Store is always packed. Merchandise comes in every day so there is a lot of items to arrange and move around in the store.
good,"I did enjoy working here. The management was a little rude. They didn't understand the life of a high school student and how busy it can be. I wasn't told it was seasonal until I was laid off, so I didn't expect to be laid off and I didn't have time to look for another job."
good,"Ok work place, friendly environment. Most of the time was enjoyable, many of my employees was very friendly and helpful when I first started. The management was ok not the best but they did what they can to help as best as possible. I would say the most likeable thing about the job was the customer's they were always friendly and respectable."
good,"Work a lot of times was fast paced, but I enjoyed that about it. Often times whenever I came in I bounced around departments and helped where I was needed, if I wasn't fitting room consulting, I was either in stock or cashiering or just picking up merchandise misplaced by customers all around the store. The hardest thing was how short staffed we were, literally almost everyday I had off, I was asked to come in and work. Even once about an hour after I got off, they called me to come back in and close, not that that's a bad thing, just sort of inconvenient. On the contrary the most enjoyable part was the benefits, we had great discounts, plenty of work to do and we were in a very high volume location, plus I enjoyed my coworkers because management put me among people who worked to pick up the slack as much as I did. Overall working here was very insightful and a good customer service experience."
good,I had a great experience with Ross. They worked with my schedule pretty well. Management was great and kept everything equally fair to everyone. Great job experience.
good,"Seemed like the more work you put in the less it is noticed and it becomes a daily expectation. Raises are less and less reach year as they don't want you to cap off. When applying for your management is about who you know, but the new warehouse VP seemed to be changing this things. Overall an okay place to work."
good,"Its was a company with nice people, but did not work with you at all in terms of life outside of work. If you are really sick they did not tollerate any time for you to see a doctor ."
good,"Working at Ross isn't bad, I think a lot of it depends on how good the management team. If the team is good, you will be trained correctly in a way that doesn't overwhelm you. With a bad management team they may ask you to work in an area you haven't been trained in and say that you can learn as you go."
good,Ross wasn't a bad place to work. however it stayed busy at my store all the time so it made it hard to keep it clean when the store was already short handed. nevertheless we made it workout.
good,"While they strive for a good workplace, it is really dependant on your local management team. If you have good management they will help balance the work load and partner with you to create a fun place to work. If there is bad management you will be punished for other peoples mistakes."
good,"It was going through many transitions. Different management, security it was a revolving door. I was not personally a fan of the store manager and assistant manager, but loved the supervisors."
good,"When I began the store worked like a well tuned machine, towards the end it ran like a car with no engine. I respected the managers on a personal level and never once took a disrespectful tone with any of the managers. In fact, for the most part I enjoyed my time at Ross. All the hardships associates would face would better unify them as a team which would give you reason to want to work there. Management is flexible with your schedule if you have conflicting hours such as school or a second job. The store's associates do their best for the most part, yes there would be that sore thumb sticking out once in awhile but management would be quick to discipline associates not doing their part."
good,"My job was receiving and office management, making schedules, following schematic, training, hiring and running the store. I gained much knowledge on the business aspect of this job and knew I was ready for more responsibilities."
good,Everything about the company and its people are great. I love working for ross. I just cant survive and take care of my family only getting 1 day every 3 weeks. I would stay at this company forever if they would at least give me 4 short shifts a week.
good,"If you like long days and no support, then this is the place to be.  You don't get help to run the store so you are doing it by yourself as the MOD.  Expect miracles from you to get things done."
good,"Not as much help is giving when new but give nice judgement, I enjoy all the effort they put into your job.I also enjoy the small parties they have on special occasions."
good,I work as a stocker and at the start I worked so hard to show that I would like to stay with the company. After holidays I was only given 1 day a week for 4 maybe 5 hours. Management is fine and they do their best to train their employees but to work 1 day out of the whole week is not worth it.
good,This a is company you really get chance to service the internal and external customers.  I really enjoyed working for the organization.
good,I verified the clothes coming into Ross Warehouse. It was repetitive work. Management was watching you the whole time. When work was stable we were very busy. I learned how to communicate with others and work as a team in this position
good,"Everyone dated everyone."
good,"Learned a lot about the retail business and loss prevention. Assigned tasks at start of day, need to be fast at checking people out to keep up lines."
good,A typical day at work was very fair. It had its good and bad days. Everyone was friendly but everyone didn't take the time to give quality work. I learned how to deal with customer issues face to face. Management sometimes were unfair and didn't give credit when due. The hardest part about this job I would say would be dealing customer attitudes all because some customer were very rude and non understanding of store policy. I enjoyed this job because the co-workers were all a unit. Everyone got alone and had laughs. When we were at work we were One. Some people just needed help to leave their laziness at home.
good,"Very nice and friendly place to work,  slow flowing job easy to understand the work assigned, great fun co-workers  and managers. Difficult to get the hours you want"
good,"Ross was an alright place to work at, its just time consuming and they dont normally clock you out at the right time and they will miss your break clock outs too."
good,More Hispanics than any other ethnicity. Can sometimes be uncomfortable working around coworkers who stare while speaking Spanish. Make a person feel as if they are being talked about.
good,"If you are a perfect fit for the position and company, you will be very successful. They are not afraid to make it clear if you are someone who they do not see growing in the company."
good,"typical day at work is crazy but what faced paced business isn't crazy. I learned a lot about different departments about sizing of clothing an how they should be hanged, learned about loss prevention an how we handled it. was always alert about the safety of our customers an fellow employees. Being a cashier was a tough job all on its own but most customers are very considerate an understand how hectic the store can be."
good,"Its a fun and active working experience, I learned to get along with customers and my co-workers, and I also learned to be organized and fast. being part of the ross family was delightful. the hardest part about this job was making sure you get your job done in four hours, me and my stock team manage to get the job done."
good,"Typical day at work as a retail associate means lots of cleaning and running back and forth from the floor to the registers. I learned to be quick on my feet and lots of patience. For some management this is their life, for others, they don't really care and are easy-going. Co-workers don't last long, many leave quickly because it can be a stressful environment. The hardest part of the job is knowing that no matter how much you clean and how hard you work, it isn't going to stay that way because the people who shop there don't really respect the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employee's discount because the store is filled with treasure that you get first dibs on."
good,Ross Dress For Less is a fun place to work and employees are generally very welcoming and kind to newcomers. The stress of the job when in a full time position is not worth the low pay. Management could use some training.
good,"Working for ROSS was a experience."
good,Working here has been a pleasure. Consistency with rules and regulations could improve. I do believe that having a rally meeting should consist of the entire team not just the members on duty. Should that happen I feel all members in between lunches should have a brief of what was discussed at the rally meeting that was held prior to their shift. Other than that management is amazing and my team as a whole is phenomenal.
good,Its a fun and laid back place to work. The co-workers are friendly and the managers are wonderful people. Your work there does not go unnoticed. The store manager does things from time to time for the workers.
good,under good management ross is overall an okay company. pay is not all that when first starting off but if you put in work and move up in management everything is up from there.
good,"lots of certifications to complete, very fast paced, can promote easily, can be extremely stressful, teamwork is a must, pretty intense policies, basic dress code, pretty good pay in the start, promotion increases are decent"
good,"Management was good, but the hours and payroll eligible was just not enough. No room to really grow within the company or store."
good,I enjoyed working in a busy business setting and experiencing different types of customers and situations. everyday was fun and adventurous especially holidays
good,If you're into customer service this is the ideal place for a good trial run to see if you're a good fit. Working as a cashier and overall associate taught me personally how to deal with customers and co-workers as well.
good,"A typical day would be come in clock in and go to where you are designated. Be there for your time, clean up, clock out, and go home. I learned that people are crazy. Management was awesome when I first got there but they moved to another store, so the new managers were mean enough to want to make you tell them about themselves and quite; one of the managers didn't even care half the time. I loved my coworkers; they are the only reason I stayed so long. The hardest part of the job was standing there for hours and hours and hours. The most enjoyable part was working the register since time went by so fast."
good,"working for this company wasn't bad at all, I just wish they were able to give more hours. if you're a student or looking for a side job this is the perfect place to work. I would go back to the company if I weren't in need of a full time position"
good,Flexible hours and a great management. Opportunities for advancement with open availability. Most of coworkers are trustworthy.
good,Ross is a good place to work you get to interact with a lot of different customers. The products the store offers for the low price they have is wonderful.
good,"Ross pays well for the job, but overall there are many rules that make no logical sense. They hinder the work environment and slow down simple task."
good,"When I was part time, I really enjoyed the job. I would do more than was required and would love interacting with the customers. "
good,"pretty crazy place to work, I would only recommend as a last resort job or you want something simple. Its easy but retail is a crazy place"
good,"I love my job at first, but as time gone by I noticed that I wasn't receiving any hours. The management at my location needs some assistance. I was informed that we could be cross-trained to receive more hours, but that hasn't happened yet. In stock, we only work a maximum hours of 3-4 within a day. Usually only work 2 days out of the week."
good,the job was hard and i didnt like it verry much but i sayed there any way and worked me and a supervise got in to it about clocking out
good,"I enjoy my co-workers and my managers because they are energetic, respecful and we have fun. We help each other with out asking."
good,"Ross is good place to work if you are just starting out in the workfield or need a second job. If it is your only job, it can be difficult to get hours."
good,days were long because of continues standing but the ease of the job made it hard to complain. I didn't really learn much that I didn't already know. the management had a lot to work on including employee relations. co-workers were very helpful and committed. the hardest part of the job was the extensive standing in one place. the most enjoyable part was co-worker and customer interaction.
good,"SUPER relaxed environment. no one really cared that much. good pay. sometimes people wouldn't tell you about things. they called me in saying i was supposed to work even though i wasn't scheduled, so i got ready and started working, even though it wouldn't let me clock in. the manager didn't let me know anything and she ended up calling me into the office letting me know my time was up and gave me my final pay. annoying lol. anyways if you work here expect to get off at least 30 minutes after you're supposed to be done with work. and if you work night shift, then add an hour to that. not too organized but then again it's ross."
good,"•	Partner with Engineering and Operation Teams to develop new procedures and programs , Training Environments, time variable updates, procedure Rollout"
good,"Management didn't seem to care about the employees that much, they demanded staying late and completion due to short staffing, and the hours are strenuous."
good,"Work was not difficult, but the pay was minimum wage.  Managers were fun and raises are almost nonexistent.  Hours vary based on position and the customers that come in are typically not nice."
good,"The company is long on passion, but short on open mindedness to innovation. I enjoyed the colleagues and the store teams. There were elements of the role that felt unproductive. Suggestions for improvement and change were not welcome."
good,If you love fashion then this is a really fun job to have. Especially around the Holidays! They offer great incentives and things like employee of the month. They put in money for their break rooms so that employees are comfortable and frequently have fun things such as pot lucks and things like that and lots of one-on-one time with the boss so you can work on yourself as well as the company. Lots of merchandising opportunity!
good,"coworkers and management make working at Ross fun, a typical day consists of talking with customers about whats going on sales, or just catching up with our regular shoppers"
good,"Mitigate theft and fraud, minimize operational shortage, develop great teams and partnerships and maintain a safe and secure environment."
good,"The job itself is fun and fast paced but the little pay and the work politics when juggling with multiple supervisors, managers, and district managers really makes the job less rewarding as a whole."
good,"I am happy to work for ross and I give everything I have when I go in to make sure I am always following guidelines, I enjoy problem solving and helping the customers each day"
good,"Flexible schedule, always messy in high volume stores."
good,"The store is nice and leaves room for advancement, but the Ross as a company isn't worker friendly. It is the average fast paced environment of a retail store which allows long shifts to go by quickly."
good,Your typical job for someone fresh out of high school or on summer break for college. But a fun place to work with great understanding management. Fun place to grow and make new friends
good,it is a Nice Place to work with  friendly people with a lot of working hours available open early and closes Late you met a lot of interesting people and there is always opportunity to move up
good,my first day of work was the awesome feeling cause I had to learn so much things about warehouse. Learning new things in life
good,I have worked for this company for going on 4 years. I have had my ups and downs with this company. Some of the management team lacked learer ship skills and I beleave this is due to the fact that the will promote people who are not trained right and do not know how to run a Store. Oh the other hand there are great managers as well that have to move on because the company dose not pay people enough. If this company was willing to pay there employees more I think this place would be a great place to work for.
good,Its an okay working environment. Management and co-works attitudes change constantly. You work to break your back working for not that much pay & your raise are about .20 a year.
good,"-Job expectations were clear and easy to meet"
good,"Ross was a great job to have. I loved most my coworkers, though some of the management were kind of snotty, but not all. We had many emplyee functions like pot lucks, fairwell parties, holiday parties, secret santa, etc."
good,"We all had our job duties. None of us had to do the work for others, which we all held our responsibilities at a decent rate. The hardest part was not being able to keep the store clean because of the way customers did not respect the store. There was many times the store was messy because of the customers, but we tried every night to keep the store clean. Overall, I learned great communication skills, and learned to have patience."
good,"Decent work life balance"
good,"Ross is a constant growing business with many opportunities for advancement.I enjoy meeting all kinds of new people as well as the work.The merchandise is great.The hardest part of the job is the lack of help but that is in any retail environment.My manager, Wanda, is amazing.She is very hard working and dedicated to the job.She is also a great teacher"
good,I loved my coworkers and the management but the workload was tough. Policies changed and being one of two guys working Stockroom carrying heavy boxes constantly sucked.
good,Ross was a great place to build skills relating to retail such as customer service. This was a fast paced environment that taught me  to work under pressure and work quickly.
good,"Working in Unit ID I would start with a order of boxes of clothes. I would sort them, inspecting them to make sure they were good to go to the stores. Making sure everything was in order. I had a bunch of different type of people to work with. It was very interesting. Hardest part of the job was keep your percentages up to come close to making bonus. that it was easy to pick up different areas to work in."
good,"A lot to do, but an enjoyable place to be. I was a trainee manager so you had to do everything yourself, but it was still a great environment to be in. I loved the people I worked with."
good,"A day working at ross gets very hectic. The lines are never ending. I absolutely love the people I work with we all make a great team! I've learned what it takes to become a great leader. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers, and the most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co workers."
good,"I love my job here at Ross for the most part,"
good,"If your lookng to make a career. Ross is the place for you. In a typical day you can ensure you will be on your feet 8-10 hours."
good,We all started at the same time so we became basically one big family but the hours & pay is nowhere near enough to live off of.
good,"Typical day would be helping customers with returns, putting alarms on items, pulling tolls, and working the register. I would say the management there wasn't so great. Treated under-management unequal, as well as not being organized. Schedules were always being switched and mixed up. Due to unorganized management and schedules switching up all the time it made work difficult at times. the only real benefit out of this job was learning better people skills, better patience, and meeting new friends."
good,"While working for this job I was able to move up rather quickly, however management was not always there when you needed them and at critical junctures in business. when management was there easy to reach and an open door policy at all times."
good,"Great ways to move up faster in the company, if you desire. The hire from within the company which is awesome."
good,"Ross store is an amazing environment, you get to meet people from all over the world and occasionally strike up great topics. Love the culture diversity this company has in both their employees and customers."
good,"My typical day includes managing associates to complete tasks assigned by the store manager and district manager while making sure that customers are being provided with excellent customer service. "
good,fast pace environment. co workers are fun to talk to. management team easy to approach. Hardest part of the day receiving truck on daily basis. Once truck is done the rest of the  day is easy and relaxed.
good,"This job was a decent place to work for.  I was hoping to work here longer, but only to find out this job was temporary."
good,"Although the labor got pretty intense at times, especially during holiday seasons, it definitely made up for it by providing opportunities to move up in the company. During my year there I was able to move up to a higher paying position. The trainers were amazing and friendly."
good,"I enjoy working at Ross, the pay isn't that great but the hours work for me."
good,"I worked for ross for over a year it was a decent job. You make a little above minimum wage as SPS which is a bonus, but you better be comfortable with making public presentations. All in all, it was a good learning experience the time I spent at Ross."
good,"Customer service for consumers. Unload, sort and stock store with daily merchandise. Exeptionally well managment."
good,"Ross was the start of my retail experience.  I am thankful for all the skills i possessed in working there.  I learned how to run the fitting rooms, cash register, and work the sales floor.  Working the Sales floor was what i loved most about my job because i love to organize.  The hardest part of my job was getting started because it was my first time in a retail environment so I had to be trained."
good,"fast paced and busy. employees knew their jobs and were friendly. we recieved discounts twice a year, stock options, and insurance."
good,ok job for high school kids or in need of second job friendly co workers management ok
good,"Very fun job, Everyone was very friendly and outgoing. Great hours. Very understanding."
good,"A typical day to me is walk inside work speak to everyone, go into my office, count down my registers and safe and then make deposit. My daily routine is I just check in with the manager let him or her know what i have completed and ask if their is any thing else that i need to add to my tasks for that day. After talking to them i complete what i need to complete and then i usually just do my own thing as far as cleaning, markdowns, pricing until someone calls me or need back up on the front end. The hardest part of my day is after lunch i am full and ready to go but I still pull threw to accomplish what i need to. I can not start a task and not finish it before the end of my work shift, The most enjoyable part is seeing the smiles of the many people that I have helped that day that will return to get great customer service."
good,"As the Assistant Manager I oversee all operations throughout the day and ensure those operations will run smoothly on days I am not in the store. I also spend 50% of my workday as the manager on duty(MOD). As the MOD I am responsible for ensuring all associates receive breaks throughout the day as well as delegate tasks and oversee individual productivity. I give recognition or coach and develop associates while monitoring their productivity. While being MOD and monitoring operations, I am also responsible for addressing and resolving any customer issues. I have learned time management, patience, multitasking and the importance of efficiency. The hardest part of my job is accommodating to all 40 employees needs or time off requests. The most enjoyable part of my job is training, coaching and developing my employees."
good,"Everyday my boss is hiring new people and people are quiting. I still have to train and coach the new employees to meet company standards. If the new people don't get the proper training, I am responsible for that. So I take the initiative to make sure everyone get the proper training thus resulting in our store genenrating great sales numbers and minizing shrinkage and internal thief."
good,A typical day at work is meeting and greeting our customers. As a leader of the team here at Ross I help and assist in the teaching of shrink trends of the company. My coworkers are willing to learn and wants to achieve goals in life. Many of the workers are students. The management allows me to help with Rally meetings and the teaching aspect. The most enjoyable part of the job is being a leader.
good,"A typical day working for Ross was challenging. Not having enough empolyees to complete the day, and or having someone call out."
good,"Always a busy day working for ross, I learned the organization of a busy place, The hardest part of my job was recovery of the store, putting away ""go-backs""."
good,"great job for someone with addition income , however for someone in which this will be their only source of income not a good ideal. there are not many full time positions available"
good,"Through Ross Stores, I have gained an incredible amount of experience in customer relations as well as methods and procedures in mitigating theft and fraud."
good,"This is a good place to work for, but not enough hours!! I love the people I work with, and the customers I deal with from day to day."
good,"1) Unpack merchandise and bring them out to the floor; clean floors and organize merchandise; help customers around the store and answer questions;"
good,Good part-time employer. You come in contact with people from all different walks of life.
good,"The hardest part of working here, was adjusting to the attitude issues of my fellow coworkers. Overall, to be able to assist others needs was a great experience."
good,ross was too easy all i did ws unload trucks all day and stock the merchandise
good,"Management-every decision made by upper management is politically motivated"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Ross, because it gave e a chance to work work with people face to face."
good,A typical day would to be a hard worker doing multi-task work. What can I say you learn something new every day. So the managers. Well put it like this they can do better. The hardest part of the job is that most of the time you would have to do everything on your own.
good,Ross is very fast paced and this specific store was one of the nicest Ross's you'll ever see. I got promoted withing two months of working there because I had open availability and management was very impressed with how hard I worked. This company really does want to see associates grow within the company and the district managers are very friendly as well. As for the store manager we did go through about 4 different ones during my time here. What customers don't understand about this place is that it's just a high end goodwill but they come in expecting it to be neiman marcus. You will constantly be on your feet and hearing your name over the intercom to assist with the lines. Also during Christmas always looks like a tornado just hit the store and expect to stay an hour later than your schedule.
good,A typical day at work would be fast paced and a busy workplace. I learned how to unload trucks and process merchandise. Management was very organized. I got along with all the other employees they were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job would be finishing processing all merchandise by the end of the day. Most of all it came down to a great successful days of work and enjoying the great environment I worked in.
good,its a good starting position; just bad pay your expected to keep the whole store organize clean and as a cashier you deal with customers  disrespect and behavior deserving at least more then minimum wage.
good,"great place to work•a typical day at work"
good,It is a department store so it is a little crazy some days. Its not for everyone but if you can handle a good work out this is definently the job for you.
good,"This particular store was very unorganized, pay not very good, but if you're a student and don't have many bills this may work for you."
good,working at my location can be better if people were just open to suggestion
good,"Not the worst place to work but not the best. Low compensation,"
good,"I go in to the store put on my vest to show everyone that im the janitor. I pick up the trash from the cashiers, the bathrooms, the changing area and the kitchen. then vacume the front of the store the entrance area. Then i sweap up the floor on every section of thge store from back to front make sure its all picked up and sweped on then i take the mops out fill them up with water and put some cleaning supply to clean the floor very well and i make my way from the front to the back mopping everything neatley. Then i make my way to clean all three bathrooms making sure everything is in its place the hand wash, toilet paper and cover seat. After doing all that then i wippe all the mirrors from the store down i clean all of them to make sure they look their best for costomers. My manager is great she's always polite and helpfull when need of help. My co-worker helps me do half of the store so we can finish on time when the store opens. Shes verry helpfull and finishes her work on time. The hardest part of the job would be to put the mops away withought disturbing the employes to stop them from me passing thrue but we get it done in a good reasonable time. And the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that im helping the store look aproppriate for employes to work in a clean enviorment and especialey the costumers!"
good,"Opportunity to provide great customer service, great co-workers, able to deligate task."
good,It was ok.It was ok.It was ok.It was okIt was ok..It It was ok.was ok.
good,"A typical day at work involve loads of activities. As an area supervisor I am responsible for cash pulls and pickups from registers, partnering with associates and store protection specialist to reduce shrink, manage Ross programs and store recovery, and many other administrative duties. I also implement new flow changes to apparel, snake departments for high and low inventory, and also aid and encourage productive stock team results. I learned numerous coaching and leadership skills while on the job. As a manger, leadership and management competencies are constantly being analyzed and developed for individual development. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the different product levels, merchandising for high and low inventory levels. I enjoy the associates and the customers that I interact with on a daily basis. I really do like performing projects as far as prep for the holidays and shop re-locations."
good,always make sure the customer is happy with what they purchase. I've learned as long as the customer is happy than you and management will succeed.
good,"cash handling, customer serice skills, merchandising,shipping"
good,"very hard working, hardest part is when they find there strongest person and assaigned them to one station all the time, no chances of a higher position, co-workers all speak there own language which is philipino. most enjoyable part of the job in empting out the reciving room and container is gone!"
good,"I love working at Ross, but the management can be very hard to deal with. They encourage you to move up in the company, but do not give full-time hours to more than a couple people. Working part-time at minimum wage is not enough, so a second job is necessary if you want to work here."
good,I would like to work for a company that I could get an advancement. People are great but there are some days that we have to wait around for our trucks to come or they just cancel our trucks and we don't have work.
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and assisting customers with purchases. Management was very professional. I learned how to multi-task and talk to people professionally. The only hard part is when customers come in frequently which put me under pressure.
good,"Work life balance is pretty good. Leadership seems to care about the analysts. Compensation doesn't scale to the area, which makes it near-impossible to make it without dual income."
good,"If you take advantage of the programs they have you can move up in the company rather rapidly as long as you can execute and respond to feedback in real time."
good,Environment of the managers to be more patience with new employees and customers while shopping at their store. By answering their not to be in a hurry
good,"Its a great place to work you get to work the days you want , had a couple flaws with some of the other associates that had gotten comfortable with the managers and felt the need to have rude attitudes toward new hires ."
good,A typical day at Ross for me is usually very busy. there is always something to do. Management was not the best but the base pay of $11 per hour made up for it.
good,"Little space to work and several employees on their phones with little to no supervision! Overall, not the worst place to work, but not great for someone who doesn’t like drama and likes to get stuff done in an orderly fashion."
good,"good, place for work and good personal and good areas for lounch and diner restromms clean and microways plats cups for all the people who work their."
good,"This job is extremely fast-paced and stressful but it is a safe space to develop leadership skills. A typical day at work looks like clocking in, reporting to the Manager on Duty so that they can give you your tasks for the day and we are supposed to accomplish these tasks while juggling taking care of customers. Some of the company policies make it hard to enjoy doing the job. However, the most enjoyable part is talking to customers and making jokes all while providing great customer service."
good,The work work place was very laid back and the employees were pretty okay to work with. but there was not any room for moving up in the company so i had to find another job
good,"There are good people to work with. Not super stressful. Managers are organized. Could have more benefits.  The most enjoyable thing is the people you work with, there is lots of good team building."
good,"7 to 10 hours on register. greeting customers watching for suspicious activity."
good,"When I went in for my interview, I was not asked any questions about myself or how I would be on the job. They just started explaining to me what I would be doing there and basically how they ran things. I was one of the youngest there as I was only 18 at the time, and not many of my employees seemed to notice me. No one would talk to me while I was at work and I barely even knew anyone's name because I barely had conversations with any of them. Even on my breaks when my co-workers would come into the break room, I would still be ignored. On top of that, I was only scheduled 1-2 days a week for about 4 or 5 hours so I was barely working. For the whole summer I got about a total of 30 hours (over a span of 2 1/2 months). I was not very pleased with my time at Ross Dress For Less."
good,"In the warehouse was a great place to work in as of lots of space and busy , although the temperature would move from hot to cold uncontrollably it was pretty good"
good,I enjoyed working at Ross! I had some experience in that position so I kinda knew what needed to get done while I was on the clock. It was a quick paced job that I needed to be prepared for!
good,"For the most part, I like working there. The hours are decent and flexible, the work is easy, yet busy enough to keep from being bored, and the managers are nice and knowledgeable. The only problem is that the pay is low, even for retail standards."
good,"Was a good place to work. Alot of negativity with the employees. No once seemed happy to be at work. They did serve us lunch for 50's day. The managers are reasonable, but let other employees treat others bad."
good,"good place to work part time, good discounts for employees, but there are no more benefits"
good,You better not be a parent if you work for this company. You get marked for having to be a parent. Management ended awful for me. Very rude wouldn't recommend no one to work for this company .
good,"great place to work at, great enviroment.keeps you steady;busy. things change overtime; you have to cope with, pay is well nowadays.Hardest part of the job,would be yourself an how you handle senarios."
good,"I don't love working in retail, but overall Ross was a good company to work for. Scheduling was flexible and there were opportunities for advancement."
good,"The work load was enough for a high school student to handle. They provided opportunities to succeed if they thought you were good. The pay was minimum wage to start (they recently raised it). The management was thorough about how they wanted things to be done around the place - sometimes it was good instructions, sometimes it was unclear. It's a good first retail job."
good,As a person of security or as they'd call it a loss prevention specialist the job had a lot of restrictions. I didn't like the fact that I was restricted on things I couldn't do like touch carts or wagons.
good,Working there was fun management very inconsistent. Love my co workers best part of the job was the other employees made it fun very helpful. Hated leaving.
good,"The job paid good, but the you didn't get many hours. The stock truck was always late or canceled. The managers were not on the same page, but everyone was nice. I was constantly told that I didn't have to come to work because the truck was canceled. Other than that, I liked working there for the most part."
good,"Got the job automatically after the interview, everything was good until I realized how stressful it was working with some of my coworkers. There was drama, and when I asked questions during my training some coworkers gave me attitude. The Management was more tolerable but other than that. If I would of known the people I would be working with, I wouldn't even applied for the position."
good,"Coworkers are amazing, flexible with your schedule. Job changes by day though depending on customers. Working at Ross dress for less is wonderful but the actual work differs by day depending on what customers you get that day."
good,"It gets very busy, a lot of stress from having to see a full line of people and having to be very quick in their transactions. Sometimes you aren't allowed to leave at your schedule time because the manager wants you to stay and finish, and you don't get paid overtime."
good,You'll learn a lot from both  the staff and customers. Is a hands on type of job so i learned a lot. Working with customers one on one is pretty fun and getting good feed back is  always  a plus !
good,"Systems are a bit outdated. With this being said creates more work for management. Hand written schedules and etc. Work environment is great, dealing with suspicious customers not so great."
good,This was a good entry level position which helped me gain some valuable knowledge customer service.  I thought it the management was very helpful and there was room for advancement
good,"Depending on the type of customers you get, it can be pretty good and a fun job. It is very fast-paced and you are expected to perform your best while at work."
good,Typical day at work is the same routine everyday. Breaks and lunch is mandatory. Fun place to work at. Nice discount. Most of the management was easy to work with.
good,"If you are someone that wants to succeed in retail, than Ross is the right place for you. You work hard, long hours but there is a lot of room for growth and promotions. "
good,"While working there was fun for a while, it wasn't giving me enough hours. It was a very clean and organized store with a really relaxed environment I would spend my time checking out people in the back and interacting with customers along with stocking products and organizing dresses and shoes. The hardest part would probably be managing time between go backs and checkouts. But the best times were when I got to interact with the people."
good,Ross was a great place to work while I was in school. I only worked weekends and I was able to lower my hours once I got closer to leaving for school.
good,"The work environment was very hectic and busy. Not enough staff to cover departments. The store was very busy and sometimes it was"
good,It’s a fast pace work area supervisers try to push u to work faster to get more product out pay is poor minimum only good thing about it the people you work with no chance to move up in the company
good,A good job for someone who is looking to get their first corporate job. There isn't much room for grow after a certain point but you can take the skills learned and bring them to your next potion.
good,"It is a good job to start as a first job. It would not be a good job for a long term job. They may cut hours because they don't have enough pay to pay for those extra hours of the day, week, or month."
good,"Ross is one of my favorite store, I was enjoying working at Ross. It’s a friendly place. The store manager is great, she is very kind and fair with all associates."
good,"When i was interviewed for the job, i got a totally different vibe of the job when i actually started working there. There were no hours, and employees noticed they weren’t getting paid for overtime or the hours they had worked. there were a lot of shift changes and salary cuts. i thought i was going to be working full time and i wasn’t informed that i wasn’t until i was hired and i wasn’t pleased."
good,In Ross the people work so hard but the salary is minimum for that the people move in other job but the team work is wonderful they aro so nice people
good,"Working for Ross overall was a positive learning experience.  I was able to learn all departments in a retail store.  I initially started off in the stock room and was then trained on the register, and then work on the sales floor putting back all merchandise and sizing cloths in different departments.  I then was training in the fitting room and was able to communicate with the customers assisting them in making selections of clothing to buy for different events.  the company was very good about making sure that employees were crossed training and able to fill in when employees were not able to make it to work or needed to leave early.  I learned how to communicate with customers and helped sales by convincing customers to purchase items and helping them to decide on what they wanted by providing information on items based on my experience and product knowledge.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers make decisions and selling customers products they needed or desired.  The hardest part of the job was when we have senior day and we would have to make sure that the seniors got their discount and sometimes we would have to figure out whether the person was 55 or older. The management at Ross was very good about making sure all employees got their required 15 minute break and their 30 minute lunch break and accommodating employees who had other jobs.  Ross uses a computer system ADP where employees can go into people soft  and put in their availability according to their personal and other work schedules."
good,Working for Ross as a store protection specialist has been a learning experience. You learn the different type of scams and techniques that people use. Working with store management is important to minimize theft and fraud.
good,"The people that worked there was really what made it.  Some days customers just come at you and you feel really drained, but the other associates were always there to help me through it."
good,"It's an easy going place if you don't mind sweating. There is no AC!!! They only give you a 30 minute lunch break and no other breaks. You have to ask for permission to go to the restroom. You cannot be late! In fact you must be there 15 minutes early and wait to clock in at the exact time. If you are late, you get sent to the office. I was never late so I do not know what happens in the office. You also have a certain time that you can pick up your check... On your lunch break or after you get off work in the office."
good,I started out working the fitting room & soon after became Key Holder. I learned quite abit. I was sent for training for 2 weeks. The hardest about this job would be noticing people who are above me dont work. They sit in the office & let people like me in my position do all the work or thier job & take credit when corporate comes in for a visit
good,"ability to take on new tasks and learn different areas of the business such as cash office, merchandise markdowns, tagging new inventory and putting them out on sales floor."
good,I have enjoyed the experience I have obtained while working for the company. I was able to use my skills to help customers and the company in a positive way. I have gained great insight and am pleased with working with fellow co-workers.
good,ross is a good place I guess. I didn't work there too long it was supper busy. its not the store thats bad but the customers that it attracts. there are some customers who just come in and just throw items on the ground and it can be quite frustrating.
good,Really waste of time if you don't put in any rewarding work in. The interview was great on balancing life out between having fun and putting in effort to work. Strict dress code.
good,Employees are hard to keep not many newbies quit after the first week of working the graveyard shift. Just like any other inventory retail job. Managers are slick out the mouth but friendly.
good,"Always moving  when working here time would go fast going to cashiering to working the floor and fixing clothing, to the fitting room. And at night closing up to have it ready for the next day overall it was a good job"
good,Work early shift unloading truck and setting up the store. Fast pace and try to get most of the big items out on the floor before store opens. Easy work place but needs some improvements.
good,I worked at a couple different locations and it was very mixed. I had co-workers who were the friendliest people and I had some who weren't very nice and uppity I don't know why... they work at Ross. Same goes for management I had some of the nicest caring managers and then I had others who were extremely rude and hateful. As for the job itself it's very easy and laid-back I did cashiering and stock room and sales floor. Like the title says it can be a great place to work if you have good management
good,I learned how to operate a turret truck and a order picker. I used all types of equipment and computer software. The location and hours were very convenient for my family.
good,Ross was a great place to work for me because i enjoy interacting with people. i had an opportunity to work in pretty much every area of the store. My manager at the time was very supportive in my development within the company.
good,quick pace and can be sometimes overwhelming ! manager staff is working to become a lot better ! pay have increased by 2 dollars . they will work with your schedule
good,Ross Dress for Less is great for promotions and job security. Severely lacking is the ability to work remotely. Upper management can be very tough....
good,"Working at Ross was great loved the people I worked with, very fast paced, busy, careful with sneaky customers, and management can be fair. You can't share your discount or you can be reported to corporate and lose your job, only allowed to share with spouse. "
good,"Work wasn't bad at all for opening/day shifts. Customers were fine, there was always something to do, and nothing was done overly complicated at all."
good,"Very fast paced, crazy scheduling, short staffed, wonderful managers with very little to work with, most of what I know about retail I learned from Ross. Not enough hours for all employees."
good,Ran the stock room. Had to unload an 18 wheeler everyday at 6 am had to have the stock out on the floor but 2pm. Close the store make sure it was cleaned before we left.
good,"Getting there on time is very strict, they can work with you in case of emergency though and fix it for you. Management is always changing but the store manager is super nice and likes to see you on your best and if you have any questions or anything he will always help and listen. Overall my experience there was very nice with the workers there. You can always change to different positions with just talking to the manager. Customers are all different races and its super diverse and its pretty amazing."
good,"The hours given are very flexible, there is always something to keep employees busy, the discounts they give are very good since Ross Stores is already a low priced store"
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross warehouse because i had a great team and great manager who understood and treated people well."
good,It was a great place to work just sometimes very stressful because wasn't enough pay for the job. I enjoy with the employees that I work with very friendly and nice got along with everyone I work with.
good,Ross is a popular go to store where there are expensive name brands for less. The environment is jolly and fast paced with lots of multitasking. Our goal is to make sure every customer leaves satisfied by our great deals and low prices.
good,Store is very fast paced which  creates a stressful atmosphere within management. This is transferred to all employee levels. Shortcuts are allowed which in turn compromise the validity of training as well as company policy. Employees are posted to do jobs they are not hired for and at times breaks are not able to be given.
good,Was able to get good experience with dealing with customer service . Had a difficult time getting a set schedule. But overall had really no issues with management or co workers
good,liked it cause it was easy an going at your own pas sometime we would work in a group. did a lot of stocking an organizing an tagging sometime will be done early but we go an help out when other need it
good,It was fine. Experience may be dependent on co-workers and managers. Rarely worked full-time but did occasionally work overtime. Can get busy at times.
good,My  typical day at work was great because I worked with some very helpful team mates who made the experience wonderful. I still keep in touch sometimes.
good,"An opportunity to support, strengthen and grow in my position and to be a part of a company that offers awesome products at a very affordable   price."
good,I been a employee for this company four years and I have had many challenges to face. This is a growing Fortune 500 company that needs more organizing
good,"I worked for this company for 3 years and had a love hate relationship with it. I loved that it was such a fast paced environment with friendly co-workers and pretty good benefits as well as discounts. However, this business takes its work very seriously. Its very important to stay on task to be sure to maintain the store. The management team is lovely and such a joy to work for. The most difficult part is keeping up with the pace."
good,"-fast-paced"
good,A Friendly environment with kind  customers make  work a place where yo have a team  that understand what need needs to be done and most importantly how it needs to be done with out damaging our misplacing the merchandise or sale promotions
good,Typical day you are providing customer service. I learned hands on how to consitently react to customers needs  and lead other associates not the best work culture making daily quotes
good,"Ross is a very faced paced and productivity driven company with a growing demand in retail positions. The company is on a learning and growth curve trying to tackle success and industry leading shrink goals. Ross is a company to learn and grow into a management position but lacks in a work life balance, due to there extended hours of operation. There pay is competitive to those who wish to put in the work and grow with them. I have noticed in more recent years that ross tends to have a higher turnover ratio then some other companies but all in all my tenure at Ross was very much so a great learning experiment."
good,"Unload the truck separate boxes then put them in there designated areas,then start processing the shoes, putting sizes alarms and prices on the shoes. After you fill up the shoe rack you run the shoes meaning you put them on the sales floor then that pretty much some up my day at work...."
good,Ross is great for life balance and allowing their employees to make time for family. Ross provides Summer Fridays and Christmas/New Years break; allowing their employees to arrangement for travel time and personal life.
good,"Great discount benefits, flexible work schedule, and great fun calendar events such as denim day, favorite sports team day, etc. only downside is that the store is never fully staffed so there is always work available"
good,Ross provided an excellent platform for my growth as a manager. I would recommend Ross to someone new to management.  There is opportunity for advancement in the company.
good,"It was great working at Ross with the night stock M.O.D's and Co-workers. Everyone was treated like family and had a great time working there, but the hours are not enough."
good,I was only a seasonal worker but while there I was given training in multiple sections of the store and the staff was very friendly. i would recommend working here to anyone in search of a job
good,"Ross is a very fast paced job, in which its good to work as a part time if one is in school and desires some type of income to begin they're long line of career in customer service or retail."
good,A typical work day would include doing hourly patrols inside the facilities. Watching customer and also writing daily reports. I learned how to stay vigilant as well as great customer service skills and how to greet customers' properly.
good,"Fun environment to work in"
good,"This company is not terrible to work for, but you will be working hard. The job is a bit stressful for the pay, but the people you work with make it more than worth it."
good,I like working at Ross I stop working there because I lost my car due with some issue with it. I miss working there it was fun and laid back I would love to go back.
good,Working at Ross was great. I learned how too communicate and socialize with others. Working the cashier you have too be good at math and know how to handle you're money. Give the customer their correct change.
good,"I was part of the opening crew that would unload freight every morning. Management was always willing to lend a hand if we were short handed. The hardest part of the job would be the large freights received during Christmas, because the budget for bringing in help was too restrictive"
good,good place to work management was good employees get half off in July and October good loss prevention sytem point of sales system was good however pay is too low to make a living of fof 7.25 an hour and I had a lot of retail expierence
good,"I was told that I would be getting $10 an hour, which never happened.  Others in my position were payed $11.50 and up, with me at $9.55.  When I gave notice to quit was the only time the store manager ever took notice to try to bump my pay up."
good,Not well paid but the job was easy enough that i could enjoy time conversing with co workers while being productive at the same time. The employee discounts were nice too! Management changed toward the end of my time there and he was very unprofessional at times. i decided that i should go elsewhere and try something new!
good,hours are to short you work your tail off for those 4 and a half hours no breaks but one fifteen minute break poor management not enough time to finis
good,"Worked there for almost two years now great place 20% off and three times a year 40% off for employees for 4days "
good,"I had two different types of positions when I worked for Ross Dress For Less. One of my positions was a security guard also known as (loss prevention). My duties were watching the cameras for shop lifters on my screen at the front desk and at the same time greeting customers while they walk into Ross Dress For Less saying ""hello welcome to Ross"" and as when they were walking out I would say ""have a nice day thank you for shopping at Ross"" and when the cashiers were cleaning out the register and counting the money I would have to watch them count it and walk it back to the billing room. My second position was a retail associate and the duties were keeping the clothes organized, off the ground, etc. "
good,They work with students schedules. Teach good time management and problem solving skills. Vacation time is accepted. Good first job to work at. Shifts can be very late.
good,"Even though it is a new store that just opened they are unorganized. And does not give everyone an equal chance to succeed within the store. "
good,Working at ross was a good learning expierence for me as it waa my first retail job. They do work you hard and the managment sometimes needs some work but overall it was a good place to work
good,"Cash management was hard due to the reg. where always short, when reporting you had to lie to cover for cashiers. One manager good one bad, Alot of the people where fun to meet."
good,easy work a lot of work to be done for not a lot of pay. managers where nice and took time to train you on the job. The culture of work was fun and you get awarded for doing a good job.
good,"Ross has a great work culture, you day to day work environment was medium sometimes a little overwhelming and very demanding but it's was fine because it helps shape character."
good,excellent work culture and decent management. Easy going environment with the hardest part being dealing with rude customers.
good,Working at Ross has taught me how to work in a team under pressure. My managers always answered all my questions and taught me how to relax every time a customer gave me a hard time.
good,Ross is a usually a good place to work if you are attending school since it is mostly part time. But if you have alot of bills to pay it could be a struggle due to the pay.
good,"Ross is a great place to get you started early,but is not a place I could see myself working long term.Mostly filled with college kids so call-outs are constant which can sometimes be to your benfit as they will call you in to work but dont be fooled there might be some weeks where you oly work 8 or so hours even tho your avalble to work more. If youre just getting started Ross is a great place to be but if you been around the block i would suggest searching elsewhere for a job but all in all Ross is decent."
good,"You will get accustomed to working in a fast paced environment and pick up great customer service skills. Ross is ever expanding, as such, there is plenty of room for advancement. Work can be a bit hectic and tedious however."
good,"team orientated, productive fast pace environment, great customer service skills, sales floor merchandising, sizing and recovery, stock efficantlly and productively, etc."
good,"Good place to work,good add on bonuses for meeting quotas.plenty of overtime.bus route,good point system  for not coming to work and flexible hours,able to work by yourself without a supervisor standing over you.learn how to use different equipment for warehousing."
good,I've worked at Ross for a year. I started out as an associate and was promoted to stock manager within 3 months. This job makes a good second job if you are part time they don't give a lot of hours to part time employees plus you get a 20% discount and double discount days. If you are full time you get a full 40 hours (of course). My store didn't have the best managers in my opinion and their was a lot of favoritism.
good,"I worked during the Sumner and it was hot in the store. We were told the thermostat is controlled by Corporate "
good,"Unbalance schedule due to customer needs. No room for growth, and low wages. Few weekends and employee discounts where nice though."
good,"Typical day at work is vary easy, be waking up at 5am for work greet co-workers and start unloading box'es. "
good,"Overall this can be a good company to work for-- if you are only looking for parttime hours.  "
good,"It was a great place to work as a part timer just for seasonal, it used to be very busy which I liked but too messy and not much respect for schedules. Great people to work with no much with certain management. The hardest part of working at Ross was the time of schedules because I was seasonal I had to stay late and sometimes be real early but having kids was not an easy thing to manage."
good,"My typical work day consisted of running reports, managing the schedule for three VP's, monitoring phones, maintaining expenses, booking travel and assisting the Buyers/ Buyer Assistants and DMMs."
good,"Easy to move up in positions. Very friendly work environment, great management, & a lot of new opportunities. Learned to be independent & easy to receive & give work feedback to grow better."
good,"My coworkers are very helpful"
good,I worked there with a few friends from school they made the job less tense but overall the customers made the fun no attitudes and very great atmosphere to work in
good,During my time at Ross I developed communication skills that can translate to any job opportunity. My short time of supervising the stock room gave me the confidence to be responsible for productivity in the work place.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and seeing that they are satisfied with their purchase(s). However, the hardest part of the job is managing the time to do things. When you're a cashier at the front end it is difficult to put up returns while at the same time trying to check out a line of customers. Also it doesn't help that you have to answer phone calls at the same time. So it's easy to get flustered when you have so much to deal with all at once."
good,"Retail Sales experience that I get from working here has taught me a lot about being patient and adhering to the needs of customers. "
good,Ross is a good job to gain skills to make yourself more qualified for future jobs and opportunities in the future. The co workers are great and i gained a lot of experience.
good,Great place to work with dynamic colleagues. Learnt to increase job knowledge resulting in increased productivity and performance. Communicating and planning with different associates is the enjoyable part of the job while working on third shift throughout night is the hardest part of the job.
good,"A typical day in the work place was fun and team oriented which allowed me to learn better organizational and leadership skills. The management was a little too lax at times, though only on certain managers' shifts. My co-workers were very friendly and open in terms of communication, which added to the overall work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was easily earning the respect and friendship of my co-workers and team members."
good,"serving the customer and working with the co worker, training the new associate ,solving problem, with this company I have learn a lot about how to  work with difference personallity"
good,"I've learned a lot these past couple of weeks at Ross. I learned how to do cash office and be the front end supervisor. Management is good at my job, the managers are easy to talk to and get along with. My co workers are okay, I really don't know them. They can come off ""clicky"" sometimes. There isn't a hard part to my job because I am very familiar with everything I do due to my intensive retail experience. The most enjoyable part is helping customers and making sure they are satisfied."
good,"clean up station , unload truck, process and hang apparel accurately. fun fast paced work place where you'll learn stuff you can use at other places"
good,"ross is great place to work with great benefits, everyone is friendly and happy to be there. the shift are greats and everyone loves to work together as a team."
good,"Learn to be diversified, fast pace environment. Great staff and customers. The company concept of treasure hunt is great."
good,I was a magnific experience working with all my manager and co-workers my manager is great to work with a typical day at work I got there at 9:00 clean all the registers wait for the fedex to bring the high security merchandise  scan it and process it take return give change give associates there break and meal the hardest pert of  my job was dealing with the associates the most enjoyable part of my job was when it was time time for me to leave and I saw my customers so satisty with the service I gave to them
good,I worked as a key carrying member of management for two years at Ross and I honestly loved my job but my store manager felt that her staff should be complacent and happy at the job that they had. To this effect any associate that attempted to better themselves and get ahead were put down. This same manager would talk bad about her employees with them in the same room. I also had a district manager threaten to end my career at Ross for declining to move to the other end of the state for a demotion.
good,"Typical day: balanced cash registers , handled customer service inquiries."
good,"Spent years working for them.  I will speak to this in person if desired.  I worked in almost all operational positions to include tilt tray order fulfillment.  I enjoyed my peer interaction at mid level management, also my associates and other associates in contact with."
good,"i likes working for ross, but hated working for an agency. no benefits. i would go back."
good,"A typical work day was interacting with customers, whom positive or rude I would take the money of and give change to. I kept my area clean, handled duties outside of job description such as handling garbage and sanitation. I learned how to work even faster, to maintain a great composure and my relationship with coworkers was superb. The job being as simple as it was was enjoyable and the hardest part would be the downtime within the store."
good,Work days are usually from 4 to 8 hours.  You get breaks and a lunch depending on how long you work that day.  Management is fun and they are very straightforward with everything.  Customers are the hardest part of the job since it consists mostly of interacting with them and not all of them come with the greatest of moods.
good,"Great company enjoyed learning from the buyers as a data entry assistant.  The company doesn't teach work etiquette to their entry level associates coming into the company.  There is little to no interaction with most departments, not as diverse as a company that caters to a more middle class clientele."
good,"Great Job but they are a company that prefers to keep all their staff under 20 hours, and rarely hire full timers."
good,Usually the day goes pretty fast. I learned that it is good to work in a store that isn't too big. Management and co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was taking the sensors off. The most enjoyable part was the dealing with the customers.
good,All the employees and management are really nice and willing to help you whenever its needed. The hardest part of the job for me would be working mens and kids. Trying to get everything cleaned up and back in its correct place while everyone continuously moves round everything you just straightened is very hard when only given 4 hours.
good,My typical day at ross would consist of frequent movement and speed always had a customer that needed help. Being Supervisor I always had something to deal with but I enjoyed working with my employees and enjoyed the customers
good,"Work place was fine, although was a  bit unorginized. Day to day picking and packing of goods and products wasnt bothersome at all."
good,This really is one of the best companies to work for in my opinion. They have kindly worked around my school scheduled for several years. Enough can't be said for this amazing management team.
good,"I have been a part of the Ross family since October 2013. I have a blast working in such a diverse environment. I work with many different associates and work together to handle and assist many different customers. I am always on my feet, staying longer than I need to and working harder than I expect to. It isn't a bad thing because I enjoy doing my job to the fullest. There are a few concerns when it comes to management as I feel that associates should be compensated for all the hours they put into working hard for the sake of the company. I am a part-time associate. I understand that I am responsible for contributing at least 25 hours of work to Ross; however, I feel that I should be compensated properly if I go above and beyond to do my part in ensuring that Ross is at its best."
good,I learned a great deal about customer service. My managers were very approachable and easy to work for.
good,"A typical day at work would be for me to arrive to my worksite and check in with my Manager on Duty and get my assignment for the day. What I learned is that working at a retail store, especially in fitting room, wasn't as easy as I thought. There had to be put a lot of work and dedication into the job. Management can sometimes call you unexpectedly and call you in to work someone else's shift and when that does happen you have to be ready. Some of my co-workers can be very friendly but some can be pretty hard on you and push you to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is to run various z-racks and do one in less than 15 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job is when management would put together celebrations to celebrate success or if it's someone else's birthday."
good,"When I start in the morning sort out the merchandise , making sure that the merchandise runs out properly and clean the stockroom before my shift ends .i  learn to manage , to make a fun place to work . The management were very conscience and very communicate and professionals . My co workers were very hard workers , team players . The hard part was when I couldn't place the merchandise on the floor due to no space on the floor . My most enjoyable part when All the merchandise was out of stockroom ."
good,"A typical day at work would be to get straight to the job after clocking in. After 2 hours, we go on break. Before break time, we walk around the whole store to look out for suspicious activity and to pick up after customers. I learned how to advertise new merchandise and I gained a lot of customer service experience. I learned how to neatly and quickly organize multiple departments. The hardest part of the job was to complete all assigned tasks in the short amount of time especially when we had so much to receive. The most enjoyable part was catering to customer's needs. My co-workers were very friendly, helpful, and funny."
good,"Ross the place to work as a part time. You really don't get the hours you want or need so its great for a second job. I learned that is not an easy job, their is so much to do in so little time, and pay isn't so great. I think what really kept me there was the customers, I had a lot of customers that would just shop there because I was there. Many whom only spoke Spanish, because the Ross I was at lacked spanish speakers. They felt comfortable with me. Co-workers are always willing to help if need be as are managers. Overall, a great place to work."
good,"I love working at Ross and enjoy the people I work with for the most part. I learned to adapt to working all aspects of retail, from cashier to loss prevention. The managers are reasonable and respectful. I believe the hardest part about working at Ross are the lack of hours from time to time. With my responsibilities that come with life, I would like more consistency with the hours. The greatest part of working for Ross is, of course, the discount!"
good,"Being a front end supervisor was a little bit stressful at times but it was was manageable. I learned a lot from this job, I learned how to manage registers and keep the lines flowing at a fast pace. I had amazing co-workers great environment to work in.  The hardest part of my job was sometimes handling returns, only because some of the judgement calls required managers which would back up my lines but once that was settled it was smooth after that. The most enjoyable part of the day was when we closed because it was quiet and less stressful and we got a chance to make everything look nice for the following day."
good,"A typical work day at Ross was usually fast paced. There was always something to do, and I was taught a great deal from my superiors and fellow co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with customer needs and keeping track of visual status of the sales floor."
good,"I am currently a stock team member here at Ross. My schedule is pretty much the same every week. Monday through Friday, I come in at 7:45 and get off around 12:15. My job is to unload and unpack the new merchandise we receive and get it out in timely manner and it's also a very important thing that we provide great customer service while we are displaying our merchandise. I enjoy doing this job because my co-workers are all great people and we make each others day easier, not only by lightening the mood but also working hard together as a team to get our jobs done. Our General manger and Assistant manager are both new to the company so they are still in the process of learning how to make us better as a team. The hardest part of this job for me would have to be the hour cuts, seeing that I did not have this issue when I first began working here. Other than that I pretty much enjoy what I do on a day to day basis."
good,"I was a cashier, worked fitting rooms, worked customer service, did returns and exchanges, did mark-downs. It was a very laid back atmosphere great for my first job."
good,A day at Ross was crazy! They have some great deals however never enough payroll to manage the store. So that left us always in a bind.
good,Working at Ross Dress for less has a good pace when it comes to shoppers. It was pretty to simple to catch on to the different tasks at hand. Majority of management is new to the store so they are still adapting to the Ross process. Co-workers are reasonable besides the constant loss of workers. The hardest part of the job is trying to fulfill tasks with poor training. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the customers brings different types of attitudes.
good,Quickly Developing is a must. If you enjoy people it is a blast.
good,This job did allow me to work in various positions within the store. I started out in the shipping room unloading and cashiering. Became the lead stockroom supervisor. Worked as the shoe deportment lead. and was choosen often to assist setting up new stores.
good,I answered the phone and filed completed work orders. I worked directly under only one person. The hardest part of the job was trying to the orders in the back room and still make it to the phone in the front office. I got to meet most of my co-workers but they changed day to day depending on if they were needed on a job site. I liked learning about the different types of jobs performed by the company. 
good,"Structured, flexible and friendly working environment. Overall good entry level job to work."
good,You're on your feet all day and it seems like the line is ALWAYS long. the time goes by pretty fast though so it was ok. 
good,Store was always busy with families searching for a must have. I learned that suspects come in all shapes and sizes.
good,I worked stock and early morning shifts. My team was not very diverse so working sometimes felt very uncomfortable. The hours were extremely unstable depending on shipments. But working under the pressure really taught me to work fast but efficiently. Management did not communicate accordingly so mistakes were too common. I can say that Ross was very understanding when it came to uncontrollable circumstances.
good,"the work here your are always busy their is always something to get done. But is ridiculously easy in other stores macys, old navy kohls type stores even target and walmart you have to find and put away each individual items at ross is shirts go here is very simple"
good,"Started at 6AM, unload truck load, assembly line of boxes. Unpacked boxes of clothes, plastic off of clothes, hung clothes up on racks to be ready for display before store opened. I learned how to work with a Team and not just by myself. Management wasn't always available when needed if needed. Co~workers were nice, friendly and helpful when needed. I didn't find anything to be too difficult or hardest part of this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the public."
good,"Advancement was very easy as long as you showed common sense. Management hired anyone who needed a job, even if they were not qualified to work in retail. This company does not fire people because of lawsuits that were dealt to them a few years back. The cliental of Ross are some of the rudest people, but I guess it's like that at any retail store. I was promoted to Stockroom Supervisor of a different store and only worked there for a few months before getting a new job."
good,"Ross is a busy store, with plenty of regulars and tourists looking for cute clothes for less. Plenty of people from their teens to their late 60s (plenty of things for everyone)."
good,Working here wasn't too hard it's just the people that come in the store are the difficult part of the job. The co-workers helped me out when I needed it. My supervisors helped when they could. The experience I had here helped me become more active socially and I built more patience for people who try to rattle my nerves. The hardest part of the job was trying to get through the slow days and dealing with some ludicrous people that came in sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking and getting to know some of the co-workers there.
good,"A typical day at work would be to run racks and clean up clothes, also going to the register and helping people check out. I have learned more about team work and fast skills to be productive at a good pace. The management is very considerate and well managed. My co workers are very fun to work with and help me out if i ever have a question. The hardest part of my job is putting away all the clothes because there is so much! and the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know new people and helping them out."
good,Ross is a great place to work if you want to have job that is flexible with your hours. They will work with you anyway possible. The job security is amazing even through the job crisis they were hiring and the company as a whole was doing very well.
good,The coworkers and management make the company and in my time at Ross it shows. I have grown both as an employee and a person within this company. All the development opportunities are endless.
good,I had a good experience working there but there was no way of moving up unless it was management related. Managers were really good with their associates.
good,"Although it's difficult to move up, managers are aprochable and value forward thinkers. Lots of opinions can be misconstrued however if one is assurtive  and displays their feelings and opinions they are met with empathy."
good,"Ross is a busy workplace, and day by day you are faced with challenges whether its dealing with an upset customer or reaching a goal. Having customer service skills is a must."
good,"My managers were so inviting and really made me feel like a part of the team than another employee, most of them. Corporate constantly proved how disconnected they were from their hands-on employees."
good,"I enjoyed working for Ross for the time i was there, i was given the opportunity to advance in my career and i was given the opportunity to learn new skills and abilities."
good,"Fast pace work environment, friendly associates. Great place to work. Great management team. Strong Collaborative culture. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting awsome customers."
good,"I would not be scheduled very often because they were not making enough money in the offseason, there were times where I only received 8 hours for a whole week even though my availability is open and set for 40 hours a week. was not a bad job, my location just wasn't making a lot of money."
good,"I have grown a lot since I started working for Ross, My people skills and group communications skills are amazing now, and I am working side by side with great managers that care about every individual."
good,"Ross got me ready for other jobs and opportunities in different workplaces. It helped me with communication skills for the future, the situation skills I came upon helped me in different situations that I've came upon."
good,"Simplistic Job, although is can be demanding. It is really based on your time management, and communication tolerance. If you do not press management about employee problem they will tend to bypass them."
good,"They only reason why I’m no longer employed at ""Ross Dress For Less” due to lack of hours Bc they went over on payroll hours and they cut my days to twice a week so I would work only 7 hours"
good,"When I first started working at Ross, I was enticed because the pay starts at $11 an hour and goes up every evaluation, given you do a good job. However, the hours have always been SO inconsistent. One week you may have 28 hours as a part time employee, and the next week they’ll only give you 7. "
good,"Loss prevention was a good Department, operations was interesting did not want to deal with Loss Prevention much. Store Manager worked so hard to help stores"
good,"Started off okay. The longer I was there, the worse management got. Higher up positions were replaced and moved around a lot. Managment was overall lazy."
good,"Ross can be a really stressful place at times. Depending on the location you apply to you, it might be fast paced or slow paced. You will deal with a lot of rude customers. I recommend this job more for people who are trying to get their first job."
good,"The pros: I have been working for Ross since Nov. I have been working in the stock room. We get merchandise from the truck and put it onto the floor. I usually work from 9-2 like 2 days out of the week. I rarely have to work weekends. I really enjoy working with my managers and co-workers. I really like working in the stock room also. They work around your schedule and if you need time off, they give it no questions asked. My co-workers and managers all work hard and are not micro-managers. So that's been the best thing about Ross. "
good,"Within the first 15 minutes of my shift I'm required to do a verbal check-in with the Manger On Duty. I rate my performance for that day based on my whether I'm in dress code and I how I addressed the stores many specific goals for our shortage. "
good,"I worked in the stockroom so I had to go in early in the morning to unload the trailer. I tagged merchandise and put it out on shelves. The coworkers were all cool and the manager was a great guy. I hardly got any hours though, which was the only real bad part of the job. It was simple and relaxed."
good,The job is a very stressful is all about PRODUCTION and more production. Most all the workers cut the lines and don't finish the line they are given. They do all the easy merchandise and leave all the bad ones for the next victim. Not fair and if we complain they don't care all they want is production. So how can we the new ones do production when we are being pushed and shoved to the worse lines.
good,"Ross is a good retail place to work for. They are very willing to work with whatever schedule you are able to work. Most of the time they hire internally so there is always room for growth. Most associates are cross trained to perform multiple duties on an average day. The hardest thing about working for ross is the customers. They are rude, make the store a mess by leaving everything on the ground, and they don't understand ross policies. With the store always being messy, it's hard to feel like you've accomplished something in you day."
good,This is a good company for someone who is in school or etc and can only work part time. They will not work you over 25 hours a week but the pay isn't bad for retail. Also management is great and they can be flexible with hours.
good,I enjoyed working retail and customer service my co-workers were the best. I ama people person so working retail definitely gave  me a customer service experience
good,"Working at Ross can be very fun because a lot of the associates are friendly, but some of the managers aren't. Most of the MOD's are nice, but I've had experiences when others were kind of condescending. You should also have strong customer service skills because you might come across mean and rude customers."
good,"A basic day would consist of long hours. Overtime offered up to 2 hours a day voluntary.  Hot days in the summer, cold days in the winter. great supervisors"
good,"Ross has really great benefits for both full time and part time associates. They are flexible with your schedule, great job if your in school and need extra money. The only downfall is not your management but senior management ex.District Manager can sometimes be rude to regular associates and not very professional."
good,"Great experience , learned a lot of new things. If this is your first job it’s definitely a good fun job to have , you get to be trained to do different tasks your not always stuck doing the same task and you get employee discount"
good,"I would recommend Ross Dress for Less for anyone looking for extra income with time on your hands. I would not rely on Ross Dress for Less as a priority income considering the inconsistency of scheduling.  Depending on the store and management , hours may or may not be scheduled to your liking especially if listed as part-time."
good,"typical work day was clocking in , checking out the area for harsh tags to see if anyone stole . every employee had different positions , some often  rotated depending on how busy the place was . Employee have to stay late nights restocking and picking up clothes from floor and  rehanging the items and putting things back where they belong"
good,"I learned a lot from Ross, I use to have major social anxiety and being cashier really helped me break my shell. Now I'm second stock lead and it's really quick paced but that's in any role as a sales associate. My position taught me how to be responsible, a fast learner with quick hands and how to be a leader. The managers are understanding with availability and hours, overall the people you work with are good people and make work more enjoyable."
good,Ross gives you an opportunity to work with a lot of different people. The volume of the store is very busy so a lot goes on in the operations of the store and you really get a chance to learn how the company works.
good,"The most stressful part of my job is the fact that I am expected to preform so highly and proficiently, yet they Corporate does not value your time and efforts."
good,"It is everything you would expect from a retail job. Lots of organizing duties, and it is always busy because everyone wants discounted goods. Overall, if you are into fashion you would enjoy this job."
good,"The mangers are great, the hours given are not so great. The coworkers make it a great place to be at. You have to have lots of patience with the customers as we tend to get really rude customers."
good,"Pros: fast paced and plenty of room for advancement."
good,"Every day started with a plan in place, a team huddle for communication, assignments were discussed and back up plans were quickly stated. The rules and procedures are clearly laid our for every one to follow so there is no confusion."
good,"Ross is a pretty good place to work if you want to supplement your income. Their hourly rate is pretty good and their hours are flexible enough to work with your schedule. It's a standard retail job, tending to customers and organizing the merchandise in the store. It's a pretty good environment to be in."
good,"It was a good place to work, except the attendance policies. I was sick and got a point when I called off, I was also in the hospital and still got a point. But overall it was a very cool job!"
good,"If you have ever been to a Ross, you know people don't care to put things back where they got them. In a typical workday, you are constantly going through the store and putting things back where they belong, going to cashier when it gets busy, then going back to the floor. If you are closing, you may have to stay 1-2 hours passed closing just sorting and picking everything up. With it being retail, you get to move up quickly but the pay is still not great, but this was back in 2010. They also will move you to all positions in the store so you get experience everywhere and can be moved wherever they need you."
good,"I enjoy working for Ross and would love to stay long term. The pay is just not conducive to staying. I have seen a large turn around in the short time I have been there. The work is easy enough, although it would be a better organized store if the training was better. I have met some good people and made some friends, not a bad place but the pay is low."
good,"Changes happen everyday, just to make the store and you a better person in overall. Quick paste work place, always try to make the customer happy but watch out for stealing."
good,"You & all the workers only have 1 minute to clock in, management isn't that bad, I think the hardest part of the job is carrying very heavy merchandise,working under constant pressure, & being rushed all the time. The most enjoyable part is that we have microwaves to heat up our food, there's lots of overtime, & we get free cold water"
good,"Fast paced but fun environment, always busy, Teamwork is highly encouraged. They give discounts to employees and three times a year they double the discounts."
good,"Do what you're asked, The store is open later than most but there is no folding or anything tedious. It can be boring at times when you are SPS (security)  but it was pretty chill."
good,"To keep the prices low we are always understaffed. You make to perform many duties, daily. Some of the managers are easy to work with, but others don't seem to pull their weight."
good,Ross is an ok company to work for nice people to work with and can move up fast through the company depending on your work ethic and how well you perform while working
good,"A job with Ross, at its core, is an environment where the ability to deal with many different people is a must. It can get very tedious, and sometimes stressful, however, the perk of having a team to work with everyday is very helpful. I have learned to adapt to performing tasks in various ways that change with the company's guidelines. As well as how to manage my time throughout the week with work loads that are never consistent. The hardest part of the job would have to be the vast amount of people that one must service in even the smallest shifts. Yet, the co-workers, and friends, that are made make it still a very enjoyable job."
good,"I've only been working at ross for a month, and I liked it but they were not giving me enough hours, and on top of that they had me work during hours I am not able to work."
good,Lots of hours. But it's a horrible work environment everything is always so busy. People are always so rude also. Constantly complaining about lines. Don't recommend
good,"The idea is to hang it, size it colorize it and sell it as quickly as possible. Merchandise is sometimes rather poorly made. Great place for good deals on furniture."
good,"The store is always busy. There's never enough staff clocked in due to bad scheduling. There's not enough time to make the store look presentable before it gets destroyed again. Managers try, sometimes, but don't often end up being much help. Everyone is overworked."
good,"Ross is a great company to work, there are interesting people. The hours are extremely earlier if you are on first shift. The advancements opportunities are there but only if you are willing to move to another shift which in some cases are difficult to do. But overall it's a good experience."
good,I recommend this company to others. Holiday time payments. It's a busy place for opening and closing associates. Customers are friendly. Stock room associates work extra hard to get the merchandise to the floor.
good,Hard to be Stock room manager because you have to Hit productivity and you have to make sure all of your associates are happy plus your manager. You seriously have to multitask.
good,"Decent job. Its just a constant cycle of picking up after people,covering breaks and back up cashier. The managers are very nice and very flexible with your school schedule."
good,I was active duty status. I joined for many things but the top 2 reasons are traveling and meeting new people to build my social skills and network ability.
good,Great place to work because of the work-life balance.  We get Summer Fridays and all national holidays off.  We even get birthday and anniversary off.  Bagel Fridays are a hit!
good,"Great people, easy work, but little hours. Work is challenging at times but it is worth doing, provides you with a better sense of orginization. Great location."
good,Ross has been a pleasant work experience.  Staff and management are great. The only downside is the lack of hours which change every week. A great part time job if you have no other obligations.
good,Management was not competent. Easy place to work. Nothing too difficult. spent many hours in OT because things were not properly managed and executed.
good,"a typical day at work is pretty quiet up until noon and lasts until around 5, depending on the day. co-workers are pretty enjoyable from my viewpoint but not everyone gets along all the time. the hardest part of the job, for me, is being an acting FES with barely enough man-power on the sales floor. Breaks and mealtimes often coincide and there are days when some people do not get breaks/meals and have to leave early. the most enjoyable part though, is when things go smoothly and even the customers seem happy with how quickly they are able to get in line and processed by a cashier. although my particular store has undergone a few changes in management since I've been there, there is no doubt that management has gotten better at communicating to each other and to their employees and so far shows signs of improving even more so."
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at Ross is, the fact that the managers are always willing to teach a associate something new each time you're on the clock that you didn't know."
good,"You learn so much in such a short period, but theres also chances to keep moving up. there are also good people to work with."
good,"Everyday is the same. Aggressive customers in customer service and in the Fitting rooms. Run racks/ go backs. "
good,Retail is always fast paced but never dull or boring when working for Ross !! Always fun and friendly environment to be in with customers and fellow coworkers .
good,"Your skills will be utilized by supervisors if shown"
good,Enjoyable work place friendly coworkers and management also great place to meet people friendly customers come in each day. Great way to learn about reatail.
good,"I love Ross, the managers are amazing, as well as the other workers. The only reason I left was because I was going from Fallbrook to Oceanside just to work 4 hours, 3 times a week."
good,"Ross is a great place to learn and develop yourself for improvement as well as promotion. The company provides the necessary tools an employee seeks to be successful. I enjoyed the challenges and constructive criticism, It made me a better manager and leader for the company and for the team. The hardest part of my job was limited options for creativity. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting guest as well as reaching goals set by upper management and their counterparts."
good,I was Blessed they gave me an Opportunity to work for their Company.. Enjoyable part  taking care of the Customers.. i Love Retail and People!! personal reason for leaving..will share that with the Employer whom Decides to hire me:).. Wasn't allow to say Merry Christmas!
good,"I enjoyed working here, but not all members are consistent with tasks given, which may lead to you adding on to your list of tasks. Management is okay for the most part cant complain. A little unorganized, but overall good job."
good,"Nice, easygoing place. Not too many micromanagers when I worked there. Although, they could give part timers a tab bit more than TWENTY HOURS A WEEK. You can't even buy a pizza from little caesars with that kind of income.Checks are like $200. ABSOLUTELY DEPRESSING. But overall, eh....."
good,"Ross has rude customers. They're the sole contributor to the fact that Ross is not a fun place to work. Unless you're super lucky, you'll likely be understaffed, and unable to keep up with the customers mess! The only thing that makes Ross worthwhile is the level of friendship and understanding that comes from the mutual dislike of the place and its customers with your fellow associates. Dont get me wrong, theres plenty of nice people that makes the day better, but theres always the entitled rude person (you know what im talking about). Any one thats worked retail knows it can suck, so we support each other. If it werent for my awesome team members, i wouldve quit long ago! Decent turn over, so if you need something to pay the bills, this place will be ok and fairly easy to get in. Its the co-workers that really make any of it worth it, even the managers can be pretty awesome."
good,This is a friendly work place as well as a fast-paced environment when everything needs to be done in a timely manner. There are many opportunities to grow in experience and learn with different positions to choose from. Most often there are issues with communication and discipline for those who don't show up on their scheduled shifts.
good,"for part time work its great."
good,"Good place to start career and get a foot into the corporate world but the compensation, work life balance, and culture is lackluster"
good,My job at ross was really simple as soon as i clocked in i had to greet customers at the door and i would make sure that my presence was know by all customers. My job was to report any incidents and train all employees on safety topics of the week.
good,it was fun unloading trucks and processing clothing to be put on the floor that day and it was a strategy job when it came to making sure u make the right moves to complete everything in the stock room in one day. i learned how to time manage a lot better and how to control a larger group of associates. my co workers were a joy to work along side with and the enjoyed me as there manager. the hardest part of the job was not knowing exactly what was coming on truck and was either over payroll or under payroll. the most enjoyable part of this job was the whole job its self.
good,"at the store I worked at the need for communication was one of the major things that could have used some improvement."
good,"Overall good company. They worked with me to get 40 hours, while I was in school. The starting pay was pretty good for retail. Some management was incompetent, but that's everywhere. I think that since I worked there the stores appearance and standards have gone down. Even when I worked there you could see a decrease in organization and cleanliness in certain areas. Co-workers at the time would were sketchy and throw you under the bus when you weren't looking. I liked going in and balancing the cash office and then doing different tasks everyday to help in different departments."
good,"I worked in one of the biggest and busiest Ross' on the border. You had to have good time management, and be able to have a great sense of urgency working there. You can't let things get to you , people are messy. I really liked it and management was great, I learned a lot from my store manager."
good,"Ross will show some appreciation by offering us double discount days. I almost sometimes feel guilty having $300 purchases and only paying $180, it makes me wonder how the company makes its revenue. The stuff isn't exactly expensive as it is. Its not really a good job but its not bad either its just okay. There needs to be improvements though. (This is my store, each store is ran differently)"
good,"Ross is a great starting company to work for. With hard work moving up in the company is attainable. Management and co workers are all very friendly and efficient. Ross is all about efficiency, Almost every task that you will do will be timed. A typical day at work for A FES (Front end supervisor) would consist of Setting up registers for cashiers, Answering phone calls, Making store announcements, Costumer service. Basically just keeping the front end of the store intact. The hardest part of the job honestly is trying to prevent theft. The more theft in the store the less payroll and without payroll there are no hours. The most enjoyable part of my job most definitely seeing how we all work together like a well oiled machine."
good,"Hardest part is retaining associates and keeping the store clean. Turn over is really high so you have to really try to connect with the associates to get them bought in and to stay. The people there are great, upper management seems to really care about you as a person. Advancement is really easy with the company."
good,"My primary work is in the cash office. Balancing the registers. deposit, and safe, and till in the drawers."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of cleaning your work area, getting the cash register ready, making sure you have enough money to handle change or large purchases. I learned a lot about customer interaction, how you can make their experience better because you are the last person they deal with before leaving the store. Management was good, they were always there to help you when you needed it, whether it was needing help with getting money for the cash register or answering questions for yourself or the customers. The co-workers were really helpful, they will help you when you need it and always gave positive feedback. The hardest part about the job would be learning where all the different sections of clothes were and pointing them out to the customers. The most enjoyable part about the job is when you get customers coming to you with their purchases and are surprised about all the good clothes Ross had to offer."
good,"Sales Goals, Loss Prevention Audits, Sales Floor Presentation, competitions amongst stores, monthly Bonus / Incentives if goals are met, and performs other duties as assigned by district Manager."
good,"I like my job with Ross I like to go in early and count the money and make everything balance. After I finish the Cash Office I go work in the fitting room and I get to meet and work with the customers. My"
good,"While working at Ross, I was the cash office manager and also a supervisor for customer service. This gave me great skills as I handled accounting and inventory control and also learned the basics of management!"
good,Great way to establish retail and customer service. Scheduling is flexible and managers are willing to work around school schedules. They also work towards fixing complaints and making the store comfortable for both employees and customers.
good,"This Job was cool, people were fun, job advancement was there just the lack of hours was not there"
good,Every shift we all have fun while working. The entire staff gets along and works together so well. The Management teams works with the associates instead of dictating tasks. The most difficult part of the job is remembering to clock out for the end of your shift because your having so much fun while working.
good,"I worked here because I thought I would be able to stay at this job and not eventually quit after a month. I was completely wrong. I loved the atmosphere of working here, and all of the managers were understanding, yet firm. I learned a lot here, and everything is pretty fast paced. The pay sucked, but I'm glad that it was based from experience. I started there at $7.50, I was expecting a little more, but what are you gonna do, right? Every week I was generally scheduled between 16-23 hours. You received pay checks bi-weekly, but for a 18 hours one week, and 20 on the next, what is that going to do for me? I actually wished I did stay on, and got a second job. I didn't have a problem being trained there, but sometimes I was put to blame on different mishaps that happened during store hours after I had left. Everything is pretty simple and repetitive, I just wish the pay was a little more. Also, some of the customers CAN be a little demanding, which I did expect to some degree working at a store like this. I did enjoy the discounts considering clothing in my size are always a little more expensive."
good,"Working as a cashier/sales associate was not challenging at all , i would actually check customers out and do returns , get customers a dressing room. and i would stock clothes and other items were they needed to be but my main job was handling cash and making sure i would doing my best by keeping my draw correct."
good,"My day at work usually was geart, my co-workers was friendly and  very dedicated to the work they did. the management was good, the most enjoyable part was i had bo problem on the job is my day's went be well and i made everyone satisified."
good,great store everyone worked together and got along great. plenty of product in the store just not enough hours to give to employees in the store.
good,"Cleaned exterior and interior of restaurant using equipment such as cleaning solutions, mops, brooms, and cleaning cloths to maintain sanitation, health and safety standards for customers and employees"
good,Did all my assignments as told. Always made sure all costumers were helped in every way.
good,Fast pace friendly workplace. Always some thing new to learn. Good benefits.
good,"Ross is a great starter job. It's busy, fast paced, very diverse and the management team cares about their associates. Working retail you learn patients and time management."
good,"* A typical day at Ross was routine. You know what your duties are."
good,"Ross Dress for Less offers advancement and growth opportunities for those who are hard-working and willing to learn.  The difficult part is the demanding retail schedule.  However, there is a great team environment and great vision within the corporate environment."
good,"A typical day at work would begin in punching in to start work then going to the front end to see which section you are assigned to recover and what cash register you are to be working at that day. While working at Ross I learned to have alot of patience as well as be organized. I also learned how to read the different item tag to see which part of the store they belonged in. Working at Ross was hard but fun at the same time. The hardest part was trying to keep the ailse clear of mess, because as soon as you straighten the sections customers would mess it right back up. What i enjoyed the most was working with the customers and learning spanish words daily."
good,"Typical day consisted of go backs, sizing, and dealing with customers. Management was hard on the workers, gave us more work than what we should be doing, but I enjoyed the company of my co-workders."
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross. Employees and customers are treated well, but the hours were very long. I enjoyed the high energy atmosphere; there was never a dull moment."
good,good job. was only a temporary job that ended due to me finding another job
good,"A typical day at Ross includes ringing up customers, processing returns, marking down reduced items, handling customer problems and complaints. I've learned how to oversee a team with the help of managers. The most unpleasant part of the job would be the ""lunch time rush"". The most enjoyable part of my job is working together with my coworkers to ensure a pleasant shopping exprience for the customers."
good,"Unloaded frieght from truck daily, worked in stock room, so pretty fast paced, I enjoyed seeing the new products coming in. Was called to cashier frequently, set up displays."
good,"The managers that i worked with were professional. They allowed for extensive opportunities for promotion within the store. However, higher management (District Manager) was very unfair with pay raises and did not want to pay employees what they are worth."
good,It’s worth the pay. That’s about it. It can be tedious but hourly is cool. I didn’t get many hours so it was basically a hobby for me but y’all would like it probably I think
good,I worked as a seasonal and it was hard. I was left to work last shift which was the worst. Costumers made such a mess. We would close our doors at 12 and we would be on our way home at 2 am or so. On the days leading to Christmas we closed at 130 a.m we didnt get home till 3am or so. It's very faster pased. You're everywhere going up and down. Management was alright. They did have some favoritism for shifts worked.
good,Ross Is A Great Place To Work At. You Just Have To Be Motivated & Willing To Work Despite Your Job Description. Sometimes You Might Not Work At The Register You Might Have To Stock But It’s All For The Better
good,When it gets really busy. Sometimes the customers leave a big mess in the store that it all has to be all picked up at the end of the night and sometimes it cant all be picked up and fixed and ready for the next day because its all to much.
good,"I actually like working at Ross, (at least my store) everyone treats everyone like family and they are willing to work with you on your availability. Just make sure you’re available weekends, it’s a must for this job. "
good,Good place for a flexible job with the manager being helpful in finding the best most satisfying position for a productive and positive employee. Good team effort.
good,"I would clock in to work and start unboxing the materials in the box. Making sure they are tagged and priced and ready to be stocked. The materials would include cloths, shoes and household items."
good,"If you need hours go somewhere else this place won't give them to you very very little hours. They don""t recognize the people who do work and praise the ones who don't."
good,"i was a cashier, and when the line wasn't overflowing i had a hard time trying to please all the managers. there were about 5 and they all wanted things done differently so that was one thing i hated. i liked working weekend mornings the most because they went by so fast because there were so many customers.  This jobs taught me great customer service skills and i even picked up some spanish, especially how to say numbers in spanish. the most enjoyable part of the job was that the work team was like a family, they would celebrate birthdays and job anniversary. on busy days like black friday the managers would even buy everyone lunch or dinner"
good,"The time I was there, I felt that they could have paid more. don't know what the payment is now.  I liked working there but hated to clean the store after closing."
good,The managers are very friendly they are willing to work with you if you have any issued with your schedule and don't mind answering questions about the job.
good,"Part-time job/ work weekends only/ very flexible ,been there over a year now.  Looking for full time employment.  Very close to my home.  Nothing else to say"
good,"Cleaning the store,helping customers,and bringing items to sales floor. Learned to work hard,discipline, and a team player. Have great listening skills and be patient."
good,"Ross is a great place to work for school kids are for someone who just need a little bit of income, Are job to started. and maybe it be come a career for someone. There are lots of things to learn from working at Ross Stores."
good,"I was really good and picking with the gun on the wrist got 100+ bonuses..that was the problem,when I was at  a high percent they will send me to another department I wasnt good at so that my percent will go down ."
good,"Great job to get warehouse experience."
good,"I like this job, my coworkers were very nice, but the manager was most of the hard on us. She was good manager. The hard part of this job is when we have to unload the trucks."
good,Fast paced place to work. There is never a down time. Always something to do. Always find some great things to buy with our discount card. Work with some great people.
good,I worked with the receiving team unloading trucks and putting out freight I loved this job I started during the holiday when there were tons of hours I was hired to stay and the hours started falling which surprisingly I did not mind because I enjoyed the work environment  at the start I expressed SEVERAL times that I wanted to learn other parts of the store and was told I would but it never happened they even lost a member of the pricing team I inquired about the position and again I was told that I could but once again I was never put on they lost someone in the fitting room and of course I was not needed again I finally asked about a full time position or a way I could have full time hours by working in other parts of the store that I had expressed interests in numerous times and I was taken off the schedule completely so while I did enjoy working here if you don’t have any plans of advancing I would not suggest this job for you if you like mundane day to day work you will thrive here
good,Hours were dependent on when trucks would arrive for offload. Great teamwork between employees. Great pay rate for just a department store job and decent hours per week.
good,I liked it was a cool little job never used discout though they actually have very nice things for personal or your household just takes time to go through the store.
good,It is a great environment and fast paced. Efficiency is important. it is also a good opportunity to learn how to run a store and learn how to be a leader. there are positions for everyone and they do not discriminate.
good,I worked in back stock which was a pretty good job. It was super fast paced and we had to get jobs done at a certain. Overall great place to work and management was really nice.
good,It is a very tough job  for those who do not like to have something to do every day. There is never a day where their isn't something to do. It is a good place to work in and have experience in.
good,It was okay. They time you at the register to make sure you're fast and efficient ringing out people transactions. They give you a percentage which shouldn't really dictate how well a worker you are. Since everything is discounted the floor would be in disarray as the night ended. I was happy I left.
good,"As a cashier, I'll spend most of the time up in customer service. There I check customers out and complete returns. I have to work fast and friendly, as I'm rated on my performance. I also have to work back in the fitting rooms and out on the sales floor - putting back clothes and merchandise, and organizing the store. "
good,"I loved the fast pace environment, the customers id come across were generally very friendly. I had no quarrels with the management. But I did witness plenty of unfairness with my fellow associates when working here. There's a lot of  favoritism with the general manager. He has his favorites that could do no wrong."
good,"I have learned with my current job to always take notes when meeting with peers and ask questions if you don't understand a task, stay organize and time manage your daily work."
good,"Ross is a job that has a very flexible work schedule. Management always took care of their employees. It was fast paced and always a task to complete so there was no slacking there. The job was fun and stress free which is another positive aspect of the job. There was not room for advancement there, which would be the only negative aspect of the job.  I would say the work was fair there was no hard task, only to make sure the work was done correctly or re fixing mistakes made by others.That is just part of the job though we are a team based corporation. I enjoyed the fact that the store was a family and we accomplished a lot together as a team."
good,I like to work hard and friendly with my coworker and im hard working women and hat experience with working with different people and in a different envormental
good,It was a quick paced enviorment. Worked 3rd shift and got 5 hours. The job was easy. All I did was scan clothes and packed them up. Really easy like I said.
good,this was a fun place to work .its overall a good company the management just sucks at the location i was working at they have good work hours and the pa was ok
good,There is a big discount a few times a year. Did not like being timed on register. I worked in the office and changing rooms mostly. I did not like that I had to have all of my tattoos covered.
good,"An typical day at work was am regular day, it was fast and easy"
good,"Just keeping the store looking presentable, preventing theft, ringing up customers, and sometimes using your opinions to help customers deciding between which outfit to buy."
good,Loved my managers but supervisors not so much.  As a part time employee didn't get much hours so I wasn't paid as much as I needed.  But overall good first job for experience.
good,Ross is a decent place to work. Management (especially upper level) can be frustrating at times as no one seems to know what the requirements and guidelines actually are. Other than that the people are great and I enjoyed my time here.
good,"Typical day at work punch in, clean up on your way to your duty station, check your cash, at the end of the day you have to clean up your work station as well as entire store"
good,On a typical day at work my duties are to walk the sales floor checking for any signs of internal or external signs of theft. As well maintain a command presences at the Front entrance and exit.
good,I love my job. Great benefits! The prices are great as well.  I try not to purchase something everyday. I have recommended this job to a lot of people.
good,"Well established company, but works in off price model, so everyone is expected to perform high with tight payroll constraints. Domino effect issues in the stores due to tight metrics."
good,"- A typical day at work is lines out the door,Alot of customers . Alot of shop lifting , SO you always have to be on your toes"
good,"I worked lost prevention which involved scouting for potential theft and informing the other associates. The lost prevention department was hard to mix with the other employees because of potential internal theft, but it was still a fun work environment."
good,"Working at Ross has not been my most fun job, however it was what I would assume your typical minimum wage job to be. It was a very fast pace job, however fairly simple. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with angry customers in which you must basically take whatever they say to you with a smile on. Other than that most customers tend to be friendly."
good,It was a fun place to work. I love working there shopping there. and my co-workers. But there was one manger i didn't like to work with.he alway had me doing things i wasn't able to do cuz i was with child at the time everything elays was good
good,"A typical day would be head to customer service, figure out the scheduling for all of my closer's lunches and breaks. then proceed to help customers with their purchases, or any issues which they may have, ensure that all of my employees are proceeding ideally with their departments. once we close the store down it is my job to ensure the front end is clean and help clean up any other department that my need it."
good,The pay is pretty decent but they ask a lot of the Assistant Store Managers with little time to accomplish things. The environment is okay depending on your co-workers.
good,Very nice place if your young and love clothes. I worked in the dressing room department and it was very safe pace kind of position. Didn't make a lot of hours but I was there for 3 years and I loved being able to keep in touch with the new designers that came out on the floor.
good,"i love my job. easy and love my coworker. "
good,A typical day isn't bad and actually very easy going. Management and coworkers were very friendly and helpful. The workload was simple and very manageable. Time management and efficiency were definitely encouraged.
good,"A typical day at work required working the cashier and ringing up customers purchases with a time limit at a fast pace to avoid long lines. Handle money and credit card payments, maintain store cleanliness and do basic housekeeping chores. Other job duties may require to work the fitting room. One of the hardest parts of the job was being efficient as a cashier to handle to long lines during the Christmas Holidays. Another hard part of the job was restoring the store for closing. An enjoyable part of this job was the delight of customers finding unbeatable deals. Another enjoyable part were the work parties at the end of the month to reward us for our hard work."
good,"good job, had work to do everyday. day  went by fast. i can see myself working there again.  The co workers was good to work with and the management kept you up to date on the job."
good,"A typical day at work was  semi-busy. I learned alot of things  from working there .The co-workers were nice to work with, and I think that the hardest part of the job was when the customers would talk to me rude some time over the phone,but I would never argue back with the customer. I also think the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and co-workers."
good,"I enjoy working in big box retailers such as Ross because of the daily activity with team building, and I pride myself in the utmost merchandising of trends for max profitability. Along with my team, we created a fun working atmosphere."
good,"Busy days, lots of work, great co workers, good discounts. A lot of work goes unrecognized, and the customers can be mean, but that's just retail."
good,"With the constant changes in stock, you learn all areas of retail. Fun work environment and fast paced. Pay is slightly under-scaled but the experience you gain is great for developing."
good,"At Ross, if you work hard and show that you are dependable, there is great opportunity for promotion. They are really big on promoting from within and are willing to give anyone that chance as long as they work hard."
good,"The environment is wonderful; I've met so many people through-out my two years at Ross, however, they have come and gone. Many have quit because it is a rough job, not necessarily doing the job, but it is an on going process. the relationship between employees and customers are down the drain. Management, as humorous as they are, most of the time they don't help out. Instead they push us employees to do their dirty work for them, and when you push someone to their limits they are bound to quit, luckily for me i have gained so much patience over the years. As for my co-workers, they are the best, I know who they are, and they know who I am -- simple as that. The most enjoyable part is being able to manage all my cashiers and sales floor associates. I've been there for so long that they see me as a manager now, ask me questions, what their duties for the day is, and trusting me with money."
good,Friendly and fast pace environment . Excellent customer service provided and a great team playing group. Leaning on one another for support. A open door policy with management :). The hardest part of this job is just having a few customers complain from time to time but i handle this with a kind word and patience. The most enjoyable part is see the customers smile once they r taken care of.
good,"Prevented store losses using awareness, attention to detail and integrity. Maintained up-to-date knowledge of store policies regarding payments, returns and exchanges. Organized weekly sales reports for the sales department to track product success. Created new processes and systems for increasing customer service satisfaction. Cross-trained and provided back-up for other customer service representatives when needed. Managed quality communication, customer support and product representation for each client. Guaranteed positive customer experiences and resolved all customer complaints."
good,great job to work at but had problem with supervisor.  When you first work there its great you get use to everybody but then they start moving on. You get new supervisor who really don't know what their doing. It just complicated and they sometime messed up my schedule.
good,"I had to deal with a verity of different cultures of people and characters. Tourist from all over the world as it was a touristic place.key West in general is a fun little town and Ross was truly the only store in town to find everything for amazing prices.I had to use my languages often, French and Spanish mostly.My bosses were fabulous, I loved all of theme, very real and human people, modern thinking and a great sense of humor.I worked non stop all day, it was very busy, time flied by fast , tremendous amount of people coming in and out of store all day everyday.The pay was not great but the atmosphere compensated for it. I truly enjoyed my time working there."
good,"Very few stores in the Arkansas market, full time positions are rarely open.  Minimum wage to start. Management team very busy.  There is never enough cashiers. Store is hard to keep clean due to customer traffic. People who work there are friendly. Once a month we have lunch paid."
good,"A typical day at work, I start at 4:45 in the morning and get off at 9:15 am. Hard-tagging and hanging up merchandise was what i was mostly doing. I can't really pinpoint what I learn but I know i didn't think it was so much to retailing. My manager is awesome always trying to help his employees in any way possible. I'd say the hardest part of my job is waking up at 4:00am. the most enjoyable was being able to leave early and have the rest of the day to myself."
good,"Ross is a very friendly environment. Great customer service and also great working environment. Management is great , never had a problem with any co-workers. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers."
good,"-A typical day at work is very upbeat, very fast pace job."
good,I worked in the fitting room and the shoe department. I had to resign because the manager started to get upset at me because of too many mismatched shoes.
good,The overall workplace was usually hectic. We were always understaffed or always had call ins. I was pregnant at the time and it made it a lot harder to get everything done. there were days I got no break or lunch break. It just finally took a toll on me
good,My day starts off by setting up the stockroom so my team can unload the truck. I have to fill the white board out so when the team comes in they know the goal for that day. We then start to unload and process the merchandise. I as stock lead have to keep track of everyone's productive for the day on a tracking sheet. My management team is not very supportive so it makes my job that much harder.
good,"My experience working at Ross Distribution Center changed my life because it was the first job they gave me. I learned how to work faster and my coworkers weren't afraid to show my new ways to obtaining my bluechip (extra money, based on percentage). There was also a lot of young people that myself included, ennjoyed the job until I had to move to a different location."
good,"This position was a new beginning for me. Standing on your feet for nine hours in the same position was somewhat hard for me. I was a little unsure of this position at first but I was always willing to include a new skill. While being a lost prevention specialist I was able to learn communication skills, and teach preventive precautions to staff and employees. The hardest part of  his job would have to be on the ""strategy"". When there was a suspicious customer in the store you must keep a close eye on the customer with a radio and give a description. Customers would become irate and at times their behavior takes over. But to be honest I understand why.When a manager or employee calls and you have to be present within seconds. Then standing in front of a customer giving a description is embarrassing. "
good,"A typical day at work was in the fitting room where I clocked into my shift and the previous employee told me where the clothes were separated for the department on the sales floor along with how many people were in the fitting rooms. Also told me who had carts waiting out in front of the fitting room. And as I took over I separated the clothes in the fitting room on a running rack so another employee could put them away for me as I counted customers items as they came in and out of the fitting room. Also keeping the fitting rooms clean and tidy. Working at Ross I learned how to multi-task 3-4 jobs at one time because a lot of the time there wasn't enough employees working to help the associate in the fitting room. My co-workers were awesome. I worked there for 2 years so a lot of the employees I worked with I actually became friends with and still talk to everyone in a while. They were always hard-working and willing to help me in the fitting room if they could. The hardest part of my job was dealing with un-happy customers in the fitting room but typically it was something small and not a big deal. The most enjoyable part of my job was working somewhere I could shop which I love to do and Ross carries shoes, under-garments, jr and women's clothes and much more. So I was always shopping on my breaks and after work."
good,it is fun but the pay is way to low should raise it up a notch and bad manegment most of the time
good,"I was the engine that kept this Ross running at it's prime. Anything that needed to be done, as far as apparel, I made happen. I would be constantly ""flexing"" and ""snaking"" all apparel, which means moving all clothes, pushing them down the rack, making room for new apparel, or closing gaps in the racks when a particular area was low on merchandise. I covered breaks and lunches for the front end supervisor and fitting rooms. Nights I closed, I helped back-up on register while constantly keeping my section recovered and clean, so when the store was closed the least amount of time as possible would be needed to make my area perfect and ready for open the next day. Once my area was finished, it was my responsibility to be sure the other apparel departments were clean and recovered to my managers and my standards. The hardest part was getting into projects and not having the time to finish. However, whatever I could not finish the first day I started, I would finish first thing the day after. I loved the constant change, there was always something to be done. I was never bored and could not say I felt I had a ""slow"" day. I was always moving and smiling and contributing to new ideas and improving my store on a daily basis."
good,"As a retail associate, it's not a difficult job however it's stressful to have to deal with some of the people that come through there. Even though I'm sure you find that anywhere. At Ross, they treat you like family and the management will do anything for you as long as you do the best as an employee to them."
good,Cash balancing for the day. Leading the Floor for Customer Service Department.
good,"Ross is very good about hiring people who are just starting out, and they teach you basic job functions. They are very flexible with students."
good,I worked 3rd shift which was part time and the work was fast paced and simple. Theres opportunities to work part time but get overtime pay on your checks by clearing out or exceeded a product limit.
good,Working at Ross was very hands on I loved it. I was always kept busy. Loved working and helping with the customers. They always had something new for me to do and learn.
good,"Ross , dress for less is very affordable for anyone "
good,"I worked at the Beverly location. I was working the graveyard shift and also some day shift as a sales associate. Overall, great place to work but not good pay."
good,"I really enjoyed this place of employment they have room for advancement always offer extra hours, and great staff and management to work with. I just did not like the holiday hours I believe it is to late to be open."
good,"Customer service, I did exchanges and returns. You will always learn something at ross, management was good always there for help great environment work place."
good,It’s nice environment with great set up co workers it’s just the customers are a little rude. A lot of recovering such as picking stuff off the floor and a lot of go backs.
good,The policies need to be improved and the theft at the store was a bit ridiculous but I enjoyed working with people. It was the main reason why I worked there.
good,"I’ve been working at Ross for going on a year as of May, 2019. I started off in stock and moved to fitting rooms , I was then promoted to sps. The pay raise is decent not much , but it definitely does make a difference. All of the managers are nice and understanding."
good,"I enjoyed working there and I would tell others to join the team I learned a lot working there and made life long friendships I started as a cashier and made my way up to markdown leader I also learned how to stock the sales floor , floor layouts,brand guides,and cleaning the sales floor"
good,Fast and steady paced work environment with friendly employees and upper management as well. Production based work skills with room to grow in the company
good,Busy Retail store.  I learn more about safety of customers. Management was always very busy as well. The hardest part of the job was standing 8 to 10 hours a day.  I love meeting the different people from all over Katy and surrounding areas.
good,"Ross is one of the best jobs I have ever had. Job was great in the beginning but once more people came on the less hours everyone got. The job would be perfect if you are a student and need a part time job, but not if you need a wage to support yourself. The schedules are super flexible the only problem is the schedule gets made the night before so there is no knowing exactly when you are working. Some weeks you will get 20-25 some weeks you get 10-15. That is the reason why I left and only suggest Ross if you get a second job."
good,I enjoyed working in the fast pace environment. Co workers were always helpful. Management was outstanding. The job got difficult at times but nothing you couldn't overcome. The position is challenging and would be pleased to work for this company again and explore the other departments they have to offer.
good,"Only part time positions everyone is hired as a temp but if you work hard with a great attitude then you are able to secure a job. I am able to do every position in the store besides area supervisor it was really easy to get the training I needed and be very valuable to the store. "
good,a typical day at work was always a new experience because you always met new people. I learned about customer service. management was great.workplace culture was enforced on a daily which is good.hardest part of my job was rude customers. most enjoyable part of my job was the great employees
good,really enjoyed my time there even though some of the supervisors had horrible attitudes . overall it was pretty cool enjoyed the Christmas employee discount.
good,"For me it was good while I was going to college, because the hours are very flexible. My coworkers were amazing. The work is easy, but the pace is very fast. Other than that I can't say I enjoyed working there. If it isn't the holidays then you are most like working with a skeleton crew. Because of store policies, you are constantly getting yell at my customers. I can't blame them that they don't want their hold on the floor or that they can't take accessories into the fitting room."
good,Ashley was a good and positive caring boss. It was something different that I learned. I organized everything I learned sections are colored coded.
good,A typical day at ross dress for less was very wonderful.  I enjoyed working for ross.  It was my first job and I did my very best to keep that job.  I did just about every job title at ross as far as working in management.   My co-workers were team players we worked as a team to keep the store steady flowing and making sales.
good,great place to work when you are going to school they will work around your class time and if you work in the stock room you get holidays and weekends off!!
good,"A great place to work as a stepping stone. Flexible schedules, and management cares about employees. The particular store I was working at was under-staffed which made the store looked messy and lack great customer service."
good,"I loved my management and my coworkers but the hours were terrible, some weeks I would only get 4 to 8 hours. All together a nice job but not a job to live off of."
good,great starter job for students that are in college.  Great work/life balance. Pay could be better.  Great advancement options.
good,"Fast paced, check customer out, answers any questions a customer may have. Answer the telephone, do layaways and returns. I learned how to talk to customers in a respecful way, always putting them first. I learned how to be a responsible worker and to be dedicated and have good attendance. My bosses and the management were great to work with and I felt they treated us all equally. The hardest part was trying to be in three places at one time. The most enjoyable part was pleasing the customers and working with great people."
good,"Woke up 5am, sorted the truck, sized clothes afterwards, super boring... coworkers were amazing though. I left because it was very boring being in the back all day"
good,I reviewed and printed out and  corrected shipping labels from customer orders to for items to be shipped out to customer correctly
good,Working for this company has taught me alot about being the best I can be and more when it comes to serving my customers.
good,great work place. I love the discounts we get. customers make a mess but its a decent place to work.
good,I learned how to use a pallet jacket. How to use a RF gun and other electronic equipment. Management is always on the floor checking making sure everything is running smoothly for us.
good,It was an ok place my first boss was an awesome lady the second boss well not so much
good,"ross is fast paced, you have to be willing to work and have great customer service."
good,Well when i started working on my first day it was pretty amazing but tiring at the same time because i had to mark merchandise such as clothing and other accesories. I got along with all my co workers they seemed very nice and thoughtful in a way because they would always help me if i needed anything. The hardest part of the job was when i had to work on the pallots and carry boxes. I loved working on the aisles because i would always mark prices on toys and bags and other types of accesories.
good,"But the pay isn't worth the daily assignments. Nothing else to tell, it just sucks to clean up after people."
good,I started working at Ross my senior year of high school and I worked as a cashier there. The hardest part of my job was working on weekends and havig to quit the choir and cheer squad at my school. I made a lot of new friends at Ross.
good,For the most part all of the employees are very friendly but the store is open very late and if you are on closing shift you stay at least an hour after close and sometimes more. By the end of the work day the store is usually very messy and it takes a while for the few remaining employees to recover the store so we would end up leaving around 12:30- 1 am which is hard on students that might have class the next morning
good,"Limited hours, not meant to be a dependable job. I worked there for one month; hours started off 25-50 a week. Then 5-18 a week. Most definitely was not consistent with hours due to truck load."
good,I really enjoyed working here but i only received up to 10 hours a week which is not enough for bills. The management wasn’t too bad but wanted you to do a lot of work in a small amount of time.
good,"Always walked in and be greeted by everyone."
good,"Loved working  there and would love to again.. good area .. nice people.  Fast low prices  discount and more Christmas  is fun a fun time to work. "
good,"Utilized electronic cash register to assist customers with purchase. Handled cash. Resolved customer issues, giving assistance and direction when needed. Returned merchandise to designated area, ensuring inventory counts."
good,"Had a decent management team, but managers would come and go frequently. Benefits were good, enjoyed double discount days and would use it for clothes"
good,A typical work day was very fast paced you really had to be on your a game especially on the weekends. I enjoy working as a team communication  was the key to an successful day. Working together made the day fly by.
good,management was not bad or unfair the job was honestly very tedious but I was stuck behind the service desk all day and for me that was extremely unpleasant
good,"Ross was a great working environment, but it doesn't give you enough hours.The managers were very friendly and I loved the coworkers, but sometimes it could get boring. Definitely if you were working fitting room."
good,"I loved working the cash room, I like math and working with numbers.  I enjoyed supervising.  I loved organizing clothes, the office.  I loved being the supervisor and making decisions."
good,"I loved my job and all of the customers that I met when I worked at Ross. I wish that I could have had a better relationship with the managers, but my coworkers made going to work worth it."
good,"It was a decent job to work as to build experience, especially how to communicate with customers in a friendly and professional manner."
good,Very busy place. Always on the go doing something. There is never a time where there is nothing to do. Learn how to merchandise items and promos. Management is a strong team and very on track with how the company works. Employees love to be kept busy because it makes time go by faster for them. The hardest about the job it that it never ends but the enjoyable part about it is that it just never really does end.
good,"fun place to work if you have good co-workers, it get crazy busy on Saturday and Friday. hate that i had to work on sunday but all around good job the discount is best part."
good,This is one of the easiest jobs you will ever have. All you have to do for loss prevention is stand by the door look good and greet customers. From time to time you will walk the inside of the store and greet customers. Other times you will help open and close the store and make sure all customers and employees are safe. You will never handle cash but you will make sure it is secure by watching the managers take it from the front to the back. You will log what you do each hour and take note of any crime or issues in the store.
good,"i worked at a distribution center during the night shift. 3:30-10pm and over time was always available. i work in shoe packing, which required preparing merch for processing."
good,"I learned to be a great leader that the company always has room to grow. My most enjoyable part was the employees given them praise"
good,I have no review for ross. typical day was over haul with employees and management was never around unless you needed them
good,"Busy, Busy, Busy....it was never a dull moment in Wal-Mart. It was good and bad management there, I can honestly say, but I hung in there. Co-workers, ummmmm, didn't really do to much talking at Wal-Mart, Just went to work and did my job."
good,"A typical day at work is doing the sizing first to make sure the clothes are ordered by sizes and types. Then, I have to start checking out costumers with their purchases. I like interaction with customers and make sure they have a good shopping experience! I learned to work in a fast-pace, and this is something that I really like. I prefer working in places with a fast pace than having several inactivity time. The managers always are cooperative and friendly. I don't find any hard part time of the job. I just think that we have to deal with the long lines to checkout but we are always ready to work fast and accurate to diminish that problem everyday."
good,"This job was a steady job. I got along with my co-workers, and supervisor. I liked the benefits, and the rewards."
good,"Receiving Frieght & product placement, ive learned fast pace gets work done, Manangement was organized but didnt always treat the employees the best, co- workers were upbeat & cheerful, hardest was being understaffed. Most enjoyable was doin what i love."
good,"Lots of room for advancement, management does a great job of encouraging employees to move up in the ranks. The company in general does a great job of offering opportunity to employees. Working as a sales associate is rough and fast paced, and the salary makes it seem not worthwhile. But if you are only there for a summer job, or you are looking to work your way up into a management position ect... it is a great place to start out!!"
good,I enjoyed communicating with the customers and employees. The management was supportive in the training of new employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the grumpy customers. I really enjoyed seeing our customers walk away happy.
good,"Never a dull moment.  Learned a lot from the upper management. They value their employees. Love the collaborative approach. It is a fast phased environment, you get to deal with different type of customers."
good,Sometime the customers are very rude and so is management but it was a good experience over all great discounts.I really liked the job for a short period of time but I think its time to expand my horizon and get a good job/career which i would really enjoy.
good,Over all this was a very enjoyable work place. Everyone on the team was very hardworking and also nice. Everyone was respectful. The hardest part about working here is you don't get any hours.
good,job was not hard it was simple and straight out minimal thinking required easy to excel at the job.
good,A typical day is taking inbound calls. I learned to be empathic towards customers. The management varied every couple of days. The hardest part was pleasing customers. The most enjoyable part was relieving a frustrated customer.
good,Great place to work not to much to say.....there's always something to do from keeping customers happy to keeping a safe clean working environment for customers and employees....
good,Ross is a great place for someone just starting out in the work force or if you need a part time job to help make ends meet. Very nice work environment
good,"Its a job if you don't mind working so very hard and only making a little money, then its a job for you. "
good,"ross is a good place to work like other places i worked at. I have many years of experience in retail.Iam good at Customer Service and Cash Register. My Strongest strengths I am dedicated, hardworker, and people person. Got along with my co workers and managers. Always on time for work and tasks.I make sure im greeting customers at all times."
good,it stared off great until they got a new district management and he ran off his good managers and put his people in their spot now the company is going down the drain i hope they sevive this year and stay in memphis tn.
good,Your all ways doing something. Your either on register running go backs or racks. In the fitting room or stock room. Or helping customers find certain items.
good,"A great starting point with opportunity to grow in the company. Friendly staff, Lots of learning skills developed here, Situations that put your common sense and Customer Service skills to the test. Great practice multitasking under demanding pressure."
good,"I love working at Ross,  the schedule is very flexible . Ross has very wonderful employees, managers, etc. The hardest thing about working at Ross is that most customers can be rude, but you have to keep that big smile on your face and keep your day going!"
good,Great place love the public there nice clothes and boss was very respectful
good,Fun place to work. Management was always helpful along with coworkers. Plenty of hours if Loss Prevention but only one Loss Prevention associate can be full time.
good,"The store is not a bad place to work, the problem is in the direction, there is no balance in the distribution of hours and opportunities in the group.  Managers must be prepared to do objective and non-subjective work, there must be equal employment among all workers, we all need income."
good,"I had a good experience working there , it taught a lot about how retail work. I learned how to label and organize the professional way. They taught me how to communicate with angry customers."
good,"cashier, stock, customer service, cleaning and . work with fellow employees, help run stock to floor, work with customers to help them find the hidden treasures"
good,The management and staff were rude and disrespectful to fellow employees as well as patrons. The manager that was there when I was employed was terrible.
good,"Left overs. Hard to get to the next department. Metal and hard hangers. Old flooring, staff area boring, old pictures, colors not that great, rep clothing not super in racks."
good,Management at my time of employment relied on others do there job....not a team work environment; easy to move up when doing your job... nice employee discount days
good,Best part of working at Ross is my co workers we have grown to be a family. Truly don't approve of the set up very confine. If you're claustrophobic then this is not the job for you.
good,"good day, lots of management but the advancement option is hard, you need to be liked i feel like its rigged. many supervisors play their game or else you're not moving"
good,"You clock in, then check with your MOD to see what's going on that day. You recover an area for 15 min. After that you go to stock or fitting room or cash register. There is a lot of busy work so you'll always be doing something. Something always needs hung or hard tagged or ran or cleaned. A lot of stuff is done as a team so you can talk the time away and really get to know your co workers."
good,I worked in the stockroom at 5 A.M. about 100+ cartons. pay was minimum. Applied hardtags for about 7-8 hours. We had low staff. We had about 2 managers total. People would not show up to work or call in and they would not get introuble for it.
good,"a typical shift consisted of rolling out and unloading trucks of merchandise, sorting, labeling, then storing them in their correct locations throughout the store"
good,I do not agree with the background policy. I worked with the company and now have contacted the ACLU for assisting me in suing the company for discrimination
good,i typical day here really sucked all it consisted of was people telling you what to do when they didnt know what they were doing people never did much to help you here
good,After I clock in i am assigned to an area to pick up clothes off the floor size each rack in the area I'm assigned. Then I am assigned a register to work on during the day when back up is needed. My management team is awesome and understanding. Some of my co workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is trying to assist the customers with language barriers and most of them are from a different country so the customers get frustrated sometimes. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people from foreign countries that does speak some English and tells me stories about where they're from while I'm checking them out and most of all customer service.
good,"I worked several depts. within the store so here it goes, as a cashier your job is easy all you have to do is be fast and friendly bag their stuff and get em out as fast as you can and call the next one in line. Because our store only had 2 cashiers if we were lucky. chances are you are one of the cashiers, theres a long line of people who don't like to wait and they start yelling and screaming, no joke. As a stock room associate they have a small budget which means they never have enough people to work it, so you have to be fast in processing merchandise and running it around the entire store. As they scream out your name on blast on the PA so and so come back to stock room with an empty hummer cart! no joke. Fitting Room attendant customers try on clothes you give them a number 8 being the highest of how many apparel items they can try on. People not all people steal stuff, and you basically have to watch them like a hawk how they are dressed when they came in as opposed to how they come out, some people were shady they would stuff clothing in their bras, shirts, pants, strollers where the worst! last but not least Front End Supervisor, I did exchanges and returns, and heard plenty of complaints, beware of the people returning stuff, some not all would return stuff that wasn't even our merchandise, or merchandise wouldn't match the receipt. Be weary of that. They only hire the majority of part timers. your hours when they hire you they say are 25hrs a week but in reality its 12 to 20 hrs a week if your lucky. As a part timer I was one of the lucky ones because i knew multiple"
good,I loved my coworkers but management could be difficult at sometimes. They start you off at minimum wage kinda sucks cause the 4 years i worked their i went from $8. an hour to $9.15. the more open your availability is the more hours you can get. also the more you say yes if they call you in the more likely they are to call you first when someone calls out. but then they like to take advantage of that sometimes or that could have just been my experience. chances of advancement are usually very low unless you know someone in management. i started as a customer service cashier then got trained as a front end supervisor and i was told by 3 different store managers that they all wanted to train me for an area supervisor position but that never happened. i was cross trained in every department. like i said i started as a cashier then a customer service cashier then fitting room then markdowns then sales floor then front end supervisor then stock room and finally cash office associate.
good,Lots of customer interaction! Loved it! Must be well organized and fast paced!!
good,They time you on every little thing bagging calling next customer giving change it’s crazy stressful and managers walk around once. Week and give you your percentage and tell you need to improve
good,"If management was different, and they actually listened to their employees, it would be a great place to work. The crew is friendly. Large corporations seem to not care as much for their employees, then smaller ones."
good,I enjoyed working for Ross until new management came in and started trying to get rid of people to hire friends from an old job. The associates are fun to work with.
good,I enjoy that Ross lets me have a flexible schedule. I do not like that the company will work you hard for a couple of weeks and then call you off a week later.  There are no consistent hours that can be counted on to work. They hire a lot of new people and then drop hours. I was scheduled for just 3.75 hours one week.
good,Relaxed but yet very productive at times. You have to stay on your feet and be very quick when things come off of the conveyor belt and be able to hurry up and sort it all and put it in there proper location.
good,"Ross was a great place to work. But typical day at work would be about 5 call outs or more a day. My job was to give breaks, pull cash along with change orders. And to make sure all merchandise was ran from the stock room. Attend to customer complaints. Open and close the store. Protect the asset of the company and to make sure the store is clean at all times."
good,"Everyday you are asked to do so many thing from running a register, providing customer service, and keeping the store together. At this job I learned how to run a retail store by paying attention to management and even learned about security to a certain degree of what to do in certain situations especially when it comes to loss of money and or merchandise. I enjoy everyone I work with its like a big fun family even with the management, they can be like parents, and everyone is around the same age so everyone can relate to everyone. The hardest part about the job was the lack of attendance, either people did not show up or kept calling out. The other hardest part was rebuilding inventory after a holiday and getting the stockroom together."
good,Ross is a great place to work if you are a student or still in high school. The manager's that were there were great! very understanding and outgoing.
good,Ross is a very fast pace job. You must be able to multi task to keep up
good,"Having this job will truly make you respect people who work in retail, cleaning up the store until early morning hours, mangement staff was completly lacking experience, hardest part of the job would be having to constantly keep your area clean with all the customers going through everything."
good,This workplace is good for people with no lives that dont really want to advance in life. They work you like slaves for long hours and you dont really see the hours in your check. the most enjoyable part working there was clocking out and there were a few nice coworkes. The management was horrible.
good,"AT ross everything was a mess and working as a sales associate at first was very hard. The hours were long especially picking up after people who were making a mess right where you cleaned up. As a cashier it was better, making sure that all the customers got throught the line fast."
good,I started at ross with a stock room position which was physically demanding but fun and then I was moved to a cahsier/sales floor position where I had to work in all aspects of the store at once give great customer service at all times.
good,The hardest part of my job was the hours. I never got to see my family because when I went in they were getting off work and when I got home they were already in bed.
good,this establishment is designed for those that are looking for a second job and not trying to use it as a primary. i was only given at most 12 hours per week and lived around 20 miles away; it was my only source of income at the time. when i asked for more hours i was looked over and told this is not a place for full time workers. i loved working there but i could not live on the small amount of hours i received there.
good,Job was awesome..they just don't offer more than 15 to 18 hours aweek..lucky to get 20..when i worked there i got 9.00 an hour..they went to eleven an hour..but still only offer 15 to 18 and hour..no benifits.you get a 20% discount off of stuff in store..but don't make enough to pay bills.let alone shop..
good,"It wasn't organized and management wasn't the best when I was there. The work load was a lot since it is a retail store, but you had times where it wasn't that busy."
good,The team aspect is wonderful but the lack of room for growth is crazy and you're seen as someone who can be easily replaced. No matter how much work you put towards your day.
good,Clock in ask what section I was working that day and then I began the day. Here and there chat with my co workers while still doing the job at hand. Very fun work environment and people.
good,i love ross.....but you have to kiss up to advance hard work gets unnoticed especially nights............................... some people get away and some cant its kinda childish
good,im happy with this job the people r nice and the management r really helpfully. good location easy work this job is more for college students or high school kid
good,"Co workers were very nice and good people. No one likes the store manager and I felt bad, but she definitely has her moments. I watched her call two stockroom boys stupid among other degrading things because they forgot to put  an orange apron while tagging shoes."
good,"I worked the Holiday season. It was an easy going job most days. The worst part was cleaning up the store after the day was done. Sometimes you are there until 1-2 a.m. cleaning up! I worked the floor putting merchandise back and running the dressing room."
good,No benefits since this was a temporary assignment. Very flexible hours and wonderful co-workers. The position I held was primary all data entry. Easy tasks; as stated before this is good for a temporary position.
good,"Working as a cashier at Ross is what you would think for a cashier. I actually enjoyed it. I only worked there for a short period due to being far along in my pregnancy. But the short time I did work there I liked my co workers, the environment, customers were always nice. I never had a run in with a customer or another employee"
good,"open and put away stock. every day. great people to be around. unfortunately it gets old fast with the stock lead that is currently there. everyone else is wonderful. most enjoyment you will get is becoming part of the family and learn new positions. worst part is the stock lead. definitely the stock lead. she needs to be replaced with the way she talks to the associates. I felt underappreciated. management was good though, they were almost family as well but keeping good professionalism."
good,"Fun place, pay sucks though. The employees and management are really nice to their employees. you just have to deal with rude customers"
good,I was a seasonal worker and it is a crazy place to work.   It is super busy at the holiday season and you don't get a break.   Work fast and furious.  I did learn a lot on the cash register and dealing with many different people.    I got very good at my job very quickly!
good,"Stock, cash handling experiences. The management was above everyone however and we were worked like ants for very minimal pay."
good,Work with great team under much presion for finish in time the production
good,high volume of customers
good,A regular shift is run smoothly everything is organized. The hardest task I would say is the heavy metal but with the help of team members it’s very helpful.
good,The good news is the people are usually friendly luckily for me i had a job in which i was constantly moving around the store which i enjoy but some of the jobs in stock duty have you standing in one spot for long period amounts of time which can be daunting after a while. Sometimes people there will try and make you skip out on your lunch break so make sure you take your lunch break at your scheduled time.
good,Great team with bad management can make great employees leave. Arrive on time and just be ready to work and focus on yourself! Work as a team and work towards the same goal
good,They only higher for part time positions unless you are applying for a managment position. There are very few in the store so 80% of the employess are part time making minimum wage.
good,This company needs to understand the importance of recovery throughout the day not just leave it for the closing shift employees to do.  The also need to better schedule the employees they have
good,A run in the mill day generally began with reading the change of shift reports. I believe clear communication between coworkers and administrators is vital.
good,Only one work day a week. Gave me hours to get the store ready for opening as soon as the store was ready for open got dropped to 1 day a week for 4 hours. Fire people if you get another job because now your availability isn't set to go in when full timers call off.
good,"great job in that you can control your own hours via their scheduling system. Job also is very easy and requires low-skill level for decent pay. Hours can be hard to come by however, if you are looking for more than 20 a week."
good,"Work day to work day is rather similar (excluding seasonal). Each day is a new set of products to refill the store with. The workplace is good for cooperation and in some areas require teamwork. Time management can be hard at times, but can be reduced with a good dispersion of time to employees to work."
good,As an area Supervisor there is little to no support from upper management. Seems like you are thrown to the wolves. Customers can be unruly and blame you for things that you cannot control while there is no policy or action in place for resolution.
good,Everything was fine but the hours really aren't the best for me. The people are nice and the work is simple. Everyone starts off as a seasonal and in three months time can be upgraded. I feel like i'm waiting a long time to get my hours up and that is why i'm leaving.
good,I worked here for 2 years and your management team determines how your store is going to run. when I first started working here our store manger was fun he liked to keep the store happy because he believed that happy employees made for better workers. but not long after i started working here he received a better offer from a different company and left our new store manger tried to keep up what our old one did but she had trouble making the transition from shift manger to store manger and moral in the store went down. she was fired about a year later and our new manger was very strict and this i when i had to relocate so i did not work with her long. every store is run differently depending on you management team.
good,Ross was a good job they would only hire too many workers so we would need to share hours witch cut the small ones we had anywhere from 30 down to 15.
good,"They are only concerned about how much money you can bring in for them. some managers are not interested even in the well being of there employees, they dont call they dont check on you, they just don't care."
good,"My experience in the fast pace environment was challenging at times, but worth it for production as skills in completing orders improved. Co-workers were fun to work with in daily assignments."
good,While working for the company was great the management and how they handled situations were not ideal. They tried their best but was still just lacking.
good,"All products that arrived on truck were put out on the floor by a specific time, generally everything out and done by time store opened up for business.  Constant picking up after customers, straightening store, and  working cash registers."
good,it was ok i liked the discount and my manager was nice. but i hadsa baby and she couldntr work with scheduling me around my boyfriends schedule so i had to get another job
good,"Busy days, time flies."
good,Fast pace very unorganized the environment is very rude management needs work...... Need more communication skills when it comes to knowing what's right and wrong..... Stand up for your employees
good,People were always stealing and as a loss prevention officer it is hard to do anything about it. Many of the associates don't speak good English. Ross gets very busy at times but at night it is very slow.
good,its a fast fun pace to work here. I just needed a little more but great staff. and the management it really easy to get along with and will jump in and when whenever and wherever we need the help
good,Its a fun work environment and with a 20 sometimes 40  percent discount who can complain about that?!. The benefits are non existent and the hourly pay is great its just they don't really have any hours to give you weekly this place would be good for a high school grad a or side hustle don't expect to get ahead in a place like this. Still fun work environment and easy work.
good,"Loved working there, loved my customers, & loved that I was always learning new things. Management lacked greatly between communication and execution."
good,Had this job right out of high school. I was easy enough and fun while I was there. I learned a lot but like any entry level job with young kids out of high school there was issues with immaturity but not too bad.
good,A day at work was fun in the beginning until the manager wanted to work you where you didn't know if you were coming in to work or leaving work. Hardly anytime with family. Great customers
good,"this was a very messy  place not becuae of the employees but becase of the customers they would put clothes every were they would leave old shoes in boxes and take the new ones,"
good,I love the people I work with but this store can't seem to get its act together. Come on and hire more people we need help around the store.
good,"At the particular place that I was employed, my manager was very condescending and rude. Work hours were okay, but we were always understaffed."
good,I  enjoy working for Ross Dress For Less. I'm upset because I always give 100 percent every day always number one on our CPR report. I was demoted out of my position of 8 years because I couldn't change my work schedule for the company. They could've offered me more money to change my availability then maybe I could change something.
good,"I was okay to work for Ross, but there was a long of girl drama. I only worked part time so I did not ge any benefits. I would usually work to get my part of the job done."
good,"Productive and friendly workplace, managers were great, met lots of new people, fun place to work, took on lots of new task."
good,Was a good starter job and helped me get the experience i needed to move forward. Managers are nice but not helpful when needed. Co-workers were good but with the turn over rate being as high as it was it was hard to keep up on training new people. Most enjoyable part of the job was merchandising and flexing for new product when needed.
good,"management showed too much favoritism, but co-workers were fun to work with and showed team effort. i learned many things like processing shoes from putting alarms to putting the away."
good,"Making sure the store is clean, assisting customers when help is needed, handling the register and stocking merchandise on the sales floor."
good,I learned how to open boxes and scan the merchandise and put it in the trays. the hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes (40LBS) and when the trays would stop when other people dont fold the clothes right.
good,A typical day at Ross would be customers leaving a mess all over the store and having to stay long hours after they close to pick up all of the abandoned merchandise.
good,"work in the fitting room, restock store. learned the aspects of the company. the hard part is the repetitive work through out the day. the best part of the day is seeing the customer get the item that they want at a cheaper than average cost."
good,A typical day at work consisted of pts picking.The most enjoyable part of the job was completing my assignment ahead of time and moving on to the next. I learned how to work at a fast pace & maintain a safe clean work area.
good,A typical day at ross would start with friendly co-workers and associates. Over all it was great company wich helped me become a more seriouse and profecional worker. The hardest part of my job would of been when I first got hired and needed to learn all the rules. The most enjoyable part of my job was once I learnd everything i was abble to help out so many associates with their problems.
good,"Fast paced, they train, good discount, no benefits unless full time, employees are nice, lots of customers trying to get a better deal"
good,Loved working with public and making sure the customers are happy
good,"No real life outside of work on third shift. Managers gossip and speak to employees with attitude. Overtime is almost every week so there’s only one day for relaxation. Also, wear comfortable shoes, stranding is required for the entire shift, and there is only ONE break."
good,"Open new inventory. Take items out of box but items on cart make sure everything going to the same area. Next, we place them on the selves nice and neatly and color organized."
good,They give me the time off when I need it and are understanding. The managers are nice and make sure to interact with all of the employees. I love this job.
good,"Retail today is not out to help their employees make it in life.  By this, I mean management has promised  the hours I need, but do not schedule accordingly. "
good,i enjoyed cleaning and organizing all the shelves but there were too many short staffed days and the schedule was always changing. the store was messy. the only thing i enjoyed was my coworkers.
good,"Ross can be a great place to work. Unfortunately, HR is very strict on rules and even if the employee was in the right, they only care about what the customer says even if its untrue. HR seems to only care about profit and the customers from the year Ive been working there. Despite this i do think Ross is a great place to work at. Its fast paced but easy to get trained."
good,"Well I'm either working in the stockroom or on the salesfloor. A little stressful in the morning, like when I first arrive. Some employees don't get along, managers hold different standards for each employee."
good,"typical day at Ross is very busy, they teach you how to manage the cashier and how to do inventory. "
good,"Everyday expect the same customers giving you a hard time doing the same scenarios as they were a day later. Most are very provoking and rude, nice when they want to be depending on the employee. Depending on the manager, they show a lot of favoritism in a very unprofessional environment. They will drag you out the store from your position if they don't like you. Overly, not everyone is like this there. I'm grateful for my experience and to have worked there I learned a lot actually. You have to work in a very fast past at the registers without conversations. If you do consider working here take the humble route of things, don't get familiar or try to fit in. Learn how to not make the same mistakes or you'll get written up. Always be nice and respectful!"
good,The double discount days you get are great! You will meet some amazing people as well. The team is very understanding and caring and they work together.
good,An average day follows the same routine beginning with stocking the store and assisting the customers. Team leads and managers strive to complete daily activities as fast as possible and will release part time employees once their services are no longer needed for the rest of the shift or day.
good,it was a part-time but i need a full-time job... the hours are crazy i only get between 15-20 hours. the management is great its just that its a part-time but i need a full time
good,"It was an over-all good experience. My fellow sales associates were welcoming and kind and the primary reason I enjoyed this experience, but the person in charge of the vault (supervisor )is  very difficult if she doesn't like you she doesn't schedule many days, and you ended up with just one day of work a week, making this a really difficult situation for living in the area"
good,"Working for a huge retail company like Ross, you see why things are done in certain ways. Because the store is so big and has so much going on teamwork comes in handy."
good,I learned a lot of ways to look at the various jobs that I was able to do for this company. I was tested often through management of the skills I have
good,A place to learn about customer service and learn how to work in teams. The harder part of this job is when some customers treat you bad or when a customer start screaming at you and you only have to remain calm because we cannot scream at any customer. And the most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer feel happy with the service I give to him/her.
good,"I loved working here, in the back room processing  apparel. I wanted a part time job 15 - 20 hrs a week and was given the hours I requested.   The holidays were extremely busy and because of a shortage of employees I was working 52 to 56 hours a week  in order to get the merchandise processed and on the floor.  These hours only lasted a  few weeks and I dealt with the extended hours,  unfortunately constantly lifting the heavy boxes my back gave out and I was forced to quit. I would definitely go back to working at Ross if I didn’t have the back problem.  I worked with a great group of people and for the most part it was a friendly environment."
good,"Customers can be disrespectful by not cleaning up behind themselves and complain about the line being too long, but, on the side lines the associates enjoy a great laugh after discussing a few things about those kind of customers. I'm usually happy to be there, however, the hours haven't been so great."
good,"Ross will definitely provide their employees with hours."
good,"Ross was enjoyable to work in. The discounts were great and so were the people working in this environment. The hardest part of this job was hanging clothing and straightening the store after customers messed it up, but I enjoyed it because it gave us something to do when we slow as I need to be active in any job."
good,I liked the job while at school. The manager was flexible with my hours.  Long hours on your feet. Short breaks for lunch. Managers were great. Dealing with the public can be hard but you get used to it
good,It is a good place to work but poor manament made the bad politics crept it. Moderate pressure and good training. Customers are good. They give one lunch and one 15 minute break together. Their managment was very concerned and helpful in the hurricane (harvey) time. They even paid for the days when the store was closed because of the hurricane.
good,I had a great time with my co workers and we often would go get drinks after work or go out and get food after I think the best part was the coworkers
good,"Working at Ross gives you a lot of opportunities to grow with the company & make new friends. It's fun, fast paced at times, everyone works as a team."
good,They take care of their Employees. Great management. Accept all cultures and ethnicity. Very open-minded environment. Hardest Part of the job would be dealing with the customers.
good,"awesome job as a starter. Gets you experienced in fast pace work and used to unruly customers. hardest part is, no job movement/advancement for a long period of time, very little full time positions. most enjoyable part is the discounts, fun environment."
good,"I LOVE ROSS, and I enjoyed working there. The discounts, the fast-paced working environment that keeps me busy. However, management could've been a little more clear as to what they wanted and how they wanted it done. I was never properly trained but besides that if I'd every have the opportunity to work at another Ross I definitely would."
good,Ross is very organized when it comes to schedules. there is a lot to do so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. Management was okay just had many issues with getting there attention.
good,Always something to do but no matter how hard you work it never pays off. The pay should be higher for employees because they work their butts off but I guess management does not see that.
good,"in my work experience  I have learned how to deal with all kinds of Individuals  and their personalities to cope with everyday issues and how to solve them in a work Environment. A typical day of work consist of dealing with attitudes, children, elderly and some even senile manners. being able to work an meet new people an experiences that change on a daily base is life and exciting. I have enjoyed my working experiences  from training to management, each position has taught me values an lessons to further my journey and careers."
good,"Nothing special. You walk in, clock in, and then you're given your department to work on and occasionally every now and then work the register. Easy job and easy pay. Just if you're doing a closing shift, be prepared to stay after closing hours to clean up"
good,"Really great for a part time job.. it's as fun as the store manager makes it other then that it's what you make of it. You might only get a 4 hour shift or a 7 hour shift and only work, depending on your availability you might only work 2 or 4 times a week."
good,Do not really want to say much because I plan on continuing with this company because the pay is good. I do not know what else to say.
good,"Clocking in, you check with your MOD(manager on duty). After pairing with them you go to do your start assignment (recovering a area of the store that could be more organized to the shoppers eye)."
good,"Ross is a good place to start out, especially if it is your first job. I was hired on as seasonal help and was moved to a part-time employee. Management is very understanding about your personal life outside of Ross, although it can be a bit un-organized at times, only because they have so many tasks to be done throughout their day . Most of my co-workers were women, except for the Store Protection Specialists, which I soon moved to. The hardest part of the job, would be the recovery and cleaning after customers once the store hours were closed, our employees would sometimes stay 1-2 hours after store hours to make the store look presentable. The most enjoyable part of my job was, knowing I was a good and reliable employee, and that I had learned enough to do my job on my own without having to interrupt the busy managers with their numerous tasks."
good,"Working at Ross was an experience that was needed with working with customers and the different situations that you will encounter while working in retail."
good,"A typical day at Ross is full with excitement. My co-workers and manager are some of the best people you could work with  and that's what I enjoy about Ross. The hardest part time sometimes is working real hard and not making the production you think you deserve. Other than that I enjoy  working at Ross, I just want to work somewhere else where my work is more recognize and appreciate with rewards and growth in the company."
good,"The job is not a great start for someone getting their first taste in retail it is very fast paced everything is timed, the costumers have no respect if you are straightening racks or have just straightened some display. the people you work with come from all different cultures. Management could do a better job at being easy to find. the hardest part is the being timed part how fast your bagging and scanning to how fast you call the next person in line. what i liked the most were the other girls i worked with and working dressing room."
good,long . hard work. busy . leaned how to deal with all types of customers. liked the staff . learned how to manage a team./ train others . best part of the job was the praise you would receive when doing a good job
good,Look forward to an advancement in position soon.  It's expected to produce a high number with not so much support from co-workers.  Unable to work using my abilities.
good,"Stock items on sales floor ,arrange clothes in the fitting rooms ,sorting ,prevention of theft .I enjoy working with my managers and coworkers ,putting the clothes in order,counting"
good,"Fun work place with a supportive management."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy interaction with public.  Can be very interesting daily.   You never know what will happen or what you will see(  cowboys in dresses and Men in evening Gowns).Very fun place to work.
good,"Ross is a good place to work for because it gives you a good direction of the retail industry learning the odds and outs etc. I worked multiple departments from cashier, stockroom, fitting room and front end supervisor, I learned a lot and survived there because i never said no. If they asked me to stay, I stayed, If they asked me so and so called out so do you wanna learn a new department today? I was like sure lets do this. I never said no, even if i didn't like it or didn't want to do it, I never said no, it made me more knowledgable about the store our merchandise, and our customers. Which resulted in more hours and more shifts, and trust me when i say working part time in retail is brutal. I would see others who weren't fast enough or didn't pull their own weight in working or lazy etc. They would be let go. I hired in as a seasonal and they liked how i worked so they kept me. Oh yea another way i survived was that I stayed out of politics, I was polite and courteous to everyone even to those who don't deserve it. My advice work hard learn as much as you can, do as much as you can, and once your comfortable find another job that lists all the skills you learned here find full time and get paid more. This job is good as a stepping stone to find another better job, but not good to have a career here. Management is always stressed out here and we get new managers at our location like every year, I'm not kidding! We had some good ones and we had some ogres. I have not been promoted and yet still do supervisor duties and do not get the said title or pay. one more thing if you"
good,"The overall experience as an associate was good, The pay and the benefits only helped me when i was attending college. Since i have now finish my schooling, I am looking for a better position as to where I can use my trained skills as an Quality Control Engineer,"
good,"I love working face-to-face with customers, I learned to have patience more. The most enjoyable part of the company is when it is going at a fast pace. I loved most of my managers who were there they were understanding."
good,"Its a great job if you're look for to make some extra cash, the work is simple it gets a little difficult around the holidays."
good,It's a great place to work with friendly co-workers. There is a lot to learn about retail and sales which happens on a daily basis.
good,"Working at Ross was a very enjoyable job for me. One thing about is, that I am a people person. Working and getting to meet communicate with different people was very enjoyable for me and plus I LOVE to shop! The typical day on the job in my department was in shock in the back in a some what warehouse setting. Setting up the dock unloading trucks, scanning the truck in, opening the boxes and separating merchandise so that the merchandise can be put out and ran on the floor at a certain amount of time. The hardest part about the job was honestly for me, leaving. It was a job that really enjoyed. not because of the work. It was my co-workers that I saw and the regular customers that can on from time to time. The most thing I could take and learn from this job was communication. Communication goes along way and today it helps me in the career field that I am in now, which is talking to my patients when they need information or help. That's the biggest thing of all, in the words of my fellow co workers. Team work makes the dream work"
good,"During a typical day at work, I get clocked in and get my job assignment for the day. All of my co-workers are very warm and friendly. There is rarely and conflict between employees. The managers are easy to get along with and are still able to maintain order in the work environment. They make sure that issues are addressed and are very prompt in their responses. There are really no complaints I have about this job, I love it but I would like to move forward into a career that is more challenging and that im more qualified for."
good,Its a nice place to work. love how we get discount for associates. multitask. fast environment.
good,hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that dont understand  retail poilicies.
good,Krystals was my first job. I worked on the weekends only. I was about 15 years old. Worked the night shift Friday and Saturday nights. My mom was my manager. It was a great experience.
good,Ross is a good place to work except management dosent work well together .
good,It's just like any other retail job. But everyone seems to want to get the job done and make things look nice.
good,"I work for one of the top three Ross stores in the country, located on the Las Vegas Strip. I like it there because it's always busy, so I'm always guaranteed hours. However, we don't make enough for all the work we do. I make only minimum wage. My typical day consists of cashiering, cleaning the sales floor, and running clothing racks. I work hard because it is true that they recognize talent and will set you up to move up in the company. This is a great place to work because the people you work with are friendly and you get a great discount. On the flipside, customers can be very nasty. I go home disappointed some days because of the way some people treat me. Talk about rude and nasty!"
good,Helped customers.and handled purchases. Cleaned store and stockroom.
good,"great company to work with, try them out and you be the judge...call them any time and they are happy to help when they can...  no seriously though call them.."
good,It was a great starter job when your coming into retail. It gets very busy but if your the type that doesnt crack under pressure its great . you can picn up great skills .
good,"Enjoyable work place, easy to do, and there is always something to do."
good,Ross is a good part time job you work 5 to 6 hours from 5a.m. To 10 a.m. A lot of lifting and scanning A lot of walking back in forth but besides that you stay busy time goes fast.
good,"I have been working in the Ross Store for a long time, and I like that place because the managers' team always works with my availabilities which were helpful during school time."
good,"Worked there for a few months and found a better opportunity somewhere else. The management was ok, they made me work a higher paid position without paying me the correct amount which resulted in me looking for new opportunites else where."
good,It’s ok but a bunch of employees slack off and call off a lot there was times where I had to do a truck all by my self and it gets really stressful and the pay isn’t good for all the heavy stuff we need to assemble but the work environment is ok super friendly
good,"I moved up to FES within the first couple of months working. Although, I stayed in that position over a year, felt taken advantage of, managers weren't on the same page, I was let go for attendance issues. I don't understand how that's possible when I was a part time accumulating almost full time hours. It was unfair. When I wanted to move from FES and gain more experience, nothing but excuses were made. Although, the discount and pay made it worth the fight."
good,Very hard work you have to clean everything I a short amount of time because they don't want to pay you for more hours then you get in trouble when you don't finish. Loved the customer's and having a job. Just like any job they are run by people who are not perfect you have to take thw good with the bad. Jesus loves you so do I. 💖💖💖
good,"Sometimes we have no hours some cashier get 1 shift a week and others get more."
good,"Learned a lot about a warehouse set environment. People were very nice, but cannot say the same for management. Hardest part of this job would be learning where everything needed to go."
good,"Managers seem to favor individials who slack . co workers hide in restroom , on cell phones. Late for breaks and work . always stayed later than time , due to short staff, call outs and no shows . I loved my job , needed a career change."
good,"After 9 years I was separated from Ross for stopping a shoplifter. Which shrink is the biggest part of your bonus.  No phones on the sales floor call out, you are not allowed to call the police for theft.  The company policy puts employees at risk. They do offer good pay. It's hard to bonus when your in management."
good,Fairly good place to work. Depends on the manager really and the people you are working with. Can be stressful but you get to meet nice people on the job
good,"Ross is a nice work place, how ever there is no room for improvement and you be over work at times. It can be very stressful specially during the holidays some time."
good,I've learned to manage a fast pace while working around others. even though I made a lot of new friends and enjoyed working with all my co-workers the store manager can be a little rude to her employees.
good,"ross was a good place to work. I was hired on as a seasonal but they kept me because I was a hard worker and tried my hardest to get everything done in a quickly manner, but doing it in the fashion its supposed to be done in. I learned a lot while working there but after the holidays hours were cut back and I was barfley getting 25 hours a week and that was not okay at the time because I was in need of a good income. so I let them know I had a interview for a new company and my manager at the time was really rude to me about it. needless to say I go the new job and quit."
good,"While I was there, the manager was terrible. Picked favorites and treated workers unfairly, however I have heard this manager is gone now, and that would greatly benefit their team. Other than this, I loved what I did there and the people I worked with."
good,working at a fast pace want so bad. I enjoyed it and no manager hounded me. I worked in my own space and could socialize with co-workers near me. I honestly would recommend it.
good,"Love my job and store manager is awesome , but needs a better assistant store manager. Great place to work, everyone is like family once you open up...."
good,When I worked at Ross years ago it was a nice place to work. Decent hours and ok pay for the work. There's different management now so I'm not sure what the environment is like any more.
good,"It is a good job but only if it's a temporary arrangement. Usually understaffed, overworked and underpaid. I would recommend this job to students that need a bit of extra cash."
good,"This was my first job but it really helped me learn about organization, work ethic and cleanliness. It really helped me for my later jobs. I do appreciate everything I've learned from them."
good,"Our store went through several management changes. A couple were great and a few were not great. Overall a great place to work as a part-time job. Decent employee discount. Plus and minus are dealing with awful, self-important customers, but it gave me great experience in how to deal with that type of person."
good,Been with Ross for a few years. They say that it’s very easy to progress and move up. But it’s been my experience to be pumped with a lot of false hope in that area. Training is minimal. Not much support from upper management.
good,"Always enjoyed working at Ross. Could never get a full time position, rarely.Fellow employees are friendly and helpful.  I've worked with several managers at different locations and they were very reasonable. Great discount."
good,"Busy work environment especially during holidays. Everyone works together to complete the daily task. Overall great work environment, I would suggest Ross to anyone looking for a job in a busy work environment."
good,Too much work for too little money. Your are asked to do so much but the money isn't worth the work. The store also needs better organization. Overall I wouldn't wanna work here again.
good,"Ross security is a wonderful place and I love were I worked but hours have been cut short and I only work one day now, but I know there are other security options that would fit me perfectly as well as I would be a great candidate for the position. Ross taught me a lot about safety of others and myself , also how to be quick with catching theft and fraud."
good,"Ross dress for less was a very good experience for me, the employees were very friendly and willing to help any and everyone, my managers were very hands on with the training, it was a job that was easy to understand very quickly."
good,I was hired as a cashier but was brought in before my cashier training to train for unloading the truck in the morning and putting the merchandise on the floor. I was also shortly after trained to run the register along with training on managing the dressing room to fill in as a stand in for breaks. I did however find handling by the management team to be unprofessional at times with lots of drama and gossiping. I would not have stayed as a full time staff.
good,"Process register transactions with a sense of urgency.  Demonstrate respect, friendliness and professionalism at all time.   Respond to customers requests immediately, handling any issues in a friendly and helpful way.   Take inventory of items, also changing pricing on all items, according to sale ads.  Perform daily recovery to ensure a neat, clean, safe, and organized store before closing each night. "
good,"Easy place to work, Friendly people, Fast Paced, Knowing merchandise and memorizing. Good place to work if you have school because they work with your hours."
good,If you're only interested in picking up a few hours and getting a store discount you might enjoy working here. The pay is low and the hours are inconsistent and of course you will usually work weekends. It is nice place to work if you don't like sitting on your butt all day. It's small enough to manage without being overwhelming.
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Typical retail job, offers benefits,  workplace culture is  relaxed.  The hours are part-time and varies depending on season.   However there isn't much opportunity for full time hours."
good,Respect and character learned how to be to work on time and do my work on time and clock in and out on time because that was very important so your time will be accurate
good,"As a Cash office supervisor I would arrive in the morning and take care of the things needed to be taking care of .It was a nice relaxed job and I did enjoy it, I just wasn't given enough hours ."
good,I've worked for Ross for over 5 years.  I love working at Ross.  But it does have its cons. I don't like the fast and friendly check out rule. I feel rule giving customer service.
good,"Ross Dress for Less claims to be a pro-employee company but they ARE NOT! They are a pro-manager company supporting whatever the store manager says, no matter if they are right or wrong. "
good,"Very good start off job that expanded my customer service skills. Typically, a day was very busy and consisted of lines that extended to the back of the store. Clean up was definitely hard during rushes but very acceptable pay."
good,"I love working at Ross .My store manager,  duty manager and associates is working as a team. And being a front end supervisor is the best part because I can give the best customer service that I can . Specially Tuesday is my favorite day because it's seniors day. I love seeing my regular seniors customers. Until the new management take in charge everything changed.  Everyone left !"
good,I managed to do a lot of pick up and tear down at work when it comes to managing and measuring time the only concern is the compensation for the amount of work being put in the store mangers do a third of the work while the supervisors like myself do not get compensated for the work we do but it gave me skills to become a better supervisor.
good,"I enjoy the business plan Ross has. Ross takes care of its part time associates better than any company I've ever worked for. And promotion potential is a huge plus. However, managers and full time associate quality of life is not good. The way schedules are made makes it impossible to plan or enjoy time off because of the up and down shifts you work. There needs to be more continuity in manager scheduling. The store hours are getting longer and longer and holiday hours are out of control. So you have good pay but you are not rewarded in any other way for all the hard work you put in all year. Instead of staying closed on Thanksgiving for instance when Ross has no sale prices we are now open.  We stay open later than any other discount retailer on Christmas Eve some stores till 1am. But we close at 7 on the 4th of July? Where does this show associates you care about work life balance."
good,I was in college and needed a job that was flexible. The discount is cool! If you want to move up its easy. It was kind of hard to ask for weekends off.
good,My coworkers were like another family and I have developed real friendships. The managers were very understanding with life situations and worked with me on my scheduling concerns and potential problems with coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working here but hard to move up positions with the pay they offer. They moved me up as an SPS and only raised me 50cents and it is not worth it for that position
good,"I worked with good people and enjoy going to work. I would start my day, right after my first job, crossing guard. I would change my uniform and then go check my area and filling rooms. then if is was time clocked in. I would keep my areas in front of me in order and clean. Assist customers as needed."
good,"At times it a slow pace then others its fast pace. Most of the time you work as a team or as an individual. One of the most challenging things was a lot multitasking, The most enjoyable time is to help new co-workers."
good,I like working at Ross because they keep me busy all day long the play is decent but the schedule gets changed in the middle of the week sometimes and you're told not to come in or go home early and if you don't check the schedule daily you may miss a day
good,Ross is a great place to work. When you have a great DM Ross is amazing............ Upper management is extremely helpful and all about people..........
good,"It was a nice place to work. Everyone there was friendly. I learned how to work a register, and that it is extremely important to be friendly even when people may be rude to you. Overall was a great place to work for a first job."
good,"Ross was a great place to work to make good friends, very fast paced, hard working people and fun environment and the managers were great when i was there, Mike and Richard!"
good,Very challenging to place to work due to the long hours. Can be very stressful because the buyers are always under great stress that transfers to those around them. Over all it was a good experience that made me a stronger person.
good,Overall a good job with great associates. If you are able to multitask and work well with others then it is definitely a nice experience.
good,"start working as store protection in loss prevention department.The store had just open so the position was just there on a trail base.After eight months at that location they decided that loss prevention was not needed..The discount was good,associates were nice along with managers,"
good,I love the products Ross supplies for the public. Working there was fun and interactive. I learned a lot about retail operations.
good,It is okay to work there. My job is not hard I just monitor people and make sure they are not stealing things. The people I work with are awesome I just wish they had better management. At least the one where I am currently employed has a horrific management team.
good,It's and ok place to work. It's sucks that only hire part time. And it's hard to advance in the company. It's good to start out for students but not someone with a family or kids
good,"Shifts where short. didn't really learn much, brought my training over from other stores I've worked for. Some of the management were awesome to work for and the others made it hard to some in. Loved my co workers, we always tried to make our job fun to make it go by just a little faster. The hardest part was not being able to get it done in the time frame that was needed. I love having busy hands so working for Ross there was always something that needed to be done."
good,"A very typical day at work for me here is okay. Most of the managers are very understanding and will always be there to help you when you need it. The security is great, I always feel safe with them around. My co-workers are like my family. Management could use some help with one manager. The hardest part of my job is the customers. They either are having a bad day and take it out on me and my co-workers or they are just plain rude. The biggest obstacle is the language barrier between me and some customers. Now the enjoyable part of my job is, again, my co-workers. We can talk about stuff together that some co-workers might not like."
good,"its a fun retail environment, the management is pretty good overall. Advancement seems pretty easy. if you like helping people look and feel their best its a great place to work"
good,"Seasonal work during the holidays.  Enjoyed working with the other employees, helping customers and the management was easy to talk to."
good,"They really don't give you wht your working for, the hours was nice, the people that worked there act like team member, really work together to get the job done"
good,horrible experience all the coworkeres I had were rude and disrespectful. the manager wasnt great either she got mad over little things
good,"Definitely gave me all go the tools I needed to be confident in my sutomer service skills. Awesome co-workers, not much of a work life balance however."
good,Ross is an easy job. They really try to work with employees who have families. The management is friendly and the environment it calm and accepting of all people. the dress is pretty relaxed though they do like to keep a professional look.
good,"Good co workers, bad managers, fun meeting new customers of all different race, always a busy place while working, busy environment, military base near by"
good,"The best part of working at Ross is getting to interact with many people. The bad part is the few hours they give you, or during the Holiday Season they overwork you but they don't compensate you for it."
good,"Interacting with people from different countries on a daily basis was the most enjoyable part about the job. Nothing was difficult as far as work duties were concerned. The coworkers were friendly. However, management was not."
good,This company is great for a resume but the scheduling and training is terrible! I worked overtime many weeks because the store manager thought she could work 30 hours a week and continue making her manager salary and got away with it!
good,it's a great place to work and meet new people a place where you will always be busy at any time of day also you get to see all the new merchandise coming in
good,"Being a Stock guy here isn't too bad. you just have to work fast and get the truck unloaded, everything tagged and out on the floor before the store opened. and there was trucks every morning and the sizes ranged. The only thing about working there at the time was the hours. They never gave me over 25 hours per week so they didnt have to pay out benefits. I feel like this was very cheap on Ross' part."
good,"I've had a great time at Ross. It was a good learning experience and I would work there again, if given the chance in the future."
good,Ross is a nice place to work at. They work with your school schedule and have great managers It a great place for college student to work at.
good,Needs a bit more work on the agency they use to recruit associates. The benefits offered need more work. They need to have better benefits and a bit more of a pay.
good,Not a bad place to work for. Recommended for students and people who just wanna make extra money. The schedule is flexible and the discount is great.
good,"From the beginning to the end of work there is always something to do. Depending on what you were assigned each day, I either was a front head cashier or on the sales floor or at the dressing room. I was usually the head cashier which had the responsibilities of cashing people out, doing proper procedures for returns, and at the end of the shift I had to run the items back to where they belonged. The hardest part of this job was probably dealing with customers waiting in line when it was busy. A lot of customers would get mad because there wouldnt enough cashiers on the floor which was hard because we werent always fully staffed. I enjoyed being around people everyday and helping them with what I could."
good,I love everything about this job. my co workers are amazing and I enjoy my time at Ross.
good,"Provide customer service by greeting and assisting customers, and responding to customer inquiries and complaints. Cashier; Adhere "
good,"There is always something to do which is why I applied for a job.  Associates get a great discount and it is doubled 3 time per year.  The hardest part of the job would be two-fold.  First there is often little to no training in certain areas and second the ""company"" makes changes that negatively affect the associates with out asking for feedback."
good,I like working for ross. Everyone there is very friendly and helpful. All my co-workers are willing to help me. Management is very understanding and will work with you if needed. I think the hardest part of the job is it only four hours a day . The most enjoyable part is all the people there take you under their wing as if you have worked there for a very long time. They don't treat you like the new girl.
good,As productive and engaging as could be although alot of idol time that  we try to fill  with busy  work..
good,"Work is strenuous and takes a toll on you physically. You need to be 100% through your entire shift. Short or long shifts, they expect you to perform remarkably. Be sure to sleep enough hours of the day to be prepared to work the overnight shift. Management is kind of al over the place. overnight co-workers are some of the funniest and most enjoyable to work with."
good,"I am in loss prevention,so a typical day at work for me is very stressful. I have to meet with the managers to go over my daily expectations, do hourly store walks and look for theft issues, take detailed notes in a daily planner, and coach associates one on one about lp topics until they have them completely memorized. The managers are in the office a lot, so I hold the front end down until they come back up. The assistant manager at my store is amazing, but the new store manager is a total jerk. He is the reason I am looking for a new job."
good,Ross is a great place to work however no advancement in the Facilities Department and is a 1 1/2 stars out of 5 for Diversity.
good,"I learned about the many different aspects of running a retail business. Management was really good, friendly, and  understanding. Co-workers were fun to work with which made the job enjoyable. The hardest part about the job was the pay and not enough hours to have more than 20 hours a week"
good,"Not fairly compensated for work that I did."
good,"I enjoyed punching in Daliy, providing great Store protection specialist skills and customer service as a routine that evolved into a habbit and how to carry myself around women who seek opionions on how to coordinate diverse dressing styles"
good,"I loved working for Ross Distubition Center. I learned alot that helped me gain experience, motivation and hope for my future."
good,"A typical day working at Ross is performing the cash office duties and operating the cash register, the most enjoyable part of my job is helping my teammates recieve whats needed to service the customer to the best."
good,Every morning I opened my till and then went back into storage and helped put out cloths till we opened at 0800. At that point I ensured the front was clean and maintained my till while providing as much customer service as possible. Nothing was hard at this job but the most enjoyable part was meeting and talking to customers as they were checking out. I learned how to maintain a till on my own.
good,The managers were great but to many employees didn't work to their best abilities which made it difficult to have a smooth running shift.
good,"i enjoyed working here, they have a good staff and they work well together."
good,"not much opportunity for advancement and no benefits.   when there is advancement opportunity,  very few people are considered and it's not based on how much experience you have...plays favorites a lot."
good,Spent five years here; working as front end supervisor; able to assist greatly with fundraisers; flexible hours; accommodating to school schedules; became friendly with several customers.
good,"The only issue i had working there was a lack on schedule flexibility. Other than that, working at Ross was an enjoyable expierence especially when it came to helping the customers out."
good,Run fairly well at a store and corporate level. Sometimes corporate feels very stingy with refusal to give overtime for all but two weeks of the holiday season of my first year here but the people and work make it trivial.
good,The company offers great chances for advancement. Works around schedules if employees are working more than one job. The company is very diverse so it makes for a great work environment for every culture.
good,"La cultura organizacional es excelente pero se necesita evaliuar el desempeno de los gerentes en funcion a las relaciones con sus empleados, falta objetividad y motivacion por parte de la gerencia, lo que incide indirectamente en la lealtad o la identificacion del empleado con la empresa."
good,"ive had a few managers come in a out of the store i was at. each one taught different things, its hard to learn the ross way if everyone teaches theres"
good,"For the position I held, I found the environment to be very exciting and inviting.  The staff as well as the customers were easy to get along with.  The hours were great and the store was put together nicely."
good,More patience dealing with customers how to do returns more respect and kindness face to face and over the phone with anyone who has questions or concerns
good,"It’s a good place to grow"
good,"As a “Linethrower”, work is sometimes very fast paced during peak or other days, but also some weeks it’s just super slow and boring. This is when management comes in with them making bad calls and it’s just a bunch of time wasted on your end but at least you’re getting paid doing nothing lol. It’s pretty easy to move up in positions, after 6 months of being there in good standing, which is a good thing."
good,"Fair pay for an easy job. Other than some occasional discrepancies between employees and one of the managers,  it was a wonderful environment to work!"
good,The company is very flexible with school schedules and primary job schedule as well.Not to mention the 40% off discount they give you when scheduled. When the 40 percent off is not in session the company offers 20% off when most companies only allow Associates to get 10%
good,"It's a good place to work but management is horrible. Had bad experience. Not good with breaks and meals, favoritism. Would recommend for someone to work there."
good,"Worked at Ross for 2 1/2 years. Was given many tasks. One of their best workers, yet was always thrown under the bus for nothing I did.  Would get hours out the wahzo but than if I did something that the manager didn't like I would get my hours cut horribly. Stressful when you're the only one doing the entire store your self cause everyone calls in or they don't schedule enough people to work. Overall I liked working at Ross better than Walmart"
good,"They really take anyone who apply. You get a certain amount of breaks based on how long your shift is. It is hardwork as it is commonly understaffed. Don't recommend anyone staying here for long, but good to get started in the workforce."
good,Not a real career based off of the compensation and health benefits offered but a good starter job to learn key attributes from. Great for a second job or while in school.
good,"Working retail is a fairly easy and enjoyable job, but it does pose its own problems. Customers tend to respond in a kind manner when approached with a friendly attitude, but some will take their frustration out on the cashier. This happens few and far in between, though. I learned that while not everyone is the same, everyone tends to desire respect. Also, it seems like management is never on the same page, so that is something to pay attention to."
good,"It’s is a nice work environment, that is good for a young people to dip their foot at the work area. Good coworkers, but customers do not respect a clean store so it gets messy pretty fast."
good,"Fun and very competitive with fun coworkers, a challenging place to work... nice and tidy, managers are alright, costumers not so much, hardest job is being a cashier up front"
good,"Fun place to work, good for if your in school, flexible hours, pay depends on location, yearly raises at certain point, good management team willing to work with concerns"
good,I enjoy working at this company. There is always something to learn and they give opportunities for advancement within the company. It's a fast paced environment and always something to do and I love working directly with customers .
good,"there is a lot of interaction with coworkers"
good,good discount and the environment was fun. They will advance you to a hire station very fast. in a few months I went from stock to from end supervisor.
good,Ross was a seasonal job while I was laid off for the at my regular job.  The environment was relaxed but when I worked there the management changed in the middle of the Christmas season.
good,I liked working with the team members. The customers that came in were a joy. I enjoyed helping them find items that they needed. Management was ok. The Supervisor would schedule you to work hours that you had class. Floor manager was great.
good,It is a typical retail job where you will work in the differing departments throughout the store. Nothing majorly good or bad and pay is decent for what you're doing.
good,Co-workers were great people to work with. They would all want go to the bar once a month to have some fun. Overall the crew made sure every day was a good day.
good,"Regardless of what was required of your position, there was usually something to keep you moving. A lot of great customers and quite a few amazing co-workers to thank. A company or business is truly shaped by their employees, which made it a great experience to work there. Despite my leaving, I would do it again."
good,"A normal work day would be you bringing your belongings and locking it in your locker. The schedule will be right in the middle of the main counter telling you what your job would be. You then would go to a cashier and clock in. You do your job, talk to the manager and they tell you what you can do better or if you need to do a different duty. It is constant work because the Ross at Harbor city is very busy."
good,"I really liked my job. I got to wait on customers, unload trucks while helping my customers find what they were looking for. I only left because I moved to another state."
good,It was a good place to work the people were very friendly but the managers are peices of work. The job is Not hard I had to unload a truck of around 100 boxes per day with 2 other people. You are required to take boxes off of the truck and sort them accordingly then take the racks of like items to the sales floor
good,Communication team work easy to get along with my co worker easy to my friends everyone is ready to help employees easy place to work management team are very nice
good,"The managers were very fair, with hours, pay raises, personal life, they really looked out for one another. If it had a better starting pay it would be a great place to work."
good,"Busy every day, there has been favoritism showed on several occasions. Co-workers sometimes called in at the last minute and no consequence for their actions."
good,If your looking for mid day shift with 20 hours or less production is for you. Some complained but I never minded working there. It's hard to get more hours there though.
good,"It was fun working with the other employees. Some people in the management was awesome and  made coming to work fun. It was fun working in the position that I was working in,"
good,"the job was ok but not enough hours and you wont hire full time so you dont have to pay for benefits, i went from cashier to front end sup in 2 weeks but could not get enough hours to sustain my self and my kids so i had to leave."
good,For the most part I enjoyed working here. There has been a lot of management changes that the team struggled with over the years with inconsistent messages and favortism
good,What i learned at Ross is that Managers sucks! They don't treat people equally there. They will cut your hours when you have an attitude or not feeling good.
good,"the staff is friendly and work together as a team....you receive discounts on top of the low prices displayed."
good,"The managers are awesome people, but the only way you'll advance is if you work the hours they want you to and over your scheduled time. Stock workers are treated unfair and night crew blames everything on stock (morning crew), and then the morning crew has to clean up after night crew."
good,"The manager is changed every few months. It's disconcerting."
good,i liked working there but i never got enough hours as the weeks went by my hours got shorter and shorter it was some weeks where i wasn't on the schedule at all
good,I like working at ross however my training has not been completed. Job description can be completed irregaurdless lack of pay. a okay job to have but you will need a second job.
good,"As well as stressful place to work. Hard to get a job advancement, no insurance offered to part time employees, cashier is usually left alone in the front and has to learn to deal with long lines by yourself."
good,"i work in the stockroom and i love it! never did i intend to leave until now, the stock lead makes your job hard, shes always stressed so it rubs off on the stock team. love how its a fast paced job and you always have something to do."
good,Its an okay job with flexible hours. Its okay if you don't want a lot of hours and are okay with being around a lot of people every day. you need to be fast.
good,I liked working at Ross but the only bad thing was they were only giving me 4 hours a day. At the time i was looking for at least 8 hours a day. 40 hours a week.
good,"With the correct management , work shift ran smoothly and stress-free . The right management knows how to motivate and enjoy your shift. I worked closing times and most of the time recovery went smoothly."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, but when it's slow it is REALLY slow, the only time you're super busy is if you're a cashier. They're willing to cross train you to maximize your hours which is great."
good,"Move quickly"
good,really slow on weekends. they always celebrate achievements with a pizza party regularly. you only get 10 hours a week. you start out at $9 an hour then move to $10 after a year.
good,This place was not bad to work for. I tried to get in as a manager and because I called in sick one day when the manager was going to interview me I did not get the position even though he said he would reschedule the interview. I worked in the stock room most of the time.
good,"My time at Ross Stores was a temporary gig however it was a lot of fun. I met a lot of great people who I was able to learn from. I hadn't worked in fashion since the late 90s so getting into the industry again was a bit overwhelming at first but with the help of the other admins I started to feel right at home. Again, I learned a lot from my peers and they were all very welcoming. It can get a bit stressful as with any other job especially when it comes to end of month sales but it is all worth it. Great place to work for"
good,"A interesting place to work, friendly co workers, Management gives you a option to work in different departments to further your knowledge.  Ross has a broad spectrum of items to choose from, which in turn brings in regular customers in the store. I enjoy interacting with the customers and helping with their decisions."
good,"Great Benefits, Insurance Is A Little On The Expensive Side. A Pleasant Place to Work. Compensation Needs To Be Improved And So Does The Style And Processes Of The Company In General. Payroll Recovery STEP etc. Overtime Is VERY LIMITED."
good,"Ross is a nice place to work if you're looking for easy pay. It requires a lot of moving around. They could have better pay, but it's retail. There are no benefits for part time employees, and they sometimes understaff for certain shifts which means more work for others. Good management varies by store and you're mainly working to clean up after customers. The discount and products can't be beat though"
good,"Ross is a chill place to work, the only down side is that full-time is limited to 6 people per store, meaning if you were looking to work full-time, this is not the place for you."
good,It's a good job for a high schooler or anyone just looking for a little bit of extra money. If you're looking to advance I wouldn't recommend it. Everyone is pretty nice for the most part.
good,I was never informed about being terminated until I called in to see when I would go back to work since I had not been scheduled to work after new years. All I was told was to come pick up my last check.
good,There was always something to do.  Great opportunity to learn about having great customer service.  Management and staff were very helpful.  The hardest part of the job is recovering the store during the holidays.
good,"I loved shopping at Ross that is why I applied to work there and I was happy to have the 20% discount and 40% discount when it rolled around. It is a job where you are always on your feet, but in my opinion the fitting room attendant is the best job."
good,Typical we cleaned and picked up anything that needed to be put back. Gave excellent customer service and did what I could do meet customers needs. Every day is something new and interesting.
good,"There is a lot of theft from the customers and there are no consequences for them so, it continuously happens. The customers also dirty the store, open packages, and leave spills and dirty diapers in the store; and then they complain to corporate about the store being a mess."
good,The managers were friendly and fun to work with. Closing was not fun because of the returns and go backs. The pay wasn't very high and the customers were very rude.
good,Working at Ross was a good start in my retail career. I learned a lot in the years I worked there but I am happy to not be employed by them anymore. The store I worked was unorganized and most co-workers were not held accountable.
good,"It is a good place to work for a part time job. You can work around school or even another job. The pay is higher then most other places and you get a discount. it is fast paced, especially on the weekends, or if you are on the stock team."
good,"Throughout my time working retail, I must say that this job puts you on EDGE. It has its perks but boy it's a handful. If you can't stand long periods of time, handle heavy objects or perform work for long periods of time then this job is NOT for you. It is a lot of physical work in a fast-pace environment. The job has wonderful customer service experience but you have to be a heavy hitter to work here. This isn't your average customer service retail job. But it challenges you mentally and physically."
good,"Working there was great for the people you work with. Those who work at Ross are usually very nice, the job is normally easy and repetitive. Over all its an okay place to work"
good,ross is a nice place to work if you need a quick job. the pay isn't that good but if you are full time you receive benefits. and if you work part time you don't have to worry about anything but cashiering. the job overall is stressful due to the never ending mess.
good,I think that when personal time gets tough the company isn't as willing to help as they say they are. go to work do the tasks and get work done and if it is not to their likings even though you are following proceedures they want more
good,Fast paced fun environment. enjoyed working for this company. Discounts was great. Wonderful for part time employment. Detailed when at the cash register.
good,"Great environment to work. plenty of opportunity to grow ,but lacks equal opportunity the funest thing to work for ross is your peers. Management contradicts itself too much. Example during peak every associate gets away with low performance , not following company policy ,but after peak seasons supervisors are expected to turn around associate moral and productivity."
good,Cashier at ross most of the time i was behind the counter. on slow times we were given task to put back items that guest would leave behind. organize any area that we were assigned to.
good,"Ok pay, not a whole lot hour wise though. Not much room to advance either past a manager. Hours are usually 4 hours a day to a rare 8. Hardest part of job is dealing with customers and sometimes managers just don't want to help ring out customers. Not the worst place to work. Not the best. ""Meh"" is the best term to describe it."
good,"This job is easy, and a good starter job, or if you've worked here before it's easy to go back to when job searching isn't going so well. I think just about anyone can do this job."
good,developed and maintaining a posttive relationship with the customers also assisting custumers with looking for items in the store and handle all cash purchases. Maintain and imparted knowledge of cashiering procedures
good,Great place to meet new people and interact with customers. Create a bond with customers as you assist them in find their desired items. Great place with room for advancement.
good,It is very very fast paced and need to keep up with certain numbers as a cashier and able to maintain fitting room. There is a lot of responsibility to do as an associate but if you are able to keep up then you are on good track. Worse thing to do is to close the store because the store is always trashed because of customers and the store needs a lot of maintenance after closing so openers see that is very well cleaned. Breaks are the worse to come around especially when it is short staffed and managers who do not listen. Work very very long hours sometimes are the worst because feet will hurt and some managers won't let you wear tennis shoes.
good,It really depends on the location and the people you work with. Otherwise it's a pretty chill place to work and you usually meet lots of interesting people.
good,Its a job where you become family with all your coworkers. You're able to have but also work and get your job done. There are always something within the company that changes for the better.
good,I liked the atmosphere and the job requirements. Very fast paced but achievable goals.  I would recommend this as a seasonal job and/or part time job.
good,"My usual shift was spent sorting clothing, helping customers find matching styles, and working the cash register. Normal retail job. received great customer service and register training."
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross. Started as cashier, then cash office, then front end Supervisor.  Wan't making good salary though, so when Sears called, I had to leave."
good,Typical day at work can be very slow and annoying. Management sometimes seem like they don't want to communicate with there staff. You shouldn't have to look down on your employees due to your position being higher. Everyone should be treated equally.
good,"This was a fun place to work. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning team skills. The only ""hard"" part of the job was not being able to advance in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a team and constantly meeting new people, customers and other employees."
good,A typical day at work was busy and fast pace. I learned a lot about cashiering and having patients with customers. The management was good to the employees.
good,"looking for better benefits with growing company that can challenge my abilities and reward quality workmanship."
good,They are very big on respect. As well as customer service. Our days are very productive and there is never a dull moment. They are also very big on teamwork which is always a plus. A happy environment makes for productive workers.
good,Colleagues were easy to work with but had been scarred from sub par management. Normal workdays were hectic and sometimes unorganized because of management. Being a leader in this climate was often stressful and sometimes discouraging especially with a constant change in management and direction.
good,"Cashier for half the day then I would have to work the dressing room for employee to go to lunch then i would go back to my register.  I really enjoyed cashiering. I like the customer service part of the job. "
good,"Love working there very fun work place. So many different cultures you meet and able to help.Always something for you to do from stockroom,fitting room to the sales floor."
good,"A typical day at work consists of ringing customers out at the register, processing returns, helping customers find items, making sure the store stays looking nice & clean, and at the end of the day tilling out registers. The co-workers at this particular Ross are excellent people to work with, they are all very hard working and get the job done! The majority of the management at Ross is also great. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to interact with customers and of course being able to shop here!"
good,•	Responsible for keeping accurate log of all product losses for each week and submitting that log to management. Assisted in developing work schedule for loss prevention associates assigned to work the sales floor. Regularly did inspections of loss prevention surveillance and product protection equipment. Documented all customer’s inquiries and comments thoroughly and quickly. Oversaw retail store shortage committees pertaining to meeting compliance and also efficiency.  Evaluated loss prevention exception to this rule reports.
good,"I have had worse jobs, I have had better jobs. You are just a number and some of the laziest and most worthless people seem to have found a home here!"
good,"8 hour work day of running back and forth to the floor, register or fitting room. As Loss Prevention I observed customers and supervised co-workers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the shoplifters and trying to remain safe while I pressured them out of the building. The most enjoyable part of my job was communications with customers and setting the environment with my co-workers."
good,"Happy here so far, has a lot of potential to grow. My peers are great to work with. I like the Birthday of benefit. For the most part I have been happy. Just hoping to be on a normal shift schedule again one day."
good,Great meeting new people. Nice and safe environment. Need little more team work. My second job so far and it help me get my foot out the door.
good,"I think Ross Dress For Less is the perfect part time job for anybody that's going to school, or has a full time job and just needs some extra cash. Plus the discount is a very nice bonus. The company is very flexible with schedules and is more then willing to work with you. Its a fun environment to work in, very friendly and fast past, so the time fly's by. However, if your seeking to make Ross a career, Its in my opinion, very difficult. Full time employees are a rare site and trying to move up in the company can be frustrating because there aren't many positions open and you have so many employees fighting to get the same position. Overall, Ross is a great company to work for if you're just  seeking for a little extra."
good,nice people relaxed workplace with employees that treat you like family friendly customers great management convenient hours I would recommend his company
good,"Very laid back kind of environment, with nice people. but the ware house area was very Cluttered. Manager took a lot of time off."
good,Customer service/cashier enjoyed keeping myself busy and interacting with others.Making sure all customers leave satisfied
good,when i worked there it was a nice place to work everyone there is on the same page you go in knowing what you gotta do.you can move up fast if youre persistant.
good,this job is one that's good for a person that's just starting out in retail and the pay is ok just not good enough to live off of. management really seems to not engage with the employees much
good,"I learned alot at Ross, working in the fitting room answering the phones and helping the customers is fun and enjoyable part of the job. I also learn to organize the sales floor and put the merchandise in the right places. My Manager is very down to earth and listens to our problems. My co- workers respect each other and are very friendly. I hope to keep moving up the company so I can become full time."
good,I would go in early incase manager needed me.. When on clock i would unload the truck of merchandise and put it away. Tag clothing and do resets as well as Run the cash registers and do returns.
good,"Typical day at work is always busy helping customers while trying to do what your supposed to do. What I learned was always work well and try to improve on your own work skills even though you think its good. Management is nice and I like them, you can always go to them when needed help. Co-workers are great people and you get to know them all the same as others and are a good team. The hardest part of the job is learning something your not to sure about but still have to work at always learning something new. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and just the work place itself and keeping it clean."
good,typical day at work get there punch in and start to tag & price merchandise put sensors (alarms ) on merchandice overall ross is a nice work place
good,"A typical work day at Ross, is definitely a work a balance. You have to be able to maintain your patience and being able to keep your composure, if you cant do these two things, this job is not or you."
good,"A typical day at work for me, I'm usually cashiering, maintaining a clean area, working on other put backs and recovery if I am not busy.  One thing that is always is key is making sure you maintain fast and accurate service."
good,"Ross was a family oriented store with credibility. i enjoyed working there for these reasons. fast paced environment friendly employees. i was a cashier, sales floor representative, fitting room representative, assisted in stock room and helped customers to the best of m ability."
good,The management gave me opportunities where I was able to grow and learn from my inner strength. Overall this is a friendly and fun environment. I highly recommend individuals who are in college or retirees to choose working for this company.
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers because they are fun and positive. The discounts that the employees receive are great.
good,A average day at ross is greeting customers and helping them leave the store satisfied. Management was always on the floor assisting customers as well as some employees. Some co-workers were professional and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is being understaffed. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping customers.
good,"Okay company, Discount & pricing is okay also. Management is a bit crazy. Night shift can be hectic occasionally. Not guaranteed hours every week."
good,A day in the life of Ross Property Management...is extremely fast paced. We are working on several things at once while being pulled in multiple directions. We have a great team and interact well and often with colleagues in other departments throughout the day. Being able to solve problems for our stores and field leadership makes us smile as they're our true customers. Interacting with our landlords is challenging but satisfying at the same time.
good,Really liked working here. I love working with the public and assisting customers with anything they need. This job taught me how to make the customer happy. It also taught me ho to answer phones and act in a professional manner.
good,Went by smoothly fun co-workers. Mangers are very helpful and understanding. The hardest part of this job was cleaning up the mess.
good,Associates walk the store to make sure customers dont steal. Stock room associates make sure truck is finished daily
good,"A typical day consists of operating a cash register, stocking shelves, and unloading merchandise.  Management staff was not consistent.  Most co-workers were great to work with and I met some great people while working there."
good,"A typical day at work was unloading the truck, organizing the stock, helping customers find items, answer calls, fill in as cashier or customer service cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and meeting new people. I learned how to multi-task well and improve my customer service. Hardest part of my job was that I would work different hours every day and was never on a constant schedule."
good,"great place to fine tune customer service skills. There is no ""typical"" day at Ross, everyday is different. The hardest part of the job is the multitasking. I enjoy working with the staff. You have to be a strong communicator to be successful there. The pressures of the store can be demanding from time to time. The regular customers that come in make the day, I personally have a handful of customers that look forward to seeing me when Im there. Ive learned that you cant please everyone no matter how hard you try. I know that I am a positive influence in the store per management. I continue to evolve and grow stronger in my position at this company that I work for."
good,"The management and people at Ross are the best.  Working on the stock team, it was easy to interact with the other employees without fear of making a customer uncomfortable, so we got to know each other and working with good people makes working so much more fun."
good,"My typical day at work is fast and what I learn out of it is many different things. How to work fast, maintain my area clean, and organized. My management team is cooperative, strong, and friendly. The hard part of my job is getting all tasks done by the end of your shift sometimes. What I enjoy about my job is how everyone try's to help one another when needed."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be in the fitting rooms where my responsibilities would be to number one, keep track of all the merchandise that comes in & out of the fitting rooms by counting each item that comes in & out to make sure hard tags are still properly in place & no tickets are missing while still greeting each customer w a smile. Then every half hour, i am responsible to check both the men's & women's fitting room of any merchandise that has been left, hardtags that have been pulled off, & any other damage. Usually, when its kinda slow i help out the other departments around me by recovering & last, i make sure i have my sizing done before it comes time for me to clock out."
good,"I recently have been transferred to the Orland Park location and they are completely unorganized compared to the Merrillville Location. However, if you start there you should be alright. Everyone so far seems nice and considerate of schedule and making sure breaks are taken care of."
good,"the work place was great, the people were very nice and our team worked together"
good,"Upon opening which is pretty busy, I will scam cameras system as well assure all safety check points are clear and observing for internal/external theft indicators."
good,A typical day at work we were really productive and worked at a fast past. shipping out merchandise and doing the next as more comes in. I enjoy working hard and as a team.
good,"The management was very friendly as long as job was done correctly, and on time. If you were not a full-time employee, you were not able to ask for certain times to work, even if there the employee had a child."
good,"I enjoyed working for Ross for almost a year and a half but had many issues with an out of state transfer, which led me to look for work elsewhere. I could not live without a job and they did not help to further my work experience."
good,"handling returns"
good,I loved my co-workers at Ross including the managers. Ross is probably one of the hardest jobs I've had because its very stressful. The customers never make your life any easier you have to be on your game at all times because your constantly dealing with theft as some of the merchandise is not tagged. I love that its a fast past environment I prefer to work fast pace. I love that your always busy. There's never a moment when there's not something to do. The hours aren't the greatest but if you just talk to the managers they're really great about trying their best to get you some hours.
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job is just communicating with the customers and helping people when needed , Ross has really good prices and the clothes are good quality so when families come in and come to the cashier with all different itmes and kids look happy that just lightens my day that there is a store like ross where you can dress nice but for less."
good,I had a great experience working here. My coworkers were easy to get along with .I could do everything In the store with my eyes closed. There Is room for advancement in the company.
good,I really like working with the handling of money. Supervising the customer service desk and cashiers was the best part of my job. The hardest part of my job was for the employees having to wait for me to finish counting their drawers down for closing of the day.
good,"• Cashier, stocking, customer service; enjoyed the flexible hours"
good,A good solid company with very good upper management in operations.
good,The people are friendly and the work is lite. you get e 20% employee discount and it comes in handy. the hours could be better you could have 20 full time employees in plase of 40 part timeers.
good,"A typical day at work includes but not limited to: Review and update calendars for 3 VP's and 1 Manager. Provide materials for any scheduled meetings, process expenses, answer phones for VP's and Manager as well as my own phone, create, run, format, and print numerous reports, make travel arrangements, register VP's, Manager and Buyers for trade shows, type correspondence, employee appraisals, assortment packets, assist other associates with Excel and how to run reports using Retek. I have learned how to multi-task. Management needs training in people skills. Co-workers are very supportive of each other. The hardest part of the job is dividing my time between 3 VP's and 1 Manager when one gives 6 - 8 hours work daily. (this explains the 12 hour workdays). The most enjoyable part of the job is learning. You never stop learning so you never stop growing."
good,Very hard company to work for.
good,"A typical day for me starts off by reading the previous day’s log, confirming all staff that is scheduled to work on that given day. Check in the manager on duty to confirm the schedule for that day. Once completed, I fill out daily log information. Check all security tools, alarm systems, camera angles etc. Throughout the day I observe shoppers and monitor for suspicious behavior detour shoplifters and make needed stops of confirmed shoplifters, notify police authorities when needed, maintain all security reports and logs."
good,I am grateful to Ross for giving me an opportunity after I had been out of the workforce to take care of my kids.  They were understanding of my situation and were willing to work with my schedule.  I was offer an opportunity for advancement  as a full time employee but at the time I was unable to take it. For this and more I would rate Ross as a company with a lot of opportunities for advancement and growth as the company is growing it selve
good,"Working At Ross You Have To Be At A Constant Paste If Not Things Will Start To Get Hard And Customers Will Get Impatient , But Always Remember Don’t Get Frustrated"
good,"Its a great job to start with and gain some experience but better to avoid this job, its environment is not healthy. The people are a great pro because they always think about each other but the management is very unfair and low thinking."
good,"The new Managers was very bias; they had their favorites. They were also involved in things that were unprofessional . They would give certain people more hours than others. But  before the new Managers I loved it everybody was getting equal amount of hours, the energy was lit ""as they say"""
good,We work as a team and was able to help each other. I had a flexible manager that was great. I understood what my duties and requirements where. I would really recommend this job.
good,"Depending on your manager, the workplace is fun and helpful. A typical day at work can include assisting customers with purchases, returns, or exchanges. It also often includes helping in the back of the store with stock and organizing in the store as a whole."
good,Everyday was a new experience. I learned how to merchandise and display clothes to make it appealing for the customer. I moved into a management position through hard work and dedication. The hardest part was the amount of physical work involved on a daily basis. The part I enjoyed the most was getting to see all the new merchandise first.
good,"Customer service at all times. Cashier. Sales floor, keep things neat, clean, and organized. Stock, unloading trucks each day and stocking shelves. Handling money."
good,"For job seekers of Ross, you must have open availability in order to get the most hours. Having a second job prohibits the manager from scheduling equally."
good,"Excellent job opportunity, very fast pasting job which required efficiency and good conduct among associates. An extremely busy job during holidays periods."
good,"During the holiday's, you work long hour's on your feet which is expected in retail. Overall great shopping benefits and employee discount. Management was good but when changed I received less hours."
good,Ross isn’t your ideal retail store. The manage to maintain a huge market because of the large amount of products for such a price. They don’t have a lot of incentives for employees as far as health benefits. Customer is always right no matter the policy. You just have to show up smile keep the floor clean and be quick at the register. If you can make it through Ross’s hustle n bustle you can work any retail.
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to do work wail trying to help everyone you can cause you gotta keep an eye out and at them same time make sure everything is good wail also helping the customers.
good,Ross was a very fresh and exciting place to work. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. I would fully recommend getting a job here. Managament was always helpful as well.
good,This is a corporation so as long you realize that it will work. That means any message can be seen by someone in another state with no idea of you so write plainly. This has helped with my remote terminal work. Also with dealing with different cultures since it is a kaleidoscope. Will see a manager with an employee so they work.
good,I loved working for the company. They are flexible and will work with you to succeed. It is a fun and fast paced environment. The employees are friendly and ready to help
good,"I like work at Ross because ,flexible schedule , and you will  move around , you will not need exercise anymore 😂"
good,place is a good place to work. there are some managers who you wouldnt want to work for. some people use color against you. but overall if you speak up you can get things changed.
good,I loved working at the Temple Ross. It’s like working at any other retail store. Every store will have it’s stressful days but overall I loved everyone I worked with. Wish I would’ve stayed😞
good,Ross was my first job I got out of high school. They taught me the basics in customer service and allowed me to learn the front end as well as sales floor.
good,"Pretty simple job. Mainly requires to know the backbone info about the store and prevent theft. But if you don't like to just stand around all day, without being able to talk to anyone and stay in only one spot, then this job isn't for you. It will eventually drain you. Not worth the lack of hours."
good,A typical day at work was busy and hectic. Lots and lots of people every single day . I loved working for customer service it was my favorite. Deal with different kids of people everyday.
good,"The crew I work with is amazing, and as long as you're not management you have flexible hours they are willing to work with. But if you're management you're pretty much on call."
good,"This was your basic cashier job for a seasonal position basically. I would handle cash, greet all my customers it was an over all good experience there. The hours were crazy with closing not until 1am some nights but it was a good job with good people and managers"
good,"On a daily basis I would manage a team of 5- 20 people in the sales, execution of policies, reducing shrink, clearing of stock, merchandising and customer service. On top of that I would execute planogram, hiring, scheduling conflicts, and managed payroll."
good,ROSS is a pretty easy job but many of the employees just don't pay attention to detail and tend to throw things on the shelves rather than organize them
good,I really enjoyed working at Ross I enjoyed all the employees it was just very wrongful on how they fired me knowing I had a doctor's excuse note. So technically I had an excuse.
good,I would recommend Ross as a good company to work for. Associates were helpful friendly and team players which made for a successful smooth running job environment.
good,"Working at ross has been a very pleasant experience from the customers, co workers all the way too management, I have been there over year now and enjoy working as Loss Prevention"
good,Decent for a retail job.  They tended to be overly fixated on loss prevention and more concerned with money then either their customers or their employees but what's new with big businesses these days. All that said it wasn't a horrible experience. Day to day it was simple. Work the register then occasionally process returns.
good,I honestly loved my co-workers. Unfortunately the pay and hours are not the best. The management team is awesome. I would  recommend this job as a temp or for extra cash.
good,I worked this job while in college and it was one of my favorite jobs. I like the people I worked with as well as management. The only con was hours were limited and not consistent.
good,"Collaborating with store protection specialists, management, and associates to render first-rate customer service. Also, sustain order on the sales floor, stockroom and back office."
good,"Great Job . They Try To Wirk With You And Cross Train You In All jobs Of They Can. I Did Stock , Cashier, I Worked In The Fitting Rooms And Was Learning Inventory."
good,"They are uptight and tekuncttabt to promote any associate. If you asked for a certain day off, you were sure to be a scheduled the time asked. You are expected to do the working at least three people during the holidays."
good,They had good hours and a good bit of overtime. It was extremely rare for them to ever give less then 40 hours.  It could be fast paced at times but normally they had steady work.  Everyone got along and most of the supervisors were very helpful.  The only downfall was certain people were given free passes for their actions. It was a good place to work and days went by fast.
good,"I like to work at Ross, because I have learned how to provide great customer service, at the cash register, in the fitting room, and on the sales floor."
good,"It was pleasure working with Ross, Turkey Creek, Knoxville, TN. The environment was very friendly, professional. All the staff members were courteous and cooperative."
good,This is A Great Company if Your Settling Down In The Area And You Need The Money.  Stand For A Long Period Of Time And There's Mandatory Over-Time. Great Job If You Can Keep Up With The Pace.
good,I worked at three different stores so I had three different experience so it all depended on the location but I did enjoy working for the company. I started working in the stockroom but ended up working at every position available throughout the store due to promotions and being cross trained. It could get hectic around the holidays but if you had a good crew it was fun.
good,"Amazing job for somebody going to school. After school, you can go right to work and work until close, which depending on the location of the store it will be either 7, 8, or 9 PM."
good,"If you are seeking supplemental income, a retail job like Ross is a great place to start. The work environment is light and fun. If you focus on the customers and completing your tasks, you will do great."
good,"walk around store at the start of day the look at your morning task before working then get to the assigned register and have a quick timed check out and bagging procedure"
good,It's a good place to work. My customer service and sales skills have grown a significant amount in my position at Ross Dress For Less. Ross Dress For Less provides flexible hours to promote attendance and work-life balance
good,Coworkers would gossip too much about each other. The environment felt hostle. One of the supervisors was always talking poorly about associates behind their back.
good,It was pretty easy to be honest. Wish I could go back sometimes. The pay is the only thing stopping me. I was not making enough at all and I was coming in all the time. So its definitely a place for a high school or just out of high school kind of person
good,"Day: Fast paced."
good,the job is good you recover and ive learned how to handle upset customers and the management is good and the place doe not descriminate the hardes part is when it gets busy you cant go nowhere
good,"it is very easy to move up in the company however it is a lot of stress and very little pay. I moved up to a MOD in less than two years, a lot of work and responsibly yet i was only making $2 more than associates ."
good,Working here you do not get many hours but the pay is nice  and something the higher ups are horrible and do not help .otherwise it’s ok place to work
good,The environment was a very nice place to work.Everyone was always cheerful. The manager was always involved . This was my first actual job and it was a wonderful experience.
good,"Enjoyed most of it by meeting pretty nice coworkers who helped while I was pregnant. Also, it was a team based environment to get everything cleaned up at the end to leave home."
good,"must be able to multi-task in a fast paced environment with excellent customer service skills/bilingual a plus."
good,"Its a good start. They train you well. at first it looks like they expects lots of thing from you as they train you in every department, but it is good for us only as we get to learn about everything."
good,"love love ross, even though its tough worker in a small stock room and dealing with heavy boxes when under staffed but I love the clothes and people that comes in and shop with positive attitudes"
good,"The environment was great and the employees are friendly. However, the store was extremely busy all the time. Management did their best to help and support the associates."
good,"Ross is a great company to work for and if you have the right managers, it is also a company that a person can really grow in. I was lucky and had an amazing store manager who helped push me to do great and I was promoted quickly because of it."
good,"the work place was fun. they had understanding managers. they taught you a lot about retail, the hard part was standing for a long period of time when the store was busy but other then that good place to work"
good,"Early hours, faced paced and had poor management at the time. stock manager was great thou. everyday we unloaded the truck. organized, tagged when needed and put out everything to the floor. sometimes were would rearrange the floor to fit management needs other times we were enlisted to do markdowns or other positions to fill needs."
good,My day really be easy at this job I get done my work fast and got to find new things to attend to or ask the managers do they need any help with any thing the managers are very nice also
good,Ross has incredible deals and working there gives you first peek at discounted items and a 20% discount. They offer many positions and opportunity for advancement from within.
good,"Stocking shelves with new merchandise, friendly co-workers, supervisors are professional and friendly, the work is not hard but a lot of walking and lifting"
good,Everything came new and bagged in boxes and then got laid out into the store racks and shelves. It was like decorating a house or filling a closet while checking up on the customers and helping out with cashiering and cleaning.
good,"Good entry level retail company."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers and working with other associates. Hardest part of the job was too many Chiefs and not enough Indians. Time constraints are rarely obtainable.
good,"I loved my job (s) at Ross. I received healthy feedback from mgmt when I did good I got praised for it, even received employee of the month twice and also got promoted twice during my time there, and when I needed improvement my bosses coached me and helped me to become better.  I had a lot of fun with my coworkers there, some of whom are my good friends now even though we have all moved on from Ross."
good,"flexible hours, good work is recognized, and very welcoming staff that look out for each other. offers a wonderful place to work while you are in school or as a great second job."
good,I started at Ross a few months after graduating college. Ross was a great place for me to start my career. I learned a lot about the retail industry and what is expected in a fast-paced work environment.
good,Respectful co-workers management availability major advancement consistent work training and help as needed benefits and bonuses also available work related skills a plus
good,Overall Ross has been a great place to work at. It’s always been a friendly environment and great attitude employees. I’m just in need of a job where I can move up and am in need of better pay.
good,Your typical day you start with no one shopping there so that's good. People treat you good so it's not intimidating. Training was good too but things are logical as well. Though it would've been nice to be told all the rules instead of just figuring it out. Other than that job isn't hard but can be overwhelming sometimes if there's not enough associates to help.
good,"It was a good seasonal job. I think manager could have tooken care of the store more rather than letting the mager do so. They did not maage breaks right so a lot of people forgot to take them, or they were written uo for overtime, ( it was our fault)"
good,Fun place to work with a diverse group of people. Advancement opportunities for individuals with open availability only. Education opportunities available.
good,"I was in customer service so I worked the register and also put items away that people returned, and tagged clothes etc. The job itself isn't too bad but you have to be able to handle rude impatient customers. I didn't mind working there."
good,Not enough hours at the store but great people to work with and most managers are cool not always. It’s a fairly simple job as long as you pay attention what to do
good,"Manager would always call me in earlier and make me stay longer than my scheduled shift. Although, the working environment was friendly. I did learn a lot from working with Ross."
good,"Un buen ambiente, donde se aprende cada dia mas donde hay un ambiente de comunicación con los costumer."
good,The managers treat you well. The job is fast paced there is always something for you to do. If you work closing shifts be prepared for late nights getting off at 12:00-2:00am
good,"Great opportunity to learn multiple roles and responsibilities to use in other jobs. Many chances to move up. However, it is easy to be taken advantage of if you are good at your job."
good,"I applied for this part-time job, when I was in Costa Mesa. At that time I was going to school for Masters of Public Health. My goal was to gain more life experience by communicating with customers and employees"
good,"I would not recommend working in stores now. the employees don;t seem happy and it looks stressful and they don;'t get very good product, Marshalls seem to have beat them"
good,Pay and benefits should be more than offered. The work schedule is fair and the people are nice to work with. This company does promote from within which is good.
good,Co workers very helpful. Fast paced work. Management is very helpful and understanding taking the time to listen to employee concerns and help with problem resolving
good,I really liked working with this company. unfortunately it was a seasonal position and i was able to find more of a competive pay raise working with another company throughout the summer.
good,Time usually goes by super fast because its busy. Associates are friendly and helpful. We help out each other a lot of communication is required. And most important Costumer Service.
good,There really not much bad to say.I enjoyed working for Ross. I enjoyed the employees and managers. There was barely ever a dull moment. As long as everybody goes to work and does There jobs everything will be a breeze.
good,It's very relaxed but also not relaxed. Not sure. They didn't really give me any sort of training. I learned by myself mostly. Luckily I already knew how to do it. It's a good summer job.
good,Ross was a very nice and fun place to work! Every one of my co workers were always very helpful with anything pertaining to the work place. It was just an all around feel good vibe to work in such a positive environment.
good,"Was fast paced, with a lot to do but was productive and you learned a lot from it. Even though part time was only 10-20 hora a week, if I didn’t have to quit believe me I would still be there. Yes it was a lot of work but it would teach you at the same time and would give you experience. The only thing that was a problem was the lack of hours. I was putting  in about 8-9 hours a week."
good,I like working at Ross it was not that stressful although you might get physically tired at time from being a retail associate and working on the retail floor.
good,When I was working there it was good place to work for. You could be train for different departments and promote easily. Very productive and busy while employeed there.
good,"Fast paced, timed, nice people good environment. Always had smiling faces and great attitudes. Didnt enjoy the tagging of items very hard on my fingers."
good,"co-workers make the job enjoyable."
good,"This job is great for kids out of high school or in college. It teaches you patience, time management, and responsibility. Works great with school schedules."
good,It was a good job. everyone treated each other with kindness and respect. You didn't work too many hours though because it was part time. It would be easy but at times it would be a little bit harder depending on the customers.
good,Working at Ross Dress For Less was just a part time job for me.  I was mainly in the cashier providing excellent customer service to customers. Answering any questions if needed.
good,"If you get lucky enough to find a great team, working at Ross can be great.  It's easy to grow if you're motivated.  Store Managers have a lot of say in your development."
good,"I loved working for Ross, It was exciting the customers were nice, the employees were nice, my boss was awesome. I would of loved to stay with the company they just don't pay enough for you to live."
good,"everyone needs to at least experience being in a retail job. its easy and can be fun with your coworkers. "
good,"I worked cash register and did stock. pretty average Retail job."
good,"Good place to work, fast pace workplace, always busy. Weekends are extremely busy, the holidays are not fun to work too many people, but friendly staff and manager."
good,Good company too work for you will really learn a lot but it is very busy and fast paced. competitive as well but it makes it fun and gives you good incentive too do better.
good,It was okay working there it would just sometimes get to busy and management would suck. Working at ross teaches you a lot about patience. Working there you have to be at a fast pace and there’s always something to do.
good,a typical day at work will consist of putting away inventory or counting drawers for cashiers. The most important thing I learned while working here is that you have to be willing to help customers find exactly what their looking for. the hardest part of this job was counting inventory. the most enjoyable part of this job was the customers
good,"Got tills ready for Cashiers, Made schedules, Received in truck, Did inventory"
good,It was a fun place to work when I was a little younger.  I wanted something more stable as a I was getting older and set hours to be home in the evenings with my son.
good,"I worked here for 6 months without missing a day and with picking up extra shifts or staying longer if needed. The only professional things I have to say are, do not let them over work you if you exceed more than other coworkers. Also, do not get involved with other coworkers. Keep work friends as work friends."
good,it was a good job also very hectic keeping a really fast pace as well as being time manageable! sucks to only have been temporary. i would refer anyone who would like a fast job like ross warehouse!
good,depending on where you are put it can be either fast paced or absolutely boring. if you are stuck on dressing room there is nothing to do and you have to basically just stand on hard tile for your entire shift. but as a cashier or someone on the floor you are always busy keeping the place tidy and helping customers. but you never know what you are working until you get there and you never know your hours until Tuesday the week before. as a part time employee i was sometimes scheduled as little as four hours or as much as 35 hours in one week.
good,"Everyday was a new day. New items and the thrill of seeing what the next day would bring was great. The pay wasn't good, but the offer great discounts."
good,Ross is a great place to work if one really needs the cash to pay for personal things! There's no benefit as a part time worker & no raise at all. a the managers are very nice people to work with.
good,"There's a high turnover rate. I loved working here but am not getting enough hours/pay to support my family. One of the managers is very wishy washy, will agree with employees about things but then side with gm (opposite of her original thoughts)."
good,It was it get the job but to many changes to keep up management changes to much no growth in the company but they will hire you that is Fursure it may take a little bit but they will
good,"Learned how to deal with customers and customer service. Able to adapt to new problems and environment. Fast paced work place, it means I'm able to organize my duties."
good,As an hourly associate the hours can very anywhere between 5 hours to 30 hours a week. Everyone is super friendly and willing to help you out if you dont know how to do something. The managers are super nice and laid back. I do have to say tho the Ross I worked at there was a lot of favoritism between the managers and a few associates. The likely hood of moving up in the business is very slim.
good,"It was a challenge working during the holidays. Hours would extend the appointed end shift. The closing shift was the hardest part of the job; they are in charge of picking and hanging everything back up. In November and December, the store is left in disastrous conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the team work put in daily by employees. It was always fun with the associates. What I learned was to never work retail during the holidays."
good,"I was working at Ross's part time, and every Saturday and Sunday, after getting the Job at Leif's I worked both for about 8 months. I thought it was best that I quick Ross's."
good,It was a great experience working for the company. I would not mind going back to work for them. Some of the associates are very great to work with. Some of the managers not so much. But over all would not mind going back.
good,I loved the being a part of a team who keep the store running smoothly and efficiently. It is hard work but is also enjoyable and rewarding to see the results in the store as well as the benefits it has for our community.
good,The job requires excellent customer service skills given the various assignments.  Constantly moving and on your feet but can be enjoyable given the staff and customers in store.  Long hours at sessional times.  Company should consider more full time positions and benefits for part-time employees given that 80% of the staff is part time.  Over all a good place to work if you are a team player and a hard worker.
good,"Enjoyed working at this Company , meeting new people everyday ,helping the customer find everything they needed when visited the store. Never mind coming in to to work when they wewre short of help"
good,Working here was very relaxed. No one is really worried about you and you do your own thing. The manager is very nice and will work with you. Great temporary job.
good,"Unloaded truck, unpacked, hung (when needed), organized apparel and products to go out on the floor. Assisted in upkeep of the store, restocking shelves and the dressing room when needed."
good,"Not a lot of opportunities for advancement. The only way to go up seems to be if you work there for years, and at that they are not the people you would think that would get promoted."
good,Pay rate is not good and corporate does not care about giving the employees raises. If the company offered  competitive wages I would  not mind the amount of work i have to do. Most of the day is spent on register and cleaning store up. Management is the best but corporate is not very great. Overall it involved a lot of moving around but it was a good job
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Ross was the 10% discount employees would get on jewelry. I got some really nice jewelry working there! I really enjoyed it
good,the customers make working here hard. no matter how nice you are to them they are rude to you. ross is a good place to work for a teenager. part time only is best
good,"trading hours  Security patrol at out site they area."
good,"Exciting , Fulfilling Rewarding and room for advancement opportunities ."
good,Even though there were management team members that were fun to work with being in the fitting room was stressful. I believe that everyone who is to work in the fitting room should have a meeting with the store manager so everyone is on the same page so the procedure is getting done the way its supposed to.
good,"- A typical day at work was arriving having your team meeting before starting off the day, after the meeting, I would get my basket with my materials such as my marking gun and I would go through three thousand of merchandise a day. "
good,"Solid business model based on process execution and procedural compliance.  Fast-paced, and high expectations from all members of the management and associate team."
good,Very fixable company. Good hours. Low pay. Enjoyable place. OK discount. management was very understandable. busy season was Christmas. very accessible.
good,"A typical day at work consists of attending to customer needs/ complaints, proper set up of seasonal or yearly fixtures, cashiering, scheduling for time management,  and the passing off of scheduling and time management to following manager/ supervisor.  "
good,I really hate that I had to leave Ross but not too much because they rarely like to put you on the schedule well from my experience.I think cleaning up was the most draining thing to do.
good,it was a deterrence. good paying job while attending college. its a foor in the door. was there for 2 years while in school until and moved when i graduated
good,"Work is always work at Ross,  the team is always pleasant and always showing a positive feeling. Overall the workplace is positive, it's full of energy and always busy."
good,"When people think of working at Ross, they think that it's a living nightmare because of how hectic it gets. But this one treated me well and it wasn't too bad."
good,"Lots of new things to learn, fast paced. Definitely increases your sense of urgency. Very nice co workers and nice management. Time goes by fast. Not hard at all just fast paced."
good,Ross taught me everything that I needed to know about being a leader. This was one job that shaped me into the leader that I am today. Helped me learn my strengths and weaknesses.
good,Ross dist center is a very fast placed job and stress ful workplace the demands are high annd they are very strict with there policies..they have a point sytem for your absences .Ross dist center has good medical benefits and also great holiday pay including birthday anniversary and bi- bithday holiday. Ross dist center have incentive bonuses based on your perfomance.
good,"It was fun to work here and learning the ropes. Overall a very easy job, but it can be stressful sometimes. You don't get much hours. It's a part time job. Early mornings. The people who you work with are the ultimate factor in how your experience will be."
good,I learned to love working here. I learned to also have a lot of patience with customers. Management was great to me i learned many positions while working here. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,I enjoy working at Ross. Never boring because lot of interaction with customers and colleague. I love flexible working hours according to your availability. Very Happy.
good,It was a good experience for a first job because you know what to look for in warehouse jobs it helps you build your skills up so when you move on to a other warehouse you will know what to do and what not to do
good,"Basically walk around the store keep an eye on merchandise, and customers, walk money to the safe and money leaving the draw for drop-offs, Also walk around the store and look for items out of place."
good,"If you are looking to start a career in retail, Ross is a great place to develop your career.   You just have to focus on understanding and driving the process."
good,I like working at Ross. I started in April 2017. I work part time. Management is understandable and will work with you on your schedule. The work environment is awesome. I love the discounts that the employees receive.
good,Most of the staff at the time I was working wasn't to friendly but I made it through just being positive and trying to maintain a very positive attitude
good,"When I was hired I was not told at the time that I was part-time it wasn't until I noticed my hours getting  lower and lower that they told me I was part-time. Also keep it in mind that this is after having me stay an extra six hours after my eight hour shift was over, so that extra time I put in lead me to believe I was in fact full-time and not part-time. However that was my experience my experience with Ross was that of my own, it is a good company fast paced and has the potential to be better."
good,"Besides the fact that I didn't get many hours, overall it's a positive environment to work in. Manager was very aware of what was happening through out the store. During Christmas it's hectic, but as long a everyone works together and does what they are supposed to be doing. Things run smoothly"
good,"I think it needs better management. It was ok. I would go back if everything started to become better. It's alot of work, but simple when you get used to it."
good,"OVERALL working at Ross isn't so bad. I guess it all depends on the management. A typical day at work may include covering the fitting room, ringing up customers, recovering, etc."
good,"Ross is a great place to work if you have a good manager. I've been working there for almost a year and our store manager recently got fired after working with the company for almost 10 years due to him basically not doing his job right. His assistant managers don't do their job right as well as far as getting the schedule out on time, giving proper breaks, sticking to your availability and the list goes on. If you are planning on working at Ross, I suggest you pick a different location."
good,"Ross was a fast paced working environment, there was always new things to learn and do. The management was well and the employees helped each other out all the time, It was a family like environment also."
good,"Ross is a fast paste warehouse,it very puncture and  organize.I like it going to work every day. The only time i did not like it is when everyone had to get off from work early and i got laid off."
good,I liked working here. The discounts were great. The coworkers and managers were good. The only thing I didn't like about this place was closing. My feet were always hurting.
good,"Un día típico,empezaba reuniéndonos todos,para hacer un balance"
good,The team I worked for was very hard working. The pay was low but many of the employees that worked there like the work and were helpful to each other.
good,"hardest part of the job is working stock. starting at 4:45 AM, unloading container and trying to place all merchandise on the sales floor before the store opens. challenging but rewarding when you do get the job done in time."
good,"a little hard to adjust. fast pace environment. the hard part was working in the backroom, not very friendly, not giving a lot of time to traing and unserstand the process"
good,"All over, my experience with Ross as a sales associate was easy and stress free for the most part. I would tend to customers in need and assist the store managers with anything they needed me to help with. I was always on time and rarely took off because it was a great job and I enjoyed being there apart of it."
good,"Management team isn't really nice to its employees. The manager has a bad attitude withe employees and customer, even a customer told me I shouldn't take her rudeness any more."
good,"Busy store"
good,I would have enjoyed working here much more except for the inconsistencies of opinion within management and an inability to combine perspectives and create a good workflow.
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross, especially for the discount. It had a lively, though sometimes uptight, atmosphere. I liked working closely with the Loss Prevention Team, but overall, the work was mundane. It's pretty standard as far as retail goes."
good,"i love the people i work with and i love interacting with customers. My only complaint being they don't give very many hours, typically a part time employee is only give 2 shifts a week."
good,"Working as a Retail Associate/Cashier is a great opportunity. Co-workers are amazing. During my experience at Ross, I learned to use a cash register, how to do returns and etc."
good,it was a wonderful time to work for ross for seasonal job. it was exciting to work there. so much work specially on weekends. nice place over all. i loved that store.
good,There is always something to do and the staff is always very fun and supportive. Great if you love cleaning up and straightening everything. Not too overwhelming during most of the year.
good,"Ross was always a fun job, very opening environment. Though they hire many employees and work minimal hours. I enjoyed how friendly the staff and managers were."
good,Ross is a very friendly fast paste work environment. The hours are flexible and gives me that extra time I need for my family. There are several job opportunities within this one company which makes it even better. I have learned a lot from working at Ross.!

good,"This was my first job and it started off great. Of course with every job there will be ups and downs and this job was no different. It was always busy as it is a clothing/department store. It's a great place to learn the ropes is retail, cashier, etc. You start off at minimum wage but can move up overtime but that's not an easy thing to do."
good,"I enjoyed my job at this company, I worked hard for them.  They offered employee incentives. The management team played a strong roll in daily responsibilities."

good,"Different positions include cashier, stock and fitting room. Each position has its perks. Some positions are better than others. "
good,"- having nice co-worker is huge part of enjoying working at Ross"
good,High energy work environment and not very understanding with home related emergencies. I didn't learn much and wasn't thoroughly trained.
good,"If you have a great management team at a Ross store you have a great store no matter what. Its a high turn over culture though, so all managers always have to be prepared for that."
good,Ross Dress for Less is an easy place to work but they do not pay well. Although the job is not hard so it pays what it's worth. the registers are simple to work as is everything else in the store. it's an easy place to advance within the company at.
good,"I did enjoy working here, customers were amazing, and the products were well maintained. Although the company is a good one, the other associates were regularly rude to customers and were not paitient with their management. I would recommend the company, not this location though."
good,"A great ""first"" job"
good,I enjoyed working there and gaining even more experience. Enjoyed working with others and management. My former supervisors were fair and met there employees needs.

good,Ive learned alot about presetation how it helps sell product.i also learned how to deal with different personalities.and how to and how not to handle unpleasant situations.

good,I enjoyed working with my co workers and customers until I relocated to VA.  My co-workers had the upmost respect for me.  I was the one everyone came to for positive advice They always complimented me on being a team player.  My managers like my works ethics so much that they gave me the options to come and work for them when I come back to visit Baltimore that way I wont lose any pay.
good,At that time there were really good people working there I really like working there. It was my first job and it was really easy and busy all the time. That's what I liked about it.
good,"It was my first time working at a retail store. The people i work with were amazing and they were helpful. It was easy and when needing some help, they are there to help."
good,"i honestly like driving forklift so i enjoy basically everything about my job. interact with my co workers and get our job done is my priority, i keep my work area clean and follow orders so i am willing to adjust and be part of"

good,"Very good way to learn customer service "
good,"The hardest part of this job is the lack of hours that you receive, and if your part time than there is almost no benefits except for your discount, sick pay, and some discounts at mall stores. A typical day at work isn't bad, it goes by fast and the people you work with are mostly all friendly including management. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and having double discount days."
good,A typical day would be to arrive really early in the morning to unload the truck before the store opens. Get everything stocked on the shelves and ready for the next shift. Co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was choosing to get plenty of sleep for the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met.
good,i personally did not like the ross dress for less i worked at. i thought the management was horrible and if there was a problem between employees that was affecting the work place nothing was done.
good,Laid back place to work.To many supervisors that didn't do much work..High turnovers in employees..The hotel department was  the best department with a smooth transition from getting work from other departments.
good,"I enjoyed Ross's location to my home, and some of the people I worked with. I did not enjoy SOME of the management because they showed favoritism. I worked really hard, and I felt it went unnoticed most of the time while others did less and got rewarded."

good,Management is very nice and willing to work with anyone who has limited availability. Co-workers were fun and easy to work with.
good,My experience at Ross was very fast paced. I learned how to make speedy transaction while making my customer's shopping experience the best. My co-workers were like a team we worked hard together to make a productive day. The hardest part of my job is when our store is overcrowded. I try to make the best of it. I enjoyed the smiles and chats with my customers daily.
good,The manager's work with you and the other worker are nice. You can work a lot of long hours. You had to be able to deal all types of people.
good,I enjoyed working with my co workers. The hardest part of the job was some of the costumers and some of the request they wanted me to do but it was against the store policy.

good,everything is always fast paced and exciting I enjoy working at ross the team is composed of really knowledgeable and enthusiastic employees and the store is filled with all sorts of cool stuff

My job was fairly easy yet at times when it was busy things got hectic. Meeting new people is the best part of my job."
good,Working at the DMV can be crazy to say the least.  All types of people come in.  Each one was treated with respect.  I learned a lot about motors vehicles regulations and registrations.
good,"I only worked there for seasinal, but it was a laid back place to work and enjoyed bringing to little kids faces. Would recommend anyone to work here"

When a truck load comes in, I, along with other employees, would sort through all the merchandise to make sure there is price tags and they get security tags if needed before being placed out onto the store floor. I learned to count cash drawers and all sales to making the deposit before pick up. Great management who knows what needs to be done and makes sure it gets finished while still making it a fun workplace for all employees and even customers who visit. Many great and fun employees to work with and help you along to get tasks finished. The hardest part was not getting paid enough. The most enjoyable part was getting to see all the merchandise coming in."
good,I loved working for the company met a lot of great people. Always was a joy to come to work. The company has great team members.
good,The work is fast paced and co-workers were a blast to work with. A Great place to learn all areas of retail. When I left they had great benfits.
good,"Starting the shift you clock in and get to work. Depending on what area of work you will be doing that day from cashier, sales floor, fitting room or stock could be light to heavy. I trained in all areas so if I was needed I'm capable. Management was a roller coaster because it was changes constantly but needed. When working with any company there is always different types of people you come across, least to say i enjoyed all the co- workers I encountered. The hardest part of the job was if everything wasn't done before the next days work and it added on. Enjoyable parts were having great team members and being able to work together."
good,i enjoyed working with every one. they always helped me whenever i needed it. very productive company. pay is decent and weekly
good,Worked during College. They were willing to help with scheduling.  On your feet a lot and need to keep an eye out. great for some spending cash if you don't mind minimum wage.

good,"During my employment at Ross I had a great time working with the other associates, Everyone was always busy doing something as the store was always busy, especially on the weekends or senior discount days. I would work mainly recovering merchandise in one area of the store and work as a cashier when need be,"
good,"Good place to work, learning everyday challenging, exciting employees care about the success of the business. Management cares for employees."
good,"Ross is a great store to find affordable and quality items, but the management team could be better. Being at Ross, ive learned how to build and manage a team. Ive met so many great people who all have a common goal."

good,"nice environment."
good,"Ross was a good one, its weird that Ross was oone of my best Jobs. it taught me Great customer service, fast and friendly checkouts, it taught me how to create a safe and secure enviorment as well as inventory."
good,Every shift that i came into start my job all the employees made me feel at home. They would greet me as i was clocking in the start my shift. The head cashier would notify me of what my duties of the day were and I would get started right away. Anything i needed they were usually able to provide that to me.I enjoyed all the my managers they were very helpful and nice. I never really had a hard time at my job i adapted to everything very well.
good,"I really enjoy working for this company. They give me respect, and ask for my input on company projects. I work in the back meaning early start and early finish. My favorite aspect of this job is being able to be bale to go above and beyond a customers request."
good,working a fast place environment is game but the employees are great at taking the time to show you how to work in a fast pace area as well as teaching you how to maintain a safe and secure work place.
good,It is a fun place to work for someone who is currently in high school or attending college. Work is fun and productive. The hardest part might have to be at the end of the day trying to clean the store.
good,"Ross Dress for Less has been a good experience for me thus far. Manager and co-workers are in the same page and get the things that need to be completed, completed."
good,"Fast paste learning and a little bit of everything from sales associate, cashier, stocking, fitting room, markdowns and very well customer service. Manager is very understanding.

good,"	Possess excellent customer service skills and ability to communicate. "
good,"Customer service"
good,"Great first time job, they teach you every thing and will set you up for success. I like meeting customer most are friendly. Learning how to do markdowns and stock room along with fitting rooms sales floor and cashier."
good,horrible turnover rate because of how the company treated employees. Customers were absolutely horrible. Customers would throw merchandise on the floor and let their children open toys.
good,"Working at the Ross Distribution Center wasn't at all a bad experience. The people were friendly, the management was nice, and it paid a little over minimum wage. My only concern is that for the temp employees, our own separate management didn't follow protocol."
good,This was one of the hardest jobs I have ever had. I really enjoyed the work. I saw new items on a daily basis. I was in charge of 8 employees and I tried to make their job fun. I always kept a positive attitude and an open mind.
good,Ross was a fun and different experience . I learned a lot of new things that I really didn't know about working in a retail clothing store .
good,"I loved working for Ross, I always enjoyed helping a customer find whatever it was they needed. Who didn't enjoy awesome deals! The management is really good about cross training their associates in every area of the store."
good,working with the public can be difficult but it instills in you confidence and the ability to work with others and making sure customers have what they need before they leave the store
good,Strong Leadership that understands its core objectives and consistently delivers above expectations to share holders.  Growing rapidly and focusing on internal promotions
good,I loved working at Ross. I love meeting all kinds of new people. The hardest part of my job was cleaning up the whole store. I mostly enjoyed the discounts we got three times a year.
good,Good place to work if you can handle high expectations with minimal resources.  Company programs make managing a Ross pretty straight forward.
good,"Came in early in the morning, management was consistent with directions. Co-workers were generally nice. Hours depended upon how big the truck was."
good,I don't recommend this as a full time job. Your advancement depends on your management at YOUR store. Often feels like it's us against them. Often favoritism is evident.
good,"Okay job. Usually a day consisted of putting up stock and cashiering. Closing was a hassle at times. Overall, a decent job. Pay isn't that great. Just minimum wage."
good,"It was a good job, good management and co-workers and okay hours but not the best hours though. But overall it was good but could of been a little better pay for the work."
good,"I have learn a lot by working at ross for almost ten years now, The hardest part of the job is the limited time they gave us to complete the truck."
good,"For the most part, very easy place to work. As long as you can get your work done, you can have fun too. Co-workers are nice, customers pretty much suck but they all do."
good,"i love my work"
good,Working for Ross has been wonderful. The Leaders in the building work hand in hand to make sure that our customers and associates enjoy coming in the building. We love making our store a GREAT place to shop so that our customers are able to find our treasure's and we provide TRUE customer experience.
good,Was given this opportunity to gain work experience and learned a lot about working as a group to make everything come together.
good,"Typical day at Ross is faced paced, especially on the register. I've learned to be good at multitasking. The management there are easy to work with, and make sure that new employees learn quickly and effectively. The managers also work well with schedules. Co-workers are extremely pleasant and are usually always willing to offer a helping hand. The hardest part of the job in my opinion, is dealing with the fact that the theft rate is high and so must be the employee's awareness of their surroundings. The most enjoyable part of working with Ross would have to be the opportunity of learning something new everyday, after all, knowledge is power."
good,Typical day a Ross would be unloading and unpacking a truck with Ross merchandise on it. And taking it to the floor for the customers to buy.The hardest part about the job is having so much to do in a short amount of hours and receiving a low pay rate. But my co-workers make it somewhat better.
good,this place was a good place to work.  The problem is that they have no problem getting rid of anyone who becomes extra as they make changes.  I worked there for a year and then was told on a friday to not come the next monday.  Do not apply here unless you want to have a chance of being fired without any notice.
good,Managers were organized and focused on creating a great work environment.
good,learned good techniques for working faster and more precisely
good,"I would come into work on any given day to clock in and go to the front to find which area I was to recover merchandise in. It was alright for the most part, just very repetitive. My favorite part of all was the cashiering because I love interacting with others."
good,"Customer service, Help customers, Great them, Clean up, organize, Be polite"
good,"Working for Ross Stores was a Great Experience I wish i could of Continued working there it was very fast pace and busy, My Duties "
good,"Ross is great place to work if you are a college student. They can be flexible on availability change. They recognize hard work and great employees. It's just another retail job really. The only advancement are manger positions. On top of that they still aren't that great. Great place to work, but not for a short time."
good,"The co-workers were great, some of the management needed improvement, but were overall amazing."
good,Stock Room Logistics / Store Protection Specialist. Great place to learn and grow from within!
good,they aren't bad could give more hours instead of hire ppl all the time tho
good,It was fun working with the associates at Ross. They were friendly and awesome to talk to. The hardest part was making sure the store looked nice for the next day. Overall great experience for learning customer service skills.
good,I gained a lot of knowledge for a passion and hobby that I enjoy.
good,Mostly stood around because that was my job to greet people i learned a lot about how to catch people stealing a lot about facial expressions and body language and how to act during  bad situation management wasn't that great the hardest part was the standing it hurts your feet after a while the atmosphere is really busy as well
good,"A typical day at Ross involved processing customer transactions, helping with sizing clothing, and also providing customers with a great customer service experience. I learned how to multitask with this company and how to manage my time wisely. My co-workers were quite enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of my job was managing to balance high school with my first job, being able to have enough sleep for school and time to do homework. The most enjoyable part was helping customers pick stylish attire and giving helpful tips about fashion."
good,Management was encouraging and able to help others. The work and life balance was manageable.
good,"This was a busy work place. Constant customer service, multitasking and plenty of cashier work. I really enjoyed it because I obtained more experience and we had an awesome staff."

good,"Fun, friendly, fast-paced retail store that provides a warm and welcoming environment for shoppers to shop."
good,It can get busy sometimes and have to juggle different tasks at a time. I learned how to work as a team with my co-workers and management. Management listens and helps with problem I may face and teaches me how to do new things when something needs to be done. I think the hardest part of the job is some of the customers can be rude but I have to stay positive and treat them with respect and make sure I can help them with what ever the problem they are having. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers and management because I feel comfortable with the people I work with and from management I get to learn more on how to do more in depth with the store on how to make it better and functional.
good,Able to learn so many things about discount retail as well as myself as a member of the management team.
good,I have been working with the company for 9 months now and the only good thing I can say about it is that they work with you to make your Ross job experience as quick and painless as possible.
good,"A great place to work but advancement is minimal and often promised but they are slow to deliver.  I've learned many valuable job skills here like balancing all daily tills, balancing safe, making deposits, preparing reports, assigning tills, processing returns.  This business is in the process of changing management and regional directors and human resources are slow in making decisions.  The most enjoyable part of this job is dealing with customers and maintaining cleanliness and orderliness of sales floor."
good,The hardest part of my job is leaving to go home on time. My co-workers seem as if they do not want to show up on time to relieve. The most enjoyable parts are when the customers make me smile. I enjoy communication with customers.
good,"Manage the cash register"
good,"Answered phones, exceeded in customer service, worked the register and did returns. Stock room attendant."

good,A very fast pace retail business. Learn the process of receiving merchandise and how to merchandise them according to Ross Guidelines.
good,Good part time job.  Very hard to make a career out of this job if starting from associate.
good,A typical day as a unit id employee is to insure merchandise is received properly for shipment. This would require a verification of present merchandise compared to the system. Along with that insure correctness and accuracy of the merchandise being entered. One must have a good handle on numbers and obtain basic math skills. Management is well organized and clearly explains the job by giving updates and answering questions about orders. The hardest part of this job is learning all of the guidelines and having a clear understanding of applying trouble to problem orders. One of the most enjoyable aspect of this job is being able to see a one on one productivity score. This allows each individual to know their percentage of work for the previous day and by being aware of what each individual needs to work on.

good,management sucks they have bad attitudes and you don't get paid enough for all the work you end up doing.
good,"A typical work day at Ross I utilize our Ross programs to insure our daily tasks are completed efficiently for our customers to enjoy the their experience finding the treasures at our store. I appriciate being able to to come into work and know that it will be a fun day because we pride ourselves on the respect we have for one another. I assist  the store manager with the day to day operations of the retail store. Update payroll and complete employee schedules in advance. I am accountable for opening and closing store. I present the outcomes, targets and goals to the associates on a daily basis. I do monitor the progress of associate’s assigned tasks. I have gained excellent listening skills; focused on what associates said with intent to understand rather than respond. I have dealt with adversity and conflict head-on, and I have also engaged parties to collaboratively consider all of the different options/solutions to a problem. To give an example of the haredest part of my job I would just have to say I am always up for a challenge here at Ross."

good,This was a summer internship. Learned a lot about the industry and had a part in the actual planning of sales.
good,Ross was a very busy place on a daily bases because of the discount prices.I learned how to supervise and run front line. My co-workers enjoyed working with me usually because they would say I was a hard worker.The hardest part of the job is Christmas time when shoppers wreck the store. The modst enjoyable part was the discount.
good,"Thsi job was a seasonal position. Face-paced in the indusrty of retail/clothing, this position created skills in customer service, cashier handling and duties and knowledge on clothing, toys, bedding and bath and much more.

The most enjoyable part of working here is being able to talk to customers. The hardest part of the job i would have to say is keeping up with the departments, the store gets messed up easy, but its not so bad at the end of the night when the store is all closed its rewarding to see it all nice after a hectic day."
good,The customer always enjoyed mine and my coworkers politeness and the way we ran our store
good,The company does have room for advancement and will work with a flexible schedule.
good,"Every day I go to work I try to have fun and keep my work environment clean and organized. The hardest part of the job is when we have an overload of customers trying to get out the store fast, but they are so happy with the bargains they anticipate the wait."
good,"I would still be here if they wouldn't of cut us back to only 25 hours a week and changed our start time in the stock room multiple times within a year.  What started off as 7:45am start time and home around 3:00pm ended up being a 10:45am start time and having no clue when you were going home.  Some nights you would be so short handed you would be there from 10:45am til the store closed and still not be done."
good,Each Ross team is like a family that one becomes part of. The best part of the job is working with all of the wonderful and diverse individuals that for the Ross team.
good,Overall Ross is a great company to work for. The only thing is that there is hardly room for full time employment.

good,You were set to a specific area to clean for the whole night. Also had your own cash register
good,It was a fast paced environment. Constantly busy checking out customers.
good,"I typical day at Ross consists of slow mornings, long customer lines in the afternoon till evening. I've learned that I value working with a team and making customers happy. I don't think management is very good at what they do sometimes. They tend to shrug off customer opinions and complaints while employees continously keep dealing with these frustrated customers but it is not in our power to change things. Also, I feel they give little recognition to those who really deserve it! I love my coworkers. Although, the older coworkers are older women who have been there for over 10 years working full-time leaving no full-time positions available for the younger generation. Most of the younger workers that excel end up leaving the job. The job really isn't all that hard. I enjoy making customers happy and fulfilling my duties is always a self rewarding feeling."
good,The most enjoyable part about my job was getting to know my customers personally and making their day when they shopped with us.

good,"A typical day at work . Every morning I stock each register with bags and the accessories needed , as in pens and vouchers . Each associate that walks in I greet them and get them started right away on their task for that day . I'm in charge of keeping the front clean and running smoothly . If a cashier needs change , a receipt reprint , void , price check , or any assistance I'm there to help . Im also in charge of the break schedule and recording when they go and come back .

good,Its a quite an fun place to work very detail orientated team members where nice an very helpful upon customers questions helped customers find and locate their size in clothes and assisted them to the check out process
good,Doesn’t pay much for the work you do. The stocker hours are very short. Max four hours a day. Seems like you do a lot of work but for very little money.
good,My favorite things about working here are how flexible they are with scheduling and that you can choose from different departments to work in. I also like the community and feel of the workplace.
good,"learned to mark down items,and how to make sales tags and staging of store displays, employees were easy to work with, management were approachable, the hardest part of the job were the erratic hours, enjoyed helping customers the most"
good,I worked for Ross for a short period but over all was not dissatisfied. The stock room needs AC because it gets very hot in that small room but was compensated for with breaks.
good,"Management is not that great, but they work around my schedule. The store gets really busy, especially on Tuesdays. They are flexible with working hours."
good,The stock room was pretty cool we saw everything before it went on the floor. We got a daily discount plus one day every 3 months we got a bigger discount.
good,"Friendly managers and coworkers make it easy to go to work. "
good,"Work 1 year for the store in the stock room. Inconsistent schedules, get 40 hours only on Christmas season, then most of the time less than 20 hours a week. Good place for a first time job and get experience. Very friendly co workers and managers."
good,"I learned that professional communication fosters a positive work environment that supports team collaboration, resulting in customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable aspect of working in customer service is connecting with people on a personal level and providing problem resolution."
good,"Great management team. The stress is not within employees but with theft that happens daily in stores. Even though you know they're people stealing nothing gets done about it because of  California laws allowing them to do it. Fast paced business,  must have great customer service, great job for college kids, stay at home moms,  summer job seekers. Must be able to work under pressure some days at other days it's  cool to work at your pace."
good,"I enjoy working at Ross because it so fast pace, and allows for me to do more than just one job during a shift, which makes for a more eventful shift."
good,"Bellow management level is easy, but the hours very depending on the number of employees hired at that store. Also, if you don't try to make it seem as though you want those hours and you do not communicate it with management that you want more hours, they will not give you more hours. And in addition, if you call out frequently, or your availability is limited,then you will be scheduled for the days you are available but of course you will not be prioritized for more hours. Your attendance is important, but not as much as your communication with management. That being said if your availability is limited or you do have to call out, it's best to speak with the manger and tell them, otherwise it can be more negative towards you and the hours you are given."
good,"There are always opportunities to pick up shifts in this company and even advance. Every month there is an opportunity to receive employee of the month. As far as management,  it could improve."
good,"I started as a cashier and worked my way up to Loss Prevention. I spent several months training and studying for the promotion. I was very devoted to the job, and always did my best. It was my duty to monitor the cashiers and transactions, as well as patrolling the isles periodically. I kept a daily log of every incident and item discovered. Working there taught me to be more cautious and aware of my surroundings."
good,"Working at Ross, it was easy to get tasks done on time and understand what I was supposed to get done. Training was minimal, but it's a pretty basic retail job, so if you have experience it's easy to understand."
good,"My managers are really nice. The hardest part of the job would be speaking to rude customers, especially the ones that are rude for no reason.  The most enjoyable part is my coworkers who are all very friendly."
good,Good way to fill gaps/make a little money. Not a career in my experience . Mostly part time associates so company doesn’t have to offer as many benefits
good,its a good part time job for extra money. Constant customer rushes and fast paste work. Constant higher sales expectancy. Constant immediate communication with employees and managers. I learned that you need to be the manager when one isnt present.
good,The job is fairly easy depending on your position. I recommend Cashier if you are friendly and fast-paced. You are scored on how fast you scan and bag items.
good,You don’t obtain much of a career advancement or a chance to get full time in this company . But the people that work there make it a fun and easy environment to be there
good,"Fast paced environment, busy all day long. coworkers was easy to work with. There was always something to do in the store, clean certain areas when it was not so busy."
good,"The store gets crowded mostly on weekends, which makes your shift go by fast. Management is very good. The pay varies on what position you have on the job."
good,"I enjoyed the majority of my time with Ross Dress for Less. I enjoyed almost the full year that I was at the South Hill Location. I was passed over multiple times for positions, which really hurt considered how much I gave the company. I finally got to the point where I was going to leave the company after a year after I kept getting passed over for positions and expressed my feelings to the current manager and she did everything she could for me. I thank her for that to this day, she got me ready to take a MAPS test to become a manager. The only thing is that sometimes it is better to wait. I passed my MAPS test and was offered the job at the Northside Ross. I accepted after a week of pondering and moved to the new location. The job itself was perfect, but the atmosphere was terrible. Everyone hated me because they felt that I had taken their job and felt like they deserved the job over me. I continued to do my best and eventually was promoted again and still did everything I could do to be the best Manager that I could be. Multiple times a week I would buy lunch and/or dinner for my co-workers, I would do everything I could do to give them breaks on time and just about anything else they needed. I would work with schedules and be friendly to every employee and constantly I heard rumors about this person hating me and this person said this and that about me. I wish I would have stayed at the South Hill location because I would still be there and I would still be happy."
good,It's a good job to teach you time management and being able to get items on display in a quick and orderly way. The management is really good and they're very nice to both workers and customers. The hardest part of the job is being able to get all the items out of the packages and all set in time to run them out into the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions with the workers and the customers.
good,"This job consist of engaging in tasks assigned during all working hours. Performing a range of functions in all areas of the store as business needs require. Handling all customer issues in a courteous and helpful way.And performing daily recovery and light cleaning tasks to ensure a neat, clean and organized store."
good,Very fun fast pace and  Enjoyable place to work.The schedule is very flexible And they work well with their staff to fit their needs.  The pay is kind of low for how hard you work
good,"Working in the Cash Office was great.  Stock room in our store is not.   Stock room hours are all over the place.  You come in at 10am to stay until the truck is done, so either two hours or ten hours. You never know.  You get your schedule only 4-7 days before the next week so it is impossible to schedule doctors appointments or just your everyday life events.  You work Monday-Saturday and could get 40+ hours or 12 hours a week.   Management in store is better now with a new store manager."
good,This was my first job after high school and i don’t regret working there at all. I was also going to college and the managers were very flexible in working around your school schedule. The location of the store is a very busy neighborhood so it is very high paced.
good,I feel Ross was constantly busy which kept me busy and I loved it.I like a work place where I am constantly going .I feel that what a job should be .I absolutely love working with people so that was another huge plus and the employers where very easy to get along with as well.
good,"It is good to work there,because they provide free training,they collaborate and the payment is also satisfying,but it depends on how much are your needs"
good,"I liked meeting new people, rather it was employees or frequent customers. Corporate visits were always a learning experience. There was always room to grow and learn."
good,every day is something but great place.working on 82nd not so save. We have people coming in to steal something every day but you can't touch them or if they attack you you can't touch them or do much really just call the security and then after call the cops if it gets a lot more crazier but its a great place working with great people.
good,"It gets very hectic during holidays but time goes by fast. Some managers didn’t have good customer service skills, they were rude to customers leading to employees also having the same attitude. Pay was good, lots of hours during holidays but after wards they let a lot of people go or don’t give you that many hours."
good,There is always room to grow. The company will hire external store managers/manager at higher rate than managers who have moved up and grown with the complany. External managers dont really care about the policies and procedures.
good,My experience with Ross Dress For Less was overall great. The only advice I would give is to focus more on internal candidates when looking to promote.
good,A typical work day at work goes by pretty fast basically recovering around the store being on register. Or in the fitting room helping customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you meet all types of people who make your day.
good,Expect to work hard but pay is fair and management is decent. Not a bad place to work but it can get hectic at times during holidays and then during slow months hours could be cut down to nothing. Harder you work the more hours you can get.
good,Ross was a good comfortable job if you dont have kids or it's your first job. It's good pay and they do pay weekly if you go through the temp so I advise you to do so. But overall chill job. Just don't slack off or they will fire you
good,Ross helps develop key customer service skills . You can learn to develop communication as well as team deleopmenga skills . They as well help developed problem solving skills .
good,It was a great job to have during the holidays because of the discount that we get. I do wish that it lasted longer then just the seasonal work. It was a fun place to work as well with the dress up days and other fun things they planned.
good,"Ross is an ok place to work but management could use a little work. Most employees are friendly and helpful, by you get the occasional rude employee with an attitude."
good,"Its a fast pace job and you have to have a great attitude to work in Ross."
good,I have the opportunity to work on sales floor or stock either working in the morning shift or a closing shift. Managers are great with working with your availability.
good,"Working in any customer service job is hard work. I learned how to interact with customers in a positive way despite if they are being negative towards associates. My managers at both Ross dress for less that i was employed at are very hard working, and they do their best to keep everyone happy. The hardest parts of the job is being patient with customers and also standing for long hours. I mostly enjoyed my coworkers. I got to meet a lot of great people and made good friends."
good,its an enjoyable workplace ross is a company that always take care of his employee to don't suffer any discrimination by any manager or another employee
good,This company follows the OSHA standard are you take your required breaks. Many of the employees have worked the same position for 8+ years. You are required to accept fake currency and are scolded if you check a dollar bill because it is “rude” to the customers.
good,Was a great job amazing employees good discount flexible hours. Overall not a bad place to work especially if your want I g to jump into the retail field
good,`It was a nice place to work with great people and flexible hours. The managers work with you as long as you work with them. The only thing I didn't enjoy was there were limits on the amount of hour you can work and barely any full time job available.
good,Ross is a fast paced and enjoyable place to work. New merchandise daily and and great employee discount program.  Ross allows room for growth and the opportunity to move up with the company
good,"Fairly easy job to do and training is very thorough, however there doesnt seem to be very much incentive for employees. some of the employees werent too kind due to the fact that they've been there for a long time and no raises."
good,Typical work day starts with checking perimeter of store for immediate danger.  Learn how to identify and report potential internal and external potential theft
good,Should switch to weekly pay with the little hours given. Great prices on merchandise. Great work family. Learning processing is great it's simple and easy.
good,"Expected to have everything done within your scheduled time. Learned to manage the stock room and the team."
good,"My experience at Ross Stores, Inc. (in Georgetown, Texas) overall was a positive 2 years. I fulfilled all duties of the store from customer service to organizing the store and even management."
good,It is a great place to work if you can afford to work part time with no benefits.  Typical retail - fast paced - no down time.  Overall I liked working part time at Ross - I think it helps to have a great boss that works with employees
good,Perfect job for students since they work really well with the schedules. Work fast and you'll be fine. Average day depends on your position but can be fun at times depending on your manager.
good,I like how people help each other. and everything is well organized. Not everyone had lockers to put away their stuff. People who were from the Agency didn't have medical healthcare.
good,"I've wanted to work at Ross back when I was a teenager. I was soo excited when i finally got hired at the age of 47 yrs old. "
good,"I love working at Ross ,only issues is they have a new manager who makes everyone else do her work while she stays on her phone and yells at and blames whoever she was working with for whatever wasn't done and she'd tell me to do this job then switch it to another job and expect all of it to be done while she keeps switching me."
good,"N/A no comments shall be made."
good,"Ross has been my favorite job that I ever had, I just needed something that was full time at the time. I enjoyed going to work every day and loved what I did. However moving up in the company was next to impossible."
good,"All the coworkers I had at this particular store (though is likely limited to ours, based on what I have heard) are a great team and work together and have fun while working and we still get some of the best ratings."
good,This is a job that requires you to meet production. It is fast pace and you only get one break throughout the day and that is a 30-minute lunch break however it is paid. The hours I worked were 7-3 p.m. which was probably my favorite part.
good,"I worked as a temporary employee, because I was a snowbird and went back to New York every summer.  Management enabled me to work as a temp. for six months.  Employees were very enjoyable to work with as well as management. I worked nights the dressing rooms and the back of the store helping customers and at end of night putting clothes back on racks and help in straightening up the store. Most of the customers were Mexican, locals and snowbirds."
good,"You'll find favoritism at any warehouse or job site but here. Its crazy .They pick and choice who to be nice to. For example , if you're a suck up or speak Spanish , that's how they show up appreciation."
good,"While working at Ross the schedule was always different each week. The management was okay overall. Some managers was more understanding than others. Made some good friends and co-workers were nice. Very fast-paced job where some days we did not have enough people working. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up the place after closing hours. Overall, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make some good friends and meeting lots of new people."
good,"It is a busy environment, we must keep store clean and organize. We must work on the floor, cashier, and other areas. we had a diversity environment. The hardest part was to work as a team."
good,"It's fast paced, low hours and pay so it's good for college students or a first job. Not a lot of advancement there, but the hours are flexible to fit your schedule."
good,"A typical day at work I would work as a cashier, show jewelry to customers, make sure all clothes were off the floor and work in the fitting room. I learned customer service skills.The management was poor. The workplace culture was friendly.The hardest part about the job was scanning all items on the racks and placing them back on the floor racks. The most enjoyable part about the job was working with nice people."
good,"As far as responsibility, this job is relaxed and easy to complete. You're assigned your task for the day and once they're complete you help others or clean up the store. It's fairly easy, but sometimes it can become fast pace, especially on weekends. The crowd is heavier which means more cleaning and faster service. Overall, a great place for college students or young adults to work. The work load is fair and  it's very manageable. "
good,"Overall a good place to work, I do wish management would be more communicative especially regarding changes in how the operations team supports the various hardware and application teams."
good,My hours weren't always in the system so I would sometimes not get paid the correct amount and would always have to check in with managers . Which is ridiculously.
good,"Great work life balance, fair pay, reasonable work load. Social atmosphere keeps things relaxed."
good,"Inbound/outbound calls.  Issuing of tickets for said store.  Troubleshooting of store, equipment or registers, prior to replacement of equipment or escalation.  On occasions dispatching NCR, and learning of Unix program."
good,A typical day at Ross is i clock in and immediately get to work. make sure everyone on register has what they need and the customers get a fast and friendly check out. i learned to have better customer service. he most enjoyable part of my job is to get along so well with my associates and customers who always come in.
good,"As part time employee, Ross has a very flexible time. There will be time you’ll be schedule to close the store the whole week. You have two breaks, a 15-minute and a lunch break (30 minutes)."
good,"It is a great place to work, and they are really flexible, and work around your schedule especially for students.They were also nice in situations where an associate would fall sick, they let you call someone to cover the shift for you."
good,"A nice place to work Pt hours. Flexiable hours are nice."
good,"I've been working at Ross for 3 months now and it's my favorite job I've had in a long time. My managers and coworkers are extremely generous, kind, and always give credit where it's due. The customers, some good some bad at times, are usually 95% of the time a breath of fresh air and makes work enjoyable. Overall, if you're looking for a part time job with a flexible management team and fun/great to get along with coworkers, and a fun place to be i'd apply for Ross asap."
good,You should just have excellent customer service skills and the job will go very smooth for you and i think that they need to pay the employees better pay.
good,mejor remuneración y mas horas de trabajo para los trabajadores
good,"It was it was very energetic , working in a fast pace but careful . You deal with customer good and bad and at all time you give your best. Love it..."
good,"Very high paced but you don't get bored working stock"
good,"In my opinion, the hardest part about working in the warehouse is the toll it takes on your body. Sometimes it didn't seem worth it. No benefits as a temp worker, and process was difficult and selective to become a permanent worker."
good,At the end of the day that's what really count. If everybody did there job and management's are happy. If all employee did there part and ready for the next day
good,"working here is really fast paced, managers try their best to keep the store clean and end shift at a reasonable time. the discount is a good part of working here and 3 times a year we get double discount"
good,"Long night, some people have no respect there. "
good,Good growing company lots to do never dull moment great merchandise good discounts friendly coworkers typical retail be prepared for hard work and you will excel
good,"I worked at a very high traffic Ross for a summer. Overall, I loved my coworkers, the Associate managers were wonderful and very accommodating, but the store manager could seem very impatient with associates. "
good,I enjoy working at Ross. The management and staff are really nice and are flexible with working with my school schedule. I would recommend to anyone looking for a part-time job.
good,"Fun place to work with great people, but can be understaffed due to employee call-ins. Great discounts. Flexible work schedule. Understanding management team."
good,"I enjoyed the job as well as my colleagues and work environment. Our store manager was great. However, I decided to leave for higher pay and more work hours per week."
good,"A typical day for me as a full timer is busy, I have projects along with being a back up cashier when need be. I have learned a lot from working at Ross like time management, customer service, and responsibility for what you are assigned."
good,Best part of this job is there is no typical day.  Your coaching in real time to get the most out of your processes and productivity. Best part of this job is there is no typical day.
good,"Most days, as soon as I clock in, I'm assigned to a register and work a full 8 hours. The customers I help leave satisfied and happy. When I am not on the register, I help recover and put away go-backs to the floor. I keep my workplace clean to help me optimize my work pace efficiently and accurately. The managers were really good to all of their employees and were very responsive when the line would grow rapidly. They would send us back up cashiers or would hop on a register themselves to help bring the line down. The store was located in downtown San Francisco and attracted a lot of travelers. The store would have a lot of people in it so the workplace would become very busy quickly. Everyone i worked with had very fun and diverse personalities. All of our backstories allowed us to get acquainted and working together was always a good experience. The hardest part of the job was closing. There would be a lot of go backs on busy days because of our focus on the line. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about everyone and being able to work alongside with them."
good,"some days its so stressful you cant do anything right, other days its relaxed. very few days are so slow you cant get everything done. i love that you can do everything at the job, meaning have different duties so you are never bored."
good,They need to pay better to keep associate here. They can set up a little different like changing hours around or start up a A B teams.They over work they people not enough money in it.
good,"A typical day at work involves successfully processing the purchases of almost 50 customers a day, per cashier, whilst maintaining the work area to the utmost standard of cleanliness, and helping our cashiers maintain their registers."
good,"Ross wasn't too bad. I was only able to work part-time, so benefits were not included. I only worked 4 hrs a night 4 days a week. Around the holiday season they brought in holiday workers and cut regular employee hours. I didn't like that too much. But the job is fairly easy, keep the store clean, help customers with dressing room options, and ring them up as fast as possible to get them in and out."
good,The over all environment for this  company is great.  Everyone is friendly and  understanding. I definitely recommend this company to some one who is looking to make extra cash on the side or what have you.
good,Management staff is excellent. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday. Nothing about the job was hard. I was trained very well on how to handle day to day operations.
good,I really needed the job moving from a different city. I really enjoyed the first weeks but soon hrs dropped so did pay. I couldn't afford daily living expenses. If giving another chance with better hrs or pay I'm willing to work again.
good,"I did not work for Ross for very long but I loved it there. I never had any issues with the staff and the job was relatively easy to handle. As with most retail jobs, the hardest part of working there was dealing with rude customers."
good,"I start my shift by getting on the register right away because there is always a big line of customers. When the line goes down, I start to clean the front end and or make sure employees get their breaks and lunches. The managers are always there to help when we aren't able to go past our level of knowledge. I have learned that it is best to stay calm, especially when there is an unhappy customer; also to think of all the options to help the customer before you say no. The hardest part of the job is standing for a couple of hours, and trying to multitask and stay busy when there aren't customers in line. What  I enjoy the most, is when I am able to help a customer with what they need especially an angry customer."
good,"This was my first retail job; I worked very hard and was extremely flexible with all job assistments and criticism. This job requires a lot of self control and patience with other. It is important to understand that this is a discount retailer and everyone wants a bargain so be  respectful but attentive and everyone has a special situation. "
good,"This would be a good place to work whether you are new to the country,  the area, a first job, or a manager wanting to move up in life. Policies were consistent and were well thought out for a seamless and progressive team of workers."
good,With any retail job there are significant pros and cons. At Ross you must be productive at all times or else you will be reprimanded. It is hard but the benefits are great. They are extremely flexible.
good,great place to gain experience. fun and friendly staff. very organized and fast paced environment. everyone work together as a team to get the job done
good,It was a great experience just couldn't work out a good schedule between two jobs. I gained better customer service skills and I learned to move faster in all that I do.
good,The jobs now require certain things there are new rules like the attendance policy. You should be grateful to get hours because they always over in payroll
good,I really enjoyed my time at Ross. From time to time you'd have to deal with an unhappy customer but it was never anything to bad. The staff would always make jokes we would always try to keep each other happy.
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross, being a full time mom, this served as my me time , it gives me the opportunity to work with different clientele,  treated Ross as my second home, cleaning, organizing, recovering are just few to mentioned where I can say I'm good at as well as outstanding customer service. Good managers and co workers, as well as you get a discount employee. And most of all they have flexible hours."
good,"Working at Ross could be busy, relaxed and stressful depending on time of day and seasons. But the time goes by quickly and the discount is awesome!!!"
good,"A typical day at work, I walk the store constantly to make sure everything that is being sold looks presentable to the customers. I help customers that need direction toward something specific, sometimes I even sell people on items that they're indecisive about. Learning experiences would consist of helping customers, great teamwork, and knowing when to work. The most difficult part of the job would have to be the short staff and having to work longer hours. The most enjoyable part would be the people I work with."
good,It's a great company to work at every also works together here and u also have to work at a fast pace and make sure that everything thing is put up neatly
good,Its not that bad to work for ross it just depends on where you work and who is manager but it has good benefits if your full time and they help you with your schedule
good,"Ross is a good place to shop and work but managers need to be more conscious of giving employees in between an 8 hour shift."
good,"A typical work day involved cleaning up after customers while managing your everyday duties. you are also asked to perform another co-workers duties.The work place is very diverse, which is the best part of the job."
good,"We were responsible for tagging and stocking all merchandise in the store. Make sure the store is organized and ready for customer shopping. The hours were okay, and advancement was  a possibility"
good,"The people there are very friendly and very nice to work with.  Upon working there, I loved everyone that I worked with quickly and had a lot of fun partnering with fellow management and SPS team members.  Three times a year, there are double associate discounts, which are very nice because it makes things even more affordable; however, when it does come, it usually falls short of things one would like to buy.  "
good,Last management shift was not handled well and left the entire team with many uncertainties. The store stays open later than every other store in the shopping center.
good,i like working here and I get good hours and okay pay but I just don't like what I do I want something more challenging I don't like feeling useless at my job because I cant actualy stop thieves and so I want something where my work is fun and matters
good,"Working with my manager now in Dover, have made me appreciate the job more. I love helping customers. My day brightens when I help a customer because I know I made them feel appreciate."
good,"Over all review was great. As i said, it the other employee's . They were great ! I enjoyed the break room and the work. The area was in a nice place because, there were eateries around every where."
good,Learned a lot about working the retail lifestyle. Showed me a lot of people's characters and their beliefs also as well.
good,"We are always looking for anyone looking to make a career in retail. Ross can do that if you want to achieve goals and success, by working through all the Ross processes."
good,This job was very fun and productive . They took me in with no experience and taught me how to operate their equipment . I learned how to work the cash register and stock anything that needed to be replaceed in the store . Also maintaining a clean environment.
good,"the typical day, before the store opens the door to the public i count all the money from the day before and put the corresponding amount in each register. make the deposit to the bank. learn all the process with the money. the most enjoyable part of the job is to do the bookkeeping of the store."
good,I enjoyed working at Ross. Although you have to be a self starter as training leaves something to be desired. My favorite positon was the register.
good,I worked at Ross for upwards of 3 years and during that time we had a high turn around of cashiers. This is when i learned the job of customer services was not an easy task and takes a lot of patience. The good part about working at my location was everyone was friendly and willing to help if needed in other departments. We were very quick to do what we can to meet expectations of our customers whether it was making sure the floor was organized or helping to look for an item.
good,"This is a store that sells items from other stores. The store was a great part jb for me. The mangers were very flexible on the scheduling. When someone would call out, they'd call me. This allowed me to pick up extra hours. The management was also very accommodating of my availability*Benifits only offered to full time employees. Several of the people who started working at the same time as me were able to advance to manger positions. "
good,"Ross is a good place to work. Would I like to go back? No, just not for me. The managers and all the workers are very nice and they made working there easy."
good,"It was a great place to work "
good,"A typical day at work for me would be working in cashier or organizing the products in the floor. The management were nice and they would always try to work with you time. My co-workers were nice for the most part but I felt like they didn't want to be there. The job wasn't difficult at all, you just have to go with the flow. And lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing new products come in."
good,"I loved it, you're constantly busy so the work day goes by fast. You meet a lot of interesting people throughout the work day. It's worth the ride customers"
good,Ross is not for everyone but if you are dedicated and proud of the work you do you can make it successfully.   My peers I worked with over the years have been the best part of my experience here.  It is a diverse group of individuals.
good,"Bookkeeping for Ross was a new experience for myself. I have previously worked in booking before at another establishment. At that time I was on a team where the book work was divided between our group. At Ross, I was the team. There I balanced all the tills on my own. Documented and kept track of what amounts went to which account. I made deposits and requests for pick ups. All the responsibility I was used to sharing was all on me. It was definitely new and more of a challenge, especially since I had a time span to start and finish. I made it possible by training, asking questions also making mistakes and learning quickly from them. In no time i was handling the books for an entire shopping store by myself. Big accomplishment."
good,Good peoples.Management and staff are very friendly. Working hours are great and flexible. Needs more assisting with stocking the floor.
good,I love Ross until the start no giving no hours and they wasn't calling telling me I did have to work. I would come to work and get turn back around the door.one time I didn't work for a week straight and dat wasn't fear.
good,we would call customers and sell cox communication upgrades and use rebuttals to get the customers attention. At night we would call families to inform them about the donation truck coming on a certain day and ask to put out any donations. The hardest part would be to get yelled at from customers about calling so late or too frequently.
good,"Managers at this location are not the best, they act as if they care about our needs but instead blow them off when behind closed doors and not out in front of customers"
good,A nice high school entry level college position not so good for finances since the starting out is 7.25-9.00.
good,"I like Ross and the many different friends I've made there. The Management team, takes the time to commend you on you failures and your achievements."
good,"Great products at a value pricing for everyone."
good,Really depends on management team on how much you enjoy the job. With any retail job comes the difficulty of dealing with some rude customers. Other than that I enjoyed it and they were very helpful with my school/work balance.
good,"Ross is one of the easiest jobs I have it requires long hours of physically labor standing up the whole time, pushing racks running clothes and clean up."
good,"I actually worked at the Ross Distribution Center in Rock Hill, South Carolina. A typical day at Ross Distribution would be maintaining your zone and performance for production. "
good,"As a sales associate and Store Protection Specialist, I enjoyed the job and the job space. You rarely are bored but you won't be tasked with ""busy work"". Any and Everything you do in the store will make some sort of impact either immediate or long term."
good,I usually monitor the fitting room because I love interacting with the customers and assisting them with selections. My co-workers are pleasant and team players. The hardest part of the job is juggling having to buzz customer in for bathroom with a line of customers for the fitting room and answering the phone and some customers being impatient.
good,There was always something new to learn. I loved the fast paced environment of working as a cashier. The employee acknowledgement was also rewarding. Management really made me feel like I was an important asset to the store's success.
good,"Working for ross consist of a variety types of walks of life. Co workers can be extremely funny and friendly also,before i know it my shift is over."
good,The daily - weekly production goals are readily obtainable with compensating monetary rewards which promotes individual and team accountability. Results are relayed daily in order for associates to track personally.
good,"I enjoyed my time at ross, everyone is really friendly and you get hands on training with the nicest people. i learned how to communicate with people a lot easier and the management never once gave me any problems. They were nothing but helpful."
good,"Very easy taking the clothes out of a box, putting a sensor on and putting them on the appropriate hangers. management can be lazy at times but i think thats almost everywhere."
good,"Excellent company to work for, co workers are very team orientated.  Managers are very good at taking care of everyone while on their shift,"
good,"Ross is a great place to work if you want to meet good people, perform in a fast paced environment, and learn the keys to being a successful sales person."
good,Cant give the best review because I was not working for them for that long. On your feet a lot but it was a decent workday. Management is willing to work with you and try to coach you.
good,"as the only Ross in Guam, expect BUSY BUSY BUSY and workers expect to be overloaded with tasks and duties, whether you're working a 4 hour shift or a 10 hour shift. It is difficult to make overtime or extra hours because they're constantly on your if you make anything over. The work environment is fun if you make it fun, coworkers are great as well as managers, (some)."
good,"Fun place to work at once you get to know the people. A good job for anyone who doesn't have a lot of experience working. Like most places, there are people who are nice and there are those who isn't. In the stockroom, it's a fast paced environment so the time goes by pretty quick. We unload the truck, process the merchandise, and then take them out to the floor. I learned how to manage different situations, talking to different kinds of people, and training employees."
good,"Working at Ross was a great learning experience I learned how to multi task and work under pressure. The co workers and customers were very nice and friendly, I was hired on the stock team and I had to unload boxes and run the merchandise on the floor and answering customers questions about different products at the store"
good,"Great place to see your effort rewarded. Requires much patience and interpersonal skills. The hardest part was the difficult customers, but it was comforting to know that I had several other coworkers working toward the same goal. Management was about average."
good,"I enjoy helping customers locate the products or items they are looking for. Working at Ross is a great way to start your retail work experience. Fast pace, and team work goes a long way."
good,"Typically, a day at work for Ross Dress for Less, is fast paced and busy,there's never a dull moment. Working with the managers there is great,especially, when they ask you to come in early or on your day off,knowing that your willing to work and learn. I have recently learned to do markdowns ,so its great to get to do something new.The greatest part of my job is pleasing the customers with a clean store,fast checkout,and a smile.I do not really have a hard part in my job.I also love the option that I learn different jobs ,so I can have a variety of work experience all in one job."
good,Going to work it is a relaxed environment but still up to speed.Care for the customers and still work. Give the customers the best customer experience which means speed over conversation. Gives your schedule about Thursday the week prior so you know when about a week in advance. However if you need to take the day off you can just talk to one of the mangers. They hardly give you training until they notice you are doing something wrong. If they are over hours for the store they cut your much needed hours so they can make it.
good,"Ross was a great place to work. A typical day ranged from having slow foot traffic to being absolutely packed with customers so every day ended up being different and kept you on your toes. Management was supportive but each had their own view of particulars, how things should be ran in order to get the job done which at times made it extremely confusing. Most of the other employees were positive and uplifting but there are always the few that are as flat as a piece of paper. I believe that the most difficult part of the job was having to bounce back from a negative experience with a customer. All elements of the job can be learned and mastered once practiced and applied for long enough, but, retaining a positive attitude through the stress, customers, and job duties is skill to be practiced just the same. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing what your hard work can do whether that be the accomplishments from effectively managing, seeing a smile on the customer's face and knowing it was as positive for them as it was for you, or getting your team to work fluently and be a strong unit."
good,great place to work for great employees and supportive environment. will recommend this company to other who are interested in working retail.
good,Management were very accommodating when it comes to the work schedule. Great place to work for college students that are looking for a part time job.
good,Started as a part timer and was able to quickly advance. Plenty of support if that's your goal but wish it was more competitive with tuition reimbursement for full timers.
good,I did learn a lot from the people i worked with.  Starting from the managers down to my fellow associate.  Everyday is a learning experience.
good,"I have held this job while continuing education and job pursuit activities. They have been very accommodating with my schedule. The work atmosphere is pleasurable due to the positive attitudes by associates and management at this location. I will continue to work here until I am successful at putting my recent education and skills to work at a better paying and more interesting, (to me), job. People who seek management positions, have a great opportunity, as long as their skill set is applicable, Management supports employee growth."
good,"Working for Ross Stores was an overall great experience.  The true meaning behind the company s truly inspirational.  Working there was hard work.  Every morning we would unload freight, then process everything all in one days work.  The managers pushed us and motivated us greatly as well as the co workers.  The most difficult part of this job was my height although I always got my tasks done.  This job made me enjoy being a part of a team and leaning to be a part of  a successful company."
good,"Ross Murrieta is a fun place to work. Great Coworkers, and great customers. I enjoyed working each and every day, although it was only part-time. I would still be working there if I did not move out of state."
good,"Working at Ross Dress for Less was a great experience. I got to meet customers everyday and work with fantastic co-workers. A typical day was to clock in and get right to work, either stocking shelves, ringing up people or sorting items in the stock room. Our management kept the store in great shape and made sure we did the same. The hardest part of the job was closing time; Of course it is for everyone. The mess builds up and it's our duty to make the store as clean as it was in the morning. I did however, enjoy the friendly environment us co-workers formed and the fundraisers our store put together. It made the customers and employees interact more."
good,"Good part time job for me, the pay isn't the best for the amount of work you do but the hours work out for me. Management  is good, co workers are cool, nothing to hard about the job a lot of carrying and a lot of rushing to make sure u get done in time."
good,Working at Ross is great for people looking for a first job. Working up in the company is pretty easy although it requires you to put company policy first before yourself.
good,"Ross is a very great place to work. The culture and the atmosphere of helping people shop for less makes me happy!"
good,good place to work if you are a student with no children. very fast paced. it gets crazy around the holidays. you must be patient with people.
good,"You come in, find a manager to assign your daily tasks/ where you will be working. no more than 25 hours a week if you are part time. full time has to work 37.5 hours. fast paced, friendly co-workers. sometimes management isn't that great. Easy part time job"
good,"love my coworkers and bosses love my customers, keep my area clean help any team member that need help, try maintain other near areas clean if need it."
good,"If it wasn't for my need for full time work, I would still be at this company. Every day held new challenges and kept me on my toes. The satisfaction I got from helping customers was very fulfilling. The management was always ready to help, they all made sure every employee's voice was heard and their concerns were met. My interactions with my co-workers always added joy to my day. The hardest part of my job was having to tell the customers ""no."""
good,"I have  been with ross for 3 1/2 yrs. I have seen a lot, I have learned a lot. My co-workers are excellent. My managers are good."
good,its a good working environment you learn to grow as a person dealing with customer service your thrown challenges daily.
good,"Love the friendships that I've built at this retailer. A typical day includes any of the following: operation of cash flow, visual merchandising, fitting room duties, and sales floor duties. However, management needs a bit more improvement."
good,"I worked at Ross during a transition time in my life, knowing it would be a temporary job. I was surprised how associate centered the company was. It was always a great environment to be a part of however, it is retail so that says enough."
good,"first when you arrive you check your schedule to see where you are put. then once you get to where you need to be(fitting rooms, stock, cashier, sales floor) you ask the manager what you should be doing. then once they tell you, you recover that area. then before you leave you make sure the area is recovered again so the next employees coming in do not have to do it.  learned to be fast and friendly with costumers and help them with whatever they need. management needs a lot more work done. I am still currently working there. the co workers there are really nice as well as the managers. the hardest part would be to make sure you do a good job and on time. the most enjoyable part would be getting true cards from other employees."
good,its a fast pace job and alot of lifting well thats if you are a male people are good
good,"great team members, nice day customer r easy deal with once u learn how to. parents just let the kids run free in store will upset u since you'll be picking up what them messed up"
good,Typical day starts off slow then we hit rush hours and everything is in fast forward mode. I learned that customers like employees who are talkative and let them know that they come first. Management is very productive and friendly to be around. My co-workers are all friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job would be learning to keep a conversation with the customers while ringing up their items. The most enjoyable part would be learning new tasks and getting complimented when I do it right!
good,"I enjoy working here although the demands come pretty high at times, or very stressful. Upper management does not always seem to work well with store management."
good,i liked working at Ross if i didn't have to work in the dressing room. it was so boring back there like you're in isolation lol! It was alot of work. I hated cleaning up after some of yall trifling customers smh. i would probably go back for pt.
good,"Responsible for careful handling of all merchandise to avoid damage. Recorded numbers of units handled and moved, using daily production sheets or work tickets. Monitored product standards and quality-control. Pick/Pack, Shipping/Receiving, sorting, marking, team leader—responsible for distributing orders to employees, and monitoring daily progress, and completed assignments. "
good,"Fast paced,learned how to work fast ,check out fast ,improved cash handling and customer service,leadership skills"
good,"Working at Ross offered so many different things.  You can be placed as a cashier, but in doing so you are picking up so many various skills such as customer service and management skills.  The environment is sometimes fast pace, but that makes it never a dull moment.  When it is slow business, it gives you a chance to explore the store to know it better to then translate it to the customers who may have some questions like ""can you please direct me to..."".  The only ""bad"" thing about Ross is the pay and the lack of benefits it has to offer to their employees."
good,Quick paced environment. Speed and efficiency is key. Fun place to work. Great people. Hardest part is all of the heavy lifting.
good,"A typical a day at work for me, clocking in on time, cleaning front end  assisting customers with their purchase. Customer service is our daily routine, helping out and being there for our customers is our number one priority. Our coworker all grow together at our store, we are all there for each other when in need of a helping hand. I really have'nt experienced a hard part of the job yet, maybe because i love my job i love what i do/"
good,I met a lot of great people. And the work environment was always nice.
good,"Hardest Part of the day is having to be at work at 5:00AM.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and knowing the other associates.  You are cross-trained on all jobs and every week you rotate to a different job so as to not lose the ability to perform that job properly.  Also if the shift is short associates, then step up and fill in that job without missing a step or slowing down production."
good,its a great steady job that kept a check coming in every week i enjoyed the work place an my supervisor that was cool an made sure every was done correct an guided me through everything to suceed
good,"nice place to work during the holidays management was very kind, Co-workers were easy to get along with, hardest part of the job was dealing with cut  back on hours after the holidays, The most enjoyable part was seeing happy customers"
good,I'm very pleased with this job bu now that Ive moved it is just too far. The pay isn't all that good either.

good,If you want to find your first job. Come here but dont stay long. You wont really get anywhere.
good,"Starting off at this company as a temp. part-time sales associate and being promoted to Area supervisor in less than 6 months was a great win. This company is face growing and has plenty of room for advancement within the company. With the meaning hard work pays off , it was alot of work and the expectation's are high that was one of the thing's I loved because it help's you push your self and raise your on bar for as what you can accomplish. The hardest part but can be a very easy part of the job was insuring all Managnment staff was on the same page and working together instead of against one another. Overall I enjoyed working for this company beneifits were amazing and the potenial is there to grow if you want it."
good,"A growing company that is expanding its number of new stores. A nice place to work, good benefits. Still growing department and setting up processes and procedures.  "
good,Work really fast but make sure you do it correctly everyone was really nice and helpful it was only part time so i didnt get a lunch but i did get a break.
good,Working at Ross is a very easy job. It was my first job and I learned a lot at Ross. I worked with customers and helped them with anything they may have needed in the store. I was a cashier and also did returns. I worked in the fitting room department. I was one of the Markdown members that would do price markdowns for the store. I had great co-workers. Over all I enjoyed working for Ross.
good,"Meet and greet customers. I'm learning to become a cashier, and I've learned how to do stock, organize and pick-up after the store. I've learned how to deal with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with different types of people."
good,"I love the environment here working at Ross, Majority of the time we all work as a team to get the job done. Customer service is what we value, The managers are prompt and ready most of the time. and of course not everyone but the associates here make you feel welcomed. one of the cons are the compensation, sometimes the store hours during holiday. Overall i love my davenport store at Ross,"
good,"A typical work day requires customer interaction, reading floor plans, and team leading. From working at Ross I have learned management skills and how to multitask. My management team has help me successed in not only moving up in Ross but also teaching me how proper take on difficult situation and proper time management. My co-workers have also been a great part in my experience of working at Ross. They are willing to allow you to teach them new task everyday and always excited to be at work and apart of the Ross team. The hardest part of my job is the outdated computer systems and programs we use to assist our customers making a simple question some times very difficult. The most enjoyable part if Ross is being able to learn something new everyday making it able for me to grow in the company."
good,"Enjoy working at Ross , has great team work and managers. Makes for a great day or night at work . Love working for this company . I have learned all departments of the store , cashier , FES , fitting room and learned how to maintain a clean and safe environment for our customers as well as staff."
good,"Ensured and anticipated the customers shopping experience. Assisted with proper merchandise presentation, operated the cash register, customer service, markdowns receiving and tagging of store merchandise. Learned how to deal with irate customers. Co-workers are enjoyable to work with. Hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for hours. Enjoyable part is the relationship from customers achieved."
good,Van Huesen is a great place to work and grow as both a person and co-worker. Management is always positive. I enjoy the environment very much because it is very positive & engaging.
good,"Working at Ross was A great experience, there was always room to advance and I absolutely admired that, and employees were always  rewarded for the hard work that they put forth."
good,I enjoyed working in retail and being able to interface with customers on a daily basis while going to school full time too.
good,"-it was nice to meet people"
good,A typical day is helping out customers and letting them know that you care. The busy traffic flow keeps me energetic. I enjoy my interaction with my customers and co-workers.
good,"This was a very fast paced work enviroment. I did almost every job in the store from fitting room, cashier, stock room and floor associate.  The co workers were very fun and nice to work there. I worked there for three years so it was enjoyable."
good,"you never really knew where you were going to be working in the store the day you walked in unless they told you in advanced. some days you'll do fitting room, some cashier, some stock, some emptying truck, it always changed."
good,"Your manager can make or break your experience, good work/life balance and great parties. Learned how to do many functions like a buyer."
good,"As a cstomer service cashier, I enjoyed helping people. I would operate the cash register, handled currency and all other forms of payments. From my time at the store, I learned how to stock merchandise, count monies, returns, run a record of the days tranactions and train new employees. There was not anything about the job I could say that was hard, I just treated people the way I wanted to be treated."
good,"Ross has a huge turn over rate, but that is understandable considering it is a 18+ up retail job that pays minimum wage. Personally, I loved all of the management. Every one has their own quirks and doesn't always get along well with each other, but problems were always resolved quickly."
good,This place was very fun to work and meet new people. Staff are friendly and they do team work.
good,"Ross is an amazing place to work, especially in the valley. The thing it lacked was how I was trained. I have worked there for almost 2 months and have only taken one training quiz, I feel as if they put training on the back burner."
good,"Management were very nice people, were not the best managers, but they had really good attitudes and would work with their employees. Long hours on your feet, cleaning up after customers. Need good person skills for this job."
good,Associates exhibit great team spirit. SM & DM are invested in the progress of associate development
good,"Great place to work at but as for hours you do not get too many. If you have bills then I would suggest looking for something else that will give you hours. You get paid bi-weekly and right now it is just enough to give me gas money and pay for my phone bill, not any of my important bills though."
good,"A typical day is working with fun co-workers and getting your job done,i learnd everything about the whole store and every department and where to put everything,the mangement was great and treated everyone equal,co-workers are fun to work with and very friendly and easy to gey along with,the hardest was when i first stared as a cashier but i got the hang of it very fast,and the enjoyable part is when i was done with my department and offered to help anybody that needed help"
good,I was always energized and ready to work. My day went by extremely fast. My co-workers and mangers were very supportive and easy to speak to. The team as a whole was very organized and proficient. I learned that working as a team and having positive energy will improve the quality of a business.
good,When I worked for Ross I was able to view merchandise before it hit the sales floor and depending on what it was could put it on hold for the duration of my work day. Along with the great prices that the store already offered I also got a pretty nice employee discount. 
good,Working for Ross was pretty good. It was always busy witch always kept me busy and i like that. One other thing I like was my co -workers and the discount!
good,I enjoyed working for Ross Dress for Less. I learned how to perform the duties of a cashier and customer service.
good,Advances from within
good,Sizing
good,Didn't work here to long due to management.
good,"I have worked in retail for quite a while and Ross has had the best staff of management I've worked with yet. They are super understanding and flexible with school, a second job, personal issues, etc. Unless you're a supervisor you won't get more than 20 hours a week, but they are very willing to cross train you in other areas to help you pick up hours. So it isn't necessarily a job meant to solely support yourself with, but it can help pay the bills somewhat."
good,It is a very fast paced place to work for and I enjoyed it because it kept me busy and working and that's what I was hired for. If you are a hard working reliable person they'll help you out and give you more hours.
good,Enjoyable and Beneficial
good,"A typical day at work would be slow paced mornings, during this time I would unload new merchandise keep areas clean, prepare my self for lunch time rush co workers and management always work together to ensure customer satisfactory the hardest part of this job is not meeting customers expectations. The most enjoyable part is producing sales."
good,I deal with customers on a daily basis. I've learned to be patient and how to work faster. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing one on one with the customers.
good,If ur in School ross would be a great work place to for u to work at.
good,"Enjoyed this type of nature everyone was always helpful towards the next. Always came to work with a smile, and normally left with one also. The customer's here we regulars and I loved them. Making a customer's day made my day. Seeing them walk out of the store with a smile due to that I made that smile was the greatest feeling."
good,"This company is great for hiring those that need a part-time job or a little cash in their pocket for school. Wheather part-time or full-time, employees get a big discount on everything in the store once a year."
good,"Chill place to work just make sure you do your job. Wish management positions paid a bit more, other than that pretty good. No forced overtime atleast in my experience."
good,If you need part time hours this a good job that allows flexibility when scheduling. The amount of hours given to associates may fluctuate depending on the time of year.
good,"It was a great place to work! Customers were nice, associates were great really helpful. Wanting us to grow and learn! Management really cared about us! Awesome place 😃"
good,"Know you're Retail."
good,good place to work some drama just because people get a little power and abuse it which can sometime bring bad energy but overall still a good place to work
good,"I only recommend ross for the retired and college students. The ross that I am at right now is very flexible with my college schedule. I'm able to change my availability and ask for some time off. Most of the customers I have dealt with were very friendly, but you will get a bad apple once in a while. Oh my managment sucks. All of them expect  one."
good,Fun place to work stockroom every body work to allot turn drama they where always hiring.   I was stick in the stock room no other chance to learun new jobs sorry so I quit
good,"Es bueno lo que hay q trabajar muy rapido,mejoraria el salario o aumentaria horas"
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers with their purchases which includes making sure that all items are accounted for when customers enter and exit the fitting rooms.  Shelves are to be stocked and restocked accordingly.  You must make sure that your designated zone is free of trash and debris.  Also, make sure that the customer has a pleasant shopping experience.  Management is great.  They are easy to talk to.  The culture of the workplace is upbeat and friendly.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with the customers."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. The manager tends to order food for associates while their on break when I worked there, and good attitude is shown towards other employees."
good,Working there was amazing. The only issue I ever came upon was issues with how the management was running the business. Other than that working there was very easy.
good,Overall Ross was a great experience. I learned a lot about the retail-aparrell world. From entry level up to loss prevention. My management team was great for the most part of my tenure their. Only complaints I can think of is being under paid for the hard work you put in day in and day out.
good,The other workers are very nice and the management is understanding. The overall experience is good and I would recommend the job to another person if customer service is what they are seeking
good,"A typical day at work was run over and over fixing clothing and distributing   other departaments missplaced items."
good,"Productive and fun workplace to work at. Coworkers can be a little rude sometimes, but overall a good experience if you mind your own business and do your job on time."
good,"Overall my experience with Ross was a little shaky in the beginning. I started off in stock but didn’t preform adequately so they moved me to sales floor. It’s a much calmer experience, for stock need fast pace workers. I am content with working for Ross"
good,Ross likes to promote internally before hiring for certain management positions outside of the company so that gives more opportunities for the employees to be promoted!
good,"Great environment with friendly workers, i would arrive early to clock in. once i was on the clock i would be given a section of the store to keep tidy and work at the register whenever i was needed."
good,"Working at Ross has always been a wonderful gift for me. Compared to my more previous job, it's more flexible, worthwhile and fulfilling. A typical day includes trying to come up with ways to efficiently finish your assignments given the amount of time by the management. I learned a lot while working at Ross such as using the register, knowing inventory and just providing good service overall. The hardest part of the job is occasionally, the management assigns to work that is equivalent of two persons. It's too much sometimes. All I'm saying is if you can start at Ross, it can lead to many more opportunities in the long run."
good,"Fast paste working environment, friendly coworkers, very comprehensible with school schedule, the pay rate is good, but the closing hours are extremely late."
good,"The hours are easy, mostly about 20 hours per week. Managers are present and helpful, job is simple, and coworkers as friendly. For a first/temp job, it's an excellent place to work!"
good,"You learn to multitask and handle a lot of responsibility. Management works with you to create a schedule that works for both of you. There's generally a peaceful atmosphere among employees unless the store is behind on stock, then it's a little stressful. You'll typically take care of your assigned department only, unless you're trained to cover for another department as well."
good,"Overall I had really great experience while working at Ross. I made good friends and learned to communicate with managers and coworkers. I learned how to manage customer complaints and how to adjust my own feelings. I love how flexible the schedule is, and the managers will always help to work things out. I made good friends here."
good,It’s a good place to work. The only issue is the turn over rate. The issue with it is a lot of the people just quit and do not give notice and is very stressful for the employees that have to cover the shifts they were assigned.
good,"A typical day at work includes working on the register with a smile on your face, and then cleaning the sales floor and organizing the merchandise. Multitasking and the willingness to go with the flow are very important in this workplace."
good,I really enjoy my position at Ross. They are as flexible as can be with as many employees as they have. If I need time off for Dr or court or children they have been accommodating. I have picked up many extra shifts. Really a great place to work.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Ross. I started on the sales floor and quickly advanced to a Stockroom Supervisor. I learned so much in my years there. Training was always available . I traveled and opened stores in other states. They really encourage you to grow within the company.
good,"Be prepared to be asked to work after your scheduled shift or receive calls asking to come in on your days off. Other than that you can learn a lot from the store manager. She’s an amazing example of a smart/hard worker. The supervisors are welcoming and wise. My coworkers were smart, fast, funny, and goal oriented. Great work environment. Best perk is the employee discount!"
good,This is a perfect job if you are just beginning your work history or just need extra money as a second job. Managers are great and will keep you busy if you make sure to do things without needing to be asked. Clean store in Weatherford and good employee discounts.
good,Start time usually morning or early afternoon.Display command presence to prevent potential loss.Insure the safety of associates and customers alike.Review video of all suspicious activity.
good,"Let me just start out with saying, if you're the type of person that wants ""structure"" when you begin working a new job, such as training, this isn't the place for you. When I first started, my manager said ""Go to the stockroom and get started"" I had no idea where the stockroom was, nor had I met ANY of the employees. I followed another stockroom employee down and the stock supervisor said to me ""Get in the pod with (employee name)."" Who is (employee name)??? Well, I found (employee), after weeding my way through the VERY unsafe jungle of boxes, conveyor belt (they call it a neste-flex) racks, hangers, merchandise, clothing carts, etc. Cherie was not a trainer, and she simply said ""start on that box, put security tags on them, hang them in order as it is on the sales-floor."" Easy right? ha! NO! It has to actually be in PERFECT ORDER, the tags have to be in the PERFECT spot or they fall off/cant be used. I think I set off a good 30 black alarms before I put even 1 on correctly. "
good,"A typical day at Ross Dress for less is pretty busy all the time . Everyday I learn something new about the register or the fitting room even sizing the close on the floor. Management for the most part is pretty organized and awesome. The hardest part of this job is CPR, CPR is pretty much grading when your on the register of how fast your going. You really have to go as fast as you can receiving a score of 95 or higher . The most enjoyable part of the job is pay day .It makes you feel like all the hard work sure did pay off. :)"
good,A great place to work for and to shop at. Everything is typically collabrative on a day to day basis. One thing that you will learn from working here is how to connect with different types of personalities because you will come into contact with many customers.
good,Working at ross was a very productive experience and not only productive but very friendly and welcoming place to work at.Overall my experience was very good and if it was not for being a seasonal worker i would work there again
good,"Great employee discounts on store merchandise. Sometimes cashiering gets overwhelming during busy times. Some managers are great...others not so much."
good,it was a great learning experience. very fast paced the hardest part about the job was workload was hard to mange causing longer work days. It is not a long term job.
good,"The job was good until i noticed that the supervisor had favorites , and that made it hard for a lot of employees to advance. other then that the job was ok."
good,What makes Ross cool is definitely the store manager and how the tackle that store. They bring so much life to their coworkers its crazy. A SM's mood can sway the whole store if they aren't careful. I loved the teamwork and closeness we all had as professionals and friends. I appreciate those guys til this day.
good,"I worked in several positions and was promoted several times. I was in charge or several departments, counting and finalizing the daily cash deposits. I completed weekly schedules for up to 50 employee's. I would open the store and assign daily tasks for scheduled employees as well as their break schedules and specific department tasks. I learned how to set up deartments according to season and display guidelines."
good,Only problem there was the manager that took over because the original one who hired me relocated had an issues don't know what it was but it was very noticeable she didn't too much care for me.
good,"Days move fast depending on what kind of work your doing. People are friendly, Manager is really awesome. They work around your family schedules, accomidate to you if you need to leave early for any reason."
good,It’s a great place to shop with many different varieties of clothing. Anyone can go and find exactly what they are looking for  and a nice place to work with friendly managers and all the associates get along .
good,"It's a good place to meet new people and a great place to work.They just need to give more days and hours so u would like to come to work.Yes,wonderful ."
good,The minimum wage was just raised so that’s good. The work is fairly easy. I enjoyed working in the stockroom. The company standards change a lot but mostly for the good.
good,Great place to work. I learned how to manage time properly by working as a cashier and on the floor. I respect the management at Ross store. all employees are nice to me. The hardest part of the job is that I have to stand throughout my working hours. the most enjoyable part of my job is to meet different kind of people every day and I love talking and helping the customers.
good,"I have been employed by Ross Dress for Less since I have graduated high school back in the year 2014, and I absolutely love them overall. I also love the discounts."
good,Under paid and sometimes over worked. I enjoyed working with team players. Everyone pulled they weight but sometimes we still had to stay late. Certain customers are regulars and that makes the job easier to assist.
good,"ross has very low payroll, so expect to always be busy at work because there is never enough cashiers. hardest part was the customers, sometimes they feel entitled. however, the work environment and your co workers make you enjoy coming to work. the employee discount is 20%, but they are extremely strict on it. I've seen people lose their jobs over it."
good,Follow the company's bests practices and begin your scheduled duties which are more often than not post at the front of the store. Practice SET for setting the sales floor and you'll be all set.
good,"Ross can be a great place to work, it gets very stressful though. Customer's can get very defensive/angry at times and you do need to learn how to handle those situations properly. Overall it really depends on the management team and the things District offices/Corporate offices want to happen."
good,Ross was a very good foundation for me. The team was amazing. My manager was always made sure that her team was in order. She made kept her team together.
good,"Its okay, great store. Need better management. So much work on one manager. The work is not hard at all. Very friendly customers. I have learn alot in retail at ross from the d.M"
good,Helping customer develops good customer service. Good clothing discounts. Employee's help each other and  friendly work environment. Can at time be very slow paced..
good,"You can work hours around your kids school schedules.  Many women like working here to get discounts on merchandise, You have to constantly be moving to keep merchandise arranged properly, return merchadise tried on in fitting rooms to floor, prevent shoplifters, and checkout customers on the registers."
good,I loved the people I worked with. The stock room was a stressful work place. The work was fast paced because every day there was a truck. The process time for clothing boxes was nowhere near where it needed to be. They expect way to much
good,"my review for Ross is that is was friendly and there was always help when needed. Ross was also a very busy job, it was great working with the customers."
good,"Friendly associates and they will make you work to make time go by fast. It is a good job, however, poor weekly hours. This is a job where you can go to school full time and have this on the side to get some extra cash."
good,"This job experience was ok for me i would have stayed if the management was consistent with the hours and certain job duties that were given. At one point I was doing customer service , register and stock I was comfortable doing this role along with any other assistance was needed. I found it pretty unfair when some of the employees kept taking days off and switching their hours constantly, I kept accepting those other  hours and days given to me, I had to cover. At some point I was unable to cover one of the unexpected shift hours and since that day on , the manager was shortening my days and "
good,Love working here. Very fun and fast paste. Very flexible with schedule. They also give you a great opportunity with advancing. Easy work and management is awesome for the most part
good,"A typical day at work as an Ross employee would be working in a fast paced environment, and not getting bored doing the job given to you. Ross is a fun place to work, not only is it fast paced but also a friendly environment with outgoing coworkers who are more than willing to help you out. I learned that time management is important and team work is just as important. The management there is great. They work alongside the employees to ensure that we are able to satisfy and exceed expectation for the company and customers. There really isn't nothing hard about working for Ross. All you need to remember is that you follow all their regulations, be honest, friendly , willing to work hard and make sure that you do your part to help keep the company's reputation good. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, interacting with the customers and knowing that you can assist them in finding the things they came to purchase."
good,Ross has a great work environment. All my coworkers were friendly and understanding. I was pregnant at the time I started here and they were very considerate of my needs. The managers were very nice.
good,Its a good first job for anyone. Been with the company 5 years and enjoy the employees. Work with you schedule. Fast working enviroment. Mostly part time hours
good,"Laid back retail environment, not too many intelligent people around at the lower levels. Promote from within which is good for people who want to be there long term."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in, checking your assignment for the shift, hearing updates, and then giving people breaks as needed when you clock in. Your shift depending on where you are stationed could range from picking up clothes off the floors and organizing the racks, operating the cash registers and jewelry counter, organizing and processing the new items, organizing toys and baby clothes as well as managing the fitting rooms, or placing and arranging the merchandise on the shelf. Some stores do have a security team call the SPS (Store Protection Specialist). I was both SPS and Retail. The stores have a cultural of understanding. If you have a problem and communicate what's going on then the store tries to help. We had a girl have a tree on her car before her shift and one of the managers used their break to help her get to work. There was also times when my schedule would have to change due to life events and college and Ross worked with me."
good,"Yo le dedicaba todo mi empeño , es un trabajo que se requiere rapides y organización."
good,"It is a great place to work, it was always organized and clean. I learned a lot about the company and it made me work hard. Ross taught me what it means to earn something for myself"
good,"I have been with the company for 5 years.  I started as a part time fitting room attendant and moved up to the full-time loss prevention sps.  This company has given me the opportunity to grow within the company. Although I have other dreams and aspirations and do not plan on being with the company in the near future, I will say that this company has helped develop me and has prepared me for where I am moving on to."
good,It was very easy to get a job. Easy to learn and get trained. A little too busy environment for the money. It is a great place for beginners! Not enough for a living yet!
good,"Ross Distribution Center is a fun easy job, you get to meet new people. The security there was okay, we use a badge to get in to work, to clock in and out, and to open the front gates."
good,Ross was a fun place to work. Not always super staffed and never a very big budget to keep up with the demand. Working in management was fun. Lots of growth opportunity
good,This was a cool company to work for. Not many opportunities to advance in the company is the only downfall. Also the discounts are great .i enjoyed working here for the time being
good,"Fast paced environment, great management, very flexible with hours and plenty of customer interaction, great part time, don’t expect to get a raise anytime soon."
good,"Great education institution for work life. Very well organized structure at all levels. Sr. Team are excellent mentors with open door policy at all times. Excellent place to start a supply chain or logistics career. Excellent health benefits."
good,"working at Ross was a good time, I really liked my managers. They seemed to really care about us, the employee discount was nice, and two times a year they gave us even better discounts, they also provide us each a locker for our personal belongings, had a break room to eat in, and had a fridge. Overall was a nice experience."
good,"You have to be willing to work at a pace to keep up with job duties.  The job itself isn't hard, just be ready to switch positions in all areas of the store.  The work hours are given based on the store needs, which can not be good at times."
good,"fast paced, lots of things to do to keep you busy.  great people to work with, great benefit in getting the 20% discount.  comes in handy for the holidays or back to school shopping"
good,"I enjoyed working here because of the family-like atmosphere and caring managerial feel. This being said this job has growth options and allows room for you to show your worth. It can be stressful at times, but overall my only reason for leaving would be that this was never meant to be a career for me personally."
good,Working at Ross meant working at a fast and professional pace to secure good customer service but also making sure customers didn't have any dissatisfaction with the wait time at a cashier line.
good,"It’s fun if you’re lucky enough to work with nice people, otherwise it’s a typical come to work, work, and then leave- type of job. Hours vary, but they refuse to give overtime"
good,"Incredible service and huge selection! I brought in a painting by my daughter, looking for a special frame. I tried to describe my vision despite lacking artistic ability or knowledge. They walked me through a number of options - really taking the time to explain the differences in the frames and borders.  We looked at all the various choices and they ultimately helped me select a gorgeous combination!  I couldn't be happier with the finished product.  As for pricing, I was surprised at how little the custom framing was in comparison to other custom frame shops.  I will definitely be back."
good,"Overall it is a good working environment with flexible hours"
good,"Not much to say here.  It was a great job, but they hired too many people and left many of us with less than 10 hour weeks.  That couldn't pay the bills unfortunately, so I had to go elsewhere."
good,Ross definitely promotes from within rather than hire new people. It's great if you want to move up the ladder. However they are always overstaffed and expect you to work like 5 people.
good,"an o.k. place to work, while looking for a full time job. no benefits, no room for advancement.max hours per week 20 hours, micro managed, but  a job is a job until you find the right job."
good,Love the rush to get things done. Always had at least one or two co-workers offering to get Starbucks. Always had a great time putting our things together and putting away.
good,"Fun to work with others"
good,"Always a task to complete at Ross. Cross training is necessary here. An employee switches tasks and focus often during a shift. This is a retail environment open to the public. Shift are scheduled to business needs, meaning when customers are shopping. Customers shop nights and weekends. This is NOT a 9 to 5 job. As a manager you work a rotating schedule.  The worst and best part of this job are  the customers. You learn how to communicate with many different people and backgrounds. How to multitask and be efficient. And emotional maturity: comment and complaints made are not about you, don't take it personally."
good,It was a fast high pace job but it insured that I could pay for my college classes. the people were great there were never problems. Ross works well with hours but the full time position just was not for me.
good,"fast paced fun clean. you become a family, enjoy going to work, easy work i would recommend ross to anybody for a little extra cash. its no job to make into a career thpugh unless you level up."
good,"Management is fair, paid is good, discount is good. hours are limited to 25 or less. Overall, I really enjoyed it there. Would go back if more hours were available."
good,It is very quick paced however the team of coworkers you work with makes the job a bit easier and a little more fun. The dress code is doable. Like with any place you'll have managers you like more than others but it comes with the territory of retail.
good,"This is a very busy store, and there is always work to be done.  However, there is an appreciation when the job is done well.  The hours can be modified for personnel business when needed.  Team members work well together, and management appreciates."
good,Very much an on the go position.  Was necessary to juggle multiple responsibilities daily.  Management very supportive.  It was all about numbers (meeting company goals).
good,I worked at my location for 5 years I didon't get promoted until year 4. There were no opening's and wanted you to train at your location. The employees are great way to keep your moral up when it gets busy.
good,"I loved working there, My only problem with the company was not enough hours, and not enough pay. There was some lack of training, but when I spoke with management about my concerns, they tried to correct it."
good,"It is a good company to build your experience in Retail."
good,It's a lot of work but you learn to enjoy the busy atmosphere and the customers that you see over and over again.  They are fair when it comes to everyone doing there share and my manager was always there to help me when I needed it.
good,"As my first job with no experience, they'll train you everything you need to know. Co-workers were supportive and treated you with respect. I loved to help my team and my customers with smiles and made sure our customer service was excellent. Hardest part was multitasking, open/closing the gates for delivery, take care of call offs/filling in shifts, managing customer service, cash office, all at once but I still manage to get what I needed to do as a Area Supervisor. Overall, it was a great experience of 3 years."
good,You work at a very fast pace and limited time to complete a task. But worth it because you learn how to work with others and also learn how to be a teammate.
good,We do fun activities during the holidays. The holidays are super super busy because its retail. We have the best deals on name brands. Were not like other retail stores where the cashiers take their time cashing people out. At Ross we are trained to move fast like fastfood restaurants.
good,"Stock, Cashier, and putting clothes away in their place. Need to assist the customers and have your job duties completed. Once the store is completely clean everyone can leave."
good,I truly enjoyed working for Ross at night. The environment was both relaxed and fast paced. There was work to be done every night and the people were a joy to be around.
good,I had an awesome team surrounding me but the upper management started to slack on there job and it all fell on me o fix. It got to the point where I was not being paid for the work that I was doing and it was stressing me out. I left on good terms and would go back to work for Ross just under a new store manager.
good,"Good place to start if you're looking to go into retail. Flexible with hours. There are multiple managers that don't communicate well with each other causing constant confusion. Overall, it's an easy job for a student."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Ross Dress For Less and had they compensated my raises after they upped their starting wage, I would have stayed. However, I couldn't justify staying at a place that expected me to be a supervisor over others and make the exact same that the new employees were making. So I left."
good,Great place to work. Managing 15 people or more. Meeting new people everyday is great. Really enjoy working here everyday. The hardest part would just be working until 11 at night.
good,"Ross is a great place to work. I worked here to gain experience is customer service. It was a temporary job, but when it was getting towards the end of the year they told me I would be let go 3 days before! I was very upset. Now I am unemployed looking for a job. They did not give me much warning and I believe that was not fair. At Ross the only thing you do is ring people up at the register and clean the clothes off the floor."
good,It was a pretty easy job (stock team). The discount was very low though (10% off). The pay was pretty low as well. Decent amount of breaks. The coworkers were very nice and helpful.
good,"The people are awesome. The work is hectic and never ending, but overall pretty basic. They expect a lot from their associates, but tons of room for advancement"
good,"Not everyone is cut out for retail but Ross is a good starting place. Some managers might be a little difficult to work with but it’s not a hard place to work at, yoi figure thins out quick."
good,"I love working here, being Christmas the hours are great but after the hours aren't good. It very laid back very understanding on your problems works with your hours"
good,I loved my job at Ross but my boss made it difficult otherwise I would have loved to stayed at Ross. They have discounts for employees which was a plus. I love  to shop at Ross and really enjoyed my job. I also think that the hours there were not long enough for getting our pay rate also if there was only a 30 minute lunch which I think we deserve to have a longer break because we've got so much done within the time frame and sometimes sent home early I guess I would rate Ross careers three stars but for the shopping five stars.
good,"Quick and Busy, always working on the floor and cashiering. Closing the store was a bit difficult. Always had options with improvement and training within the company."
good,The workplace was calm and friendly. The work was easy and managers were understanding.Everyone worked together and the services were efficient. The job taught you great customer service skills and communication skills.
good,The environment on Ross Stores it's not like any other retail stores I have ever been. Since their prices are very competitive they have a great amount of costumers and therefore they are always busy.
good,Ross offers a good pay rate.  It is a perfect job for college students or someone wanting only part-time. Working environment was great and management is good.
good,"Ross is a good retail company to work for.  The pay could be better, but they do work together as a team, they're organized when it comes to the business operations, what's expected of both the managment & employees."
good,"I loved working at Ross, everyone was so friendly. Then the manager quit, which caused the whole store to got out of order. This made it harder on us because some workers started to slack off, by not coming to work, leaving early, coming late, and taking there time. Then there was the schedule which had some of us work 7 or more days straight, causing some co- workers to call out and not show up."
good,"I liked working at Ross dress 4 less in Chino, California. My management was nice and professional at all times. I would sometimes work as a cashier. So I would ring up the customers purchases, receive payment, bag clothes, help customers with returns, or any questions they may have. I also worked in the fitting room. I would count how many clothing the customers wanted to try on with a max of 6 at a time, hang up clothes on the rack, sort clothes by departments, and put the returned clothes back on the floor in the correct department. I also answered phones and directed the calls to the correct department or person."
good,Very fast paced but the time flies! Management is awesome. They are willing to help in the work in environment and outside. Learned how to give great customer service.
good,"Stressful days while having a lack of employees. Managed to get by though. I have been through 3 managers since I have been at Ross and they do not know what is going on with the store. They come and go as they please, They need more training."
good,"The culture at Ross is unlike any I have experienced before. Every person is made to feel appreciated, everybody matters and people are incredibly warm and welcoming."
good,A lot of organizing and cleaning up. Moved to markdowns which was very easy to pick up. Double discount days were great. Able to use discount at any location.
good,Productive place to work but there are some challenges with career growth and advancement. Ross is process drive 100 percent execution ensures you meet or surpass your yearly metrics
good,"It's usually very busy, no matter what day it may be. Though you may get tired out, it helps you to create and/or improve your sense of urgency. I feel that the best, rather than better, you do, there may be a couple of incentives like pay raise or seniority privileges. I have learned that you must always stay on your toes and give great customer service to whoever comes into the store. I've always given great customer service to people. No matter how I may feel, I try my hardest not to show it and I try to be as helpful as possible because I always want for the customers to have a great shopping experience and visit the store frequently. As much as I try to be pleasant to the customers, I would definitely say that the hardest part of this job or any other job like this dealing with so many different people on a daily basis."
good,Their is never a dull moment at Ross. There are always new customers and new experiences everyday. Ross is normally busy which means you have little to no down time.
good,"Picked toys and clothes out of boxes on conveyor belt and redistribute into labeled boxes to be shipped to stores."
good,"great co workers, pay was not that great for the amount of work. Management was too strict at times. Overall, great place to work.  Lots of benefits and discounts."
good,it was a great work experience. a lot was expected from the stock team. even though we only worked about 23 to 25 hours a week. learning about the stock team was easy to catch on.
good,"Honestly I learned a lot at Ross Dress For Less as an Area Supervisor . I deal with customer complaints daily , floor moves daily , and its very fast paced witch I enjoy . It can definitely be stressful but its nothing I cant handle. I'm just ready for something bigger and better in my life."
good,I still work for Ross at the moment hardest part about working for Ross would be the customers that come in to steal that are very disrespectful. The best part is having a great team to work with and a experienced manager on duty that can handle tough situations.
good,Fitting room area is what I like most about Ross.Stock room is. more challenging place steady pace and you are being timed.overall a great place to work
good,"Great benefits , great pay. A team environment with room for advancement. A stable and very profitable company. Lots of growth opportunities in this area."
good,"Ross is a retail place that works with your life schedule, so that you can balance the rest of what you have going on. Coworkers are easy to get along with and all work very hard."
good,I can learn new things and grow with the company and the staff members. A place where teamwork and communication skills play a major key in a company.
good,I enjoy working for corporations who respect and value the HUMAN SPIRIT! Having lateral lucrative upward mobility enhances the retention rate of phenomenal employees while strengthening weakness of ALL employees.
good,"fast pace"
good,typical day in stock team shows up at 7am and ends around noon. its early but the staff there are awake and excited for the day. its very competitive since there is so much product that needs to go out in such a short period of time. they enjoy seeing people take initiative and are very willing to let you step up if you want to advance in a career. in a little less than a year I was titled the stock team lead because of my initiative and it was very well recognized. If you are looking for a job where people can recognize your hard work this is a good place to work. The hours are great for part time if you have a kid to worry about or school or other jobs as well.
good,"Fun place to work, but be prepared to get yelled at by customers who want everything for free. I hate that my GM at the time would give extremely rude customers who are in the wrong gift cards. But overall fun and fast paced"
good,"Great as a part time job. Wonderful work environment. Employee discount was very helpful. Management was great and very understanding. Overall, a nice place to work."
good,"It was nice place to work. It did get a little hard after there were new managements involved because people wanted different things. The place was fun to work at because there were people to interact with. The customers were nice at times, but then there are some that are just not nice. It’s a massive con because they blame you for things that are not under our control. It’s hard to let things go, but you mange to let go after working in customer service."
good,Ross is a very good environment to work in love to be around the crowd of people that comes in daily to shop only thing i hate is theres no full time positions there you only get about 20 to 25 hours a week iys probably. A good placw for collage students or if you have a 9 to 5 job and just want extra money otjer than that no complaints.
good,Ross is a good job I have been working here going on four years now and its great with my schedule of going to school. I love my coworkers and feel that everyone is really friendly.
good,This was a great job. Fun environment and nice staff. Great company though management could be overbearing. Great for young adults or part time workers.
good,"this place is not that bad, relaxed atmosphere, just another retail job. not much of a challenge to employee, no excitement...................................."
good,"Recover the floor in all departments"
good,"Great place to work but no benefit ."
good,"come in, do your assignment, help guests, busy holidays"
good,"I worked part time at Ross for almost a year, and I can say that management was great when it came to respecting and understanding their employees. They were willing to work around my school schedule."
good,"Work day is about 10 hours of training, recruiting and managing a sales staff of over 50 people, We try to provide a high level of customer service and create a fun and well merchandised shopping experience."
good,You are timed on how long each translation takes you. You do not always get the best training. Customers get angry and lose patience with you fast. Sometimes get free candy to make us happy associates.
good,Working with customers on all levels going the extra mile to help the customer find the items that was out of stock by checking the stock room and all other area's that could maybe find.
good,"overall management could've have been better but I have seen worse so I will give them a pass. the job was easy and the customers weren't too bad. you had some drama between coworkers but it never got out of control. if you need job security and can handle unruly customers every blue moon its not too bad, just wish the pay was better"
good,"I had a good experience. I got really close to my coworkers. The hours were flexible. My managers were the best. Ross gave me a good, honest job when I was in a desperate situation. I loved Ross."
good,"I haven't work there in years but theyre were nice,helpful, always got hours would get called into work on my days off. just go give it a shot........"
good,ROSS is a great place to work. Fun and friendly associates with great customer service abilities. Management could have been better with keeping the associates informed of new changes. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with new changes without being notified of them. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the other associates.
good,fun store job that you can grow your customer service skills and nice part time job that pays well and allows you to have a life and go to school. plus its fun
good,"few hours, moderate pay, moderate-fast paced environment depending on position. flexible hours. Lots of opportunity for advancement within the company."
good,A very friendly environment. Great employees all customer needs right and met shopping is the best thing u can be excited about .a family member can enjoy
good,great place to work friendly co workers and management (they may have changed) i worked in the stockroom if your not a people person this is the position for you (your mostly in the back room)
good,"I enjoyed the stock position best, it was fast-paced and everyone was there to work hard. Great team work and friendly environment. The managers made sure you improved and were quick to help. The part of the job that seemed pointless to me was memorizing the store percentages and numbers that I had to remember and recite when the store was checked."
good,"The company is decent itself, but every store is different and has different methods of doing things. I have worked at 3 different Ross's and they all operate differently. There are good times and bad times to every job."
good,"Ross is a great good company to work for, the pay is not the best. but can be a good job for students. you learn how to deal with money, costumers, and you get employee discounts."
good,"Quick paced working environment, definitely not for the slow paced. There is always something to do! If you like to work, and constantly like to be on the move then this place is for you"
good,The coworkers take a big part in being able to enjoy being at work and giving it your 110% to develope a great team. Although it is a busy store every associate is willing to give a helping hand on any need.
good,Ross was an amazing company to work for before they changed all the major bosses and decided that policy for customers didnt matter they just wanted them happy and thats what they got...  ross will let EVERYONE return items even when they are used or stolen
good,Good place to work but the pay is low for the work be done.  Has great first shift hours if you prefer first shift.  Breaks are short and you can't leave while on break.
good,"working at Ross was a great experience. was able to develop my social skills, and better my verbal communication, in addition is a great place to work while going to school."
good,"Productive, there is always something to be done. the most enjoyable part of my job is working along my coworkers to accomplish our daily goals. the hardest part is being short handed and trying to keep up with all our tasks on a busy day."
good,typical retail life . varied shifts both days and nights required.this stupid sight forces you to write a review on all companies..and i think it sucks than ks indeed
good,A really great place to work it's got a really fun and it exciting atmosphere.  When you see kids come into the store and they find the toy they've been looking for and they have that huge smile on their face and they're just super excited to take it home and play with it it's whay gives you joy of working for Toys R Us.
good,"This job a good place to work for as a student or a parent of little ones.If you are looking for a full time job, this one isn't for you unless applying for a supervisor position. But other than that it was fun to work there."
good,I enjoyed my time at Ross. Productive and fun workplace with a ping pong table.  Able to rack up a bunch of hours.  Enjoyed my fellow cowerkers.
good,To stand for hours at a time and greet customers as well as prevent theft by watching customers and walking around the store to check the store.
good,"I provide great customer service by greeting every customer with a smile, and providing them with a fast friendly checkout. Manage and schedule employee breaks for the work day. Meeting new people everyday make this job exciting and fun. Dealing with difficult customers is  the toughest part of the job, but I still manage to provide great customer service throughout each experience."
good,"Productive, great environment,  very busy, everyone worked  well together, I helped front end customer service when lines were out of control however we had too many different managers"
good,Loved working at Ross. I always had fun doing my job and most of my coworkers were great. Kinda miss working there but I got a better job opportunity. Would definitely work at Ross again.
good,OK well this place has a lot of ladies who think they run this place. They tread the new worker's like bad think they Owen the place try to get you fired if they see your a threat they will find ways for you to get written up or make your job miserable that was what happed to me. Nothing else. To say
good,It was fun to work their. Just hard to get parking and carpooling is best. Also wish they had a full break room in the back to not just the front. Also they shouldn't demand a 80 percent every day from new recruits after 3 weeks when their Ross employees get 60 to 70 percent and still hold a job their
good,A good Place to start out or a part time for alittle bit extra cash. Also you get a discount on merchandise. Very fast pace environment always have something to do
good,Overall this experience was a good one. I enjoyed the associates I had and the customers were really nice as well. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with.
good,"If you work hard and like the company, most likely you will be promoted. For full timers there are extra benefits like healt care, 401k ect. Associates are friendly and easy to work with. Management is also very supportive."
good,"Great first work experience in retail."
good,This by far had to be the best company I have ever worked for. No words can express how much fun and the love I felt working for this company. The environment is just calm and so cheerful. I loved every shift I  worked. The workers and the customers made the day so enjoyable.
good,"Love working here! The managers are easy to talk to and are really flexible with schedules. "
good,The hardest part about the is being scared of heights. Its good people to work with. I learned a lot there I like how to meet production.
good,"A typical day at work with the right manager can be easy and manageable yet when we are low staffed or some of the employees do not have professionalism the work place can seem chaotic and overwhelming. The hardest part about the job would be an understaffed weekend with employees who were not professional, but the most enjoyable part about the job was that the managers were very kind and always worked with me and my hours and to make my time there as enjoyable as possible."
good,"a learning experience."
good,"Ross is a good place to work, including benefits even if you  are part time and you are guaranteed hours if you actually show that you deserve hours, as in come to work and do your job, if you do the opposite you wont have hours simple. Some co-workers are worth working with and some aren't."
good,"Ross is a very fast pace moving store. You learn new places everyday and they are very flexible and work with you on things. Ross is pretty well rounded when it comes to management if there is low points about one manager there is another one to help pick up the pieces! I haven't even met half the people that work at my store, but so far everyone is really friendly and I enjoy working with everyone!"
good,Coworkers are great. Typical workday involves Managing the day-to-day operations of the store. while at Ross i learned what it takes to succeed in the retail environment.
good,I have been working for Ross for the past year and they are a really good company to work for. Great benefits. Good pay. Good people. The work may be a bit overwhelming at times but it does get better after a couple of weeks experience.
good,"I am able to be busy at all times which I like. Non stop."
good,"Check in , log in complete paper work , survey work area , patrol and inspect assigned areas. Basic CCTV knowledge , management was excellent. Co - workers were very professional . Hardest part of the job was paroling the perimeter a 2 mile walk every hour. Working the guard shack , and communicating to employees."
good,"I loved the people I worked with here. I did not like that I was always stuck in stock no matter how many times I said I wanted to cross train. Also, just because there is a ""schedule"" you had better be prepared to stay long past your off time in stock."
good,I actually loved working here. Easy work was able to request off in advance. Loved the schedule. I woud have stayed if they gave me a full time position.
good,"The Co-Workers are great and the Management are really outgoing people as well. Management never gives you an attitude to get there point across and try to be as nice as possible. The Co-Workers plan a little party if it's your birthday. The hardest part of the job is unloading the heavy boxes, but that's only if you work in the stockroom."
good,"over all my experience at ross was a good one. the customers were great. the staff was helpful and amazing. I learned to have more patients. management was good some managers were better at talking to the employers than others. he hardest part of the job was that you had two to three different mangers at a time, who all wanted you to do things differently."
good,"If you plan on sticking with the company, it takes a few years, or if you're lucky by someone stepping down, a few months for one to get a position as a supervisor or manager. Low pay considering all you do."
good,"It was a very good and respectable job to be at, but can get challenging at times. There are people willing to help you, but everything must be done under pressure and rapidly."
good,"typical work day for me is clocking in, start putting back returns then ask my supervisors what else needs to be done, I learn how to interact with management, co-workers and customers. Management was great."
good,"You'll meet some coworkers that you like and others that you don't. It's a good job for those just beginning to work in retail, because there is a lot to be learned from the company. If only they paid more..."
good,"A typical day at work consist of about 4-5 hours. I learned how to move around in different areas of the job daily. I learned how to have great Customer Service, Cashier Position, Sale Floor, Fitting room, and Stock. Co Worker are very helpful, friendly and have good work ethics."
good,work was at a reasonable easy going pace. management was very quick to answer any questions or help with problems encountered in the workplace
good,"My Experience at Ross was very like assisting the customers with any questions or help, having my team members there for any help i needed or if they needed help im willing to do so, ive learn alot about sizing clothes cash handling, becoming a store protection specialist, i was very cool with management if i had a problem with anybody management come up with different solutions on trying to solve the problem, i love my co workers helpful fun but also we  know how to keep it professional, there wasnt no hardest part the most enjoyable part is satisfying the customers"
good,"Ross is a good company to work for. the management could use improvement with communication. I learned to handle more paper ,"
good,Maintaining a safe environment for customers and employees by decreasing the number of theft occurrences during operating hours.
good,Good work experience. Too much work for so less of a pay. I would recommend working in a city that has high minimum wage. The work isn't hard but t is tiring at the end of the day.
good,We had a centrally located store that had constant traffic. The hours are variable and change weekly. You will have to work most weekends. Pay could be better. Customers are bargain hunters and are always looking to cut prices even more.
good,A lot is asked from a Ross employee. You have the ability to become a well rounded worker but the management could be improved.
good,Good place to work. Nice and friendly work environment. Good co workers relationships. Nice management staff. Long standing hours.Overall nice place to work.
good,"Provides elite customer service to the fashion industry in local areas at a reasonable price. The experience as a customer representative is ideally the position to obtain in order to gain experience, at a slow and fast pace environment. Advancement opportunities are not abundant, although the management team will train you in order to be advanced in the future within or own your own. I enjoy working for this company in this season of my life."
good,It was nice to be able to have a uniform but to be able to wear what you want at the same time. Some Managers were better than others but we were always being surpervised and helped by them.
good,"The job is not very hard at all compared to others I have had. Every day we un-box, prepare and bring new merchandise to the sales floor. There is little interaction with customers in the stock room which for a retail job can be nice. Management can be very disorganized and have even changed the shifts of employees the night before their next shift, which can be very frustrating. The job can be physically taxing at times, but no more than expected for a stocking position. The best part of the job is getting to see all the new merchandise before it reaches the sales floor. In a store where merchandise varies daily, it can be interesting."
good,"I enjoy working at Ross, majority of the time. The main reason I enjoy it is credited to my co-workers. The reason why I do not enjoy it is the lazy store manager. I feel that her could be a lot more involved in what actually goes on in the store. He spends majority of his time back in the office, and does not give his struggling employees a helping hand. We basically have to fend for ourselves."
good,Management team is very supportive and helpful as well as highly organized. Work day is very fast-paced which may make the day a bit stressful but everyone works as a team to get the job done.
good,"It was my first time opening a retail store, from the beginning the management team was great they offered me great positions, giving me the opportunity to do administration in the cash office. I had that position until I left the company four years later.  Got to work with many co-workers and between all of us took great care of our store and customers."
good,"A typical day at Ross mainly requires working at a constant fast pace.   Working there has taught me how to work together as a team and an individual and how to provide great customer service at all times. The hardest part has to be learning how to do multiple things at once and learning how to manage your time wisely but with a great team of associates, the help of management, and being in a positive environment, the workplace becomes so much more enjoyable."
good,"I loved the management and working in the stock rooms, very little stress and stocking shelves were beyond easy. One problem i encountered were the employees themselves, most were very well mannered while a few thought they were the gods of Ross spreading rumours and cursing people out who they thought weren't doing things properly. management was great except when problems arose they seemed to tuck tail and let things go too often, when problems should have been taken care of. "
good,"I enjoyed the people. I cooked, cleaned, and grocery shopped. I had quite a bit of free time. I took care of their personal hygiene. I took the dog and the lady of the house out for a walk whenever possible. The lady of the house and I would sit outside and watch traffic whenever possible."
good,The roll of Area supervisor here is very fast paced. This is a fun place to work but can be very busy during the Holiday's. Area Supervisors open and close the store and manage a staff of up to fifteen employees per day.
good,"I use to be just a retail associate and i moved up to being a front end supervisor, this company is amazing to work for. They will try their best to let you know what you are best at and what you need to improve on in order for you to move up with the company (if that is what you want)."
good,Not every many opportunities for advancement with in the company. Part time employees are not treated fairly. On the other hand it is a safe work environment with great people to work with and associate appreciation days and events make up for the cons.
good,It is a good work place. good environment to work with. You meet some great people. and hours are good. takes a while to gt a raise.
good,"the work is hard, as in any retail business, but their policies and advancement opportunities are employee friendly. I really enjoyed working there."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced environment. There was never a dull moment. I learned to oversee the cashiers and coach them. I enjoyed my co-workers and teaching them. Hardest part of the job was coaching in a positive way so not to discourage my coworker. I was able to learn to understand personalities in order to approach each individual in a way that would be positive for them.
good,"We start at 5:30 am Monday through Friday, I am reasonable for breaking down truck into section to distribute through the store. Stock all shelves also hag all apparel onto apparel racks. Then put onto floor."
good,Overall excellent management and very organized store. The pay is good and there is always something to do. The associates are friendly and store manager is very nice.
good,"The job was great but the management team had a bad habit of changing our schedules without letting us know and communication was not the best."
good,"A typical day at work is busy, you must be able to juggle a million things at once or learn how to delegate to get the job done.  Very quick paced environment.  All coworkers are friendly and the environment is mostly positive."
good,"A typical work day at Ross includes assisting plenty of customers. Everyone loves to shop there because of the great prices. This is the most of my conversation with customers. Working at Ross for me has been an interesting introduction into the world of retail. However, I do enjoy being a part of a team that pulls together, support one another, compliment one another and at the end of the night get it done together. The most difficult part of the job I would say is not being able to accommodate a customer who may be looking for a particular item. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you know you have met a customer needs and they commend you."
good,"At Ross I learned plenty of patience, how to speak to all different types of customer whether they were satisfied or unsatisfied with their visit. I was able to use my bilingual skills to communicate and help managers communicate with Spanish speaking customers. Management was helpful when needed but they would also spend a lot of their time in the break room talking about their personal lives and would never take the blame for anything even when at fault. The hardest part of this job was closing at such a late time not getting out until 2 a.m. and management not taking into consideration my class schedule at my college. The most enjoyable part has always been my extremely fun and friendly co-workers and the customers always helping us stay positive."
good,i learned alot at all the companys i have workeduuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
good,"Working up front, your main concern is speedy checkout. While this is an efficient objective to pursue, it rarely was the case. the line of customers would usually stretch over 20 people with only one cashier. With a faulty intercom, I was often not heard until a coworker would look over and hear me shout."
good,"fun workplace to work, you learn everyday, unfortunately just a few hours per week to work. just a very few people can get a fulltime possition"
good,My first job it helped me with my problem solving skills help develop my communication skill as well. Gave me a sense of balance and work improvement skills.
good,Here I honed my skills working on the cash register and the people there were really willing to work with me when I had o return to school.
good,"For the most part, a typical day at work for me would consist of"
good,"Working at Ross was fun! There is no job security, and pay is minimum, but the environment is FUN! Not a bad place for beginners."
good,"loved the job, it was a lot of fun love the company and the discount and my mom worked there to which made working there even better"
good,"I worked in markdowns, the fitting room, and as a cashier. In markdowns, I scan items in each department for price changes and inventory. I also get called to help in register, fitting room, or stock room when help is needed. In the fitting room, I count the items on a t stand in and out of the fitting room. I then organized the items that the customers don't want on a rack. I also make sure the fitting rooms are clean of hangers, price tags, hard tags, and trash. I also make sure the bathroom is nice and orderly for customers. As a cashier, I process all items by removing hangers, removing the hard tags, scanning the items, and lastly bagging the items. Throughout the day, I do go backs, sizing, and making sure the assigned department is clean and in order."
good,"When I started I was trained by computer but that was just how to treat customers. My managers didn't train me or put me through really any training. I quickly picked up on how everything works and started training people that still don't know what they're doing and just flat out new people that have had no help. A typical day is a busy day full of stocking and pleasing the flood of people coming in. I do enjoy the people there, they're all very nice just not too helpful. It is busy so it's understandable. The hardest part is dealing with customers that don't understand that we don't have anymore of the item that's on the floor!"
good,"A typical day at work would include writing or looking at what I would be doing for the week. Then I would start my first assignment then do any major projects that need to get done. I would run merchandise that was in the stockroom. For the rest of my shift I would be recovering the floor making sure it is clean and easy to shop. "
good,"Good place to start working in retail."
good,"A typical day at Ross consists of providing great customer service, working hard to keep the store recovered at all times, and delivering a great experience to customers."
good,I was in college so I didnt geet hours but you may get frustated having 30 minutes to clean up store be fore closing and seeing the things you find in the dressing rooms
good,"Ross is a fortune 500 company that is continually growing and changing.  being California based they follow rules that are beyond the federal government's requirements.  They offer benefits to domestic partners which I feel is wonderful and they attempt to maintain a life balance, but they sometimes push to hard"
good,"I was the front supervisor and cashier. I learned how to handle a cashier, returns, tag clothes and merchandise, organize store sections by color, idem, size and price. I got along great with my co-workers they were a lot of help when i first started and i caught on quickly with there help, there were great vibes between us all. In all the job would get difficult when super busy and not enough employees but we would get the job done no stress and in a quickly manor. i think the most enjoyable part of the job was having such great co-workers because what is going to work without getting along great with the people you are going to work with. They made the job fun and we always had great costumers."
good,It was a good start.learned alot here.Everyone seems to enjoy it here and has the right balance between fun and productivity.
good,Very busy and fun place to work. Holidays were always busy from the start of my shift to the end of it. Co workers were great to work with along with the management. The hardest part of the job was trying to clean and put everything back into place at the end of my shift.
good,"I worked as a cashier, you would help customers, and the assistant manager would give you a section in the store to clean. Management was good, they worked with your schedule. The enjoyable part of the job is they let you be responsible for yourself."
good,"I really like Ross because there is always something to do. You are constantly busy, which makes the shift go by rapidly. I am either getting product off of the hard lines and onto the floor, or I am ringing up customers on the sales floor. Either way, I am productive and busy.I have worked in Sales for  a while, and it is a different type of retail store than most, so it has been a positive experience to about working in a store where products sell themselves. Management is good. They are good with their communication skills and very understanding. I get a long with all of my co-workers, as I usually do everywhere. The hardest part is probably sometimes there is too much stuff to put on the hummers and put on the floor and we have to get it done in a timely manner. The best part of the job is probably the fact that it's a fast pace job without an excessive amount of stress."
good,Wonderful environment just low pay! Starting at minimum wage 8 years ago seemed so low. Chances to work up in the company.
good,"-Typical Day at Work Was Okay, Since They Get Merchandise From a Warehouse, It Is a Challenge Putting Items Where They Need To Go."
good,"Fast paced working with customers. Checking clothing for hardtags, all security tags. I learned what to look for in the clothing and how to display the merchandise. All co-workers were easy to get along with."
good,"Lots of actions on this job which I enjoyed . It made me learned so much in a short period of time.  I applied for this job because its a seasonal job.  Management assigned 90% of my time as a cashier due to my quick learning, adaptability, and customer relation experience.  Some co -workers are not into team player but I am able to deal with it by continue doing my job and still assisting them as needed resulted in great relationship with them.  Love the organizing part where I get some free time to check our merchandise on display, get to re-fills, organized, removed damaged goods, and make our products looked great and inviting while on display. It was awesome because, they offered me a permanent position after the hiring season was over."
good,there is alot of expectations for too little.but overall i did enjoy working there until new higher personal came in
good,A typical day of work at Ross is usually very diversified and you will accomplish 10-15 different assignments. The most enjoyable part of my job is providing an excellent customer service experience as well as an exciting treasure hunt shopping experience for our customers. The hardest part of my job is the recovery of the store at the end of the business day. The store is always a mess and impossible to maintain cleanliness and organization because of this you are always working at 100 mph all day. Great place to work if you're beginning a career.
good,"Ross is a very fast pace and busy place to work at, but each store varies. Good attendance, punctuality, and appearance are key especially for advancement in the company as well as excellent people skills. Being a team player is essential and also multi-tasking. Co-workers are very friendly, positive, and knowledgeable about Ross policies and procedures. Being in retail can be demanding but you learn how to pace yourself and try to have good time management skills, but the most rewarding thing about working at Ross is seeing customers leave happy and satisfied with the merchandise as well as the awesome customer service"
good,"A typical day working at Ross was busy, but it was a low volume store. I enjoyed organizing the merchandise and getting to see different things that we don't always carry, but what I didn't like the most was having to put clothes on hangers half the day. Standing in one place for a long period of time is not something I enjoy. I learned how to calculate a stores daily income for sales and how to process a certain amount of funds for the bank to pick up."
good,"I loved working for Ross. They offer so many different products and always have the lowest prices. The only things I diskiked were the changes they were making to the associate/customer interaction. I like to make customers feel welcomed and want to come back. Ross was starting to gear more towards the ""self service"""
good,"When I began working there, it was my first job. Everyone was very helpful and always answered my questions. I loved my co-workers and the management was very understanding and appreciative. The atmosphere there is unlike any other clothing store but you adapt. I enjoy meeting new people so that was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was probably working the freight and getting it put out on the floor."
good,"A typical day at work was rather stressful, yet really relaxing at times. I learned how to associate with customers and mostly retail experiences such as cashier, go backs, hanging clothes back up, and cleaning the store before closing. My co-workers were hard-workers and the management was great at what they did. The hardest part about the job was the hours, considering i had school the next morning and we got out at 1 am sometimes. The best part about my job was associating with customers and giving them the proper customer service they needed."
good,"I love working at Ross however, I'm looking for a different job experience. As much as I love my coworkers, I really want to work more professional environment."
good,A typical day at work is very busy. Ive learned how to interact with customers on more of an easier level since my previous job was a bit more personal. Managers are really helpful. Co-workers are nice and everyone helps eachother. The hardest part is keeping the store clean. The most enjoyable part is being rewarded for doing good during the month with bonuses and pizza parties
good,"Work long hours, with nice people, and great customers"
good,Work is fun and complicated all at the same time. We have great  customers that come in and are friendly and then we have complicated customers. As customer service we handle both kinds and keep a friendly smile on our faces. My coworkers and I work together to keep the front end clean and i think that would be the part that is the hardest because we have a counter behind us and wish we could dump everything on it. The most enjoyable part of this job is when we all work together in the front end and have a fun time with it.
good,"Fast-paced work environment where I learned to work with a team to provide great customer service. I worked as cashier, trainer, sales floor recovery team member, fitting room associate, and markdown team member."
good,I love working with people. I learned how to use a cash register.
good,"It is a great company, I just wish I could get more hours. However, the people and company is very employee conscious and I appreciate that."
good,Ross is a good place to work. The associates are friendly and management works with you to help balance work and family life. Opportunities for advancement exist if you are interested in business.
good,"The company as a whole was great. It was a good environment to work in. You can move up the ladder really fast. However, there is no fix working time."
good,Great management team and co-workers. Typical day at work was a lot of customer service. Hardest part of the job was doing the time managing to finish the job but i learned to manage that.
good,"I loved working at Ross! Everything I learned was new to me, as I never worked in a Retail environment before."
good,"A typical work day at Ross never ends without some kind of shocking ""oh my goodness, I can't believe that just happened"" event. There are many ups and downs that come with the job. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep the store clean while you're crazy busy. The best part is seeing how much you've helped your customers. Whether they are there for clothes or odd and end things. Ross is like a big treasure hunt and someone always left with a smile on their faces because they were excited about the treasures that they just found. The co-workers are absolutely awesome. Everyone knew that for the job to be done everyone needed to work as a team to complete it the right way. As far as management there were good days and bad days. More bad than good, but we all still enjoyed our work environment."
good,"Provided customer service, kept work area clean and organized, solving customers complaints. Work environment in general was fun it allowed me to meet new people , and help others."
good,I work early morning before the store opens so I don't not really get to see how customers acts or responds to the crew members behaviors but as I see for the two hours that i am there cleaning I think it's a friendly place to work. however on a daily base of cleaning I do not find the store to be as dirty.
good,"There is never a dull moment at Ross in West Hollywood. If you like to keep busy and multitask in a fast paced and fun environment this is a good place for you. There is a lot of room for growth in the company if you are willing to put in a lot of hard work. I learned important qualities necessary to be a leader such as persistence, integrity, and always leading by example."
good,"Everyone was friendly and inviting, jobs were done as they should have been,"
good,I work very closely with a very talented architect. He is easy going and organized. I have learned a great deal of this field during this tenure.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,I truly enjoyed my experince with Ross they are like family to me.
good,"fun enviroment great staff,i learned merchandizing computer input the ins outs of ross management where understanding and capable of taking care of associates needs my co workers where great the hardest part of my job was the late hours during christmas and coming right back a few hours later to open the most enjoyable part was inetracting with the customers"
good,managers are great and the atmosphere is amazing. I would recommend working here to anyone if ever asked. great sales with low prices
good,A typical day at work is processing freight and get them out on time for the customers. Helping the customers find whatever they needed.
good,"4 hours periods of standing with a 20 min break between "
good,"Great management, Great learning experience, could use reliable employees. Great for beginners not likely to advance or pay raise. Lots of fun and exposure to all kinds of people, culture, and learning lessons. Great discount."
good,"I would start my shift at 6:30 and clock out when all the work was done. Sometimes they would send me home mid-week because id completed my 40 hrs. They were not very good with lunch breaks. Great co-workers. Great managers for the most part. Fast-paced work, never gets boring. This job enhanced my skills in customer service and cashier. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the stores cleanliness on busy days such as weekends and major holidays."
good,"Worked the cashier, checked people out, worked the fitting room. Management was okay, liked most of my co-workers, got along with all of them. The hours weren't always the greatest."
good,Working for Ross is great. It is a great opportunity but with so many employees working there we are not given enough hours throughout the weeks.
good,"greet customers, over see employees, constaint communication with managers on stores over all findings through out shift"
good,"I have been at this job for almost two years, and I personally am proud to work at this location(store1255).  I enjoy the people I work with, and I can talk to management about any concerns I might have."
good,"I enjoy working with all coworkers, I like working at any place they put me like the fitting room, cashier etc.. The best part of the job for me is seeing the customers happy and see that they are enjoying there time in the store, gotta keep the customer happy."
good,I would always work the back so I had a set schedule pretty much every week. I was not going to school at the time due to the fact it was summer time and I was back at home in Acworth. The management at my store was really great. I enjoyed working for my store manager and he would always treat every employee very nicely. My co-workers were nice but sometimes the conversations at the store got inappropriate for the workplace. I learned the value of hard work and the ability to work an 8 hour day for 4 days a week. The hardest part of my job had to be dealing with rude customers. I was able to keep cool though and never get into a confrontation with one. 
good,"I have been working for Ross almost 4 years now, and I have yet to see it not be busy from morning to night it stays busy. There is always something that could be done, if it’s ringing on the register or doing your daily assignments, running go back racks, recovery on the floor in sometimes all the departments. It can definitely be an eye opener to how messy some people can be. I think that would be the hardest part of the job the constant cleaning, and picking up merchandise off the floor. The most enjoyable part of the people is when you do meet the nice customers, that you conversate with, and get to know within those couple minutes your providing them with service, also the connection and friendships you build with the co-workers to me its almost like a family in some ways. Working at Ross, I have learned that working at any retail store you have to work as a team and be a team player to accomplish the kind of success you want your store to have.  "
good,"I come in usually during the day sometimes early mornings, but i learned a lot about the store pretty fast. Management is very unorganized there's always at least two supervisors but they are always very questionable to as how they became in that position because there lack of skills. not the best co-workers, some are indeed friendly but most of them will not say a single thing to you for a long time maybe never. The hardest part was trying to become a supervisor or management, they had the worst managers and I could not go anywhere no matter how hard I worked. "
good,its a great place to work if you like working in apparel and doing base line customer service
good,Company is great they work with your schedules. Light labor with unloading trucks.
good,"A typical day starts with walking the store and identifying areas that did not get recovered and divising a plan to get the store customer ready, retrieve the previous days sales numbers and also the current days projected sales. Conduct the morning's rally meeting on any new communications from corporate or any store related business for example ( sales for previous day, safety issues,recovery, merchandising issues, new shop set ups , and loss prevention measures).I learned as being a Asst manager of operatons for a 13 million dollar store that communication between all of management is vital . The store manager drives a team oriented culture to improve productivity and helps promote a strong sense of belonging.My co- workers have many years of management experience with different views and opinions creating an endless amount of solutions to any situation. There are many challenges i come across working here but they are not difficult. Every obstacle i come across can be resolved with patience and creative thinking. The most enjoyable part of this job is the associates sense of family, they make you feel like your part of their families. I feel a sense of accomplishment when i go home after a hard days work."
good,"Ross overall is a good place to work, although I've heard from long-term it doesn't really pay off. That's disappointing to hear. Although Ross is pretty understanding in most area's and that's one of the best things about them and trying to keep everything orderly. I like working at Ross."
good,it was sometimes overweiling
good,"As a sales associate at Ross Dress For Less, I operated cash register, greeted customers, returned ideas and marked them down, answered phones and transferred them to the person whom they needed to talk to. I also ran cash office will up front which is if coworkers needed change i would provide that to them. I learned how to get things done in a timely manner. I loved my Co workers, they were the funnest people to work with."
good,"Ross is constant work, either from ringing up customers or doing another important task for the compnay, maintaining a presentable store to esure that we do have customers to serve."
good,Great place to work. Company prides itself on creating a positive working environment.
good,Most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people also clearing my line! Making myself feel like i was working very well.
good,Supervise my team and take charge of certain situations. I would provide customer service and handle returns. I would count my employees tills at the end of the night.
good,i enjoyed working there. coworkers are friendly and when i needed help with something they gladly helped.
good,"I belive that Ross is a great place to work i love my job its laid back i,feel comfortable and secure and i look to stay for as long as it last."
good,It's a constant flow of work. I'm always doing something different and stay busy. It's a great environment. I've been there for over 5 years and I've learned alot in that amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is having friendly co-workers and management to communicate with.
good,You work hard for a little bit of money to be doing so much. The pay sucks.
good,I come into work and sign in with with my associate number and password.
good,cashier handling skills were required at ross and a energetic personality to come along with it. Greating and assisting customers was our goal at the end of the day
good,At Ross i have gained great customer service skills. Postive attitudes are throughtout the store from management down. The best part is being able to put a smile on each customer face with assisting them with any concerns or questions they may have.
good,"I loved working at Ross, however I was moving away to school so I had to leave. Plus, with my heart condition, I couldn't endure long shifts where I stood the whole time. I did love it, though there wasn't much room for advancement."
good,great hours for the most part. easy job duties. management needs to be a little more organized. co-workers were great from young to old and all ethnicities. great benefits.
good,"Dealing with customers on regular basis,sales,inventory,stock,cashier duties,enjoyed meeting new people and being of assistance"
good,It was a fun work environment but It was very hard to keep clean. Everyone was enjoyable to work around and associates were treated fairly as well as with respect.
good,I loved the people I worked with but the head boss always gave me a hard time. Now that they have changed the management everything is alot smoother. I wouldnt mind working for them now
good,"This is not a bad place to work if you're already established, but if you're an individual contributor you're going to have a hard time climbing into management."
good,"This is not a hard company to work for - however, be prepared to have all your work criticized and micromanaged. Everything at Ross has to be EFFICIENT. The pay is minimum wage but there are benefits for even part timers. There are supervisors there who don't really deserve their job, but everyone in management is nice and good at what they do. Don't know what job security is like yet...there seems to be plenty, that's what they tell you, others don't seem to think so. We shall see."
good,They were flexible with my hours and willing to work with my school schedule. I would work for them again.
good,I enjoyed working at Ross. It was a great management team at the time I was employed their. And they work with my schedule and availability.Very friendly atmosphere.
good,A great place to work if you like to shop. The Company is alright to work for and they will usually work with your schedual.
good,I was able to gain some experience while making an extra buck. I call that a win-win. The best part about working at Ross was meeting all of those people and the bad part was the rude customers.
good,Working with Ross was a good experience. Management was very good and friendly. It requires hardworking employees. Enjoyed mostly at the cashier and the hardest area was the shoes one for me
good,"This was the first serious job I had while I was in college. I had a great experience - both with my coworkers and my responsibilities overall. It was a friendly environment and one I loved working in, up until I quit to move away with my husband."
good,Relaxed and easy place to work. Cash handling and great customer service is required to work there. Customers are kinda rude sometimes and the job is a face paced job. Great workplace.
good,I love the discounts I receive as an employee. The work environment I'm in is great I have friendly associates that motivate me and push me to do better in every aspect I learn.
good,"Ross dress for less was a great place to work for students as they offer scholarships and they work with your school schedule. To work at ross as a career, you'd have to look into what they offer for advancement. Working at the store, your choices are limited."
good,Typical day at work was tending to various store/associate needs. I learned about time management and hard work. I enjoyed working with my associates and studying/creating store reports.
good,"Mostly fun place to work, high energy and fast output required. Can be a friendly environment so long as you fit in and don't be a problem. That's never been a problem for me. The biggest drawback is for someone like me who has a LOT of experience which equates to being capable of having a LOT TO OFFER, but don't get properly paid for it."
good,You get there at 5:00 AM and unload the truck as fast as you can and then put the stuff out and it usually takes about 4-5 hours to do. It was an alright job.
good,They have great benefits. You are given opportunities to grow within the company. They offer good and very helpful trainings. Fast speed and awesome customer service.
good,"It's a nice place to work, very flexible with hours and the staff is really kind, everyone is close together. But expect to work late nights if you're night shift."
good,It’s a great opportunity for a part time and extra income especially the employe discounts. That alone makes it worth it. I’ve been fortunate to have pretty amazing managers that really help and promote team work.
good,My experience working at Ross was sure a ride! There is many things to learn there and you get to meet people from different places. Ross it’s an excellent place to work .
good,"Agradable, honesto, equitativo y mucho apoyo laboral."
good,Was a great environment to work. Had Great opportunities to excel. To the highest you wanted to go. Great benefits. Everything was a great experience.
good,Overall Ross was enjoyable to work at but the assistant manager at the time was very rude and they did not give me many hours. I would return to work the next day to see that the environment was still negative until the assistant manager had left for the day.
good,"I worked here as my first job, and most of the associates (at least at my store) are super friendly, easy to work with, fun to joke around with and seem to care about each other. The store manager is great, always asks his associates how they're doing and how Ross is treating them. I was hired based off of personality and the manager saw potential for growth. I started off as a regular associate, worked all of the different positions around the store, and finally ended up becoming Loss Prevention. It's fun but can be kinda scary at times, depending on the thieves, although theft wasn't too bad at my store. Communication between managers isn't always the best or consistent, and one of the managers can be kind of snooty/rude, but all of the other managers are great to work with. Hours aren't always consistent, you can get 25 hours one week and 12 the next. It's pretty easy to pick up shifts though. It's not a perfect job but I definitely recommend working there. Although not all Ross stores are as nice as mine was so check out your Ross before applying."
good,"it can be a good company if you are a workaholic and like to bust your butt. that's me so I miss it at times."
good,It was a good company but I had short time here and had to relocate due to being pregnant . They work with you and have flexible hours for you to work
good,Not a lot of room for advancement but it is a good place to work. My co workers are friendly and we have a great working relationship. I wish the benefits they offered were better.
good,"Every day the customers will trash the store, but the people I worked with are top-notch and worked without a complaint. The management left a lot to be desired, but not to worry they are gone and you will have fun and frustration working there."
good,"Moderate warehouse/retail experience. Its more on the retail side, but a great entry-level warehouse role for anyone interested in getting a taste of the industry. Unloading the trucks in the morning can be hectic and extremely face paced, you open and tear down boxes while you sort through and organize the contents inside which can be a mix of all sorts of items from household, to toys, to furniture and decor. Clothes are a different area and a bit more tedious with hangers and usually have a crew with an expertise in that department. That being said, the management is keen on rotating associates in different areas to develop skills and progress."
good,"it was my first job, training is fun and job is easy if management and team are actually working hand in hand, they have some fun fundraising events too and they will cross train you if you are interested."
good,I worked at Ross for 9 years and loved it. Had I not moved out of town I’d probably still be there. I loved my team . 40% off couple times a year was awesome
good,The Hardest part of Ross is that people do not realize that Ross is a first come first served based store. that offers awesome deals that show up and are gone if a person do not act on them. Anyone can find any kind of treasures in this store but everyone has a hard time understanding that the item will not always be in the store for them to pick it up.
good,"Everyday you have to clock in then have a 5 to 10 minutes meeting then we start unpacking. I’ve learned how to be a team player,  Communication skills"
good,"During Christmas it was horrible!!!"
good,Working at Ross taught me patience and how the retail really works. You have to be prepared for being on your feet during your whole shift. You do not receive any discounts since the clothes are already discounted.
good,I loved my job at Ross. I just needed more hours then they were able to give. The management was very friendly. I learned a lot deposits and ordering of money. How to set up tills and close out tills for the day
good,"You do your job, be friendly, and are okay with working in multiple areas then the job is fair and more pleasant than most other places to work at, and for the most part won't have any issues. Some positions you may find to be more enjoyable or easier than others."
good,Friendly exciting. Good environment . fast past job but not too fast. Easy very easy . some coworkers are mean. But the customers are awesome. What i didnt like was management was unorganized and not specific about anything
good,I enjoy my time at Ross but for me this is a means to an end. It is possible to make a career here and it's worth it. The staff is very team oriented.
good,Ross is a really good place to work. The only thing is the hours. The hours are not guaranteed. Sometimes you may only have one day out of the week. It is a good job for someone who is going to school but even if you are going to school that one day may not be enough for you.
good,It was a very great place to work i learn how to work on fast pace line n how to improve yo woek numbers daily to earn extra money weekly i wold love to go back
good,Solid work environment. Excel at training employees. Benefits are amazing and best in the retail industry. Culture has changed since leaving my position.
good,i liked all my co workers when i worked there especially daina she was hella cool and so was ken but i can say the only thing that made me mad was soc
good,"I loved working for Ross, especially when the Managers were good."
good,"Busy days from the start, managing the trucks for merchandise, and distribute on the floor, daily meeting with employees to make the plan for the day, assign responsibilities"
good,Great fast paced time would fly by great place to work and easy going place managers most def. Are organized and attentive to their employees and ate easy to talk to and communication with
good,All the Ross staff was friendly even if the costumers where not at times but that never really bugged me because more customers where nice to me than rude
good,"Ross is an ideal job for someone who loves to interact with people at a fast pace and know how to carry on a conversation but not for too long. Also, it is an ideal job for someone who is versatile in terms of running the register, managing the stock room, operating the cash office, and even managing the store."
good,"The work itself was simple, but tiring, and often times the customers could become aggressive. My coworkers there were amazing. Management could use some work, but all core problems were caused by corporate."
good,Uncoordinated when put in a tight spot don’t really know how to handle it. Poor management in the store. May have improved since I was there different management
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new customers almost everyday. Working at Ross Dress for Less really strengthened my customer service skills.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Ross friendly people to work with, a very fun environment. Good work place for people who enjoy shopping and are into fashion."
good,it was a great place to grow and learn about different ethics and they have great benefits. you has flexible schedules and you could travel to different stores
good,Retail job with advancement opportunities. Fair starting wage with reasonable benefits. Recommended for those with interest in retail as a career. Best of luck!
good,They can offer a flexible schedule. But over all I feel as though I do not get paid enough with everything I am able to do I make least that more recent highers.
good,working at Ross allows you to explore work tactics and problem solving issues you never knew you had prior to working there the energy was great and the co workers are very helpful
good,"It was pretty nice, the managers were great. During the summer and Christmas is when their hours really pick up. After that the rest of the year is pretty much dead so people really fight for hours. The coolest part about the job was the 20% discount and 4 times a year they had a 40% discount that lasted around days at a time for employees. I was working full-time for the summer and Christmas, but it just died down so much I was getting like 2 to 3 hours every two weeks. I would literally have no money to pay for bills. The management is great, hours are good sometimes, and its a real good place to work. The only thing about my location was just the people I worked with weren't so nice, but I'm sure you'll love working there."
good,"Training was on and off, they basically assumed you knew everything, but if you ask they will help you. Adjusting was fast and easy and it was a great experience."
good,I worked with Great people . The benefits were in line with other retail organizations.The hours were good . The work environment was good .i would return if asked.
good,"They give you hours depending on their sales, and you get paid bi-weekly. The dont have health insurance unless you are a full-time employee. You dont get to have a permanent lunch time because if is too busy you would problably end up getting lunch time until it gets less busier."
good,I loved working at Ross. It was enjoyable. Most differently would love to go back. I loved the pay an work. I hope to find a job with Ross in my new area.
good,Started off as a sales associate and was cross trained to do security. The security job itself at Ross was really laid back but kind of slow. The pay was acceptable at the time. Overall the job wasn’t bad at all.
good,"I do love what I do at Ross, I work every department in store, but little hours, looking for full time 3 years in a row but new hires are mostly prefered and given the FT hrs. Some Assistant managers are mostly in back  instead of helping with long register lines. One of managers does treat us with rasism. But over all  i love what I do ."
good,At the store I worked everybody was always fun to work with and were friendly. Their is always opportunities to rise in the company. The only down fall is that when your in management it seems the company sets you up to fail.
good,"was a nice place to work, hours were just long and not worth the pay... i will never go back there. only because you only get options that arent worth it"
good,"I wish ross would up there pay also they could use more hours "
good,"Fair environment, good administration when I had left, and allowed for career advancement while working. Went from an entry level position to asset protection specialist in less than six months. Just remember to work hard, come to work clean, and have a positive attitude!"
good,A typical day working at ross consisted of many people coming in and trying on several clothing. Working at Ross was very productive cause their were no lazy employee on my team. Everybody worked well with each other and got whatever the job was done. I learned that its good to work in a group cause for one you'll get the job done faster with people to help you and it shows you how you'll be able to work on a team in the future. Management was very helpful.  When I had a question about anything they were there with no problem. The hardest thing about my time at Ross is all the clothes being thrown on the floor and having to pick every single clothing off the floor. The most memorable parts about working at ross were just being able to have fun while I give 110% customer service and make someones day better if they are feeling down.
good,"Stock work is running merchandise from the daily truck to the sales floor on either hummers, blue bins or clothes racks. The floor positions are fitting room, sales floor or cashier. Management is truly looking out for the store and its workers to ensure a great work enviroment."
good,As with any job there's the good and bad. At Ross the majority of the associates work together to get the job done. On occasions we have setbacks that could be prevented with a little communication.
good,"as a stock team member, a typical day of work would begin really early. we'd unload the inventory , secure the merchandise with sensors and stock the sales floor shelves with the merchandise. The length of this process depends on the size of the delivery truck. Holidays are the most stressful times because the trucks are almost 3 times their normal size to accommodate for the high demand of merchandise during the holidays."
good,I worked at Ross Dress For Less for 3 years and during that time I worked in Transportation department implementing a new Transportation Management System.  The management team was supportive and provided guidance when needed but they also allowed me to do my job without micromanaging.
good,It wasn't a bad job I just had to relocate so I was forced to quit. The people are okay but they are just lazy so not a lot of work got done and some of the managers were not good.
good,I learned how to deal with rude costumers. I have to meet sales goals. I learned how to be better as a sales associate or customer service associate. Associates are fun to work with.
good,"Work day always kept associates busy and productive"
good,"Good working environment, conservative culture, limited resources. No work life balance. beautiful campus and really nice area and nice people"
good,"Working for Ross is fun and interesting. Customers are normal for the most part, pay is ok but could be higher, security needs to be more enforced. Fun parttime job to have"
good,"It's retail, everything that you can imagine at a retail store happens. Meaning that theres a lot of things going on. You have to be kind and fast, managers and staff are super kind."
good,Very fast paced and organized organization.  I learned how to stock the shelves with new merchandise and learned the fundamentals of cashiering.  The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours in order to pay my bills and minimum salary was not sufficient to pay my monthly bills.
good,"I've been working for this company for quite some time and while just like other jobs it has its ups and downs, I stay. They make it worth the hour every year if you perform well with a nice little raise. And the discount is a nice bonus so to speak. However being a full-time employee is much more livable than a part-time in my opinion."
good,"Very fast paced, you learn new things.. I like working for this company just wish there were more opportunities to move up the ladder.. Wish they gave us more hours during the week to work.."
good,"Working at ross gives you an opportunity to earn more money with something they have called ""BLUECHIP"" which is a certain percentage to get paid a bonus."
good,Worked at Ross going on 6yrs such a great work experience great employees flexible schedules Ross has really been good to me when it came to my schedule
good,I worked with the public and helped with loss prevention.  I learned how to maintain my calm even when being yelled at by customers as well as to do my job in a way to make other's jobs easier.
good,"At Ross Dress for Less it was a fun workplace environment. Yes it does get busy and sometimes the customer get frustrated because of the long lines but everyone tries to be friendly, and help make the line go down quickly with a smile."
good,Great company to work with part time. Many opportunities are available.  Everyone that I worked with at the Tanasbourne ROSS was always friendly and caring towards each other.  They are very welcoming.
good,"Ross is a good place to work, I started in 2015 & was looking for a new job because I’m in college right now and studying to become a nurse. This job is a step to my future."
good,Placed price tags and price stickers on Kitchen appliances and clothes. Very competitive and fast paced. Most people working there did receive bonus which means they will get paid more.
good,"It wasn't a job I was looking for, but I'm glad I did it. I learned a lot, was able to cover multiple areas and get comfortable with deeper customer interactions. When I wasn't feeling good, management allowed me to work in the back, and when I was full of energy they let me run the floors or check out in the front."
good,Working at Ross is fast-paste but I love the people working there. They could improve on management though and they should ask people who go above and beyond if they want another position in their store.
good,"Like most retail jobs, it's just an entry level thing that you can do for experience. There is room for advancement if you work hard enough, and if you get lucky and work with a good group of people it's a nice place to work."
good,"I always loved Ross even before i worked there , you will always find different stuff for cheap prices . "
good,"Fun Work Enviornment, Friendly, Very Enjoyable! But Its All About The Customer & Your Workplace To Be Neat & In Order! Flexible Hours, & Employee Discount."
good,"On a daily basis we get to be the first to see all the merchandise we are getting at the store. time go by so quick, everybody getting along, such great team work."
good,"Easy to pick up hours. low pay. a lot of work, even after closing. rude customers. hard to take breaks. got called in most off days. 20% discount. cool associates."
good,Overall my experience here was good I was able to learn many things about the company and interact with employees as well as with customers. I really enjoyed working here.
good,"New hires not trained properly or not at all. Volume of product in store cannot be up kept with current staffing. Current staff are very enjoyable, energetic, and positive. But are becoming overworked and burned out."
good,"Ross Dress For Less, Inc. is a company that provides people with experience as a first time job. It provides benefits such as health care insurance, scholarships for associates and associate's children. The management is very helpful and respectful. Everyone works as a team and tries to help each other. It is a great place to make new friends since most people are very friendly. Moreover, this company has programs that helps the community, such raising founds to help schools and people."
good,"Enjoyed co-workers interactions and involvement. Managment was sometimes shaking not getting along with each other as well as associates. Customer service is important, however, depending on your location you will experience difficult customers."
good,"As an associate you will be apart of a floor team in which you will be assigned a floor task. (ex fitting rooms, mens, women, active wear) Costumer services is a great part of job."
good,there are long shifts where you are on your feet constantly and have to always be standing and have to stay in a small general area at the front of the store.
good,"Work place outstanding "
good,"I enjoy working at Ross. The overall feeling of the store associates is every team oriented. Management may not always be on the same page, but each member of the management team is willing to talk with you whenever you need to."
good,on a typical day it is steady and they train you in the 1 week then little by little you learn on your on the little things. It is not a hard job you learn to start.You start to help around the store when needed.
good,Everyone works together very well. Lots of opportunities. Management is great with everyone. Fast paced and fun environment. Great programs for families in need.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of daily projects, stocking merchandise within a timely manner and maintaining a clean environment for customers as well as employers. The management team would continue to thrive its associates daily to push sales and drive contribution."
good,"The management so friendly as well the associates, so helpful, so secure. The customer are so nice, we do have a senior discount day, it is every Tuesday."
good,"I was lucky enough to have nice co-workers, there were barely any drama. There were a lot of changes in management but it didn't greatly interfere with my experience there."
good,"Most of the time I enjoy working at Ross. However, given recent events it has become a lot more stressful. We get super busy around Easter, and on top of that there have been issues with other coworkers not getting along. I want to keep working at Ross, but some of my friends there have already quit or were fired."
good,"A great place to work. Management and staff very nice and enjoy employee discounts. As a retail associate I enjoyed my work by assisting customers at the cashier line, answering questions that he/she may have relating to merchandise or finding a specific size needed for the individual. I enjoyed greeting the customers with a smile everyday in which the customer had a pleasant shopping experience. My trainer was very patient and knowledgeable with me when I was learning about my daily duties. The job recognized employees for those who did outstanding performance."
good,Working at Ross was challenging yet it was a fun environment to work in. You build your customer service skills up and you never have a dull moment. Although it may seem challenging depending what time of the year it is your coworkers are always eager and willing to help.
good,I show up before sunrise and get strait to work helping clean up or setting up the stock room before the truck shows up and then work extremely hard to get the truck cleared as fast as possible and spend the next several hours moving the daily stock to the sales floor.
good,"It was a good place to work, and I was able to work alongside some great people.  Definitely a lot to do when it comes to maintaining the store and the registers, but nothing over exhausting or overbearing."
good,"Helped broaden my knowledge on customer service. It taught and allowed me to have the opportunity to work up the ladder. Starting from the stockroom, to running the material to the floor, then to being on/ cleaning up the sales floor, to cashiering to training to be the stockroom manager and s on."
good,Has a positive atmosphere with a low stress work environment. Friendly coworkers and management. Consistent schedule but low hours for part time employees.
good,They really do a good job at recognizing team players and supporting one another. The work environment is filled with peer encouragement and understanding.
good,"It was usually pretty laid back, but of course there were rushes during the afternoons. I did enjoy working there, and you also recieved a discount on clothes. So that was nice!"
good,I needed something to get me by for the time being and it was a great upbeat friendly environment. Great management that was always involved with their employers. Insured all operations ran smooth to avoid distressed employees.
good,working at ross as a seasonal employee was a great experience for my first time working in retail. I enjoy being busy with consistent work and that's exactly what I got everyday. My co-workers  were very helpful and made my work environment a lot easier with having a opened mind about me starting there over the holidays. While working at ross I learned more exquisite customer service skills and the hardest part about the job was taking on late night shifts and not going home till 1am.
good,"A typical day at Ross, would be completing a 15 minute set or straighten up the assisgned area and after completion assisting the customers as a cashier on the register. "
good,Some of the managers were very understanding and worked with your hours. Very quick paced when it came to registers.Team work is also big here. working together to organize the store
good,"Overseeing the entire operation of the store. Operation ranges from all standard operating procedures are being followed in the stockroom and on the floor."
good,"busy productive fast paced environment"
good,No 2 days were alike which I like. You met a lot of different personalities and had a rapport with regular customers. The employee discounts were great and the co worker were easy going and easy to work with.  Somewhat fast paced as a cashier but the floor was more slower paced. Management would work around your schedule if you had another job or commitment.
good,Its a good place to work....its just the pay....needs to be better!!! The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers....some are not friendly and they thinking that you need to jump for them....Hooah!!
good,"i liked that there is always something different to do, and you can always move up in the company. Meet new people and talk to a lot of people. There is a lot of teamwork."
good,"As a cashier you are assigned a register, and an area of the store that you are responsible for. It must look as close to perfect as possible by the time you leave work. Perfect is having no clothes hanging over the racks or on the floor, and all sizes must be in the correct spots on the racks, and the clothes must be checked to make sure the correct sizes are on the correct size hangers. If you have shelves of merchandise such as baby items or toys, they must be zoned cleaned and merchandised. While doing this at any moment you will be called on the PA system to come to your register. You go to your register and ring up customers merchandise until you are no longer needed there, then you resume working on your assigned area."
good,"Good management, great team work, management/ employee involvement, paid 15 minute breaks, great training team, understanding coworkers, involvement with customers."
good,"The typical work day is very relaxed. Hours could be better. I don't recommend this a job for an adult with bills, but greater starter job for someone in college or newly highschool graduate."
good,Love my store. Easy day gone by 230pm. Can have our headphones which makes the day go by even faster. Minimum supervisory. Easy but very busy holiday time.
good,this job is college friendly for anyone looking for a part time job. One thing to take note you may apply for a position of a sales associate but expect to work in the stock room. Working at Ross i have gain a sense of speed when working a fast pace atmosphere!
good,"Be prepared for changing shift hours, Huge trucks to unload, sort, tag, and place on the floor for the customers. You'll be asked to assist some customers with taking purchases to their vehicles. You;ll be place in different areas other than what you applied for."
good,"when i come to work i'm relaxed and i start doing my job and sometimes i get stressed out when the days are very busy especially on the weekends, what i learned is how to work in the fitting room and train new employees. the hardest part of the job is trying to be fast when i'm on the sales floor. my managers do everything they can to make the store good and sometimes they stress me out. the enjoyable part of the job is helping my coworkers with anything and being friendly."
good,"This isnt a job for anyone who isnt willing to work, this is a high volume store all year round, reasonable hours and complete benefits provided for full time"
good,"Easy job, just you had other employees calling in and reporting employees for doing wrong when they do the same thing, miss the customers that I had daily."
good,lots of guest with different attitudes be prepare to work 
good,"Management here is really great, they communicate well and the store and hours are very organized. Everyone is very welcoming and the culture is inclusive."
good,If you are at a very busy store in the city it will be hectic but if you are at a store in not such a busy area.. Obviously it wont be as hectic. Managers are nice but they do get stressed out but its not bad. Associates are really cool but always remember to keep your associates at work and don't hang out with them outside of work because it can cause issues. ( Don't mix work with pleasure )
good,Learned a lot of customer service skills! Worked with an amazing staff. Stock was very fast paced and it was fun seeing all the new stuff! It was enjoyable helping customers.
good,It was a fun place to work. You do have to work fast to get people in and out quickly. Working in stock you have to go fast to get the product to the shelves quickly.
good,"As a stocker my typical work day started at 6:45 in the morning and was just unloading and tagging all new merchandise, job is good but hours aren't to good, only getting around 7-12 hours A WEEK"
good,Good opportunity to get the experience of working inside a warehouse. Nice benefits just pay a little less. Competitive for the most part and they're some areas where you can move up in the company field.
good,"I would prefer people to work here because, you can actually move up an grow in this company as quick as a year. They pay attention an appreciate employee"
good,The flexibility allowed me to both work the hours that I needed as well as do well in college. Most of the staff and management is very friendly and willing to teach you things as you settle into the new employment.
good,"I was a front end supervisor and this position has a list of responsibilities. You need to be excellent at multitasking. The front end supervisor has to have a radio at all times in order to communicate with management, security, and other sales floor teammates. You also have to answer incoming calls and direct them to the right associate or answer any questions. You are also in charge of finding available associates to help maintain the fitting room and jewelry department. You need to maintain the wait time of guests in the purchase line and return line. You are also in charge of the break and lunch times of the associates that are scheduled during your shift. You do all this while helping the guest in front of you.  The relationship that you can create with your guest is definitely rewarding and majority of the management is always willing to help you. The employees usually become very close and even after they leave the company will still come back to purchase items and to just say hello."
good,I gained skills that were invaluable. It gave me a stepping stone up in to other jobs knowing how to balance tills and deal with the daily deposits. I can't say anything about the job.
good,What i mostly enjoyed is the discounts and my co workers. It is always busy in this store. A lot of people always come there. The management are nice. No complaints on them.
good,I was initially promised to receive 18-27 hours a week as a Store Protection Associate but averaged no more than 10 hours.  After I worked for a couple of months I grew bored due having to stand in one central place for the majority of my 5 hour shifts.  I gave a 2 week notice and Manager asked me  to stay on and she would find another job which she did. I was to try it for a while to see if I thought I could do the job. It was a stocking position of which I had experience previously..  In this capacity I averaged less than four hours a week.  Many weeks I was called and told to stay home due to smaller cargo amounts. I did not give a second notice since I did not have a meeting with the manager to see how it was going.   I enjoyed working with a great team of workers.  Pay was excellent but management did not come through with expected hours.
good,"Opportunity for advancement, great leadership, flexibility in scheduling. Pay was average. Teamwork oriented environment, Good experience for an entry level job."
good,"Ross Dress for Less is a fast paced and growing company that with each year continues to become more popular. The store offers a lot of hrs with chances to increase pay grade depending on how good of a worker you are. "
good,I liked that we were able to work together as a team and go straight into our individual assignments all in a timely manner. We were trusted to work under little supervision.
good,"It's A good job . Most of time you if you're a cashier , you're gonna be up front taking customers . If you not doing that then you'll leave and make the store look nice and neat but time really flies in ross"
good,"I checked people out, and put clothes away. It was a part time seasonal job. The work atmosphere was nice, and I had a fun time working there. I liked my managers."
good,Everyone is kind and like a family that will help you out with anything if overwhelmed by highly fast paced environment. All managers are understanding and will to work around your schedule.
good,Ross is a very successful retailer that continues to grow. I enjoyed and learned from every challenge I encountered. Ross gave me the opportunity to open new stores.
good,"Working at this job was very stressful because I was in the fitting department and I worked the closing shift, so I would have to clear the racks from the previous shift. It definitely taught me how to have patience and how to always keep a smile on my face."
good,"I'm highly new at working with Ross so I'm still learning the rops around it. Totally different from Walmart and I honestly like it better but the only difference is hours. It's a great job for part time work and very flexible with your schedule, love it. The supervisors and managers are very nice and professional and that's what I respect about the store I work at."
good,"worked in the stockroom processing and pushing freight and enjoyed my job and coworkers.  I would recommend to anyone to get a job there, you get what you put into it."
good,Ross is great to work for. I am a person who loves to stay busy and no doubt you will stay busy. Time goes by fast and you are challenged daily to meet new goals. If you are a competitive person this job is great for you. You obviously work with the general public and meet new faces all the time as well as seeing your regulars. All of the staff is great to work with and for the most part maintain the same goal of store needs.
good,Ross was my first job and I ended up staying almost 2 years because I enjoyed the job. The different cultures I experienced on a daily was very eye opening. From the customers to my coworkers. I loved the team efforts and we all seemed to be one big family. I enjoyed my days there and had fun when we all use to work together. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find clothes and outfits that helped hem feel beautiful and made them happy. The hardest part in my location was the language barriers sometimes because a lot of my customers didn't speak fluent English but as I went on it became easier to adjust.
good,"I learned that I have the ability to charm people and that is my gift, The workplace environment is fun and easy going. They are not the best at giving hours, because I received 10 hours in a week and the position was part-time I was not a fan of that."
good,Fun and fast work environment. lots of different assignments. It is retail so busy days are  physically demanding but if everyone works hard we can get the job done.
good,Its was during the holidays is when i enjoyed working there the most. It was vary fast past and not stresfull. Even though there might be alot of go back the group still worked as a team .
good,Easy going atmosphere fun loving people to work with.  Management was great if you got lucky. Wich i did. I followed my boss to another store and stayed 5 years plus. He was amazing. He made it easy to want to work for the company.
good,A typical day is putting away/ organizing merchandise and ringing up customers.  Managers are usually caring and understanding. they try to recognize good performance and give incentives. Hardest part of the job is working in understaffed conditions. Most enjoyable part is the employees and the discounts
good,"Associate recognition of their performances and awarded associate of the month achievement in daily store meetings. I have learned that a great store must start with a great management team and that communication must be strong among them. I enjoy the fast pace store that I work at. Sometimes it can be quite demanding, but I love a good challenge. My associates depend on me and this makes me push even harder."
good,very easy work and always things to do so always busy. has a varity of positions in the store to work and room to move up if wanted. They are usualy good about working any schedules if needed.
good,"I learned how to sell retail products and goods, courtesy, respect, friendliness, and professionalism at all times."
good,Ross Dress for Less offers quality items at an affordable price. Working for this company is amazing as they really care for their employees. It is a family oriented environment that is welcoming and hospitable.
good,I have work for Ross almost 3years. It great working for Ross but it's getting a little harder working for them. They giving us a little more work that will can handle. But I love the discounts. Thanks
good,"Not complicated work, Interpersonal skills are a necessity, and employee's who don't share a sense of team work, and drive typically don't do well in this environment."
good,"It was a nice place to work. People were kind, the customers were taken care of, Being a part of that, even if it was in the background, it was still good, knowing I could help, even if it was not part of my job description."
good,if u like to stay busy this is for sure a great place to work. I loved my time there. Christmas time is insane if you dont have good management. Which can be stressful. If you can make it through october though december you are golden!
good,I learned to unload stock truck and put it out. As well I learned how to manage a team and team meetings. They taught me how to count cash office and learn clerical work. It was very enjoyable because you got to meet a lot of new faces. They always had new products and got shipment every day.
good,"Good job culture"
good,If this store wasn't located in a dead mall I would have stayed! The people were great to work with and everything was easy to understand. They were also VERY understanding of my military career!
good,Unload truck and hang clothes. Learned how to hang cloths fast and sort through boxes. Management was okay. Having to be so fast. Seeing all the stuff first and getting a lot of good deals.
good,"the job i had was nice and comfortable, a bit more active thank my last job but was nice overall. my supervisor was nice and i enjoyed my posissiton..."
good,It was a quiet work environment which I enjoyed. The customers were friendly and management was amazing and very on top of things. I learned so many new skills and it was a fun experience.
good,"Working for Ross was a good experience for me due to the fact that I had numerous amounts of help learning everything needed for my position. The management was great and represented the store accordingly. Since they are good with training they every thing became easier, the hardest thing out of the whole job was remembering the new store statistics every month."
good,"The work is fulfilling. Benefits are good for full time people. Enjoy the customers.the store is open late, 12am, 1am. Sometimes its hard to work days one day then nights the next. There is a constant flow of new current merchandise with a quick turnover. It can be a fun place to work"
good,"A very decent place to work in a retail setting. Interacting positively with customers, put customers into a positive position to make purchases, return merchandise to sales floor"
good,"How much does a Pharmacy Technician I make in North Carolina? North Carolina Pharmacy Technician I salaries vary greatly from town to town. See below for Pharmacy Technician I salaries, bonus and benefits information for 21 cities in the North Carolina area."
good,"It was actually the best first job fresh out of high school job you can ask for.  The management was good, people were friendly, and the store itself needed a little improvement but other than it was a great experience that i appreciate."
good,"After signing in you must immediately rush to wherever you are assigned for that day. Depending on where you are assigned it can be unrelenting as far as working with customers and trying to finish your assigned tasks."
good,Ross is Great job if you like to stay busy. Employees give great customer service and people always come back. The only downfall is sometimes you may not get the hours you need.
good,"Fun and great place to work. Depending on which area you work, it can be an extremely fast paced environment or slow paced environment. There is a constant flow of changes, so if you can't handle change, this may not be the place of work for you."
good,"I love going to work early mornings working in stock. Its a very fast pace enviroment, upbeat and makes me on my toes. I enjoy my cowokers the most out of the job."
good,Ross is a good place to gain experience in customer service and has a good environment. I enjoyed working with my coworkers.and learned alot from management.
good,20% discount for employees. fun place to work. fellow employees are fun to work with. very flexible to work with. holidays are a little crazy to work.
good,Over all great place to work. Co workers were supportive and friendly. Management worked with scheduling and hours. Employee discount was amazing and store was always neat and clean.
good,"I enjoyed the people and managers I worked with. It was easy to get along with people, and easy to find your fit. The hours aren't always what you want, but they're not bad. I worked in every department, but I'd say being in stock gave me ""full-time"" hours. Like any retail place, recovery sucks but with the methods they teach at Ross, it is manageable. Pay is fair. My only thing - I wish there were benefits for part-time employees, just like full-time employees do!"
good,"Short hours, part time work, depending on where you work it can be pretty slow, or it can be up beat. If you work the fitting rooms, it can be pretty slow at times. But you can run your clothes when it is slow. Working the register can be pretty up beat. You have to process go backs, and hang up clothes."
good,"it was a bit overwhelming, but very productive and fun environment to work in. my day to day was hectic with the customers and merchandising but overall a good experience"
good,Every day at this job was challenging. Met new people everyday. It is not what i wish to do my entire life but the job is easy. Management was OK. there was not hard at all either everything is common sense.
good,A typical day at work can be keep you on your toes. I learned more on what was expected of me in the work field the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the speed of the work. the most enjoyable part was coming into work and leaving felling that you accomplished something.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Ross! I got along very well with my managers and co-workers. The biggest problem is that the shifts are typically very short, and there aren't many full time positions available. So if you're working part time there while going to school and trying to pay your bills, it can be difficult."
good,I needed to leave to become  a stay home mother.   I would have loved to returned to work but under the circumstances our family had to move where my husband could make more. One while I stayed home with the baby.
good,Great job to start at with advancement opportunity. The only disadvantage is the revolving door for employees not receiving job stability.
good,I definitely learned alot in such a short period of time with Ross. I think it will make me a better employee and/ or manager in the future.
good,"I worked here for a couple of months and loved it. It was a great experience. It's ran pretty smooth and it's a real easy job, and there's opportunities to earn extra money"
good,"Was a Front End Supervisor. I enjoyed working here but just not enough pay. Most of my managers was laid back and was always willing to help out any employee. Most customers where polite. Holidays were killer most days, but I would think that would be anywhere. Hardest part was large amount of people checking out at the same time. Enjoyable part was working with my fellow coworkers."
good,The hardest part of the job is keeping up in the face paced environment but if your willing to go to work and finish your job it really is no problem. The people I work with are friendly and hard working. Management is usually pretty good about getting days off unless you are a full time employee. I learned to be fast and built up my muscle strength with all the heavy lifting.
good,typical day included restocking shelves. I learned great customer service as well as the ability to work well with other employees.
good,focused on individual development at high level.Alot of programs building my team & managers to positively impact my store.improved my quality of life
good,"The staff at Ross is a lot of fun to be around.. The associates job is pretty easy. A typical day at work (depending on your assignment for  the day) ranges from checking out customers to organizing clothing to standing in the fitting room. The front end supervisor position  has the additional tasks of delivering change to registers and handling jewelry from the glass cases up front.  My particular store has a lot of traffic, and can be stressful at times."
good,"Es un excelente y sano ambiente de trabajo, donde se respeta alas personas. Esta todo bien estandarizado y ordenado. Lamentablemente no tienen política de empleo a tiempo completo"
good,"I enjoyed working for ross, I was hired as a temporary employee, and in my short time there I made a lot of friends and I really enjoyed my time there."
good,"Fun place to work, they sell great products. they are able to work around your schedule. you arent really responsible for much around the store . easy things to learn"
good,I liked working here because it was local and the hours were convenient. This is the perfect job to work if you're in school but sometimes it can be just a little bit overwhelming because of the work environment.
good,"Ross dress for less is a great place to work. They are very nice,  and respectful. Is a great atmosphere. People are very nice. Very flexible place to work."
good,Typical day at work is to greet the customers on the sales floor while also recovering items on the floor back on the racks and shelves. Also would work cashier.
good,"Benefits to employees are okay. 20% associate discount, with 40% off weeks three or four times a year.  Not enough recognition for store management,  or resources to stories in order to run efficiently."
good,"Stay very busy throughout entire shift, and work with great people and have constant contact with assisting customers."
good,"A typical day at Ross dress for less was fun, loved working there love the great sales that always have, and the great people that you work with, as well as all the people you meet while working there."
good,"Working as a cashier at Ross can be hectic on certain days we hit our peak sales time. It's good that, in most times, we usually have back up cashiers working on the sales floor when the line gets too long for two to three cashiers can't get the line moving fast enough. Whenever there is an emergency in your personal life the managers are 100% understandable and will be able to find someone to cover your shift for you as best as they can when you aren't able to find someone yourself. The coworkers I work with are all warm and inviting. The hardest part of the job would be trying to reach or maintain a 95% or above on the CPR score. The CPR scoring is how effectively fast a cashier is at calling the next customer, scanning and bagging all of the items one at a time, and handling the cash. I personally don't agree with the CPR because it affects how many hours the manager gives a casher because people who score a 95% or above get all the hours and only a very few cashiers have a score in that range. I find it unfair because I know some of the cashiers have bills to pay, school debt to pay off, and anything else to assist their day-to-day lives."
good,I worked at Ross for over 10 years. Good benefits and good co workers. As of shrink company is not doing anything to stop it. External theft at Ross is the worst I ever seen working for a retailer. Inventory results have huge loss and management is being terminated for not making a shrink. How can you make a shrink when company is not supporting the store needs. Shoplifters are coming in groups ( mob ) and basically looting . Security and associates just looking on and cant do anything to stop them. Then the thieves coming back and doing return without receipt and get awarded voucher for as much as $500. It is very upsetting to not have support or any kind of prosecution for criminals
good,"The entire team excels at their job performance and exceed expectations. Working for Ross, you have to be able to quickly adapt to a culture of awareness and a company that is always advancing. Customer service is our priority and by having a store that is well presented and organized, we can achieve it."
good,"From the moment I clock-in, there is plenty of work to be done. This isn't always a bad thing because I am there to play my role and do my part. Sometimes it is't fair because if certain employees would work up to their full potential it would prevent less work for others and everyone could share equal responsibility. Management could be a bit more strict in ensuring every employee plays their role and make sure everything they are assigned to do that day is done rapidly and effectively. The co-workers could push a bit more ; be less lazy and more willing to expand their horizons. In knowing that no matter what my part is always done rapidly and effectively it shows me how goal oriented and how much I am a willing participant.  I enjoy work knowing that it taught me something knew and made me a harder worker."
good,I applied for this job because i wanted too know about all kinds of clothes and the fabric...working at ross was fun too me i was learning new things and people that i worked with was really great...
good,"The experience was unforgettable, I learned different things that helped me become a communicative person, which is a very important aspect when it comes to professionalism."
good,"Worked with fun people and management was laid back and cool, most of the time. Time passed quickly during shifts if you stay busy. Helping customers was pretty fun but you are on your feet all night."
good,it was okay. one lunch break. standing up entire time. coworkers were great. they fed you on Thursdays. leads and supervisors were nice. just be to work on time because they have a point system.
good,"Typical day is 8-6. Analyzing data, running system reports, going out in the market place, placing buys, writing orders etc.  Management is situational. I have had a pleasant experience with my management and co-workers but I do not think it is the same for all. Overall, supportive company with great benefits and competitive pay. The product/career does not interest me personally."
good,"There's not much to say, in my opinion. It's the basic workplace. Not much is done to boost morale other than a 50$ dollar bonus for associate of the month. I don't hate it nor like it. I stand in the middle-ground."
good,"Good management staff, great co-workers who completes all tasks and help each other. Very busy inflow Friday and Saturday. Sometimes we have food together :)"
good,I enjoyed working with the people here. The staff was very friendly and everyone helped each other out. The customers were very happy shopping at our location and they remembered me outside of work. I enjoyed doing the customer service. Management was good and coworkers were helpful. The hardest part of the job was doing the fitting rooms during holidays. The most enjoyable part was talking to the customers and helping them.
good,i had a part time position and it wasnt that bad but it could have been a lot better. the hours were a bust if you needed more than 10 but since i was a busy student who only needed the money for my car and my internet it sufficed.
good,"Job duties were to clean the entire store floors, the dressing rooms, restrooms, windows, and mirrors. Worked every weekend only. It was ok pay for a couple of hours because that gave me the time to really clean the store the way I felt needed to."
good,It is a great place to work if you are in high school or a summer job when your in college. It is a nice first job for a young adult.
good,"Processing clothes and other merchandise while maintain a fast and friendly service. Also, providing excellent customer satisfaction and keeping an organized work area."
good,Awesome store for such a small town. The cleanest and most organized Ross Store I have ever visited. Friendly staff and great selection of products.
good,A typical day at Ross would consist of me greeting customers as the enter the store. Making sure the store is safe for employees and customers. Keeping a eye open for theft that may occur in the store.  Overall i consider Ross a great company where there are many advancement oppurnities
good,"Stock items on sales floor , assist customers to the proper department ,multitask,the managers and staff are great ,good management skills a good teamplayer I enjoy working with the. customers ."
good,"During the day whether roaming the store, I got along great with my co workers. The paperwork wasn't fun but it was easy enough."
good,"cashier,fitting room attendant, sorting merchandise and restocking, customer assistance. The management ran thee store smoothly but were hardly seen on the floor. Most everyone kept to themselves there. We were rotated to different departments but the holidays are brutal hours."
good,"here I was a stocker. unload truck, process merchandise, and stock shelves. Cleaned warehouse. Didn't get too many hours. it all depended on how big or small the load was.co-workers were fun and made the day go by fast."
good,"busy making sure the store is presentable is one of the goals of the company and that is a vital key, because if the store is a mess who will want to shop there but if it clean, neat and presentable people will shop and that make for a good work environment."
good,Great opportunities to learn and gain knowledge about retail merchandising and business management. The work environment depends on management and team work.
good,"Wonderful place to work. Have food provided in breakroom once a month.  Management is very understanding, great to work for. Feels like being with family as each associate is eager to help the other to meet company goals."
good,"Almost all of the managers and associates are great. There are only a few bad apples but they truly do spoil the bunch. Many coworkers feel a loss of morale or uncomfortable-ness in the workplace. Complaints have been filed but nothing has been done about it yet. This certain manager plays favorites, which really sucks because he is the one who creates the weekly schedules for everyone."
good,"Excellent company with plenty of growth opportunities. They are located in the East Bay which is a huge con. However, they have excellent benefits, strong stock, great culture, and a great gym on campus."
good,I loved working at this ross stores location. They welcomed me with opened arms everyday. I learned everything I needed to learn within one weeks time. They love to teach their employees whatever they want to learn so they can expand in the store.
good,This is a friendly open place to work and i love to be in the public.There is not enough hours given to work . The company offers health and dental to there employees.On the job training to there employees.
good,I worked for this company for 5 months. I was pleased with the way they worked around my home schedule. My husband and I travel a great deal and even though this is a 7 day a week retail environment they hired me even though I couldn't work weekends. The team that I worked with were all friendly and did their jobs to the very best of their abilities. There is room for advancement and I saw several employees advance their careers while I was there. They are supportive and friendly and I appreciated the time I spent with this company
good,"I really enjoyed the job its self, stayed busy and active, i was called in to pick up hours weekly. I only had problems with one person there in upper management, that treated me unfairly, enough to put in my two weeks and find another job. All the responsibility i had was great for me. I would love to move up in a merchandising, or into management."
good,Great place to work if you can live off 20 hours a week. There needs to be an opportunity to be able to move up to full-time. Only if you become a part of management is the only way to get full-time hours. All management positions are already filled.
good,"Ross, was a great place to work. Coworkers always had great attitudes regardless of and situation. We maintained a clean and professional work environment. Always made sure the customers were happy and content with their visits."
good,"I either unloaded the delivery truck and restocked the store or I worked as front door security. The management was accommodating and involved. Coworkers were manageable and respectful. Sizing clothing was probably the hardest and most unenjoyable part of the job. Although, I quite enjoyed stocking the show room."
good,Fun environment and quick advancement if your willing to relocate.  Never a dull day and always something to do.  Very fast pace culture in all you do.  Work/life balance is ok but to be expected as such with retail.  Best thing I learned was how to accurately assess myself and be honest with myself in order to grow from a business prospective
good,"You always learn something new at Ross.The interview portion was fantastic i loved the way my managers interviewed me. When i got the job i honestly didn't like that the manager on duty that they just throw you out on the floor and don't properly train you. the other thing is i dont like how were timed for most things. i dont think customer service should be timed. the pro is there are some nice associates that are willing to help you out with whatever you need help out and they have Buddy trainers. and lets not forget about the discounts. and also im a people person and when a customer gives you a compliment or makes your day, that makes my day. or just even knowing i helped them out makes me happy."
good,A typical day at work includes assisting guests with shopping and purchasing of items. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting guests in finding exactly what they came in the store for.
good,"I loved working for Ross even though the pay was bare minimum. The expect a lot from you for very little pay. They want you to do every job in the store, without the pay. This is a great place to work part time, or while you are in school they are extremely flexible. At one point they let me work 2 days a week while I finished school."
good,"Great starting workplace, ability to move up in positions in a timely manner. Quick paced environment, Management was always helpful and ready to lend a hand. Great job to get your foot in the door for retail and get basic experience in all areas of a retail career."
good,"Stable work atmosphere, room for advancement within the company. Offering onsite training and advancement courses. Good benefits for full time employees."
good,"I enjoyed the job overall, but the job did have its disappointments.  Management was great and very friendly but some associates took advantage of the friendly management.  Coworkers would call off multiple times a month and no other associates would take over shift.  Left shorthanded multiple times.  Coworkers were also very friendly but disagreements between coworkers would start to occur."
good,"Great place to work and I enjoyed it. I learned a lot, flexible schedule and friendly associates. Organization and recovery could be better and need lots of patience with the customers. Overall good company to have a first job with."
good,"Working for Ross can be long but also very interesting and fun. My colleagues are great and helpful, we work in a great environment ."
good,I enjoyed working at ross for the most part there was order and structure everyonewas always nice my management team was very supportive
good,This job has given me the ability to feel more comfortable working around a lot of people. Every customer gives you a different experience. The people are great to work with. The managers are great and understanding.
good,Growing company with tons of advancement. Some stores are not in greatest of neighborhoods which can lead to a unsafe work environment.
good,"I started with Ross as a seasonal cashier, and with the guidance of my leadership team and dedication to my development was able to successfully master every position up to Assistant Store Manager, as I started working for Ross when I was 18 years old and it was my third job, I felt that after I addressed some personal health problems I would seek another career opportunity."
good,"Ross was a very great place to work at. I loved my co-workers and most of my managers. We were a family that really loved each other and we always worked together as a team. I was one of the best sales associates/customer service reps there, even had customers raving about my work ethic, but was always over looked for career advancement. I began to accept that I was never going to advance in the company, but continued to give 100%. There were some bad times, but the good far outweighed the bad. I worked both in stock and front end and they both worked really well with my school schedule. The stock hours were great and the work kept you busy. Great job for college students."
good,"Each day I came to work we had a meeting to discuss each employees role. I learned bookkeeping, stocking, tagging, and customer/ conflict resolution. All of the employees I worked with were very happy fun individuals. The hardest part of the job was dealing with thieves and unhappy customers."
good,"good place to work, especially if your a student, but if your looking for hours and full time position this is not the place to work,"
good,"Hard working environment, helpful co-workers during a day of work. You learn the basics of the job and what areas to help improve in."
good,Management was slow at taking action. job hours varied . . hours were not enough. Stayed very late due to the amount of staff members closing unless the store or asst. manager closing.
good,I enjoy working here. I'm just not scheduled that often due my athletic schedule. I pretty much have good days at ROSS when I actually work.
good,"If you have never worked retail this would be a great crash course to get used to it. Weekends are usually very busy which is to be expected. The managers are very nice and flexible so that makes the job better than most retail jobs. I work in the fitting room but I have also been on the register as well as the sales floor. I'd say my favorite would be working on the sales floor. While on the cash register time flies by so that's good. In the fitting room it can get a little hectic, so be prepared to multitask."
good,Great company to work for.  You will learn excellent skills to further your career. Ross has opened many doors for me. I am very happy to work for such a great company
good,"The store I worked at was very energized with a positive, high-intense work environment. Management and staff meshed well together, I got along with the people who were there when I was there. If I could work with that team again I would."
good,"casher for most of the part, my day typically consisted of cashering keeping the store oranized and neat. customer service answer any question they had. i learned how to make sales, operate a register coworkers are great people to work with very freindly i would say the hardest part is when the holidays come around just because it can get pretty hectic . overall great place to work ."
good,"Associates are hard workers, friendly, and team players. Great management team, always ready to assist and listen to concerns or requests. Management very reasonable and resolved issues/concerns in a timely manner. Cross training helped me understand how it all comes together for the company. I loved that I was given the opportunity to work in the cash office."
good,"The co-workers were easy to get along with. "
good,"Arrived at work with no experience"
good,"My day is just like any other day at work, I just clock in and simply get the job started.  I've learned, so far, that within the job itself, team partnership and great work ethics require a part where you can become even more successful if you stay focused overall.  Management throughout the company is outstanding.  I'm glad to have a store manager who is, not only a down to earth, humble and friendly guy, but who also knows his way around the store and how to properly, train associates on what to do with their assignments.  I definitely could say that I have a great team of co-workers that I can rely on to help me out in time of need.  There isn't really a hard part of a job for me at the moment, everything seems easy and compatible overall.  I could also say that, I definitely enjoy my job overall, as far as working with everyone to keep the store organized and completing projects, and everything else we are assigned to do as store retail associates."
good,"Great employees, are treated well, and given food for overtime."
good,"good place to work , if your going to school though it does not offer much hours a week only part time"
good,"Easy day at work most of the time"
good,"Great place for a first time job, usually work with your life schedule."
good,"it was nice working there, but the hours were horrible. The people I worked with were really great and friendly."
good,"I led the SPS team and had strong communication with them through out my shift keeping an eye out for suspicious activity and keeping the store safe. I learned a lot about myself especially how good of a leader and communicator i am. Great managers easy to approach with any type of problems. Great co workers with good work ethic. The job does get long, you have to keep yourself busy. I enjoyed being a professional and looked up to in the store."
good,"Ross is a welcoming environment to work in. We value our customers and enjoy providing customer service to them. We take pride in making sure our store is stocked with new inventory and the presents of our business is neat and clean for customers to shop. Management relationships are not just employer to employee but sometimes blossoms into a personal business relationship. We learn more everyday about the retail industry with the daily store meetings we have concerning sale numbers for our store and goals that are set by the district for us to make as a team. Recognition is always made when going beyond the standard efforts by management and/or co-workers.My tasks are enjoyable being that I am a fitting room attendant and buddy trainer. I have the opportunity to provide fashionable opinions to my customers and help them find the ideal outfit they are looking for.I also enjoy being responsible for new product displays to show my creative talent through my work. Being that the Fayetteville location is a training store, as a buddy trainer I train all new employees and managers that come to our location for training for proper procedures and operations of the store but mainly the fitting room area. I give this position two thumbs up for employment!"
good,"a typical day at work is so busy, so you get a lot of things to do with a huge amount of customers, you don't get bored at all and you don't feel how time past, there is always work to do, projects to accomplish and customers to help, you learn how to enjoy working in a fast paced job and stressful situations with a great team, how to have fun when you are working and helping customers. the management team was so friendly and that was the best part of the job."
good,"A typical day for me as a mangager would include making sure the store is properly staffed, assigning work and daily tasks to associates, checking time and attendance, checking sales and payroll, handling any manager calls from customers and associates, making sure the store is properly stocked, merchandised and recovered daily. The hardest part of the job was keeping the store looking nice. Most all of the employees had fun while working. This was the most enjoyable part of the job was working with our employees and keeping it fun and lighthearted."
good,In my opinion the managers need more communication with each other about schedules and other things. I also think that the managers should communicate more with their employees about changes made to the schedules. My co-workers at Ross are great. Most of them are friendly and always have a smile on their face. The managers are just as nice and friendly as the rest of the staff. The hardest part of this job would be figuring out the daily routine. When being trained I don't think that you get a very good feel for how things are run and how you are expected to do certain things. Once you get the hang of it though it goes much more smoothly. The most enjoyable part of this job is speaking to the customers and getting to know them. They're all so friendly and love to talk.
good,"I really enjoy working for the company. The management team and all my co-workers are great, hardworking people, who love their job. I really enjoy helping customers find the items they are looking for. Many of the customers are regulars so we have all gotten to know each other, which makes working there ever more enjoyable. Ross is a fast paced environment, which is nice because it make the day go by quickly."
good,my co-workers and management in general were great to work with. There was a since of family among us they made working the job easy
good,"Ross was very fun place to work. but during holiday season situations can get out of control. Working wit Ross I learned that shoplifters comes in diff shapes, forms and sizes. I learned how to be part of a team, the only concern I had was how the managers would rather sit in the office or break and take too long to assist cashiers when they called for assistance."
good,nice place to work but hours and money is not sufficient enough for an adult with bills. But over all a great place to work they do offer discounts to all of their employees.
good,This job fit perfectly into my life because I worked Monday through Friday 9-5 but I needed to advance so I took a promotion
good,"I really enjoy what I do at Ross.  However, I am looking for a more challenging job.  I believe I can use my experience from Ross and branch off to a bigger company."
good,When I arrived to work I was greeted by a manager. I would clock in and then I would go to the back room and review my work load and speak to my co-workers. We would discuss how we are going to break down the truck and restock the warehouse. The hardest part of my job was picking up others slack. The most enjoyable part of my job was the meeting new people.
good,Managed a team of 45 associates worked with payroll and daily sales goal. Controlled shortage culture by overseeing loss prevention team. Had annually inventory for merchandise lost of marked out of stock.
good,I learned a lot working at Ross. It taught me the value of earning a paycheck and to work hard. My coworkers were great and so were my bosses. I loved working in customer service and really enjoyed being able to help others
good,Management is constantly thanking you for the work you are doing and are very nice and friendly people.  They work around your schedule as much as needed and will try to schedule you as much as possible so you get your full hours.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to returning customers. It's a good feeling to see customers again and for them to remember you. Often times conversations are longer with returning customers than with new customers.
good,Great managers depending on your location. however some of the actual company policies are absurd. very easy to move up in the company if you are motivated.
good,"Overall I fell in love with the work environment at Ross, because of my coworkers. I love clothes shoes and jewelry so ross felt like a second home then a job."
good,"Loved working with everybody. Everybody gets along it feels like we could be great friends. Managers are nice and make you feel welcomed all the time. Hours can be flexible. Miss working there ALOT."
good,the store was always busy but everyone got along well and got the job done
good,"A typical day working at Ross was fun, fast paced, usually cleaning up the store, bringing new merchandise out onto the floor and customer service. "
good,"Busy day dealing with both fun and not so fun customers."
good,"Ross is a good company, there is always room to advance.  The biggest issue I had was work time verses personal time.  The job was more important than the home."
good,I pretty much do everything in that store the only thing they lack is on is raises my raises are once a year and they usually are like 20 cents. The management is really good i've been there for over 2 years and the 3 managers that have been there have been great. The hardest part of the job is cashering because time passing by really slow and your feet get really tired really fast.
good,"I enjoy helping customers by answering questions and checking them out in a fast, efficient way. I also enjoy working in a fast paced environment and working as a team player. I believe that when you work as a team player that the customers needs are met in a fun and courteous way!"
good,"Fun and fast-paced workplace, laid back but driven, lots of fun.  Great job, just not enough hours available."
good,On my first day I wasn't really comfortable due to the fact of negative comments said about me on my first day. I learned a lot about merchandising and being neat. My co-workers weren't what I had expected. The hardest part was after hours. My most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,"Applied my knowledge in the store daily tasks, as Cash Officer, and retail."
good,"I am able to work all departments because they feel I am a fast learner and I can handle any situation, so a typical day would just be doing my job wherever they put me at weather its at cashier, the floor or the fitting room, even being the front manager for a second. I love the people I work with makes it easier to have time pass by, the hardest part would have to be the mess customers make because it does get pretty messy and hectic, but I mostly enjoy engaging with the customers its fun to help and solve problems to try to make the customer happy."
good,"Loved my boss, the only issue I had is that the hotline for team issues was not a fair system, stories could be fabricated and backed in that store because of retribution."
good,"Salary very low and hours too, manager rude , co-worker are some nice and others rude. lunch break 30 minutes but never like the manager there because she steel a lot of money to that company. she was always pushing everybody that were missing money will she was the one steeling the money from Ross."
good,"* As the back room Supervisor, I arrived to work at 7:00 AM sharp."
good,"A typical day at Ross means working hard 100% of your shift from the moment you clock in to the moment you clock out. Which I view as a positive because I've learned how to work hard and efficiently. Management gives ample feedback and clearly communicates expectations/goals/opportunities for improvement. I've been cross-trained in customer service, cash office, fitting room, stock room, sales floor, and loss prevention with some management training. I've learned so so so many valuable skills to take with me to future jobs. If you are willing to work hard and take constructive criticism well, this is a great job for you. If you want to stand around doing nothing at work and get mad when your managers give negative feedback on your poor job performance, stay away from Ross. They expect a lot."
good,Worked in all different departments:Shoe; Fitting; Clothing.  Worked as a cashier and temporary front end supervisor on some days
good,"They definitely helped me become comfortable in a service job. My coworkers were very welcoming and eager to train newcomers, management is always available and able to answer any questions one might have, and customers are easy to talk to. Overall, the work environment is very personable."
good,"fast pace work atmosphere very friendly co-workers, awesome team work. you feel like its one big family. "
good,I had a good time over all working there. I made friends with some of my co-workers. It's easy to move up in positions.
good,"Enjoyable experience , Wonderful management, treated like family."
good,"I worked in many departments at Ross Dress for Less. I started as a retail sales associate, then a customer service specialist, and finally advancing to a cash office manager.  "
good,A typical day at work is keeping your assigned department clean and organized while always being ready to open your register at any moment. I have learned a lot from working at Ross. I learned how to work at a fast pace while trying to multitask. I have learned how to give each customer a great experience at the store by giving them outstanding customer service. My coworkers are wonderful people. They help each other whenever is needed and they work at the same fast pace. They are just as hard working as I am. The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving acknowledgement from the management team and customers. Nothing else makes your day better at work when someone notices the good things your doing for the store and everyone else that's in it.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers and talking about the events of the day.
good,"had fun learned alot would love to work there again, had good people i worked with i got along with eveyone the management team was very help full hoping my next job is as good as this one was !"
good,operated cash registers and completed customer transactions. Strong organzation skills. Provided excellent customer service.
good,Working for this company has helped me a lot with my customer service skills it is a big growing company that you could move up fast and always learn new different departments I also like about Ross that is is a fast paced work environment it will always keep you occupied with work.
good,pretty good overall. it was good at times and the employees worked very well together its like a second home to me
good,Come into work greet everyone. Ask M.O.D where was my area for the day. Go there clean and assist customers. Management is good very friendly and supportive. Co-workers came in happy and ready to work together. Hardest part of my job was was dealing with rude customers but I dealt with it very professionally. The most enjoyable was getting customers exactly what they were looking for and knowing i was a great deal of help.
good,"My day begins with seeing my manager as soon as I come in, to see what my assignments are for the day and which department I am assign to that day. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting and joking around with co-workers."
good,"The store I work for is the largest for it's area, and we feel every bit of it. The day flies by as customers come and go at a fast rate, and we do everything we can to ensure they have a pleasant visit and leave with a treasure all their own. Management is impressive, considering they type of retail company Ross is. Co-workers are fun and always challenging one another. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be the fast pace, as during the holidays, when you have three call outs on one shift, it can feel overwhelming. But the most rewarding part is seeing a customer come in unhappy, and leave with a smile, all because not only did they find what they were looking for, but whichever associate they encountered along the way made it their goal to help out and see that they left with a smile."
good,"great place to work, understanding management, great discounts"
good,"Very complex place to work, just need more money. Very fast pacd you have to stay on your toes at all times."
good,typical day at work being on front registers is very busy
good,"My typical day is very busy, in retail i am always learning in things, and my co managers are very helpful and always willing to give you constructive feedback, the hardeds part of my job is being the boss, the best part of my job i always get to met and work with new people all the time"
good,"The store had sugnificant values to be learned. Organization skills, people skills, loss prevention, and management skills. It was a simple task to show the emploees the every day tasks of the workplace."
good,A typical day at work would be greeting customers and making sure the store was being stolen from
good,loved it will work there again.!if was rehired.If your a self motivated individual you can go far in this company.
good,"Friendly people with different values and ethics, they look for people who are self starters and learn fast."
good,This was different from anything I had ever done in my work experince but very rewarding and refreshing in a lot of ways. I think because I worked with a very diverse group of people and customers.
good,"I've been with the company for almost two years, and though my position is part-time, I enjoy working here. Great 20% associate discount and you couldn't ask for a better management team here."
good,"Very nice customers, and great people to work with and for.Very nice items in the store to find at great prices."
good,i enjoyed my time at ross dress for less in paramount I got to work in customer service which I never experienced & on the sales floor both were very new to me & I believe that worked to their expectations The team that I was surrounded with were great & the managers were all a pleasure to work with & although I wasn't kept for very long I have to say I respect the organization.
good,"Overall great company to work for , great team work threw out the different departments ."
good,Another day at work was not too hard just keep moving with good job culture. Hardest part of the job was simply picking up extra heavy packages at the time me being physically smaller. Most enjoyable was getting along with coworkers and supervisors at Ross DC.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, there were a lot of people coming in to the store non stop, you get ask to do almost anything, from handling cash register to helping with dressing rooms."
good,Ambiente de trabajo rapido y eficaz. Variedad diaria en todos los departamentos.
good,A good way to gain experience and maybe move up in the company. The associate are good to work with as a team m. And many great experiences that help me progress.
good,i realy enjoyed working at ross. Everyone was joy to be around it was always a team. work was always finished on time.everyone did thier part. i would go back to work at ross again if ever the chance
good,"Very pleasant work environment thanks to the co workers."
good,"This the longest Ive been at a job, I really liked working for Ross, I advanced VERY quick. I became a Key carry MOD on duty within 6 months. The management team was supportive. Within a year I was training to be a manager. There was always chances to advance quickly. I learned a lot working for the company."
good,"I learned how to use a vocolet,and the management was good a few errors but they were minor.The workplace was real nice, had parties sometimes etc had vending machines for the break room.The hardest part of the job was nothing,The job in general seemed easy towards me only thing that probably was a little difficult was your percentage at the end of the day"
good,"I've been here for a little over a year and it's a nice place to work at times, however, there seems to be a lack of communication where someone will tell you one thing and then someone else will tell you another and you're left with trying to figure out whos telling you the right thing. Beware people will talk behind your back, but that's just a typical thing at most jobs (can never get away from that no matter where you work). You can advance very easily if you put the effort in, however, some people just don't and it shows sometimes. Overall it's a nice place to work, but there are also days where I want to walk out because of the lack of communication and organization within management."
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross for the most part. Management needs improvement, but higher up, fellow staff and supervisors were all wonderful. The pay is good at $11/hr."
good,Everyday was different always something new to do from heavy lifting to sorting boxes and also just running the item out to the shoe room for customer to view
good,It is a very respectable company that has so many ways for you to grow in the company. The job gives different ways to move up I just think I should be getting paid more for the hard work I do
good,It was a great place to work. management was not the best and they were always understaffed but if you're looking for a job to help you get on your feet ross is the place to be..
good,"Love it! Perfect to learn about management, and to help people feel safe. As well to help the company with theft. I mean it’s great helping both clients and our own work place"
good,Fast growing company where work life balance can become challenging. As an exempt employee you will be required to work many of Saturdays throughout the year and you will not be compensated for your time as a manager and above.
good,Great work team but not enough hours. I eventually resigned because of health reasons. Great store msnager and backroom manager everyone got along well
good,"a typical day at work was pretty easy going, was nothing ever too hard. for the most part it was a fun place to work...…………………...………………………………………………........"
good,"I worked at Ross Mililani , it’s a fun and fast pace part time job. Love working with co workers. Management plays favorites, morale goes down when you get few hours than others Talk to management a few times , never taken seriously."
good,"On initial application I stated I had a previous arrest. Was hired and worked for 5 months, which then was offered a promotion. Requirement for said promotion was a more extensive background check. Gave all information they asked for and then was let go from my job there. I could see maybe not giving me the promotion but to fire me from a job I'd been doing is ridiculous"
good,It was a good job don't get me wrong but managers are really lazy! If they actually help out and not have their employees do all the work maybe it would be better
good,Ross is a very busy store. You must be available to work weekends and evenings. They will work with your schedule if you can work evenings and weekends
good,"The pay wasn't good but the managers were nice and willing to work with you and your schedules.  You need to have a hard work ethic and friendly attitude.  If your not a people person, this isn't the job for you."
good,I worked at Ross for more than 8 years. I started out as a stocker and got the chance to work in all areas of the store. They are very flexible with working with your schedule and it helped when you were working at another place or going to school.
good,Good environment. Everyone was nice and willing to help if needed. I only did the maintenance for the company but it was overall a good place. The company was understanding of things when something did not get done.
good,"I loved working at Ross. They expanded my work abilities. When I started working there they taught me not only to work at a cash register, there was opportunity to bounce around different jobs in the store."
good,i enjoyed this job a lot. it was fun because it was fast paced and all the other employees were good too. it didn’t really get boring cause you always had something to do.
good,It's a good job to work at but it's not something I would stay at because I'm not wanting to work retail I want some different. If your a people person and like clothes and shoe you would be good to work there
good,This company provides great benefits to its employees however the scope for upward mobility is not good in smaller departments. There is consistency and routine within the job itself however a high turnover rate causes inconsistency within the department.
good,"Really chill place to work if you keep up with other tasks and don't let things get to far behind. Rarely had bad interactions with customers. Management at the time I worked there was great, always helped out."
good,"Ross had a great working enviorment, great staff and most of the managers were great to work with a typical day on the job was slow-paced mornings then around lunch rush we would get a long line to chop down with the help of our fast cashiers. One thing is for sure you have to be fast and remember to keep a smile on your face which wasn't hard for me because customer service is very important to me."
good,"worked during the night, so my shift was from 11 PM to 7AM. My coworkers were easily the best part of this experience- friendly, and willing to help each other with anything. The managers were pretty friendly as well, albeit strict. The slowest paced ""work"" I encountered was our first few days of orientation - it was mainly note-taking and going over safety regulations"
good,"Great culture and people, just need more hours.  Would highly recommend working here.  Fair management.  Room for promotion if you put in the effort.  Overall great place."
good,"Early morning stock room, coming in at 7:30am. Get in stock room everyone knows where they need to be. Set up the line for merchandise to come off truck and divide merchandise by location. 1in break before store opens. Get back, push merchandise to the floor. Everyone was friendly and most helped each other out. Was pregnant half way through working there and they accommodated."
good,"Typical day at work is get in and get out, fast-paced work flow with easy to follow tasks. Interacting with each customer is a must but it provides a positive environment for both employees and customers alike. I learned how to deliver the treasure to customers efficiently in an organized fashion. The hardest part of the job is working around the customers when they are in the aisles you need. Using your manners, and a simple excuse me goes a long way. The most enjoyable part as a part-timer is the short shifts. Time flies by due to moving all around the store and before you know it, the shift is over."
good,I felt like when it was busy we were pretty understaffed but always came out on top. my boss is always very understanding and easy to talk to. Closing takes too long and it is not fair.
good,My pay is ok! Only thing I wish is that I could get overtime because I have 2 babies and I’m a single father. Other than than I love my job!! Need $12
good,must move with a sense of urgency and be efficient as well.  Must be able to take constructive criticism while continuing to be energetic and customer friendly
good,"Working as a cashier/sales associate we're being timed on customer transactions and bringing the que line down, especially on a busy day."
good,I was hard worker with positive attitude to achieve goal. workplace was fast-pace and teamwork. I learned to be confident. I enjoyed the setting and flexible schedule.
good,"I've worked at Ross for 5 years now. The last 3 years have been the best experience at my job. The current management is a group of great people that really try their best to look out for you. The job itself is meh. Customers come in and can turn the store upside down. Of course, you have your rude customers but they're not common. There is a lot of manual labor such as crawling on the floor, standing for a LONG period of time (cashiers get mats, fitting doesn't), running around the store, carry clothes to fitting or to the center pad ( clothing racks). Also, don't think you applied for one position. You might work cashier one day and fitting room the next. you might get placed in the stock room too. But if you voice how you don't like certain parts they will try to keep you out of their as much as they can. Also, we get a 40% discount event twice a year I believe? normally we get 20% off of merchandise. The job tries to be cute and has blue jean, silly sock, etc. type of days. And we sometimes get food in the breakroom I believe that depends on if we passed certain things and did well in certain things like evaluation and stuff. "
good,I loved my job at Ross I worked there for 6 years and would go back given the opportunity it was just time to try something new. Other wise they're a fairly flexible company to work for and try to promote with in the company.
good,"Its and awesome career. Your always interacting with customers and always on your feet with things to do, fast past and co-workers are helpful. i enjoy it"
good,"I learnd a lot about being able to run and mange the store, how to make good decisions to help drive sales, and working with many different personalities and being able to coach everyone to have a successful team. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with a great group of people and help develop them to make them better associates. A typical day at work consists of helping in all area of the store, the registers, fitting room, sales floor, stock room, and making sure that everyone is on task and also being aware of time to make sure everyone is staying on productivity and gets their breaks."
good,Ross is a great place to use as a stepping stone to get you through college or to a permanent career. Unless you have patience and want to make Ross your career. There are only so many full time positions per store and it could take a while before you move up. But with the right management and fellow associates it is a wonderfully fun place to work.
good,"Very friendly fast paced company, new merchandise on a daily basis, everyone works as a team just overall great company to work for. promote within and training available"
good,"I normally come in at 9am. Once i clock in, i receive my keys to the store and safe. I make sure the front of the store is spotless, print the daily schedule, assign each associate a department and register. From there i give 15 minute breaks and lunches according to the time the associate began working for the day. The best part about working at Ross is the usual customers. We've built a bond that motivates me to come in each and every day to assist them. The hardest part of the job are call outs. It causes a shift in the flow but it allows me to strategically plan out the day minus a cashier or sales floor associate. I really enjoy working for Ross. The management is amazing and I've learned a lot within these years."
good,"I get paid well, but I haven't gotten many hours so far. Also, the management is pretty decent but the majority of my coworkers are not welcoming. It is good hourly pay"
good,I love my regular customers.  I know a lot of them by name.  Also by taking a management position I have learned how to prioritize and how to be a great role model.  I enjoy working with my co workers.  I try to have fun in a professional way every day so everyone enjoys being at work.  The most stress I have to deal with is making sure our daily shipments are processed and put out before the end of the day.  I very rarely have to handle an upset customer but when I do I never have an issue taking care of the situation.
good,"Overall I did enjoy working here, and the customers usually were a pleasure, the day for a front end supervisor is usually being at the front, cleaning, supervising all cashiers, sending people to their breaks and lunches and making sure the floor is covered at all times. there is never once where you dont have anything to do."
good,"While working a variety of store functions including but not limited to: loss prevention,"
good,I was nervous to join Ross. I had no idea what to expect. Everyone immediately welcomed me and made me feel at home. I can honestly say that all our groups work together in an inclusive way which allows my work to be more efficient.
good,"Cashiers work in a variety of places including supermarkets, retail stores, gas stations, movie theaters and restaurants. As a cashier you'll probably use a cash register to ring people up, take their money and give them their change and a receipt. You might also have to wrap or bag their purchase."
good,"stocking, customer service, I learned time management, the workplace was dull but an work based environment. the hardest part was working in clothing."
good,There are never enough part time hours in each week to maintain and good lifestyle to be able to pay bills or entertainment. The full time hours are roughly about 37 hours. Part time hours are about 20 hours a week.
good,"Me gusta trabajar aqui por que es un trabajo el cual me permite tener un horario fijo por las tardes, por consiguiente me permite tener un trabajo por la mañana"
good,At Ross everything was done by the book and everyone has to work as a team. If not the store becomes a mess and the store becomes chaotic. The customers i experienced were mostly friendly and the manger at the time always made sure that everyone was happy.
good,Good place to work for associates. Being a supervisor is not so fun because it's a lot of stress and long hours. I feel supervisors should be payed more money an hour.
good,This job offer more flexible hours than any job. They will work with you so that your needs are met. The train you and put the best in charge so your training is as complete and comprhesive as it can be. Every Ross is different just like every customer is different.
good,"This is a great place to work for those seeking part-time hours.  Also, great for students.  No benefits for part-timers except store discount.  I like working here."
good,Very quick paced environment. Great costumer service is a must. This job is very flexible with your hours. No overtime is given. sick days and benefits are provided for full-time employees.
good,"Ross Dress for Less was a fun and active place to work.  I help with cashiering, morning audits and putting merchandise on the floor.  While working with customers and management."
good,I like a job where there's always something to do. And you meet people from all over the world and get to see so many different cultures. The work environment is outgoing fun people
good,"Orlando, Florida   •   August 2015 to December 2015"
good,I gained the opportunity to balance large amount of cash in the registers and deposits. I also was placed on a time limit to complete my tasks which allowed me to improve my skills.
good,"We had fun when working but we got our stuff done. I was trained for stock and cashier. However, I was mostly on stock. They were very flexible with my hours knowing that I played tournament softball."
good,"good work place & enviorment to work in. Hardest part would be maybe just to customers complain about something not in our control, or how messy it can get, but overall it’s a easy, good work place and not hard at all."
good,"Perfect side job, they'll work with your schedule, really easy people to talk too. Whatever work you do it will get notice by management. And they will tell you ."
good,I enjoyed working for this company everyone was friendly and i enjoyed dealing with the customers. The Management was always good at training all the employees. I liked the fact that i was always busy and their was no lag time.
good,"Working at Ross on a Seasonal term was a very fun learning experience with room to develop. Considering that it is a very big store with many departments, it helps expand the skills needed when applying it to retail stores much smaller."
good,"You had to go above and beyond, they made you do things above your pay rate and they worked you hard. They always expect you to know everything once you hit your second week of working."
good,great place to work for a short time but friendly people to work with .hardest part is to finish your work in so little time . A little stressful team work
good,Although they have their days of Fast past and Constantly moving around throughout the store. There are still a good Days where Everyone is a happy and in good moods and that’s what makes the day go by smoothly
good,"Working with Ross was amazing due to the management willing to work with its employees. The managers at Ross will assign you shifts that you prefer, any time, any day. If you were unable to come in for your shift, they did not give you a hard time about it. A typical day at Ross would depend on your shift. for me, I worked fitting room. My work day starts by clocking in upfront and bringing returned or rejected clothes back to the fitting room. There, I would hang, organize, and put away racks of clothing to the sales floor. I would receive a 15 minute break every 2 hours, and a lunch after 5 hours. My job included allowing people into the fitting room, counting clothes as they went in and out, and putting the clothes back where they came from when rejected.  After my shift I clock out, and get checked by security before leaving. The security there is friendly and checks up with you during your shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my friendly coworkers."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Ross clothing ,the people where really different because we got people come in from all over the country. I love being the common denominator for customers."
good,"Ross dress for less, was not what I thought it was for so long I would over look them as place to apply for work . But since joining up with ross as a (Store Protection Specialist) I really cant complain at all I work in a very stress-free environment , my pay is better than most starting pays here in (Miami) , and the cherry on top I would say would have to be the people . I love the people the environment or atmosphere that they create their all so caring and together , for example and this is every morning one of the older associates makes coffee and walks thorough out the store making sure everyone gets some so their wide awake for their shift . its a completely different spin on the usual corp. world I'm use to where everyone watches your every move and is always planning on your downfall just to suck up to the boss."
good,Poor management I was seasonal management failed to let a few employees know they didn't need us anymore. I had to see I wasn't on the schedule and had to ask why. That's how I found out the job ended they didn't need people anymore.Very small space to work in your literally against the wall tagging clothes with a conveyor belt separating you from coworkers on other side of conveyor belt.
good,"For management there's many responsibilities from money handling and merchandise handing to employee scheduling and employee rewarding and dissipating. Fun, fast paced, great team players"
good,the environment was often fast paced which made the day go by fast thats how it was most days fast and busy the hours were good and got paid a reasonable amount at the end of the pay period.
good,This company offered great training and good leaders within departments. The general managers were also very in tuned to all aspects of the company. Hours were hard to get.
good,Really enjoyed working here always a place where it felt like home. Very friendly people always helping out each others and all was on the same page and worked like a team. Always a place where everyone got along with no issues made sure we provided great customer service.
good,"The management was great. it was very fast paced and mostly 1 person per department at all times. Parttime only couldn't get more than 28 hours a week, but it was enjoyable to work there."
good,"Above Average, People are great, Staff too. Discounts are great. Great Flexibility. Decent Pay. Would i work at Ross again yes if i was desperate and didnt have alot of bills."
good,"it was a normal day for me just did what I was suppose to do, Help customers with what they needed help with. I learned how to communicate with people more. The job was full with different stuff like things you might need for your house, clothes, and a lot more thing. my job wasn't really hard at all just help people and make sure people walked out the door happy with their stuff that they bought."
good,"It is very fun to work there, but depending on the area you work at will depend on how hard you have to work. As loss prevention we have to prevent any possible theft and with the regulations placed on the security, it makes this difficult task, even more difficult. Although it is a really great place to learn about customer  service and professionalism"
good,"I really enjoyed working here but the on;y thing that i hated was that my schedule was always getting edited without me not knowing about it. So some days I would show up way too early, late or not show at all because I did not know I was supposed to work. It is really fun to work all of the employees are great it is really laid back as long as get all of your work done."
good,"Ross is a fast-paced workplace with some great people. There is a system that gets everything done in a timely fashion. Everyone has their own tasks and associates aren't given more than they can handle. Overall, it's a rather great place to work in retail."
good,flows by so quickly because you stay busy. Everyone here seems friendly. The hardest part is putting up with none pleasing customers. My most enjoyable part about my job is making sure each customer leaves with a positive experience.
good,I really liked working at Ross but sometimes the management made it hard to want to work there. I had a lot of great coworkers who knew about teamwork and the managers were not always on the same level. There is no real advancement in place unless you know someone or you are someone's favorite.
good,Everyone is enjoyable to work with and all work with each other to get the jobs done that we each are assigned to. Management is awesome and easy to talk to with any concerns or issues.
good,Working for Ross was a great experience it expand my learning ethics for being a sales associate have great customer service it was never a dull moment in the store it was always sum to do
good,Its hard to put everyone in a position for success and happiness when it is such a fast-paced store. There are ways to show appreciation for all but most strategies are not allowed with the amount of work given and necessary to maintain a nice store with good sales.
good,Ross does focus on individuals career goals and promotes self development at all levels. Room for growth and advancement is achievable within the company.
good,"Its a fast paced environment it's a pretty good place to start. They are flexible with your schedule and management is good. The hours you get are okay they are always consistent rather than on the sales floor. The job is to greet customers, help with a little customer service when people ask where to find merchandise, and the main one is preventing theft which is in the job title. It is a good company to start at either on the sales floor or as a Store Prevention Specialist."
good,"In all honesty, working at Ross has helped me develop great customer service skills. They have also helped me with effectively communicate with my peers."
good,It was a great place to work until the srl wasn't correctly doing their job slowing down the stock room and crawling down my back on my hummer Time which was less than 10 minutes
good,"I enjoyed working here but when I  requested more hours It wasn’t met with my needs. It was a very fun, and a calm environment. I enjoyed who I worked with and the customer service."
good,"The TA team is probably the most diverse team in the company and it's great. Everyone is super engaging, collaborative, and supportive of your growth.  I work with a fantastic team of individuals and I get to branch off and do a ton of creative work to help attract talent."
good,"Other than being pretty understaffed, if you're like me and like being busy and up and moving, you're really enjoy this job. Management is trying pretty hard, and is usually able to work with your schedules and needs."
good,I work part time but i dont get enough hours. Its fast paced and you can advance to a manager position but overall i would work fulltime more hours and benefits.
good,I enjoyed my time at Ross Dress for Less. Management was attentive and fair. Colleagues were pleasant. Requirements were reasonable. Management was understanding and personable.
good,Working here is fun once you know what you are doing. If you are having a bad day the coworkers make it fun. Management is easy to talk to and there is room for improvement.
good,Everyone has their good and bad days but for the most part it’s a good work atmosphere theirs always help you just gotta ask for it and management is good
good,"Definiendo mi dia de trabajo en esta tienda, empieza tranquilo ya despues se vuelve un poco ajitado ya que se trata de terminar todo lo del stock room el mismo dia, dependiendo la cantidad de mercancia que llegue. En esta empreza e aprendido como tener un buen customer service, tambien e aprendido a manejar el dinero ya que hacia el Cash Office, Procesar la mercancia, entre otras cosas."
good,"It was a fast-paced workplace. We always had something to do, nothing never stayed clean for more than 5 minutes. Constantly having to hang clothes, be fast cashing people out. You always have to have a great attitude and customer service. It was a fun place to work specially when the night crew closed."
good,Ross is a good place to start off and get work experiance.  It is very easy to move up in the company if you are a hard worker.  Would recommend for someone who is trying to find work.
good,"Weekends where super busy "
good,I loved my time at Ross mainly because of the people around me including my manager she was awesome. As an SPS I was in contact with everyone in the store and I never had a problem with anyone in the 3 years I worked there.
good,"Busy, fast paced, but an awesome place to work. Store discounts are good. Good benefits and really great co-workers. Good work hours. I love talking to all the customers."
good,"People come and go pretty fast at Ross, which means someone is always being trained. It also means you wont be at the bottom of the totem pole for long."
good,"Can't Complain. The job was not bad, I liked it, however I did not enjoy cleaning up after people which is what drove me to quit. Fellow workers were nice, management as well."
good,"Co workers and work environment were perfect , they really care more bout the employee the then the customer in the sense that its not the ""customer is always right"" mindset. I only quit to concentrate on college."
good,"I would open store, process cash office than organize sales team. I'll then move on check daily sales and reports along with assist point of sales and merchandising team."
good,I worked in the morning very fun place nice people learned fast the hardest part was picking up big this great work place and management was great as well there
good,"I learned retails experience, team work, multi tasking. "
good,"Honestly loved working for ross. It was fun to be around so many outgoing people. The discounts were awesome! saved my family tons. Manager was kind of annoying, always assuming everyone was stealing."
good,"Loved working here.  Moved different spots in the store.  Lots of stocking and cleaning,  knowing where things went. Great discount on things u could buy in the store.  Management at the time was awesome."
good,The hardest part of the job for me was the register since I never worked in that position for long but other wise than that everything has been good. Learning new things has been the best thing in my opinion.
good,"This was a very good place to work at, there was a lot of work to be done and not always the needed amount of hours to get it done, but no place is perfect and this place paid well."
good,Management needs work. It's okay but don't expect much this is a good job if you need some extra cash or go to school. You will make some nice friends and have some fun while at work.
good,The day starts off slow if you have to open the store but around 1 to 2:30 is when things start to pick up. But it doesn't start to get busy until around 3 o'clock. But it is a very easy job costumers for the most part were nice but they did get an attitude when I couldn't help them.
good,"Great company although a lot of call offs from employees was a norm, Merchandising skills were a must with little supervision, Fas pace place to work."
good,"Early hours allow plenty of time to do things after work, and job security is a plus never have to worry about not having something to do, option to work more hours when possible"
good,"I like working at Ross.  My hours are good, I prefer early morning hours.  Most people are friendly and helpful.... you do have your envious and bitter people, like  every job has.  But, if your concentrate on your work and not those  people, its a good place of employment."
good,"All the employees are nice and fun to work with. Everybody is always on task, doing what they are supposed to be doing. The managers are always checking to make sure everything is going good in the store."
good,Overall I would love to work here again or any ross for that matter. I just hope they work with people and there times that they are available thank u.
good,"The job was good, it paid weekly and the minimum, anyone looking for a stable job with career advancement would love working there. Very safe and friendly environment."
good,"Always be on time and have integrity.Stay focused, Stay to yourself , working is not a time to have fun it's a place to make money and always remember there is always someone ready to take your spot."
good,It is a good work place if retail is your career choice and if it is not then it is still a good work place environment. Management is very understanding and will work with you about any issues.
good,"ross has some interesting rules that are difficult to get used to, but once you learn to comply to the ""ross way"" there is no problems working there. the management team at my store was supurb and gave plenty of time to adapt to the way they do business"
good,"The manager's were willing to work with my complicated schedule due to being in college, I loved the people working there and it wasn't too much work, sometimes I even had time to be able to do my homework in the break room"
good,The customers at my Ross store made working at the company very enjoyable. I met some great people and had a great time assisting customers while working with the company.
good,Working at Ross dress for less was fun and exciting. Meeting new people was always fun and interesting. I got alone well with the associate and the mangers. The pay was good to
good,"I felt very involved with the company and the welcomed. The only problem I had working here was the lack of available hours to work (outside of holiday hours). If you stay with the company for a year, there is room for advancement to full-time and a slight raise; however, staying there permanently was not an option for me."
good,"nice managers, nice and fordable clothes the prices were amazing and everyone were very nice the schedules were flexible and the manager was also nice enough to help with everything."
good,"I enjoyed working for Ross, wish I was chosen to stay by the manager but we had a surplus of people and I was chosen to be let go. It's fast paced and an enjoyable experience."
good,I liked my job and only left due to relocation. We all worked as a team and I just hate they didn't have a position where i relocated or else i would have transferred
good,I enjoy working there. I get along well with the staff and management. Everyone is very helpful when needed. I like how they work with your schedule to try and work with you
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is communication with customer, because I like to help the customers with their needs and also make sure each customer feel welcome every time when they walk to the door."
good,It is a very good place for retired people or students who are looking for a part time job. I think the people in the stock room should be paid higher because they do harder work like harder labor like lifting boxes and it is very tiring compared to the people in the sales floor.
good,I started as a sales associate and quickly moved up to FES front end supervisor. It's a fast paced environment but it makes your shift go by fast. I met a lot of nice people.
good,"This was a good place to work ... start off at 9 .. always looking to promote from within the company. Does not pay so well compared to the workload that they give you as a manager. As an associate, 9.00  was cool."
good,"I enjoyed working Ross, however the store manager at the location that was employed wasn't very pleasant to work for, she is no longer there now. The pay also could have been a bit better but overall it's a pretty good company and I would recommend to others, I have recommended to others."
good,"There is a lot of great things at Ross Dress for Less, I like everything there is a lot to buy there, great quality of work and good personnel I recommend Ross."
good,"Challenging, fast paced, great coworkers, nice breaks, alright management, nice parking, face to face interaction with customers, problem solving, money handling,"
good,Management was fair. Everyone who worked there worked well as a team. It was a fun environment to work in because your co-workers and management got along well and worked well together.
good,working at ross was fun enjoyed doing my job and helping customers the best I could. they only needed to have more employees. they also needed to raise the salary up more
good,"It was a fun place to work..always something to do. I didn't mind fast paced, even being pregnant, I enjoyed the workout. I think people should be paid more though, for the multiple jobs we do while on duty."
good,"fun place to work"
good,"I actually enjoyed working at Ross Dress 4 Less. It was an easy job, but it, unfortunately, does get bored quickly. I was tasked to put alarm chip to shoes every single day. Other than that, the team members were fun to work with."
good,"Its a great company to work for. Good managing skills, working in a fast paced environment as well. This company is well known for having great employees"
good,"cool work environment, moderate paced. managers arent often on the same page but a good experience overall. would recommend job to young adults looking to gain experience in retail"
good,"Working at Ross is an enjoyable experience because you can work at your own pace and it is systematic. It teaches you great qualities as an independent worker as well as working within a team. I am a part of stock team, so a typical work day includes preparing for truck, unloading the truck in a timely manner, distributing products on the sales floor, and organizing excess product in the back. Lastly working with my coworkers is a joy. I am working with all ages and it gives a sense of wisdom and youthfulness."
good,At Ross I have learned a lot of things from co workers that have helped me in life itself. I’ve made some good friends and can’t complain about the work environment. The people I work with are all entertaining and it’s never a issue. I just don’t feel the work is worth the pay.
good,"I enjoy workind at Ross. Its fun and fast-paced, there are rarely any slow days because we are the busiest location on the island. Also, the people I work with are friendly and enjoyable to work with, everyone is part of a team and we work together to get the job done right."
good,Every day every one of the associates would have to do something called START which was we had our own section to check and make sure everything was organized like its suppose to. The management was awesome and helpful.
good,working at ross was a fun and stress free place to work in. I enjoyed Helping customers with a variety of different things. I also like the fact that everyone was a team player..
good,A typical day is complete daily cash office duties and then proceed to stockroom to process the days truck. The most enjoyable part of job is seeing new items first hand. We work short shift of 4 to 6 hours per day. We also get timely merit wage increases and chance to advance.  I have worked there a year and have received two wage increases which amount to one dollar more than I started at.
good,Ross Distribution was a fast paced environment. i enjoyed co workers. at times we would be at a holt in our areas less they had one other to move us to.
good,"very easy job, fun environment. fast paced., sometimes slow paced depending on position. over all great. ............................................."
good,"It is what you make it. Started off working stock quickly made it up to management. Lots of room to grow and learn. Co-workers become family. Free food, decent pay, transfer to other stores that need the help (there is always someone looking for help). Put in time, work your way up the ranks amd it can be rewarding. It gets busy and hectic and everyone is out to get their tasks done but at the end of the day it's one for all and all for one."
good,"Everyone is nice, managers and co-workers are all willing to help. You get the necessary training for your position. Pay is fair, but can sometimes be boring at the job."
good,"Very overwhelming, busy, high volume store with lack of footage."
good,"All the Employees are very kind to one another, guiding the way for the new recruits. The Managers are always willing to listen to any requests you may have or if you would just like to discuss something."
good,The job itself was cool. Nothing too difficult. The only bad thing I would say is the management is not good. This is why a lot of people leaving including myself.
good,"ross keeps you busy at every moment and always have something for you, its a very occupied store and the management was good constantly checked up on you"
good,"This was a part time employment for me, and I really enjoyed it. The management needed a little help here and there, but otherwise it was a great place to work. Employees were very nice and demonstrated excellent team work."
good,"They need to pay the management better,they are not consistent of their rules and regulations,they tend to have more favoritism.Need to hire more associates."
good,unload truck then separate into different aisles then also but security devices on products the required them then take the carts that have products onto the floor the stock the area
good,i worked the night shift at ross.  the work was not bad but the blue chip was hard to get right. i was around 80 percent on blue chip.  the job was a tempory position and the training was free.
good,"Good company, but only part time hours available to most.  Nice people to work with and decent management.  Customers drive you crazy with having to constantly clean up after them, but it's a job."
good,"Ross Dress for Less has great opportunities for growth and development, Great People to work with and great benefits, even for part-time associates. Not to mention, the discount."
good,"Always stay on top of your game "
good,"I answered customer service questions on the floor and on the phone, cashiered, LRT usage price change, rolled out new inventory and put those into the proper locations, and put away go back merchandise from customer service."
good,"Easy to work at ross , they work with your schedule if you have another job or go to school. Friendly environment , training is easy and fast to learn . ross is a save place to work at ."
good,I've worked in four different Ross and each of them basically had the same type of managers (1 main manager and 3 assistant managers). There's the one with super uptight but is understanding and caring. There's the one that's super uptight because they can be and like to make you angry. There's the one who's pretty laid back and nice but still gets the job done. Lastly there's the one who somehow became a manager for no outstanding reason at all and is rude. Each Ross I've been at has these managers and the whole flow of the workplace depends entirely on which type is the main manager (in my opinion).
good,"I would definitely recommend this job to anyone especially first time workers. It is a very laid back environment. Everyone is treated fairly. "
good,"I loved working on fast paced work place. The conditions of work place was not always great,but you were working with vet loyal people. The hardest part of a job was making company's goals."
good,"Constantly busy, always something to do. Fast paced environment.  Friendly environment, great co-workers.  Open door policy and the hours flexible. Management is very understanding when emergencies happen. Just an overall  good working environment."
good,"Great job. Everyday there is work to do and money to make. Lots of people, so there is a good chance you will meet a friend or two on the job. Good management."
good,"work was hectic during the holiday season "
good,"overall the experience I had was positive. Its definitely a job where you have to be quick on your feet. The store I worked at had alot of people coming in at a time, so things could get a tad hectic, but still managable and fun"
good,Being able to work at ross has helped me gain a tremendous amount of customer service experience. Since my main duties while working at ross were front end supervisor it really aided in the process of becoming the best customer service person i could be.
good,Working in the stock room for 3 plus years I felt I learned things about retail I never knew. how to process retail store stuff for sales is not for everybody. Its hard and fast work but the rest of the store employees know who makes the store go.
good,Meet some great people while working at Ross. Got to be able to have returning customers that were satisfied with customer service. Learned to think quick to solve multiple situations.
good,Ross was my first job and I worked part time. It is a pretty decent job once you learn the flow of things; the training was also easy and my shifts usually flew by.
good,I really like this company. The quick advancements decent pay and laid back feel. Pluse the blue chip.. Extra bonus pay for the individuals who work above and beyond the requirements. Over a good stable job.
good,Managers show favoritism. Work place is messy as far as the people . They act more like friends than managers . Talk about employees amongst eachother.
good,Each day at Ross is a new experience. The company gives chances in learning more and more activities. Its a great opportunity to get involve in new activities to take with in and show others.
good,I worked in the stock room. It was a good experience. The managers were mostly fair. Extra opportunities to get some extra hours if you need them. Not stressful. Great job when you're a teenager looking for some extra money.
good,A typical day was greet customers smile so they may feel welcomed   I learned communication is important so writing clear and concise summaries of daily activity was vital. The employees was phenomenal  they had great customer service skills the workplace culture was gripping and tough everything had to be in order. Enjoyable part of the day is when I was able to solve problems that would occur during my shift. The hardest part was being in many places at any given time.
good,"a day working at ross is like a normal day at the store.i have learned a lot from stock room and sales associate,the management is not perfect ut is decent not to stressful , nothing is hard at this jo everything is easy"
good,Friendly and fast learner. I also am flexible with my time and willing to challenge my professional limitations. I am a team player and always strives for perfection and success.
good,I'm a natural hard worker so hands on tasks would be more ideal for me. Most companies i've been apart of would same I'm a fast Learner with a Benign Manner. The most enjoyable thing about work to me is knowing that my son would be taking care of.
good,I was a part of the first group to get hire for this location so it was fun opening a new store with people. The other employee were all great people and management was also amazing.
good,"Great place to work. Fun environment and the management was great. Pay could have been better, but this was a great place to work. The only down fall was the customers disorganization."
good,My typical day at work is set my a check list of to do's and follow up items from the day before. What I have learned most is making sure that you get the most out of your people. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone is doing their part effectively so that the entire team can function properly. If the freight is heavier than predicted and an associate calls out then everyone has to work all the harder. The most enjoyable part is taking care of the customer with all that goes on in a given day.
good,"Though I loved my job, unless it was the holiday season, employees were never scheduled more that eight to twelve hours a week. The chance of advancement was minimal."
good,Have to meet a 75% requirement. Usually have to work fast pace all work day. Management is nice and not rude at all. Management is not usually on us every second. They treat us like adults.
good,"If you have the right stuff and the drive, this is a great place to work and grow. Ross is a typical retail environment and you must have great time management and developmental skills to succeed. If you juggle expertly, you will find the job and processes easy. Any hesitation and the typical retail bug will bite you (payroll, turnover, truck processing and store standards)."
good,Overall good place to work. Pay and benefits are fantastic. Training is very good the company invest in their people. You will work hard and are held accountable
good,good workers all working well as a team. enjoy the atmosphere and the rules that each department upholds. i enjoy working as a loss prevention agent in the Ross distribution center
good,"Work full 40 hrs a week with over time hours from the months of September through December for holidays. Possibke ahit down days from January to June. Holiday dinner in December, and associate appreciated in week yearly."
good,"-Coaching and training and providing customer service and preventing theft."
good,"I love my job here at Ross. I worked all the way from a seasonal employee to a manager in under two years. The staff always ends up being fun and outgoing, the management is kind and take their jobs seriously. The store is always clean and the employees take pride in their store."
good,"Ross offers lots of help for there employees, they give a decent discount and have benefits. However the pay isn't the best and they could work harder on making sure the pay is equivalent to the work that is done."
good,"I started out as just setting up the stores then got hired on fulltime the managers trained me for all parts of the store  ,I went from full time associate to management in less than a year the company was very detailed on what they wanted and how it was going to look"
good,"Just not for me, good place to work though. Benefits are very good, and the discount is even better. 20% off and three times a year you get 40% off also."
good,"Ross Stores is an incredibly difficult yet fun environment to work in. Depending on how big the store is will judge how much work you will do, otherwise being part of Ross Stores gave me an amazing experience i wouldnt trade for anything."
good,"I enjoyed working in the stock room. It was fast paced, consistent, and the people in the stockroom were very helpful, friendly, and nice. I enjoyed helping unload the truck. Separated the items, tagging and hanging clothes to be put on the floor. Than putting the products on the store floor."
good,"I enjoyed opening the store, and getting the things in their perspective.  Management was friendly and honest, I can say i saw things great from the start. The hardest part of the day, would be returns, because i like organizing things.  My experience learned and earned at Ross. Resolver."
good,"A great place to work at. Through hard work the advance opportunities are there . I started as a Area Supervisor and became a general Store manager within 1 year of Service. What I learned through out the years , I been able to apply at other jobs."
good,This work place has helped me improve my communication and social skills. We deal with about a 500+ costumes a day it is necessary to be open to customers because no matter what and requires giving quick and reasonable answers. I enjoy the company of my co-workers they are all great people who I enjoy working with no matter what and it allows me to gain several connections towards what I need for my next job.
good,Assisting customers with merchandise. Having an Good recovery at night when closing the store. Maintaining good customer service skills. Working well with others
good,It's a good place to work people are friendly managers are very helpful. Everything g is nice and organized and easy to find. I just couldn't keep up with the work hours because of my children.
good,"Es muy buena empresa, el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno."
good,Job was fun and worked with really fun crew. With this company it really depends on where your store is located you can have a really nice one with good customers or a bad location with really bad customers that destroy your store daily. The work is easy and it is fast paced.
good,"Excellent working environment, with excellent benefits and at times flexible when it was necessary, will work with the associate and provide additional training and tools to make yor job work."
good,Ross is a great place to work and I get to meet new people every time I work. I also like that there are great deals in the store for everyone.  The people that I work with are great people who enjoy working there too. There is great music that fills the air and people enjoy it- customers and the staff.
good,The enviroment is no different from any other retail establishment. There are some bonuses. An associate is choosen every month for employee of the month and is awarded $50. The company also awards small scholarships to employees and close family members.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the new merchandise that has come in from stock and in jewelry, and  also the clearance in the different departments."
good,"This was my first job and everyone was very friendly. Managers were cool. They tried their best to work with your schedules, but would sometimes fall short. Most of my time on the weekends felt like they were understaffed and would be a mess by the end of the night. Most of the problems working here was the customers, they would expect way too much from the employees. They would let their kids run around like its a park, people that steal bunches of items,people trying to get a discount, and drunk people that come in yelling and trashing items. In conclusion, this job did help me with time management and how to deal with people of all backgrounds. (Working here kind of reminded me of high school.)"
good,Loved Ross because of my customer.  I love it was a fast environment.  All my Ross teammates.  And also the clean environment.
good,"When I got hired at Ross I was expecting your typical minimum wage job with no appreciation, but I was wrong. I came into the job having previous terrible experience with another company. However, they started me off at a higher pay rate of $9.00 an hour. They are surprisingly organized for a discount store. The management is focused on developing associates for higher positions and I was a part of the recruitment program for future managers when I was promoted. I got to learn a lot about managing a store with multiple departments, and had goals that needed to be met which changed a lot. As far as management and co-workers, it really depends on the store itself how the management is running it. I started off at a training store location as a seasonal associate. Everyone was very organized and knew what was expected of them throughout the day. The store I transferred to however was a very different experience. The management was and still is going through its own issues, being part of that team I know quite a lot that I will not disclose here, but it got unhealthily frustrating. The store was very disorganized, nobody was on the same page, and there was a lot of drama, even from the management itself which I feel is unacceptable. Overall though I would definitely recommend Ross as your next ""job"" or even a career opportunity. I enjoyed my time there and would love to go back in the future if I ever need to. They focus on promotions and recognize hard work. It's an easy job with great possibilities."
good,Typical day at work goes by pretty fast. Ive learned many differet things. Management is okay. Co workers are fun. Nothing hard about job and i enjoy my work at ross
good,"I worked at Ross for about 3 years, i enjoyed working and growing as an employee, and becoming a manager, it was a fast paced job  and i definitely learned a lot about leadership and managing. I'm very customer focused and is very likely to work in any other company that is customer focused."
good,"Great for place to work if you're just out of high school. Great discounts, management and very flexible hours. Nothing hard about this job. It's all simple and very easy to learn"
good,It's a pretty repetitive job that can get a little boring if the store isn't busy. The coworkers are relaxed and nice. The managers are good people to work with.
good,"Although Ross stores are much harder to maintain than other discount department stores, the work environment is great and the company really cares about their employees. The pay is reasonable starting out as well."
good,"Not my first choice, but it's okay. The managers do not communicate well and corporate changes there mind all the time. The hardest part of the job is trying to straighten up the sales floor and get merchandise out in a timely manner."
good,"I love working at Ross but at this time their is no room for advancement and I am ready to move up . I am wanting to move to Durango Co. They are planning to build a Ross there but when it will be built keeps changing. "
good,good start up jobs give opportunity to move up in management and try new positions. supervisors and management are nice
good,"Pretty good management and work-life balance. However, at times there are many instances when the store is under-staffed."
good,Eventful place to work. Store is always busy and there is always something to do. Friendly environment and customer service isn't as bad as people would think.
good,I work with a great team and we all work hard to keep the store great and the customers happy.  It takes a great team of people to have a great business!
good,"I enjoy going to work and being able to help customers find there treasures. Thats the most fullfillling part, making my customers happy. This month is my 10 year anniversary..."
good,"Is a great enviroment to work"
good,"What's to say that my review stars don't say. There are far worse places and mildly better places to work. It's a good company with some issues when it comes to technology and honest management decisions. The atmosphere is nice, and the workers in my experience were pleasant...upper management is a bit unbalanced and the asset protection division is a bit off but other than that it's a good company worth recommending to anyone who is looking for a stable place to work."
good,"just do your work and have great customer service skills! you go in do your assigned work which is written down so you dont have to forget, friendly co worker and nice management. Overall a great work experience"
good,"Rising up to succeed all expectations, organizing all sales floor merchandise, engaging with customers when entering and leaving the store, operating cash register efficiently, delivering great service. Coworkers are productive and focused on making customers smile. The Hardest part about working at Ross is that you work a lot harder than expected but it's worthwhile if you build customer relationships. The most enjoyable part is exceeding all your limitations and growing in the company."
good,"The company is willing to cooperate with you to create a schedule that fits both parties needs."
good,"Typical work day smooth "
good,"It is a good place with nice coworkers. I am having a good time working here, the manager is very social and understanding."
good,This job was very fun at the location I worked however I transferred with them to another state and did not like the job. It may have just been the people I worked with that made the second experience bad.
good,"In the minimum of minimum wage work opportunities, Ross: Dress For Less still provided a very attractive training program which covered every systematic step in the warehouse, cashiering, security, management, stocking, dress room, and opening and closing procedures. There was not a stone left unturned in their training program which I found very appealing."
good,I work with great people who are very helpful when I need them. The management team cares about all of the employees and their well being.
good,"a typical day at work is very hectic and a bit annoying when management isn't clear with instructions"
good,"It was fun working here, I was a teenager then so I didn't have a problem with working a few hours a week. I learned how to work behind a register and clear the line quick. I didn't have a problem at all. Closing time was fun, there was a lot of clothes everywhere but it was good working fast and on your own."
good,"customers were there more often at month end they tried to steel and some were cought ,management was good to their wokers"
good,It can get crazy and it can get boring. I think its a easy job and you meet great people and discounts on items. They work well with school and give good benefits.
good,"In a normal day I arrived and check in what area i had to be, fitting room was always crazy because there was not enough people working at sales floor so there was not enough people to come and take away the clothes to the floor. Working at the sales floor and cashier it wasn't that bad."
good,"Productive and fun workplace to work at with vending machines. Also, many eating places around. Management do not know how to control their workers at times."
good,"mulit task,it's always busy,working with others an trying to get the job,being organized provide customer service to others"
good,"I always know what I am going to be doing as soon as I get to work. We have a clipboard with everyone's shifts, break times and duties. If I ever do have a question it is immediately answered. Management has been the reason why I have felt comfortable working here. They know how to maintain the store and the employees. My coworkers are friendly and helpful. I haven't had any issues with anyone it's the opposite everyone has been helpful whenever I need assistance. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with recovery during busy times but it's not impossible and totally doable. The most enjoyable part of my job is greeting customers and giving good customer service also problem solving is very rewarding to me personally."
good,"It was a fun environment, deal with  a lot of customers. Well i was hired during holiday season, it was pretty fun. I was pretty much on the floor hardly at the cashier, i also did customer service where some customers give you a hard time when you tell them what can be return or not return."
good,"Since the first day i started it was busy, i always had to be on point and a fast worker. Once you would be done working in one place, right away you have to ask were to go next. Since customers can be messy we always had to organize the same things maybe more than five times at a time. But, out of all the chaos in the store a lot of the co-workers are very nice, a few people here or there were rude but luckily you wouldn't see them often."
good,"usually busy days, ive learned customer service and how to use a cash register better. my co workers are amazing! the hardest part is probably dealing with rude customers"
good,"There is room for advancement. Sometimes the company over hires and there is very little hours to go around. There is job security, and it is a good idea as someone's first job."
good,"Fun work place,supportive management ,great benefits  overall Ross was an awesome place to work.The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other employees."
good,"Loved working out there, all the management and staff were awesome, I just never could see myself moving up in the ladder personally, maybe you could. Who knows."
good,Fun and easy place to work. The managers and employees are very understanding and properly train you. The only problem is that if you are new you will mostly get night shifts and you can't leave until everyone finishes their department.
good,"wish it paid more for the duties that needs to be done."
good,"You can start from the very bottom at Ross, but if you can show the management that you have the right attitude and you're a reliable worker and within perhaps a year or even sooner, opportunities will be given to you and you could get very far in the company. Overall, my experience there was good and I have very little to complain about. If you're someone who is starting to apply for jobs, start here. With the right mindset, you can achieve much in this company."
good,"The best part about working for Ross was the work was fast paced to keep me motivated and kept me on my toes, for as long as it lasted. Often the days I worked were cut short and they could not afford to keep me on for five hours at a time. It reached a point eventually where they stopped putting me on the schedule for three to four weeks at a time, possibly more, and for someone who was trying to establish roots in the work environment in California, it was very disappointing and discouraging for me as an employee. I sometimes did not feel like a member of a team or a family as I felt at Walmart, and I did not feel like I was all that appreciated. If I was, it was not shown. The lack of consistency in organization at Ross drove my brain to distraction, but perhaps I was more used to the more rigid organization of Walmart, and perhaps it was not Ross' fault. This would be a good starter experience for someone who wants a light retail experience, as long as you don't expect too much. This is my personal experience there, and may not reflect the opinions of others."
good,very flexible and friendly place to work especially for college students. Also very big on reconition and promoting within the company.
good,Cared about their employees but some more so than others and liked to show favorites. Upper management was very snobby and rude to the every employee that wasn’t either an Assistant Store Manager or a Store Manager.
good,"As Front End Supervisor my day consisted of greeting customers, and managing the purchases/returns/phone calls/etc...Management was driven but friendly, hardest part of the job would be the difficult customers but our amazing managers handled them, most enjoyable part would be my lovely coworkers."
good,"I learned how to make deposits & till out the cash drawers. Management was very helpful & supportive."
good,If it was not for the interaction with people this job would not be good but the people you work with daily make it enjoyable.
good,"If you are a hard worker at this company, the management will take notice and offer advancement! The co-workers were all very friendly and it was a positive experience to work there."
good,I worked at Ross during high school. It was very balanced. It was easy too maintain school & work. Customers were very nice. I enjoyed the atmosphere .
good,"Because of how Ross merchandised it's product, it allowed for more creativity with merchandising products. I learned more of the bottom line of sales. It also full-filled my borderline OCD tendencies , as there was no set layouts for merchandise."
good,Began w clocking in then going to line to sort shoes by styles and sizes as boxes come down line. The thing about this company is that they values the employees by serving free lunch to them on each Friday. They even offered voluntary overtime.
good,My job here was very pleasant. I got to learn many new things and meet new people. I made sure to clear the stock room and clean the floor of all clothing or other items. The management was very helpful and understanding.
good,"Good place to work always on the go. My first retail job , i learned a lot here, caught on quick and became an important member of the team"
good,"- 40 hr week"
good,We all worked hard but everyone made working at Ross a pleasure. We drive 100% customer service. I learned responsibility and patience.
good,"Fast, fun, and friendly environment. I like working at Ross because I can manage my time wisely by scheduling my availability ahead of time."
good,"Very structured company and, handles business very well. At Ross we all have one goal and that is to satisfy the customers in any and every way we can. We all work very well together, the hardest part of the job is not knowing just how busy you will be that particular day."
good,Great place to start working if you are looking for an easy job. Employees are very friendly. You work in all different parts of the store so you never get bored doing one thing.
good,I  think  retail workers deserve the respect that  is  not  given. Most people are underpaid and they deserve more money then  they are paid.
good,"Management is fun, friendly"
good,great job! love it . Managers are really cool . only thing everything is part time no benefits but overall great company to work for.
good,"Retail always has it's ups and downs and you definitely experience all of them when working for Ross. I really liked a lot of the people I worked with. I enjoyed all the discounts on merchandise and I really, really like the management at my location. You get a pay raise every year which was nice and you can also work your way up. They also offer rewards and school grants and such which is super cool. They also have 15 minute breaks instead of the legally required 10 minute ones, and you depending on the length of your stay, you ge more breaks which are spread out evenly and really help your shift flow well. Lastly, they're very willing to work with your schedule and also let you get time off."
good,"This is the first job I've ever had that I actually enjoyed going into. When I started, they were very flexible and understandable.Since Ross is a fairly popular store, we have many customers, which means many messes. 75% of an average workers day is straightening and cleaning up. It makes time pass by quickly, however it can be slow at times. When working the dressing rooms, there isn't much to do. You cannot leave for a long period of time, because the customers have to wait on you. It does get boring after an hour just standing there, and checking in customers into fitting rooms."
good,This is a great job to have in retail. The benefits are good if you choose to get them The discount on the merchandise is also a good thing. the work environment is good.
good,"I ended up meeting some of my best friends working there. There was always something to do, organizing clothes, and unloading the truck, fixing clothes."
good,Staff was fun and helpful. The manager is awesome really great guy. I was and the sales floor looking after customers. The staff also work together to get the job done.
good,"I was hired to stock an empty store and get it ready for opening day.  The work was repetitive and time consuming but organized and rewarding.  It was busy but all the employees worked fast and hard to achieve the desired outcome.  Management worked closely and tirelessly to instruct, motivate and keep us on track.  It was a good feeling to have accomplished the opening on schedule."
good,"I work over nights, therefore a lot of the time I am responsible for stocking inventory in a timely manner. Over all a good company to work for."
good,"Ross is a pleasant company to work for, they respect the employees needs, and recognize talents."
good,On a regular day I go into work before the store opens to do my cash office duties. After that I speak with my manager to get assigned a job for the rest of the day such as cashier or ticketing clothes. All of my co-workers are great and fun to work with.
good,schedules were changed once a week you had to come into the store to log on computer to check schedule not able to check from home internet.some overtime was mandatory without notice.
good,"Cross-perform in all assigned areas to make sure that merchandise sizing, ticketing and presentation are to company standards."
good,My job duties included preparing the customer service booth for business by stocking it with supplies. I actively directed associates to specific duties or locations in the store as i thought fit according to company policies and standards. Other than that i helped customers with their purchases and returns of merchandises. What i learned during my time at Ross was how to help customers in most aspects of the Retail world. My co-workers were fun to work with and always willing to follow guidelines set by me or my manager. The hardest part of the job was to develop the skills required to ace that job but with time it because relatively simple and easy.
good,"Between the sales floor, the customer service desk, the stockroom, and the managers' office, there is always something to do.  The holiday season is expected to be more hectic, but management and colleagues have proven to be supportive, approachable, and knowledgeable."
good,As an Assistant manger I had varying responsibilities and learning opportunities.
good,"Managing employees"
good,"A typical day usually starts by punching in and getting started with my start assignment which is sizing in any area of the store and from there I am called to wherever it is I am assigned to work that day, i.e register, sales floor, fitting room or stock room. My co workers are laid back yet hard workers who get the job done when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the people I'm surrounded with each day. They make the days go by faster and are fun to be around."
good,"Worked 10 hours 10 days a week. The Co-Workers were easy to get along with, the hardest part of the job was working under very hot conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,Good company to work if you want to follow a career with the company
good,"•	Staff supervision."

good,"•	Display signage for products and sales promotions according seasonal changes"
good,"Great environment- enjoy co-workers across all levels."
good,"Ross is a fun place to work with a team of strong managers.  Also, I enjoyed interacting with co-workers.  The job I had was physically demanding and required a great deal of lifting!"
good,"Security comes very easy, you just observe and report and do your daily patrols."
good,"The work environment was very team oriented and fun to work in.  The management was supportive of all of the employees and encouraged team effort and provided productive support to the staff of employees, especially during the very busy season."
good,"Ross Inc. is a great organization to work for. They motivate you to attain higher goals.  My customer service skills were challenged and polished through different situations. The management trusts me to adapt to new situations by placing me in different areas of the workplace. A typical day at work consists of me getting the objective for the start of my shift from the managers.  I typically recieve constant updates as to where my help is needed throughout the day.  I can start anywhere from the front end or customer service to the stock room and sales floor.  This helped me to learn how to adapt to my surroundings in a changing environment while always putting the customer's needs in as the first priority.  I am usually the person who is called to help both customers and co-workers in the store which makes for a very friendly work environment.  The hardest part of the job would be trying to keep busy.  There are times where there is not enough tasks to complete.  However, the most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly staff and flexible hours."
good,I started as an associate and less than a year I was given an opportunity as a trainer and eventually worked myself to become a HR Administrative Clerk
good,"I have learned a lot while working with this company.  The best part is the people you meet,  You must have the ability to adapt if you work in the production part of the DC, because you may need to work in other areas other that your home department."
good,"On a typical work day, the motion of things was very fast-paced.  I learned a lot about customer service, and management was always helpful. Honestly, I got along with everyone I worked with."
good,I love being of assistance to not only my fellow co-workers but also are treasured customers as well. A typical day at work is quite fun and exciting.
good,"I love retail and management, this place was very challenging, but I was good at it. It's location in the city lead to less than honest people, customers as well as employees."
good,The team at Ross made working there a breeze. They helped one another and showed everyone how a team should be run. No one was ever treated unfairly and management had meetings to keep the cycle running smoothely.
good,A typical day at Ross starts by speaking with the manager to know what needs to be done for your shift as well as other areas that could be taken care of.  Management is great because they are always there to help.
good,loved the management I loved my hours I just couldnt back to my job after having my son
good,"a typical day at work was coming in pulling a palate jack or cart full of Ross's merchandise and sorting it in to individual boxes to be shipped to individual stores. i learned how to use a bar code scanner and i also learned that hard work at work dose pay off, because of blue chip. management was good they just expected what was asked of you and my co-workers were friendly. the hardest part of the job was standing up the entire time but thats just work its expected. the most enjoyable part was when they gave all of the employees and extra 30 minutes of break and cooked for us."
good,I have worked here for years and I have perfected my customer service here. I've learned how to please people and make strong friendships with all my team members. Fairy mellow place to work outside of holiday season.

good,Stand at the  cashier stand and take money for close from customer.
good,"My review of Ross is never a dull moment. I am always working, either making sure my department is nice and organized and doing projects in my department. The management is great. I get along very well with all of my managers and supervisors. Since working at Ross I have not found anything hard it the job and what I enjoy about my job is working with customers."
good,"Challenging to keep up throughout the day. Not all stores are equal. Depending on the area, some stores are easier to work at than others. In my area, it was definitely the most challenging to keep the store tidy. Alot was asked of employees and compensation was poor."
good,"one must be able to keep up with demands of customers/"
good,Ross Dress for Less is a flourishing company. The company assists with every associates growth and development enabling individuals to grow within their profession and the company. I've learned the importance of leadership and working with co-workers ensuring that we provide our customers with great customer service and a pleasant shopping experience. The hardest part of my job is encouraging associates to stay positive and be productive during seasonal times of the year. The most enjoyable part of my job has been developing  team players to work fast and efficiently while creating a fun and stimulating work atmosphere.
good,I enjoyed helping the customers. my coworkers were great and we worked well together as a team. the hardest part of the job was putting the store back together at night. the most enjoyable part of the job was all of the people I met from so many different backgrounds.
good,I love working here. The environment is so friendly. The only downside is the very little pay. I would like a higher pay.
good,"I was a temp for 2 months, but I left because I didn't like the job very much. The supervisors were nice and so were my co-workers, but just wasn't the place for me."
good,Ross has a great business model. Manager's typically are doing line level employees work or ringing on the registers.
good,The hardest part of the job is to not shop while on the clock. Managers are amazing and the customers will give you a reason to smile.
good,ross was a great place to work. the managers and supervisors were very easy to talk and very down to earth. they work with you regarding family and personal issues.

I learned most of my Store Manager skills while working at Ross, and how to put together a great team of Managers and staff. I really enjoyed working with my team throughout all of my years working for this company and I have to say that the hardest part of my job was saying goodbye. I am very dedicated in the development of my Assistant Store Managers, Supervisors and staff that the most enjoyable part of my job were the promotions of the team."
good,"The daily tasks are not unreasonable, or too difficult. The management is very easy to talk to and is understanding of employees problems. The management works just as hard or harder then the underclass employees."
good,"A typical day at work is setting up for the truck. Going threw boxes and organizing and shorting them in there designated areas. Making sure that all the items are out and stock room is clean before you leave. I have learned that working together as a team is the best way to get things done faster and easier. Our Management has always been there to answer any question we have and to help us if we are short handed or in need of help. My co-works are always willing to help in every way they can. The hardest part of the job is not know if you will have time to get everything out in time. it puts a lot of stress on the co-works but we always seem to come together and get the job done right. The most enjoyable part of the job is working together as a team, when everyone comes together to get things done. "
good,A normal day in Ross is very pact with many customers and full of energy. I've learn to keep calm with angry customers and how to communicate with the customers. My managers were professional they did their job. My co-workers were the best they did their job and were very friendly with the customers. The hardest part was the recovery. I go to school so when I closed we had to stay late recovering. The most enjoyably part of my job was meeting new people everyday.

good,"Even though I was hired as a temporary merchandiser but Ross has been one of my favorite places to work. The schedule was great and allowed to me to work my other job at night. The workload was pleasing because I like to be active while at work. If I wasnt unloading a freight truck, I was sorting and separating freight, working a cart assigned to a department and/or assisting a customer. I really enjoyed the diversity in the workplace and meeting the many customers that shopped who came from all walks of life."
good,After clocking in I go to the stock room help unload truck and then run the carts then go home.
good,i learned to process all incoming shipment to be assorted and placed at required departments. and to ensure all merchandise is processed at a timely matter. so that everything is to be completed before next shipment arrives. and to also work in a fast paced enviroment with little to no pressure
good,"Greet customers, collect payment for merchandise, my co-workers are great. My current job is fun and fast past. I would like to have more hours, looking for a full time postion."

good,"a typical day included customer service, answering phones, go- backs, sorting, pricing, returns"

Everyday is a learning process especially about the fashoin and that's another thing I love about the job. Fashion is always enjoyable."
good,"Almost every day was a busy day the good thing about it was my shifts always went by quick. I learned a great deal of knowledge about customer service and the register. The management team was great never really had any complaints. My employees were very friendly and always wanted to lend a helping hand if needed. The hardest part of the job some times was standing for great periods at a time, and the the most enjoyable part of this job was getting rewarded for all the hard work."
good,"fun place to work nice customers, employees were helpful management was very organized"
good,"Opening duties, including setting up the registers, cleaning the front to get ready for opening, recieving the truck. Once the store is open making sure the flow of traffic is under control. I was manager so that included hiring new associates, paper work, and conference calls. I made sure at the end of my shift the other managers knew what needed to be done before closing shift. I also attended meetings in other cities per corporate, as well as any training that needed to be done."
good,I learned how to work hard and remain focused in a busy environment with alot of distractions.

It was a very good learning experience and the team I worked with was positive during the extra stressful holiday crowds, I learned to balance my daily task requirements, my patience and customer social skills very well during this time."
good,"A typical day at work would be getting there on time or early, clocking in at the cash register, then going to the assigned work place. I learned that you have to be fast and work hard. You have to be friendly to customers and everyone that you work with if you want to be noticed. My co-workers were very helpful. The managers were as well. The hardest part of the job would have to be multitasking and trying to get things done on my own without help at times. The most enjoyable parts of the job are meeting new people, helping customers, and seeing new items in the store, and also the employee discount!"
good,"Management Changes, and it was great!"
good,"I actually liked working at Ross, until my hours started to fluctuate. It was nothing personal, I just had to find me a job with more hours and money. The atmosphere there was mostly exciting."
good,Great place to work. Management really works with your schedule. The only downfall is the pay.
good,"I love working at Ross because my store is always busy, so I always have something to do. However, it is a downer sometimes because you do so much for so little pay. The discount is great! We even have double discount days three times a year, which is fantastic! There is always room for advancement if you put in some effort. This is a great job if you're just starting out."
good,it was a great learning experiance. I have a good boss and employees.
good,"Ross was my very first job ever. I enjoyed the experience of working there and helping customers. I liked the variety. I was trained as a cashier first, then eventually was trained to work in the fitting rooms. With experience in both, I was able to help in both areas of the store as needed."
good,"It is constantly busy so there is always something to do however customers can be quite difficult. Also, security issues can be a big problem because price tags are constantly missing."
good,Happy customers fill the store everyday. Management was the main issue. Constantly asking questions left me feeling like things weren’t being explained in the most detail possible.
good,Ross has a system down of what needs to be done and how. Mangers are supportive and ecourage the associates to do their best and challenge ourselves to do better.
good,Nice people constant work pretty low key kinda easy steady flow of people unloading trucks was the hardest part you get discounts and special employees days
good,I personally enjoy the customer experience. I enjoy coming in to work and meeting different people and hearing their personal experience. Management and the rest of the staff are really inviting and believe in teamwork.
good,I would help customers if they needed help looking for something and getting the right thing for them. I would be there if they need something is low with the merchandise.
good,"Good place to work while studying. Learned to  multitask and be aware of last minute changes. Over all, it was a good experience since i needed to get back to work after becoming a mother for the 2nd time"
good,"I like working here, my management is nice and easy to talk to. Communication is key to having a better work experience. The schedules are flexible with what works for the associate."
good,"Just Remain diligent / observant.  You run into all kinds of people coming into the store.  Thieves don't have an age nor color."
good,"it is a Monday Through Friday job, part time. you have to be there really early in the morning. Co-workers are nice to work with. Management is supportive"
good,The pay is decent for retail and they are pretty flexible. The management is ok. They are usually concerned about business needs over anything else. Sometimes they expect way more than you are able to accomplish because of business.
good,My work with them was fun employees were friendly and mostly helpful. I didn’t have any problems with anyone and the managers were very hands on as well .
good,"The district manager was very rude and talked down to the staff,  making them feel inferior. There was no reward for good work but if you did a bad job other people just had to cover for you. There was no punishment for it."
good,"The work day was pretty fun acutally. I wont lie and say that I loved working there as some of my partners were annoying and would slack off and force me to do the work, but that doesnt take away form how nice the management was and some other coworkers I became friends with."
good,"Helping customers and meeting people from different countries is a learning experience and fun to help each customer. Love my co-workers helping each other, learning from the managers."
good,Ross helped me gain better communication skills and learn how to work in customer service.  The store allowed me to work with customers and gain personable experience.
good,"always have something for u to do, no down time which is good, the hardest thing there is trying to put away every thing on your cart in it proper place with in ten min."
good,I worked for ross for about ten years it’s a good place to work especially if you love working around different people from different cultures it’s very diverse. The discount is 20% and every four months for four days you will get 40% off this discount is one of the best perks I worked part tome and full time with your full time health benefits they are actually good just make sure you get the highest plan which I think only takes about 14 dollars out of your check every other week you get paid bi weekly which is annoying they are very flexible with hours as well if your a student
good,I feel like this was a good job for myself. Your always doing something or helping someone and if you like being in your feet this is the job for you.
good,"the pay is very good, they give bonuses if one makes the production, the work environment is sometimes a bit loaded because of that, since all the employees want to make the production."
good,"I loved working in this environment,  many varieties from home decor to fashion. Good costumer service from employees. There's nothing I can't find at great prices."
good,"Worked here while going to school, they were pretty helpful with work/school schedule.  Would recommend to consider this place or even retail if you need a job"
good,"While working with this company I learned scheduling, dealing with tough situations, multi tasking, interviewing, hiring, terminating, and how to develop talent."
good,"Everyday is different, and has different challenges. Fast-paced environment. Can be fun at times, and the teams work well together to get things done on a daily basis."
good,"Nice work place would always go back, far as the hours and the pay .. the fact how we work as a team had a big role in the work place, stocking and placing things where kinda fun at the same time seeing who could finish first"
good,"I enjoyed working with many different people and you were able to learn new things all the time. It was a very easy going environment and i was able to move about in my station. What made the job a bit difficult was the lead favoritism. Management was ok, mainly because it was a bigger corporation it was hard to see if managers had preferences or relationships outside of work that affected the way they treated other employees.  I learned how to work with my team and alone. they taught me how to speak more openly with customers and everything that has to do with retail."
good,"I got promoted after 5 months of being cashier, the SPS position was a bit repetitive but overall I get to shop at a store I work at the discounts are amazing."
good,Ross is a good job if you dont want to over work yourself! Good played back job. Friendly management and very flexible. So yeah go for it . Not bad . Good hours
good,Nice place to work but hard to keep good people.  Can be stressful depending on management and the time of year. Late hours during the holidays and demanding customers.
good,Very fast pace. Pay is fair. Don't like that I have to move for advancement. They listen to the associates but their answers can take time to trickle down. New dress code is great.
good,"Great opportunity especially for anyone starting out in the workforce, would recommend to a friend or family member especially as an opportunity for advancement."
good,"Great staff, flexible when it comes to working with your schedule. The people there are good people and they make everything easy. Very patient when they are training you."
good,Like any job you are there to work. To provide the most efficiency for this company a positive attitude has to be maintained. Multitasking skills are highly important for this job. Staff is friendly and Managers are always there to help you improve.
good,"Great manager "
good,"I learned very quickly how to multitask in a high pace environment and learned how to properly assess each daily task given to me by my manager as a retail associate. I think the biggest skill sets that I have developed while working for Ross Dress For Less is patience; critical thinking skills, efficient memory, and over all communication skills. It can be a tasking job at times but challenges on a daily basis is what prepares you for the corporate work environment; even if you are just working in retail."
good,Pleasant atmosphere to work and build new relationships with both customers and employees. Always something to do. Flexible schedule. Decent pay scale.

good,The job itself is easy. The management always make sure you have all equipment and supplies you need. Also they are well organized and manageable. The facility is neat.
good,"Working at ross was great. They were flexible with your schedule and are accommodating towards your preferences. The overall work experience was mostly fast-paced and kept you on your feet from being in the stockroom, the registers or even the fitting rooms."
good,"The time when I was working at Ross there are good and bad times, but nowhere is perfect. I enjoy working with all my coworkers they are all team players."
good,"I liked the work place "
good,"Opened 2 new stores in 2002 and 2015. Loved my job, even relocated to Savannah only to be wrongfully terminated in a case that I won with DOL. "
good,It's a good part time job for students who are in college. Other then that you need to be in management to get the pay or fulltime to get the benefits.
good,I enjoyed my job it was a fast paced job you stay busy all day and always had something to do. I just had to relocate to  another area that why I was not able to be stay .
good,This was my first job. It was fast past and I was able to communicate with a variety of people which I loved. This job taught me time management. i juggled working full-time and going to school full time.
good,It was good working at Ross.The management will also ways work around your schedule.A good place to start with. I got a good job with the experience I gained from Ross.And I bought my first car from the wages I got from Ross.
good,working at ross was a good customer service/retail oppurtunity for me. overall it was a good job and i worked with some great people. i had a good experience there and i am now looking for better experiences
good,"Working for Ross was interesting.  Management was not the best with communicating specific job duties.  Nothing hard about this job at all.  I had the opportunity to work as a part of the markdown team, I worked as a fitting room specialist, I worked in the stockroom as well."
good,Ross is a company that has many career opportunities. I enjoyed working as a team and with the customers. I learned how a business operates and functions
good,I love working with the employees they are very friendly and customer always talking to you and making you smile about everything and I love working with them
good,Had lots of fun enjoyed the environment and my coworkers always stay busy and had lots of room for growth in the company and always gave you praise when you accomplish something positive.
good,"Typical retail job. They are as cheap and petty as every other large retail chain but the employee discount/double discount days are generous, scheduling is very flexible, management is fair enough and plenty of room for advancement due to high turnover of staff."
good,They are very understanding and flexible with hours. The associates and managers I have worked with are all very friendly and respectful. The stockroom is very fast paced.
good,"Everything was great untill they started cutting hours for me , the manager played  favoritism and gave people were there the longest and most hours. I was dealing with a lot so that kind of messed with me  which is why I left but the overall workplace is very easy to work and they are not super strict but they do have a lot of rules it is a very slow paced."
good,Being a cashier here is super easy. Its fun and competitive if you like basic math thats also a plus. Getying to interact with customers is fun and easy and coworkers are usually pretty chill.
good,Everyone is very fun to work with. The fast pace environment was great and it is great for a first job. Training is fast and it is very easy to get in routine.
good,"If you like to work with customer service and you are active this is the kind of job you will like because we are always helping people and organizing the store, the team work is alway nice we like to heal each other, the manager very nice alway looking if we need something in what they could  help."
good,Not much to say was a decent first job. Management was good worked well around my schedule with my child. Never really gave me a hard time. Great discount
good,Good opportunities to move up within company. Although there isn't much incentive to stay within company since evaluations rarely happen for an opportunity of a raise.
good,"A typical day is the work place consists of steady work that I would consider to be fairly simple. I haven't really learned anything new in the Ross Dress for Less environment that I didn't already know. My opinion on management I would prefer to keep to myself. I wouldn't consider anything to be difficult in this line of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is sales floor, as I love to clean and organize."
good,"You can get your foot in the door pretty Quick"
good,"If you like interaction with people this is your place, nice environment and good teamwork.  All the associates make you feel like a big family.  Minimum pay very good."
good,"Management is they key to running the store properly. With great leadership, workers will feel comfortable working. Coworkers are welcoming and ability to work as a team."
good,"While working at Ross my responsibilities were to upload boxes, open and stock all items, Some had to be hard tag and then put on a rack which we later when full put on sales floor ready for sales."
good,"Everything was good, except for the hours they don’t give you more that 24 hours per week."
good,"working at ross dress for less, i met . some great people a very understanding manager and i even got employee of the month . i was also working full time hours because i earned it as I was still part ."
good,"The managers sometimes over work you and require you to stay because they are usually understaffed. Need a better system with their front end, there's usually never enough cashiers when needed."
good,"Working at Ross is honestly a push and tug, all depending on the store location, coworkers, management, and yearly average. The management team can either make or break the overall experience and you will most definitely see shifts due to managers and supervisors transferring or quitting. As far assignments go, that varies based on what time you're scheduled, what your strengths are after going through training, and what the manager needs. Closing is tough and you will most often stay late if you're in a busier store that gross more than 10 mil per year."
good,"The work is simple, but fast paced. The store is goal oriented and employees must have a score of 90 or above on the register. I would not recommend this job to anyone that does not have proper customer service skills."
good,"Working for Ross was a great sales associate experience. Learning about returns policy, sales, upsaling while having fun and work environment is peaceful."
good,"very flexible, sales associate, greet customers, feel warm and always smiling making customer experience great. schedule works out with everything else"
good,"When working morning shifts, the morning can seem long due to lack of customers. Customers usually start coming in mid afternoon. We stay busy until around 9pm, then it slows down again."
good,Managers who actually want to see you succeed. Decent discounts on items bought in store. Was one if my personal favorite places to work and I wish I could go back.
good,My work experience was generally good. Training was through and precise. Coworkers were friendly and pleasant and the manager was helpful and friendly. The only issue with the job is the position I was in only had one shift and it was a little inconvenient.
good,"I wasn't really on the floor i worked in the back unloading the truck in the morning before the store opened up.  Truck would arrive and we would unload truck and then separate the merchandise in to sections or departments. Once truck is one we organize each station like shoes, clothing, bed & bath, toys, etc.  Tag everything up put it on carts and inspect while we tag to make sure things are not damaged. Then we take out on the floor and start to put merchandise in the proper areas that it belongs to. The best part for me about the job I get a two for one special, time flies because we are busy but also the different people that come to shop while you are putting things away and organizing shelves as you go is great."
good,Loved the discount for sure fast paced  in stock room nice people to work with manager there to help you when needed everyone was helpful with questions
good,"A typical day a Ross can be rewarding, however challenging on some days. I have learned so much while working at Ross. I have learned about opportunist, keeping a watchful eye on the products Ross has to offer to our paying costumers, and I also learn directly from the managers about how the stores run and operate efficiently. The workplace culture at Ross is to be there for the company, to create happiness among the team in order to create a better work performance within the workplace. As for the hardest part of the job, I'd have to say that, every so often (not always), it is the very late hours of closing of the store, and returning back to an early shift  in the mornings. The most enjoyable part of working at Ross is the way we truly work as a team. I truly love working with the well together team of people at Ross. We work efficiently together, and support one another when needed."
good,It is a good place to work. Only thing is they change things all the time and not everyone lets you in on what is going on. The pay is good and good benefits.
good,"A regular day included maintaining a safe and secure environment, mitigating theft and fraud, and upholding a friendly work environment for everyone. Employees would positively engage with customers as well as other associates in order to ensure a wonderful experience for any and all individuals included in the Ross experience."
good,"All coworkers and managers were friendly and work was never more than anyone could handle and always explained with the necessary training. The basic ""uniform"" is black pants, close toed shoes, and a blue/navy shirt, jacket or cardigan. There was variety in tasks even when tasks were the same every day due to the products in store and the environment. All managers were fantastic and made a point to develop relationships with each of the employees and maintain them. I enjoyed my time working with Ross and was sad to leave, but satisfied with my time being employed with ROSS and the personal growth it allowed."
good,"* good job and good pay and good team to work with"
good,Ross is a steady employer with a high turn over of employees that move on to better jobs and career opportunities. Perfect for someone starting over or just graduating high school. Great place for career advancement.
good,"- very fast paced."
good,It was to far for me to travel to work. And i spent a lot of money get to work . Also had to leave home early just to get there on time and be early  and we had to work hard we had to do training for like a  week and had to learn everything about the store
good,I worked in the Beaverton cedar hills Ross and everyone I worked with was great! It was almost like a family. I wished that I didn't have to relocate.
good,"ross is a place, where a lot of people come and shop, it is a fast-paced company. you fill in your culture, and people will make you smile. sometimes the place gets crazy, but it is your choice to let that get to you or not."
good,It is a fast paced place to work.  During peak seasons you will get better hours but during regular seasons the hours are minimal.  The best part of working there is the discount.
good,It was a good place to work at. I really liked it but the pay wasn't good. If you have experience they only pay you minimum which isn't much. I liked working there. I would've stayed if they paid better.
good,"	Operating cash registers, managing financial transactions, and balancing drawers."
good,Ross Stores has a good working environment however I feel that they must focus on e-commerce in the future if they plan on staying alive. I think that is what turns off a lot of talent
good,"Working at Ross you need to learn to manage time efficiently. It is very quick paced, there are days where it is slow. For the most part there is always something to do whether it is on your department or helping someone else with theres."
good,Ross as a company has great advancement due to opening new stores. Ross believes in internal promotions. Ross as a company cares for its people and give them fare wages
good,Customer friendly.  Always something to do. Great managers. Great employees. Will train in all areas. Will hire within company for many and all positions
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the customers. I loved the responsibility I was entrusted with. I had hopes of staying there longer. I would go back in a heartbeat.
good,"fast paced and quick work pace on a daily basis, must stay alert and on point all the time, safety is paramount , ensure the safety and protection of employees and guests on a daily basis"
good,I loved working there. Nice to get brands in a cheap price lool. Associates are good. But the mannager in that store was not good. One of them is rough and the next one is unexperienced enough to be a manneger .
good,Es un trabajo para personas muy activas y con mucha iniciativa.
good,"Customer service, cashiering, fitting room, and loss prevention, and truck crew, it was extremely busy and there werent enough cashiers working during the day and only one person for 4 hours a day to clean up the store at night."
good,"A typical day @ Ross is recovering merchandise out-of-place, which can be very challenging.  The replenishing of merchandise during store hours can be even worse with customers inundating the main aisles where merchandise is being staged.  I learned that it is incredibly important to work as team to accomplish tasks during heavy customer concentration. The workplace culture is diverse and allows for interesting conversations with both customers as well as other associates (e.g., tourists and co-workers of diverse ethnic backgrounds). The hardest part of the job is when the store is short handed.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when all tasks are completed."
good,"Very dynamic, great group of people. Great managers, roles are exchange every week, so you can learn about everything at the store.  Regardless the schedule, Ross offer many options to choose and the schedule is flexible."
good,Typically a day at Ross varies from shift to shift. I've been trained everywhere in the store to ensure I would be able to handle any situation that presented itself. I could be in charge of the stockroom one day and be leading cashier the next. The turnover for managers at Ross is pretty high so throughout the five years I've worked and managed there I've dealt with some amazing and awful managers. However no matter how good or bad the managers were the people I worked with always made up for it. The Ross in Waco has an amazing family like atmosphere among the employees easily making it the best part of the job. Unfortunately anyone who has worked retail will be able to attest to the fact that the hardest part are the one-off customers that can't be pleased no matter how hard an employee or manager may try.
good,In a Management roll the experience was good. Left another retailer for higher pay at Ross. although I enjoyed the job in the future. Leaving one structured company for better pay is not a always a good idea.
good,Its a great company with great benefits and alot of growth opportunities its well organized and high strict when it come to there safety hazards but thats what makes the company it self great.
good,"it was great"
good,I enjoyed my time here at Ross. I loved working with the people. The Keeaumoku location was fast and tought. I liked the fast paced environment and the busy schedules. Kept everyone going at a pace of non stop work which was good because the shift hours were by quick.
good,Received different form of payments and learned all of the register open and closing process. Count money in cash drawers at the beginning of the shifts to ensure that amount are correct and that there is adequate change.
good,Fast-paced environment time flew by. Worked with several people on a daily basis making sure it was ready for opening. Dress professionally and work with professional people on a daily basis
good,"Great part time job. Overnight positions, Great second job. Hard to get promoted within. If you exceed expectations against 25 other employees maybe they will offer you the next position."
good,"This company has a great workplace culture, and the people who work here are very nice and inviting. However, the work load is intense and sometimes complicated."
good,"Working a short-time in this store I have learned that it is a nice company to work for."
good,the discount they offer thier workers is really good its like 30-40% off depending on what items you get. they let you work the hours you can which was really good when i was in school
good,I worked at the stock room for most part but sometimes I would get called to take over the cash register  . or other days I would do markdown that was nice . I also got to work for inventory .over all I liked working at that store  great  team .
good,"A typical work day would have me cutting up boxes, taking items out of the box and sorting them. Management was great and never lacked on the job. The managers did help out even if they weren't asked."
good,"worked in the fitting room, cleaned restrooms, assist customers around the store and cashed them out in day to day basis. Also assist with inventory and helped with keeping store organized."
good,"Yucaipa ROSS staff are friendly and supportive. Sometimes, business is busy as a cashier and some days during regular work hours, it can be slow and relaxing to perform store tasks and organize areas. There is always something to do here and ways to keep busy. "
good,"I was a cashier but as cashiers we also stocked the entire store "
good,"It is a lot of work, but everyone is so helpful. while clients are a handful the people you work with are so nice. the managers are always there to listen to you, and do a great job. the discounts are great. however the hardest part is finishing your job on time."
good,"My over all experience was okay. Yes, I would love to come back and work again for this company.  I miss working with different people and the customers was great."
good,Customers and employees are both great. Management is helpful in all aspects related to the job. Management and coworkers are willing to assist in any way possible.
good,"Retail is an nice comfortable atmosphere to work in, and people are friendly. I was enthuse at greeting and help all of those in urgent need of direction."
good,"I love coming to my job at Ross Dress for Less. It is a very fun and exciting place to work. We get new merchandise everyday, and our customers seem to love our products, they are always coming back!"
good,"I liked working for them, but mostly because i could get my job done in time. Most of my co-workers were older than me and they struggle to finish their job once the store doesn't give us enough time."
good,"Loved working there. The people are great and so fun to work with. If I had the chance, I’d go back there. They work really well with ur availability, very flexible."
good,Ross is a good place to work if you don't mind being on your feet for long periods of time. Everyone constantly has to be alert and always flexible in regards to your work shift and what job role you may have to cover.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was always recognized for my hard work and rewarded for it,by promotion, a raise or more responsibility."
good,Overall it was an intense place to work with a lot of demand on systems not retail knowledge.  It is an old school retailer but they know what they are doing.
good,"They didn’t give much hours unless it is around the holiday time, other than that the pay wasn’t that great, but the discount was nice and you could find cute clothes their."
good,"I started off a hard lines manager but ended switching over to softlines. but, i enjoyed both depatments. Doing floor moves was the best. Also the employees as well as the customers was great."
good,Ross was my first job ever. It was really easy to learn how to do things my coworkers told me I learned quick. Everything is done is a fast pace and you aslways have something to do.
good,"they are understanding, patient, caring, and they treat you like family, when you need help there, they are there for you and to help you and everything."
good,"Great to be able so use my competitive strength to drive results. This position needs to be filled with experienced individuals as inexperienced managers fail,"
good,"el ambiente  es excelente mis companeros de trabajo son muy colaboradores "
good,"I had a fun time meeting new people here and it was a great first job. The managers are really nice and they are very understanding of situations. The other associates are really nice and welcoming. The peak time is crazy busy. Also, a lot of customers get angry because of how long the lines get but the store is kinda small."
good,worked there for years miss it great co-workers an managers i learned a lot i built great friendships an work ethic accountability stability an understanding of a work place
good,"In my experience, working part time got me through my first couple of years in college. It also helped as a 2nd job during the holidays. They are very good when it comes to allowing employees the required amount of breaks. The hours are flexible."
good,provided excellent costumer service skills on sales floor and on the cashier. reorganized the store depending on hollydays or seasons. sold jewelry to customers
good,"It is fast paced, with relaxed times. Friendly co workers, and managers. They are able to accommodate schedules and they have employee discounts. "
good,"Great company to work for! Go to work with style everyday! Company reimburse your parking money every shift you work! Great benefits! Medical, dental, vision, 401k vacation pay and sick pay and holiday pay!"
good,it was a okay job i just didnt like always being in the back and the over time is not good when you look at you pay in two week and you did over time was still low amount of money
good,"In a place like Ross where there are busy seasons and slightly less busy seasons, it's better to work with people who want to work together. Rather than viewing it as ""just a job"", I have found that having a team orientated mindset is what makes it the most enjoyable."
good,"Ross was good. It helped me with money when I graduated high school, I would recommend it to anyone who just needs a job that gives hours and doesn't mind working."
good,Great to have if you enjoy hard but easy work. Great job that comes with good benefits & work environment. Its production based & you can earn extra money on your check if your production is high
good,"Stocking is fun but they do want you to complete like 6-7 boxes in a shift. Fitting room is fast paced especially on weekends when ppl try on 60 things and only decides to get one item then it is your job to put these clothing back onto the floor. Management could be much better. Overall good job, great discounts for employees (every 3-4 month theres 30-50% off)"
good,Is a hard work environment and stressful . The company operate over stress. Because the Salary Budget is minimum. I really appreciate the managers effort.
good,Ross is a face paced environment that allows for internal promotions. Management is a strong asset to Ross creating an environment that pushes the ceiling for the store and associates.
good,"The loss prevention gig is one of constant observation on both ends, having several managers keeping tabs on you, and as the loss prevention person keeping tabs on employees and customers."
good,This was my first job and I was very lucky to have it have been here. The Managers are very helpful and understanding as well as great coworkers who did a fantastic job of working as a team. The job was stressful at times but overall if you did what was needed everything would pan out well.
good,"If you can work here as a first job I think you should hang on to it as long as you can until you're certain you really want to leave, and only leave if you're certain it's a smart move towards something better."
good,A typical at Ross dress for less would be very fast paced. There is a lot of interaction with customers and employees. There is always a chance to learn new strategies to improve workflow. Very friendly and fun work environment to work in. Very flexible schedules.
good,"Ross dress for less was a challenging environment, the customers treated the store badly and threw items hither and tither. The management was kind and mostly supportive."
good,Everyone was in competition and being timed. We had to be at the register when there was customers and had to mange to finish cleaning and fixing our department within our 8hour shift.
good,Ross was a great experience. I was able to move around and learn many different aspects of the store. The benefits and time off were good for retail. Would work here again part time.
good,"Ross isn't like any other retail store, they are very fast paced and upbeat. The management isn't bad, they are mainly understanding and will work with your schedule or family issues. The pay is good and the hardest part about the job would be facing difficult customers. The most enjoyable part would be having fun with your team and being a family."
good,"Ross is a fun place to work at. It has many opportunities to grow in stock, sales floor and SPS. A typical day at work is placing items back to where they belong and operating the cash register."
good,Ross is a seasonal fast paced environment. Customer service is key. Can be challenging to keep store orderly due to thrift shop mentality of the majority of the customer base in San Diego Stores. Great flexible hours which allow you to further your own personal educational goals. Great for College Students.
good,Good place to work. Friendly coworkers. Flexible hours. Employee discount. Easy tasks. Pay raises somewhat often. Managers understanding and willing to work with you.
good,"Ross was a fun store to work at, everyone was very helpful. And I think if I had another chance to work there I would definitely take the opportunity."
good,A typical day at Ross was to process goods to the floor.  Recover the sales floor. Assist customers in finding their purchase.  Ensuring that cashiers were ringing quickily.
good,it is not a good paying but its an okay job to get you around. some overtime which was good .the 3rd shift is good if your looking for a part time job
good,"they have a flexible schedule, they work as a team, they pay only the minimum and I was looking for something where I would earn a little more They like to recognize our work and make us feel very good at work."
good,Training went well and you even have opportunities with overtime. The department I work in is easy to learn and can also get extra money from good production
good,My typical day at ross would be clock in face and unload trucks daily. When done unloading truck I would stock shelves. Sometimes take a lunch if the truck loads were big if not just two breaks. I liked management and wanted to be apart of it but my life would not allow at time. Loved the work place everyone was friendly and worked well together.
good,a typical day at work would be going  in an sorting out the items  in the back while the truck is being unloaded and putting the mechanize out on the sales floor wear they go .i learned that there is processes with everything that you do there. the management was pretty good overall and the hardest part about the job was how tiring it can get or dealing with other  workers who did not want to work. the most enjoyable part was getting the job done and seeing the workers thatt wanted to work and making the managers happy.
good,I learned a lot at Ross Dept Store. My co-workers were very helpful and created a  family environment. The discounts that were offered to the employee were awesome. We provide great customer service.
good,"I Would get to work,and clock in. Figure out where the manager would like me for the day, which is usually on register two. Then I would check people out inform then on sales and discounts. I will help costumers with returns and exchanges. At the end of the day I do mark downs and clean up my area and then leave for the day."
good,"I've only been there 3 months  and work part time so I may update this  review in another 3 months."
good,Ross was a very fun place to work. It was organized and the management was always very happy friendly and understanding. The team memebers were all treated fairly.
good,so far what i've experienced in the company. there's not really any affirmative leadership. the management team have tried and tried to perfect the store but it's never enough. this a reason why i'm looking for a better work place.
good,Ross is a fun and productive work environment for employment. The discounts are good and very worth it at times. The workers there will always make u feel at home and u can always talk to them if something is bothering you.
good,This was a very good job that I did not want to leave. They were kind of understanding but the manager had her ways of when she wanted to be bothered but most of the time she was cool she really stayed to herself.
good,"its has been many years since i have worked there, It was a very structured work environment involving many reviews of reporting and what is OTB, visiting vendors on what to purchase ."
good,the store was quick paced because we were always busy and their was always long lines so as a cashier you had to be quick and help get people out without rushing the customer so that the line would not back up too much
good,This is a great job to work for . You will be working great associate and customs every day . I enjoyed the work place. We work hard in keeping the sales floor nice and neat.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy meeting new people everyday and a fast paced environment. There is always something to do and always learning something new every day.
good,"I liked working here but they need to clean/update their bathrooms and employee break room."
good,It was fun working there I loved it. It was a great learning experience I was able to become better with helping people. I loved the time I was there.
good,If a fast paced environment stresses you out I do not recommend this job. You are constantly busy doing something which makes the shifts go by quickly. Management was tough but very helpful.
good,"I do enjoy working here. The managers are awesome and very good at making sure you know what your doing. It is a good job with good benefits, I just don't see my self working here for a long period of time."
good,"Good place to work, everyone jumps on board to get the job done. Managers are friendly and hard working. You get a good store discount and they even offer some health benefits for part time employees."
good,Normal day at work greeting customers as I place stock out on the floor. Straighten up messes help customers with their belongings if necessary. Ross is a very easy workplace gives you a daily dose of customer service and hand-eye coordination.
good,The environment is pretty team oriented based and fun loving environment. Management is typical pretty easy to communicate with regarding a bevy of issues.
good,checking email see any planograms can from corp. walk the floor what is the recovery looks like and what product needs to be filled. then talk to my department manager see whats going on for the day
good,"Clock in , check what schedule  i will be working this shift ex(cashier, recovery, fitting room etc . ) .  usually if im closing shift we have a meeting before we clock out ."
good,I enjoyed working here. And I liked when I was able to find something in the store to buy later. The people were real nice and it was a good atmosphere.
good,Clockwork operation from how fast you unload delivery trucks so that the driver can get to the next location. Premium on getting tasks done i.e. markdowns but well compensated for checking off duties timely and quickly.
good,"Ross is a great place to work. I joined ross nine years ago. I have enjoyed working with management to get to be an area supervisor. At ross your birthday is a paid holiday. You also have two paid holiday for your employment annivasary. Ross marches your 401k, and a good health insurance for full time employees. Ross is a good place to grow."
good,typical day busy heavy flow of customer
good,"Kept the Stockroom clean and maintained it neat and orderly. I also held each team member accountable for achieving performance goals. Processed shipments and organized stock shelves. Unloaded Trucks, stocked shelves and carried merchandise out on the floor for customers."
good,"I worked in the morning from 6AM-11AM. I started as temporary for Christmas season. During seasonal I was able to get my full 25 hours each week. I worked from Monday to Friday. After seasonal I was hired as part time. It was then I realized that I was only limited to 15 hours per week. I was only working 3 days a week, with only 5 hours a day. I was not able to change my availability and I couldn't change where I wanted to work. They didn't allow me to work on cashier because I was good in stock. They didn't allow me to expand my skills. Although it was a good experience for very first real job I feel they lack the hours for part time."
good,"As a store protection specialist i ensure our customers had a safe environment to shop at. making sure to great customers as they walked into the store and call out all types of suspicious activity to the manager. "
good,Ross has a high turnover rate. Not enough store coverage. In my opinion Ross does not pay their employees enough. Part-time employees should be offered some type of benefits also.
good,This was an excellent part time  job. I never had another job where the managers work so closely with you and the corporation cared more for its individual workers
good,I liked the job. They always feed on holidays and they let us freely base our opinion about things. Very productive nice and enjoyable place to work. A lot of walking  involved.
good,The job was rewarding.  I would greet the customers and assisted them with their purchase to their cars.   Also as I saw theft happening I would tried to prevent it by asking the person can I help you with the item. It was a good security job.
good,Ross is a good company to work for and gain experience in the merchandising and retail industry. The employees are encouraged to communicate about the store and changes of policies and the employee discounts are great.
good,"Compared to my other experience in retail, Ross is quite different from the norm.  Rather than requiring open availability which is preferred, Ross allows you the flexibility to work a schedule that is more conducive to your needs.  I can only work during the hours my children are in school and my schedule allows for that.  The pace is fast with many tasks being timed.  The sales floor has a more generalized layout allowing for flexibility when new products come in.  I was used to ""a place for everything with everything in it's place"" environment but here you just find a place in the general area of like items and make a home for the new product.  No detailed layouts of counters, no labeling.  I recently learned that managers for Ross generally work a 40 hour a week schedule which is quite different from other retailers.  My experience has been that retail managers work more like 50+ hours a week.  This reduced schedule allows for a better work/life balance.  This fact alone has piqued my interest in considering a position as a manager.  Another perk is the 20% discount off the already low prices and occasional special discount days where the discount is increased to 40%.  This savings helps me stretch my income creating a better quality of life for my family."
good,"This was a straightforward job. You come in, get assigned a position and then rotate after a lunch. There are benefits for employees and certain perks like special sales days for employees. Good employee appreciation"
good,Ross is the standard retail job.It is a good place to start off. I do not agree with some of their policies but none-the-less it is still a lovely place to work.
good,"Easy-going, great opportunities. People are friendly. You get paid lunches, but you can't leave the building. They do have a designated smoking area and plenty of vending machines."
good,"Management has always been supportive in whatever was needed. They have always been more than willing to work with my schedule and were very supportive when I had to be off for an illness that lasted 4 months. "
good,"Typically they will have you work every position and figure out what your best at and use you there so try not to get overwhelmed. Management is very helpful and anytime you need assistance there is a phone nearby to contact them. The hardest part is being a cashier, because you will have to deal with rude customers. The most enjoyable part is working with the same customers and getting to build a friendly relationship with them."
good,"Not a bad job but nothing to write home about. The pay isn't bad and they treat you decently but like any retail position, the customers can be... interesting."
good,"Management in the workplace is encouraging and upbringing, which helps in finishing projects much smoother with very little to no stress in the process."
good,This was one of my favorite jobs. A family and team environment. The management is awesome if you are reliable. I learned a lot about the retail business.
good,"my Job as FES is to keep the front end of the store clean, but sometimes it got so busy it made it hard to preform my job the exact way management wanted too. customers were cool sometimes but the little things just get your blood boiling over time, like after you tell them the total they don't give you the money like a respectful person, they lay it on the table even if my hands their of not. good job just gets a little tedious after a while."
good,Ross is a fast paced environment to work but it's also fun and never a dull moment working there.The best part of my job is making sure the customers have a great experience.
good,"Working at Ross for me was rewarding, as the pay was outstanding, and the opportunity to develop was very competitive.  "
good,Working at Ross I sometimes have to work the cash register and walk the floor.  I think working at Ross is good and helps the people of Hilo by providing affordable goods.
good,"When working night shift, the store is usually calm.  I learned how to maintain a safe and secure environment, mitigate theft and fraud, maintain a safe and secure environment and minimize operational shortage. Management is organized and well rounded. The culture of Ross' workplace is very diverse. The hardest part of working is being able focus on suspicious customers when the store is busy. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to partner up with associates and coach the associates on store trends."

good,"I worked for Ross for many years, it was fast paced, demanding, and hectic at times, also very enjoyable as well.  I met great people, developed lasting relationships with customers, many who I seen nearly every day.  We had a great team in the Reading Ross with a fantastic manager."

We have a great management team here making sure we get all associates on board to complete all the task that are given daily. I'm Looking forward to bringing my skills and leadership to a another team to so we can get the job done

good,I feel Ross is a good job to work at if you like clothes and can handle lines of customers during periods of time. Also they are not discouraging people only enthusiastic employees.
good,This was my first job in a long time. Before this I was working at my family restaurant. I remember enjoy working here for a while but found a better paying job at the time.

good,"Ross was an okay place to work, I worked in the stock room so it was pretty tiring. We were way understaffed so I really felt over worked, but other than that it was an okay job"
good,I maintained a safe & secure work environment through maintaining a command presence at the entrance of the store. Also I developed great teams & partnerships by providing excellent customer service by greeting customers and answering questions.

good,"I enjoyed working for ROSS the atmosphere was incredible, the people were caring, and the teamwork was outstanding.  The hardest part of the job was the early morning hours, but the best part was how flexible they were with my school."

good,Very fast pace and always have to be moving it wasn't real busy during the week but weekends and holiday were very busy and stressful but alot of great people to work with
good,"I'm a person who loves fashion and love giving advice when it comes to fashion. This job helps my eye for fashion on a smaller scale, but love helping and interacting with customers when they ask my opinion on an outfit."
good,"There was always something to do, never a dull moment. I learned a lot of the skills I currently use while working at Ross. The hardest part about the job would be trying to figure out how to help everyone."
good,Starting out as a fitting room attendant. If I was ever needed I would also help at the register. Meeting new challenges daily with the public. Learning how to assist the markdown team. Environment was cool because we had different ages and cultured working together. Nothing hard because we always worked as a team daily. Having fun with the public and my employees was my enjoyment at work.
good,"Truck come early in the morning, open all the boxes, sort them from shoes, clothes, other. Then someone is stationed at clothes, shoes, or other. We are all responsible for our station, have to make sure everything is ready, once ready we place it out in the store."

good,"I worked for 3 yrs. in the department and found it not what is. loss prevention is to secure the store, checking the floor, watch CCtV, and other things. had to walk the floor, but greeted customers, helped cash exchange."
good,the manager once lost my check and did not put any effort to find it; i did not receive my paycheck until almost a month later. the shift leader would also change peoples schedules without notifying them therefore a lot of employees were marked as not showing up.
good,"Managment and Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Managment was organized. They also recognized birthdays how long you have been working there, who was a trainer, employee of the month etc. The system that was used to get merchandise out to the floor. There were all different cultures in the workplace. Was getting all merchandise security tagged out on the floor."

My most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people and stocking the shelves."
good,"At Ross I learned how to stay on top of things as far as  time management. With such a huge variety of items being sold in these stores you would have to maintain your area throughout the day and keep it presentable for customers to shop. Being quick is important because you would have so much things to put away. Staying on top of my responsibilities helped me get the job done faster at night, and that would allow me to assist other associates who needed help finishing up their areas, ensuring that we would not be working hours that were very late. The hardest part of the job came when the weekends came, since more people are free then, that's when you have to work the hardest. It was a good job and I was making good money at that time, and for my age. The discount could have been better though!"
good,For the way they wanted you to work the pay should have been more
good,worked under a good management team learned different skills.
good,"great Place to work., Customer service is great, great owner and employee relations."
good,Great place to work. Super busier during the weekend and always something to do.
good,okay place.  The breaks were super short.  The supervisors are unexceptionally rude.  I enjoyed my co-workers but not my supervisors.
good,"A typical day at work is fast pace, easy going also. Nice and friendly customers, with employees to go along with."
good,Great team work and spent time showing new personal the proper process of the workplace as well as company policy
good,I truly enjoyed working here. Pay was wonderful and the employees were really great to work with
good,"It's a ok place to work,not for a long time carrier or anything like that but where I worked everyone was pretty nice and cool."
good,"It was a great experience working for Ross."
good,"It was actually interesting working there ,had fun and met new people."
good,This place helped shape my social skills a lot. Working with customers and dealing with a lot of different people was extremely rewarding to my social skills and personal growth.
good,Would have a very busy productive work day. I enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,"if you looking for great benefits  ross is the choice for you."
good,"If you wanted a stressful, fast-paced work environment, this is the place to find it. You ring up customer purchases on your register. When you're not on register, you sweep your area for fallen or misplaced clothing and you organize the merchandise on the racks. You tend to get called up to your register multiple times during your shift, and it always seems to happen when you are helping a customer or running a full clothing rack from the fitting rooms. The job is a heart attack waiting to happen."
good,"At Ross I moved up very quickly. They give you plenty of opportunities if you work hard for them just like at any other job. I was basically a little of everything from cashier to a back up manager. My co-workers were easy to get along with and hard workers. The hardest part of this job probably would be managing a large team during the holidays but I had help with that. I loved how interacting it is, there will always be something for you to do."
good,Really enjoyed other employees and coming to work was eventful and fun. Always had off days but retail is always like that.
good,"positive attitudes,helpful staff,every day you learn new things. overall a great place to work."
good,typical work day was answering phones assisting customers in fitting area and restocking merchandise
good,A typical day at Ross is very busy. Working at Ross has taught me how to be more productive and dedicated. The management is not very supportive of their employees.  My co-worker are very helpful we work together as a team to ensure developmental growth. There is not anything that I could see to be hard working for this company. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working together as a team.
good,"My coworkers and managers are all great people, everyone seems to get along with one another perfectly. However, the company itself doesn't seem to care a whole lot about its employees. Recently they cut almost everyone's hours to get around new healthcare laws, which was hard on everyone, forcing many people, including myself, to look for a second job. There are no benefits available for part-time employees, but on the plus side, if you choose to stay, there is job security, and some room to grow if that interests you. Ross is a pretty typical retail environment to work in, but is a slightly smaller company than some others, making management more available for your needs."
good,"Best group of people I have ever worked with. I experienced a lot during this job that I can take to future careers. Things such as how to handle customer questions and problems, working with equipment like cash registers and retail merchandising markdown equipment. If you are a hard worker they reward you, with in 3 months on the job I was promoted to Front End Supervisor. Would recommend working here to anyone."
good,"typically days would be very busy which is exciting to me. I've learned things like dealing with customers , how to react in stressful situations, how to maintain an safe and secure environment, mitigating theft and fraud , developing great teams and partnerships and minimizing operational shortage. Managers are very supportive and co-works are friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is everything. The fact that im helping provide an safe and secure environment for customers is exciting to me , being able to make an difference means everything."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Ross has been the hardest job in my career history, and one of the  most rewarding.  It is a great place to work, learn, and grow.  I suggest anyone who wants to be challenged apply at Ross.  Remember, the key to success with Ross is ""change"".  Go with it!"
good,"Team Member"
good,A typical day at work is busy but as long as everyone shows teamwork the day goes by smoothly.
good,"Clock-in"
good,"Coworkers and management are wonderful, though I suppose that depends on your managers."
good,The management experience helped me grow and taught me even more from being part of a great and expanding organization!
good,Ross is a very busy workplace. The hardest part of the job probably has to be recovering the store because it can get messy but the most enjoyable part is that you meet new people and time goes by fast since its so busy
good,"I would clock in a do my start, which is a part of the store to organize. then I would unload the truck daily, organize it and put on the sales floor and help customers with there needs while on the sales floor. the co owrkers were fun to be around and made the day go faster. there wasn't really anything hard about the job. everything was routine. I really enjoyed the customers."
good,Working for Ross was pretty cool. Being security is difficult at times but it was nothing I couldn't handle. I put my all into being the best and I was the best. I would have been promoted to Head security but I had to leave for basic training in the Army.
good,"It was a very good company, the team members were very awesome any and everything i needed helping they would provide me and guide me in the right direction."
good,A typical day at work would be fast paced with either a massive line or a moderate sized line of customers. The managers are on top of everything and let you know what your duties are for the day. Everyone working for Ross is very friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of my job is trying to maintain the store to be clean. There are plenty of customers who go in each day making messes and not taking care of there children. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and seeing new faces each day and working with such enjoyable coworkers and managers.
good,I got a chance to interact with customers and assist them as they were trying to get into the fitting rooms to try on clothes.
good,It like the shift and the job title I had. Its was a great wearhouse experience for me.
good,I love working here....I mostly work in the fitting room...giving me the opportunity to meet lots of different people....just giving them a friendly hello seems to make their day....my day consist of making sure toys and lingerie are in the right places and that the fitting room is clean and clear.    All the employees here are friendly and are willing to help in any way....the hardest part of my job is getting some more hours...they are doing no more than 25 for part time employees and most of us are only getting around 20...I like the way they listen to suggestions and even let me change the end caps when I see they need it..........doing mark downs is also great....I love to clearance things and give people an opportunity to buy something they have been wanting.....the most enjoyable part of my job is to set an example to make their day of shopping a good one....
good,Gives you an opportunity to grow within the company but its a really long waiting list in order to move up
good,"I had a young man come in and wanted a gift for his girlfriend. He didn't know what to buy her because like he said she was a woman. I laughed at his remark and told him its easy, if you cant figure out an item she would want get a gift card from her favorite store! He thanked me and got a gift card from ross dress for less along with some bath goodies!"
good,Review staffing plan and objectives once the goal is established present your findings to the management team and monitor your progress throughout the shift. Follow up with supervisors and team members during the shift to identify areas of opportunity or pitfalls and adjust accordingly It was a very hands on position with constant variables and challenges which made the job fun and interesting.
good,"great place for a first job. Positive work environment, good management helpful as well."
good,"Everyone has been great at Ross, and I've learned so much. I've met so many people and have really honed in on my analytical skills."
good,"Working here was not the greatest but nether was the worst. Although everyday of work was just average in my opinion, it felt great just to see the workday has ended. You do however get to rotate positions if you don't enjoy being in one position all the time."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting, checking out customers fast and friendly. I learned that there was more than meets the eye to run a retail store, and that everyone works together. The management valued my opinions, my progress and was very encouraging. My co-workers all worked together and helped others catch up and keep up the pace. The hardest part of the job at first was remember all of the procedures throughout the day, after a few days of training everything came together. The most enjoyable part of the job was the gratifying feeling of making a customer happy and knowing my progress was improving thanks to the team and management."
good,"was given a lot of responsibility, but it felt like home for a long time helped me become a better manager though a lot of trial and error"
good,"Fun place of work ,and exciting people love coming to work everyday my co-workers made it fun ."
good,"Ross is a great place to work at.  All associates are awesome people and easy to get along with.  The managers are great, very helpful and do their job very well.  I would have to say the hardest part of my job is dealing with all the different customers and making them happy and have a great shopping experience but it is nothing I can not handle.  The most enjoyable part would have to be working with all my associates and knowing I have there help with anything that I need."
good,"My typical day was filled with ringing up customers, exchanging/returning items, processing returns in the fitting room, re-stocking merchandise, setting up displays, helping customers with item selection/concerns/questions, and cleaning and organizing the sales floor.  For the most part management was very friendly/understanding about employee concerns.  They were involved with customers as well as employees.  I worked with great people who had great work ethics.  Towards the end of my time there that changed a bit.  The hardest part of the job was the high peak hours when the store became busy but I also saw it as an opportunity to challenge myself.  The most enjoyable part was helping/talking to the customers."
good,Been weekly Star from leading the team to buddy training and creating a fun environment through respect and recognition.
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy and having to have customer service throughout the day making them feel welcome. Also having fast work skills to keep things going throughout the store. What I learned form working at Ross is always be on your feet working fast and also having customer serivce to assist your customers. Management at Ross was great they knew how to handle problems and be a team player for the other assoicates. My co-workers were great too, everyone knew how to be a team player and give a helping hand when need. The hardest part about this job would have to be trying to keep everyone content and trying to keep the store clean throughout the day. The most enjoyable thing about this job is creating friendships with my co-workers and also having a experience to learn with this company expanding my knowledge in a sales assoicate job."
good,"I am greeted by all of my managers and co-workers when i start my shift. And I immediately get started with my work. The management is really nice and helpful. If I ask for help they don't judge or give attitude, they nicely show me how to do the task.The hardest part of the job is closing. I would say that is the hardest part because there is so much to do in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers faces when they find good deals at our store."
good,"During the day, the management team discusses the goals that are expected to be completed by the end of the day and we can do to achieve those goals. My co-workers are kind and willing to help whenever they can."
good,i worked as a sales associate and a member of the stock team. sometimes i do work on the cash register. I mostly unload the trucks and put out the merchandise one the sales floor. I would also do pricing and packaging.
good,"A good place to work.  Mobility is feasible with a ""can do attitude"" and hard work ethic.  I was a summer employee.  [I am not currently employed there.  My contract was only for summer employment.]"
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in and then going to costumer service to see which tasks and department you have been assigned and then you get right to work. I learned that retail can be fun and meeting new people makes the workday go by fast. Management was good and always helpful. The hardest part of the job was trying to please your co workers, even when you couldn't, for example covering shifts. The most enjoyable part was clocking in everyday knowing that the today would be better than yesterday. "
good,"A typical day of work consisted of me providing customers with service and helping to exchange or refund a customer, keeping work area clean and at the end of the day preparing store for the next day. What i learned was how stores are ran behind the scenese. Management was ok and co-workers were good. The hardest part of the job was at the end of the day cleaning up store for the next day. The most enjoyable part of the job was working on my own and getting things done with little supervision."
good,I've learned a lot working for Ross Dress for Less. I've learned how to manage a $14 million dollar store and staying within payroll. On a daily bases you are managing more than 20 people at a time. The hardest part of the job was learning how to deal with the customers because it was a very high diverse area.
good,Working at Ross Dress For Less helped me realize how great it is to work there because of the atmosphere and the management that was going on during the time I was there. I felt wanted and needed and it is a place where I achieved most of my goals.
good,"I mostly work the register and it makes time go by fast. We're always doing something. One minute you're ringing guests up non-stop and then when the line finally disappears, you have to clean up your area. When I'm not ringing, I'm putting hangers away, taking nubs off of hangers, putting sensors in their appropriate bins, etc."
good,great staff some great management
good,"Friendly people, great customers, Given great opportunities within the job while working there."
good,i worked 2nd shift we went in everyone would just sit around and talk (mind you) i went to work a little early everyday i was to work.. clock in time i would clock in go to my work area and get to work it was a every fun job open area so you could see everyone which made more the wide:)

good,I loved the dress code.. Meeting new people.. It didnt seem like work at all..Really enjoyed it
good,"A normal day of work was filing and answering phone calls. Didnt really learn to much because my work load or responsibilities never changed. I loved my supervisor, she was eventually transfered to admissions and requested that I was transfered also. She admired my work habits and I admired her faith in me as an employee. I always worked on a shift by myself so I was not able to experience working with the other workers. I didnt have any difficult moments but I did enjoy the quiet work environment."
good,I really like ross because it has all the nececities of a household and accesories for everyone.
good,Day began with the daily truck shipment
good,"Everything is Good, From The Co-workers To Just Working There Period. There Is Never A Dull Day Working At Ross."
good,"A typical day at work as a cashier was a good learning experience for me. With this being my first job ever I had to learn how to communicate and work well with others. My manager was a very cool and undrstanding individual. I really enjoyed working for her. My co-workers were like a family during these couple months of work at Ross, we got to know to know a bit about one another. The hardest part of this job was cleaning the store when it closed at night. We had clothing,toys, etc. everywhere by the end of the day. But the most enjoyable part of the job was working with others to accomplish one common goal everyday."
good,Great company with lots of job security. You work alongside some of the smartest people in retail. Pre-season strategies are draining though.
good,"I like showing how I work, more than writing about how I work...just because anyone can tell you the stuff you want to hear, That's why I like showing."
good,"I learned from my job there what actually goes on behind the scenes before all product is put out on the sales floor. I learned that Ross Stores carry alot of different products, than just clothing."
good,A typical day at work was a good day at work where it seemed as if all customers were in a good mood. I learned what working in retail felt like and how Ross stores but out there merchandise.The management was good it seemed as if they all knew their position and were helpful to both the customers and employees. All my co-workers were very friendly and helpful.The hardest part was having to do go backs when i was not sure of where the items belonged but once i got the hang of it everything was good.The most enjoyable part of working to me is helping the customer i love helping people and making people happy.
good,this job was an up beat work experience for me i enjoyed helping customers and being a cashier and reecovering different departments of the store how ever the pay could have been alot more and the benefits could have been better but what do you expect from a department store i enjoyed working with the other co workers and the managers always made it fun and they always made me feel like i was apart of the team
good,A typical day at work would me unloading trucks and stocking the floor of the store. I learned how to work as a group on projects. My manger was 1 of the best and nicest person i ever met. Work in a group and getting to know people was fun i still keep in touch with my old co-workers. There wasn't really and hard part all of the work was fun. When i worked over night it gave me a chance to really get to know all my co-workers and make friends.
good,Ross has nice discounts but the pay is horrible. I had a good time working with people i came encountered with my co-workers customers and managers they were awesome.The worse about the job is working so hard for a very little check but overall its a fun enviroment.
good,"Every day is a new challenge in merchandise presentation, ensuring TRUE Customer Experience, managing workload/payroll/loss prevention and developing staff for promotional opportunities."
good,"A typical day at Ross= BUSY! There is always something to do. you will remain busy during entire shift, which is awesome for a person like myself who love to constantly be on the move. If you want a boring job Ross is not for you."
good,Ross belives deeply in developing its associates for advancement within the company.
good," Recommended, selected and helped locate or obtain merchandise based on customer needs."
good,"started day off at about 530 unloaded trucks seprated clothing ,taged them as well"
good,"Great place to work met new people and learned new things.Managment was always on top of everything and had no difficult times working here.I can say theres never a hard part to ur job if u really want to work or theres"" no buts"", I also enjoyed working in the stockroom."
good,Had a great time at this job. Lunch break was always amazing since I was right across the street from the beach! Management and co-workers couldn't be better. The hardest part of the job was def. having to wake up at 3:30 AM to go to the morning stocking hours before the store opened.
good,"the store is a busy one. everyday you would learn something new. Management is always willing to train, co-workers are nice and polite."
good,"As a store manager I had many responsibilities within the company. I supervised, trained, and scheduled all employees."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company and indeed learned all kind of new tasks. Especially working around customers and co-workers was an interesting experience. The hardest part of the job, was having to quit my job.I wished I never did."
good,The management and my co workers were very helpful and made the job easy to learn and always want to be there.
good,"1. A typical day at Ross Stores starts off with coming on time and switching with the LP on duty. I have my uniform on and stand at my station to get ready for the day, i keep my eyes out for any suspicious activity, do perimeter walks of the store, greet customers in a friendly manner, and answer to any safety concerns around the store. 2. What i have learned about working at Ross is how to be a strong commanding authority presence in a respectful way. 3. Management at Ross is great, 4. My co-workers we are great team to work with. 5. I would have to say there is no hard part about my job, i enjoy what i do. 6. The most enjoyable part about my job is the respect i get and the fact that i can help stop loss of my company."
good,We observe large amounts of people everyday on the strip and customer service those large groups of people as well.
good,Ross is a all around good company. Due to Ross i have picked up many traits and have improved my all around well being. People around me were fun and warming and it shows you alot of what goes into being a TEAM.
good,It was a very fun and nice place to work. Every one there were very nice and good to work with. The management was just as nice as the co-workers. They would help you if you need them such as your breaks and lunch they would cover you if there was no one else. The hardest part of my job was work at customer serves because some of the customers were really mean and nasty with what they would call you if they could not get their way. But the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and work with the people I worked with.
good,"A morning shift which started a few hours before the store opened to the public. Required to recieve incoming products, unpackage them, then take them to there proper place within the store. The co-workers were nice and helpful. The managers were nice. The hardest part would have been first starting off but after I got used to it, I became a better worker."
good,"I worked in the stockroom so everyday was almost the same as far as doing the tasks. The team unloaded the truck, opened boxes, separated the merchandise by category and restocked the shelves. Teamwork is really important in that job. The hardest part of the job was having a big truck with a lot of boxes because then we would have to really rush to get done on time. But I liked working in a team to accomplish something that would benefit the whole store. It made me feel proud."
good,"I had the opportunity to be part of team that opened their two largest distribution centers in Socal. Very challenging and very rewarding, being able to start up a business of this magnitude. Great team."
good,Ross gives you ample amount of work and challenges to solve.
good,Great place to work to gain customer service expirience. I really liked working as a cashier at Ross.
good,Only worked here for a short amount of time. The time I did work there wasn't so bad.
good,It is a good job to have while looking for my Career. I was able to work nights during the time that I was in school and they are very understanding about it.
good,If you have a shopping addiction this is not the place for you. It's an easy job if you know what you are doing. I like some of the benefits that come with working here.
good,Ross was a great place to work it was a fun place very strict but it was a great atmosphere and managers only expect the best and wont accept anything less so you are pushed to be good.
good,i enjoyed working at Ross it was a great experience and enjoyed working with the Ross staff
good,Working here allowed me to improve my customer service skills and use good communication skills in order to get tasks completed. Coworkers work well together.
good,Ross is a good first job if you’re trying to get into retail or cashiering in general over all the people are extremely nice and most people do look out for each other when it comes to upper management though like a corporate that is when this company starts to decline as they are very very not interested in their employees
good,A good job it’s just management can be horrible as they try to do too much with scheduling and other things. Like sometimes they don’t care about other associates life outside of work.
good,"I enjoy cashiering, as it is fast paced and constant movement, along with short interactions with many different people. I like the management, they are kind and open. For the most part, the workplace is friendly and allows you to get to know your coworkers and become friends. The slow parts of the job are right after holidays and right before school starts and ends."
good,Work atmosphere changes with the staff. Started with young managers with no experience dealing with staff. Now older management is a lot more professional. Hiring more older adults to balance out the younger adults. Not so much as a high school vibe anymore. Which is a good thing.
good,Overall nice place to work.Managers all worked together to get job done.Staff of team members knowledgeable and very competent.Iselda still stands out as one of The Best Store Managers I've ever worked with.
good,"There is never a dull moment in this job, there is always something that needs to be done and you learn quickly how to manage your time efficiently. Management is always there to help you but there re times when you need to make a call on your own. The hardest part is getting through the long lines as some people may have an item or two, while others will have baskets full of items and it's sometimes difficult to know how much help you actually need. I find this job to be satisfying however as it's taught me a lot about managing my time and leading others."
good,"I learned a lot working at Ross. Overall it was a good environment. Felt like it could of had a better management team, was sort of unorganized at certain a times. Helped with my costumer service skill most definitely,."
good,"The pay is basically minimum wage and they won’t give you full time unless you are in management. However it’s easy to get hired and they are very flexible with your schedule. The management is also really great at the store I work at, and the people I work with are as well."
good,No down time for anyone. Must be able to multitask. Must push team to be productive. Fun place to work every day was different must keep busy to be successful
good,I really enjoy the system they have in place regarding all the internals of the company. Company culture is very good too and I enjoy it. It is a great first job and good company to work for.
good,"Ross is a company that actually rewards hard work. I have worked at two different locations where my hard work has paid off and shown me results that I can take pride in. While each location is different and has a different management style, the company itself takes care of its associates and looks after them in multiple ways and I would recommend this company as a good starting point for anyone with interest in the retail world. It is very process driven and can you the ins and outs of customer service and retail management."
good,"Ross is an alright company to work for. Long termvi think is a little unrealistic. But other than that it's okay. People are friendly, vibes are okay."
good,Good  company to build with. They helped work through college. Flexible schedule around class schedules. The management team at the time of my departure was lacking but it was soon remedied.
good,"they had a really chill environment but sometime it would get stressful but they would send help when needed, and coworkers where always nice and i missed them when i left"
good,"I like my job and it's good managers support you and help you keep your job, they work with you when you going through your personal problems they make sure your happy with your job and schedule and the amount of hours your getting they are great people!"
good,definitely not a place for any one who is lazy or slow moving.  its not really a job for younger people . the management is harsh a little. not really a hard job overall
good,"A typical day here at Ross will usually consist of an assigned task such as cashiering, fitting room, sales floor, and stock. you learn skills that are definitely useful for other jobs related to retail. The hardest part of the job is patience and standing for long hours. The most enjoyable part is communication with customers and employees."
good,"I actually really liked working for Ross . Co-workers were excellent , the management is really good . The only thing that made me not want to work for the company no more was the fact that hours were getting dropped tremendously."
good,I think it's nice to work at ross warehouse. People help you when you need help even the supervisors . It's a peaceful place and a god job. and it has god benefits for you .
good,"Not sure if it was just my Ross but management is awesome. There’s plenty of room to advance if you show interest and work quickly and efficiently. They are always opening new stores and always hiring people on and promoting from within. No benefits for part timers except"
good,"Working at Ross was a good experience, although I was only a temp. Everyone got along just fine. There is room to advance. Best part is that you work Monday-Friday 5:45 am 10:45 am"
good,Buen trabajo buen sueldo fue un lugar amigable hay compañerismo supervisora muy buena persona es un lugar muy recomendable para trabajar buen descuento personal
good,"Working at Ross is a good experience for those who enjoy retail. The customers are usually polite, the staff is great, everyone always says hello to you. It's very easy to make friends and usually if you need a shift covered there is always someone there who has your back. The pay is very good compared to other jobs I have had previously. The only downside to working here is that they can't always guarantee hours. There will be days where you come in for your shift and the truck has been cancelled or payroll is messed up and they send you home, or call you the day before not to come in. Although there are some days where they need you and call you in or ask you to stay longer to help make up for hours, but it can be inconsistent."
good,"I wouldn't be able to give any up to date information about Ross. When I worked there over 14 years ago, it was fun and fast paced. I worked there while pregnant and when my manager found out, he immediately put me on the registers or let me sit at the dressing room because he didn't want me bending down to pick things up or lifting anything."
good,I like working for Ross but just not enough  hours.Hours will be cut or you get less hours  Some get more hours than  others. Its a good company if you wang a lay back job.
good,"Fast paced environment have to be very hands on."
good,"If you are willing to work hard and actually want to learn how to do your job right by being the best at it, you can move up in the company easily. By being a hard worker who actually loves their job and enjoy working will get all the hours they so desire as well as Ross will accommodate your hours to work for your home life. When I came back to Ross, I was pregnant and started in the stock room processing apparel; my co-workers did all my heavy lifting and pulled the heavy racks to the salesfloor for me to empty; when I had a Dr's note to rest my feet, they allowed me that moment. I then moved to cashier as well as customer service taking returns; Ross is very fast paced on busier than others days and their system needs you working fast and getting the customers checked out quickly and happily; customers can be heads or tails, some difficult and some are happy just because you thanked them, greeted, acknowledged their long wait, or and was patient and smiled. My favorite part of my job is the customers and seeing familiar faces weekly. I eventually moved to fitting room. As a fitting room person you must be the eyes of Ross's back end; you must be efficient and count all garments, check the fitting rooms as well as restrooms. People may underestimate fitting room people but its just as busy and crazy as the registers. You cannot let the fast pace of the store overwhelm you. If you are likely to get overwhelmed or easily angered this is not the job for you. I later became SPS Loss prevention security; my job then was to maintain the safety of the store, customers, employees"
good,"I really like to work at Ross it is a great opportunity to meet new people, and for you to work in a friendly atmosphere. It also has an amazing pay, And the works there are very helpful."
good,"When I reflect on my time and what I learned from Ross. I must say I enjoyed and learned a lot from my time at Ross. The Mangers at Ross had an open door policy, they were always open to listen, they took the time to try and get know each employee."
good,"Great financially stable company - very fast paced with focus on doing things right.  Provide support needed to accomplish goals but sometimes you have to ask.  Would like to see more people who look like me in leadership roles"
good,Working in the dressing room or helping people pick out things to buy. Working the cashier was the easiest because all I did was scan items and bag them.
good,"Working at ross is not all bad, I think because of the location that I am in, it requires a lot more patience. Customers are very rude, but that is where your good customer service skills come into play. Everyone that I worked with were are friendly and was like family. Ross is a team job and we all have to work together to make sure our stores meets its needs and requirements."
good,"This jobs really requires you to be a people person. But, as long as you are you will really enjoy it. I have amazing customer service skills and enjoyed working in retail."
good,I experienced retail for the first time when I started here. Ross has a very relaxing atmosphere and I would recommend a part time position for anyone looking for something relaxing but steady-paced
good,This was my first job and it was fun to work at. I learned a lot of work ethics here and I loved my co workers. I was always able to be myself and advancements were given to those who deserved it.
good,Working in a great atmosphere where everyone around you has a great personality need new friends also experiencing a different customers who come in from all over the United States what are their business family were just now moving into this day it’s a great experience
good,"It is a very good workplace would like to have a better shift but the hours they give are great and they care about their employees, would recommend friends and family"
good,"Ross has great employees, and everyone works as a team. It can be very paced which is great for fast  learners. My favorite part was feeling like a family with everyone. Everyone was patient with me and it's great for part-time work and college students. I don't know what the full-time positions consist of but I left because I needed something with more accommodating hours and a full-time position."
good,My time spent with Ross was enjoyable. It was easy work and flexible hours. i particularly liked that you could set your availability. The pay was fair.
good,Its a nice and good work place to work at yet very busy. I learn a lot as in how to do differcent tasks as once and having good customer service. Management there is kind of poor but getting a lil better. The hardest part of the job is making sure getting things done on time and keeping store clean. Most enjoyable part is working with others with postive attuides.
good,"Ross really cares about their employees and it shows. Every person I worked with in the management level was outstanding. There is a ton of room to grow with Ross too so if you're looking for a career but don't have a ton of experience, head over to Ross."
good,You can advance as far as you want with this company.  It is truly a great company to work for if you are in the retail field.  Cons are the work life balance.  No matter what your job title there is no regular schedule which makes it difficult on families.
good,"The work environment and atmosphere is friendly. Everyone depends on each other and works as a team. The pay is average. Benefits are good for the cost. Flexible schedules allow for planning work around your life instead of planning life around work. There is always something new to work on in addition to the everyday things. Great place for people who need consistency as well as those who crave fast paced, constant change. In my experience. There is also room for career advancement through the MAP assessment program and internship opportunities. Scholarship programs are available for employees and their dependents. Overall, a good company to work for in retail."
good,"Working at Ross is okay, nothing too special. One thing I enjoyed about Ross is that employees always have the opportunity to grow in the business. The one downside was managements communication."
good,"Ross seemed to have struck the right balance between scale of store and customer service focuses.  They even have a very reasonable approach to peak shopping seasons, like Black Friday, which makes the holidays enjoyable again for retail workers."
good,Fast paced great environment great hours great place help you move up if that’s what you want to do. Recommend working at Ross to anyone looking for a job
good,"We are always training and up dating with corporate changes. Management try's to listen to employee's concerns. Our management team takes care of the issues right away. "
good,"Great opportunity for growth with the company with many store openings and positions available,but very demanding management expectations on a day to day basis."
good,The job starts out with you stating the information for sps which is your sir report and best in class . Workplace culture is relaxed management usually over stressed . The hardest part of the job is to try and watch the areas that are blind spot without leaving your post.
good,"I did this over the summer as a second job and enjoyed it. The only part I did not enjoy was my stint as security because a lot of people will try to steal stuff. Being a cashier was simple once you figured out how to take the security alarms off and fitting rooms were simple to run. I never put stock out on the floor, but replacing misplaced stock after the store closes was never a huge hassle. We often finished early and left up to a half hour after closing, when normally it takes an hour after closing to put everything back where it belongs."
good,"Overall it's a great place to work for"
good,This is very fast paced working place. You will enjoy working at Ross. It’s an easy place to work and easy place to learn new things. I love being a Ross associate
good,The job was fun but it wasn't a job if your taking care of a family . This job is a good part time job if you want to make a little extra on the side .
good,"Ross Dress for Less Store 1032 has hard time retaining Managers. This issue affect employees most of the time a new manager comes in.  Some employees do not like  changes, so they don't really welcome the new managers."
good,pay is competitive and work life balance is good however the culture is very old and conservative. I would recommend to those who are looking for job security and manageable work load.
good,I liked working for Ross it was an learning experience. Had great management.you had to watch movies to learn how store ran and then take test I felt those were very helpful.
good,"it helps you become mentally stronger "
good,"In my time working at Ross i was able to always change my availability and hours, since I am attending school they were understandable when i needed time off for a school project or school events and they were good trainers when it would come to changing me in to a new job position."
good,"The work environment was typically very relaxed and smooth going. This is where i learned how to manage a cash register. "
good,"I didn't mind working at Ross. I liked my coworkers and management, but they just don't pay well. Fast paced and expect lazy customers because it is a ""discount: store."
good,"Great people, became a family during the that I was there. Very flexible with my hours. Have fun and do your job. You are constantly doing something, so find a rhythm to it and it’ll be easy. Follow the rules when doing everything."
good,"It's retail so it can get kind of crazy on the weekends but it could also be very slow as well during the week. Management was great, and worked around my school schedule and other job. Sometimes, mostly on the weekends, we had to work short staffed, that was not fun at all."
good,i really like working here always wanted to work in a retail. its a good company to work with the workplace culture is really good and your good work is always recognized. i learned lot of new things and everyday there is something new to learn here.
good,Work at Ross was okay. My typical day at ross included unloading the truck and unboxing the merchandise. Then i organized the merchandise and separated them by departments. After that i had to load the merchandise on to the carts and take them on to the sales floor. From their i stock the shelves. I worked the morning shift 5:30 am to whatever time they let us clock out. The other employees were nice.They were mostly female and the majority were latino. My supervisors were kind and strict at the same time.I would say the best part of working at Ross is the experience and great work ethic you develop.The hardest part is the low pay and short hours.
good,Honestly it's not a bad job and maybe this was just strictly at my location but... I. GOT. NO. HOURS. like I'm not even joking. I worked 4-8 hours a week and even when I asked for more hours they still never gave me any. Imagine being a college student on her own like that's physically impossible to survive off of. I was better off but no places were hiring at the time.
good,I like Ross. The staff is super friendly. The work with you if you are a college student. If you need days off they try their best to  fit u in. So there overall experience is excellent
good,"Working at Ross was nice, it was like going to a second family because everyone was so kind, the only issue I had was sometimes the managers would play favorites."
good,"The company is great, and it is an easy, but rewarding job. I would have stayed a long time had it not been for poor management at my particular location. "
good,I enjoyed my time working for Ross. The employees were very enjoyable regardless of their position. Customers were very easy to help find specific merchandise. It is very easy to stay busy during each shift as the goals would frequently change. Completing each task was very possible to accomplish before the end of any shift.
good,"They train you in all areas of the store, this includes; cashiering, fitting room, soft lines (clothes), and hard lines (everything else). As part of ending shift, it is important to work quickly so that you don't have to stay later. Hard lines especially was difficult for me."
good,This is a great place to start working and learn new skills. They can provide you many opportunities as you can show work performance to received the promotion. The work environment is only as good as you make it. Overall you can make it work as a temporary or long term career at Ross Stores DC.
good,"They where great to work with . Out standing work hours , incredible pay , out standing work place              Highly recommendation to this job     You should apply"
good,"I learned many different aspect of a retailer position . Getting your assignment then go to the area and follow up, making items are in the right area if not then you put it where it belongs. Make your area organized and cleaned. Help customers find an item. Work as a team with other employees"
good,"I started off seeking new jobs opportunities work was slow and I started working at ross. It was slow not completive, non the less it was an easy job the work that they expected from you was very minimal. Everyone was very friendly and easy to work with. Management was very fair with you. working at ross was very easy and relaxed."
good,"it's a friendly environment, but we have to work very fast, you have the manager on your neck, always hurrying you. sometimes the merchandise already on the sales floor, are unorganized, and its harder for the stock team to stock the new merchandise"
good,Good growing company lots to do never dull moment great merchandise good discounts friendly coworkers typical retail be prepared for hard work and you will excel.
good,Working at Ross teaches you communications skills. It allows you to understand people more and connect with them when they need your help whether it be finding a product or successfully completing their transactions.
good,Managers were very nice friendly and understanding theres morning meetings. They are very motivating. Everyone helps each other out when needed its all good.
good,"The team I worked with was magnificent, including the management.It was a job that could make you not hate going in everyday. The only issues with it were the lack of full time opportunities (rarely allowed to work more than 25 hours in a week) and the low ( though normal for retail) pay. Great discounts, and overall easy work. Definitely recommend for a first job or additional income, but may be difficult to make a living. \"
good,"The structure is there however the management team is nit always strong. Associates don't stay on processes, which takes away from the productivity.  The pay could be better."
good,I enjoy this job due to the job opportunities. You can grown within this fortune 400 company. The discounts and perks within this company as an associate are nice as well.
good,"Everyone's a team player, always new roll out plans for floor plans. Something always to do and many projects that have deadlines that must meet time frame. Many visits from corporate which can make things a bit stressful."
good,Getting 10% off of already discount items is always exciting. Not having enough hours is not. Often times there is only four associate in a store very
good,"You learn how to clean, organize shelves and racks, help customers and eventually how to use the register. They have flexible hours. It is a great first time job."
good,I worked at Ross in Shreveport for almost a year as a part time FES Managers are willing to work around your busy school schedule and the work is not hard.
good,Ross is very open environment everyone knows everyone and are very kind. The space is very clean they compliment this particular store all the time due to the cleanliness of the workers and staff. There is just not enough hours for me there at this time.
good,"The environment of the work place overall is very chill and laid back, but still structured. My experience here was great because I had great management who was willing to listen to me not only when I was just a cashier but later when I got the position of front End supervisor when there were issues in the store or with the way they do things as management."
good,"Learned a lot of stuff for example, how to be cashier, be a better customer service. The hardest when costumers are not satisfied and scream at you when you can't control the store, and rules."
good,"The store environment is amazing and the work crew is really dedicated. If you're looking for a fun part-time job with a pretty nice employee discount, I'd definitely recommend ross."
good,Good company to work for.  There is a very understanding management to work with and great hours and benefits to achieve. Overall great team to be apart of.
good,"The job is beneficial and very productive, you have a lot of benefits and it's a great opportunity to make a honest living and provide for your family"
good,This company was great to work for.  They had training available not only for management but for the associates as well that would help them to succeed not only in their current job but if they went elsewhere.  My store manager and the team he had under him worked together to get the job done.  I was moved to another store by my district manager that was in need of a lot of help. I managed to turn the store around within 4 months but I never had the support that I needed to keep it successful
good,Excellent job.  I will go back in a heart beat if I was able to go back.  Suffered a Work injury at Safeway and I am looking for a new job in the field that I was trained for.
good,Working at Ross really tests one's ability to multitask. Starting off as an associate expect to be thrown around from the cashier to the sales floor going back and forth. One moment running go backs to being called on the loud speaker to return to the cash register not fully completing the go backs. The hours worked vary weekly and are based on availability. One thing about Ross is the accommodations the managers make to work with one's schedule. Going to school or having to take care of personal responsibilities the managers will work with the schedule but one has to be willing to work the hours given. Also expect to be called in on days off since employees frequently call out especially since most positions are part time. Take the hours you can get because some weeks one can expect a 25 hour work week to a 12 hour work week. Overall the experience is great especially as a great foundation to entering retail and gaining communication skills.
good,very great place to work if you are looking to grow your potential. very busy place to work. i learned how to multi task and the most fun is when ever the job was done.
good,"Great company to work for, awesome opportunities given to dedicated employees to move up. Had 4 amazing store managers while working for the company who were there to provide guidance and knowledge and wanted to see the team succeed."
good,"ross was a great place to meet and see new people everyday, working their was a great opportunity to help me help others finding what they were looking for in home decor or clothing. The workplace and management was amazingly well put together."
good,"Very fast-paced work environment with some unruly customers. While this job is extremely fast-paced and definitely based around making the customer happy, it is very rewarding in a training aspect."
good,"Management is very organized and pushes employees to do their best work in a variety of feilds. Employees gain a variety of skills by working on different roles each day. However, a large part of your job will be trying to reduce shrink."
good,"Ross Dress for Less provided an enjoyable and positive work environment. Management, coworkers and customers were all very pleasant and kind. There were no opportunities for benefits or advancement within the company. However the work itself was fast-paced, fun, and rewarding."
good,"great people and managers, great training and patience, you learn alot in a short amount of time, employers and employees get along good, simple tasks"
good,Offered different shift allow student employee to work and still able to go to school. Give you a lot of different training for the job.
good,Its like a upgraded theft store accept every thing is new. The place is always packed and you can get stuck on register for hours without a break. The store gets messy fast so your consistently recovering it.
good,"Working here was enjoyable, I worked hard every shift, and gave 110% every time. I learned how to be quick under a busy work environment, my managers and coworkers had a lot to do with that, giving advice and motivation every time I needed it. Keeping up with everyone else was difficult at first but I got the hang of it. Learning how to keep up had to be the funnest part."
good,"unloading the delivery truck in an assembly line style, sorting the delivery into carts and sending the carts onto their respective area of the floor/department. unloading the carts wihin each department tagging all necessary items with their respective security devices. re organizing everything in you assigned department and greeting everyone you see"
good,I liked working on cashier but fittingroom was very stressful. I was the only one most of the time when there had to be 2 in a fitting room. Overall experience was great!
good,"At least at this Ross, management is great! They work hard to make it a great place to work. They're liberal with acknowledging employees when they do a good job. Pay is okay; no more than what  you would expect for a retail job. "
good,"Is a excellent team, buy I think the company still have to work on it, because they don't give hour to they associate and the pay is not good"
good,Working here I learned so much about customer service and customer appreciation. I also learned how to be an effective manager in various aspects.
good,"hours and days are amazing"
good,"A typical day at work would start by going in and checking what we got assigned to organize, after we clocked in. I learned how to organize the material and clothes, I also learned how to be a cashier and work on the register. My co-workers were amazing, very helpful."
good,Management is understanding and also supportive. Customer service is a must due to daily interaction with individuals.
good,"I was hired on at the store opening and have been there every since, our work load is heavy at times but the co-workers/managers with the company go above and beyond to help one another. Ross is one of the most family oriented jobs i've ever worked for."
good,"I love working at Ross, but I am looking for something that works better with my family life (less weekend and night shifts) and that pay more money. Ross is a great company to work for because it is growing and there is job security, the biggest downside is the pay. It is not enough to support a family unless you are at least a Store Manager."
good,"This job was fun, with great supervisors and great employees. The workplace is clean and the customers are always great! They are always hiring, even though they have no hours, so new people will come in and get 5 days work time, and older employees will only get one or two days."
good,sales associate. merchandising. I learned how to give great customer service. management was great and very helpful as well as my co-workers. the hardest part of the job was closing because we will not leave until 2am most nights. the most enjoyable part of the job being with my co-workers and customers.
good,"Learned the entire store operation and have enjoyed each position."
good,"A typical day would consist of gathering returns and putting back in right section, answering phone, cleaning up, and gathering from dressing room to put on correct racks."
good,A very great place to start to gain experience in as a customer service representative.  A lot of room for advancement and a place to grow as a person.  Has values that they base the way the store is ran  and to be more helpful to their employees.  A good place that has great people working for them.
good,"I work as loss prevention and I hate my job but it is only because I am not the type of person to just stand at the door and greet people.  If you're into that then I say go for it! They are very flexible with hours and I had fun, It's just that I don't like the idea of standing in one place all day."
good,Management genuinely cares for their employees and respects them. They want their employees to learn and thus are more than willing to help them become the best they can.
good,Working at Ross i learned how to do markdowns and i also learned how to stock the merchandise. I also know how to arrange all the clothing in the correct order and format.
good,"Working at Ross is nice. I get to help customers by answering questions, finding them treasures, or even just speaking with them while checking them out. It can be rewarding."
good,My Co-workers were great as without them we would not have become the great team that we became. Management was good with the typical red tape from corporate. I learned a lot from my time with Ross and value it all.
good,Working at Ross Dress for Less I was able to have better customer service and become more of a people's person. Work scheduling could use a little work but other than that my time there was great.
good,"As supervisor I must admit that I have acquired a great skill set. With each there are challenging tasks and I'm always building great rapport with customers. There are many shoppers that have questions regarding merchandise, price adjustments and so forth that keeps me on my toes. I have learned how to be confident with my judgement, keep the customer happy and stay true to Ross policy. Before stepping into this position, I did not understand how returns were processed, how to price items or mark the price down because of opened packages and so forth. This position has helped me prioritize and better use my assistance through my co-workers. The entire team are genuine helpers and this makes the day more enjoyable. However, this doesn't compare to Tuesdays, Senior day, when I'm able to converse with the customers and see their smiling faces when I give them their discount. There truthfully isn't a hard part of the job!"
good,"I have worked for Ross for 6 years.  During my employment, I was able to earned my Bachelor Degree.  My manager, previous managers, and Supervisors were able to work with my schedule so I can attend school. "
good,"we would enter the building start our paperwork for the day, verify safe and cash deposit. work on projects in our department. Then we would receive the shipment truck. Give breaks and lunches to associates, audit cashiers and finish our paperwork for the day."
good,"I experienced a lot of diversity at Ross. I loved working here, I enjoyed the people and the skills they taught me. This is where I realized that I was a people person and I was meant to help people."
good,"Saturdays are the busy days, where you don't even get to feel your legs. But it gets greater, when you get true card because of your responsibilities."
good,Coming into work welcomed by fellow co-workers. I enjoy learning more about ROSS and its policies and the people that plays a part of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job are Mondays which are markdown days.
good,One of the best parts of working in Retail are the customers! Every day is someone new and something new to learn. Being up front means that you are the face of the company. My day starts with reading the closing teams notes and remarks. My tasks depend on what shift I am working that day.
good,"Great environment to work in, fast paced, associates are great, and great company for growth."
good,"A typical day at work is ensuring staff and store is functioning properly. Training staff. "

good,"-A typical day as a night stock associate would be unloading trucks, nothing to bad. Everyone is always friendly, all smiles. I learned that conversing with people of different cultured co workers can teach you alot even in the workplace. The hardest part of the job would just be having to be at the store till 5 in the morning but that is not something terrible. The most enjoyable part of the job would be to see my co workers and them being so helpful and kind to one another."
good,Ross Company develops and gives recognition to there team.
good,"Working in retail is a fulfilling job offering opportunities to utilize marketing skills, communication skills and encouragement skills. The population in which you work with share the same qualities and desires that you share for the job. This allows for the staff to easily get along and work well together. The hardest part in working in retail is ensuring that each consumer is satisfied in their product selection."
good,I really enjoyed the time I worked at Ross. That was my first job and from the time I started until the time I stopped working their I was always embraced ad treated with respect. I just felt like with me having a four year old child it was time for me to start looking for a job that was more stable and with a set schedule.
good,I enjoyed working there the people were nice and the managers were very helpful
good,"enjoyed helping customers "
good,Help customers with there transaction and answerand question they may have.Co-workers all did there job to the best of there ability.
good,"I looked forward to going into work for the simple fact that my peers were all a good group of hard working people who brings great personality to the store. Management really worked with me when i first started off my employment in the stockroom. I expressed myself to the store manager that i would like to move up in the company in which they trained me as a Store protection specialist (LP). With my training came the hardest part of my employment , self educating  myself of all the store policies, procedures and codes of conduct. With learning all those things i discovered how complex a business can be and how it is ran while at the same time i can feed off of managements great example into a store of my own."
good,"A typical day at Ross is arriving at the store at 6 in the morning and begin unloading the trucks. Once all merchandise was unloaded from trucks we would begin to stock merchandise throughout the store in the appropriate places. As the other employees opened up the stores the rest of the employees would be in the stock room unpacking clothing and shoes, tagging them with price tags and alarm sensors and placing them on the racks in the appropriate places. After we finished with all of that we would run the racks out onto the floor and proceed putting the clothing in their appropriate places. I think the hardest part of any retail job is employees don't get paid enough for the amount of stress they're expected to take on."
good,receive stock and then organize and put on shelves. monitored theft in store as also greeting customers and helping them put bulky purchases in their car.
good,"Working at Ross was an overall good experience. The day to day schedule was very dynamic with a sense of urgency to reach our daily goals. Typically, productions goals were set through a series of meetings in which Department Managers, Directors, and the VP would attend. Each shift would have a ""Production Meeting"" which would set, adjust goals based on how the day was proceeding. My co-workers were team oriented and very easy to partner and work with."
good,Great place to interact with customers while getting the job done
good,A typical day at Ross is always busy. A lot of people come there to find brand name items for a discounted price. I've learned that customers love a helping hand every once in a while and whenever they ask. I've also learned that customers love a fun environment. The management is great. The co-workers I had were very nice and very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job would be also being busy. There was never a dull moment.
good,"-Typical day at work."
good,"Very fast pace, learned to deal with different issues with customers on a dailey bases. Enjoy one on one with customers. Letting them know that I am here to help in any way. Building the trust with associates."
good,A typical day was very busy. Lots of customers with few cashiers. Enjoyed the staff and management at this location.
good,"Management is helpful. Coworkers are pretty cool. Customers are nice at times but they of course always want something more like an extra discount. Typical day would be clocking in, checking to see where you'll be working and doing your sizing. They have it laid out of what time your breaks will be. They recognize their employees hard work and have frequent parties which include free lunch/dinner. Plus 20% off and 40% every few months. Hardest part is putting stuff away at closing after a extremely busy day."
good,Unloading trucks and hanging clothes from 8-4 in a backroom is the typical day for me. Management came in and helped out if we had big loads they were very friendly. Being able to talk and joke around while working with co-workers made the day go by smoothly and fast. I enjoyed all my co-workers and management team. There really was no hard part in stocking merchandise.
good,"Excellent relationship between supervisors, manager and clerks."
good,"I worked for Ross. stores during their transfer from one location to another, during that transfer I was required to stock the store and be there for opening day during the holiday season."
good,I have worked in every area of the store and I would love to move up in the company after I graduate from college.
good,I loved working at Ross. I had loyal customers who shopped frequently and spread the word about the friendly service they received at my store.
good,I enjoyed this job because of the managers. I appreciate indivduals that are blunt and forth coming about what is expected of you. My managers never complained becasue I understood exactly what was needed of me. Typically I would come in five or six hours before closing and sign in as the head cashier. This meant I was  to remain at the cash register and answer phone calls while also representing the customer service desk. I learned about how to spot fraud and how to save the store money while being polite to customers that are aggitated. 
good,Loved the fast past and excellent customer service that I learned there. 
good,a typical day would consist of smiling and greeting constumers just having a good day and helping co workers along the way.
good,"Ross was a fun place to work although i was borderline of Tucson and Sonora, we could have a lot of guest come from everywhere so we were always busy! it was a great experience it kept me alert and ready for whatever it was i had to do, the hard part at the end of the night was sorting the clothes but as a team it made it easier to do so , so i enjoyed it aswell"
good,"Fast paced environment, lots of advancement opportunities if mind set to it, great co-workers, great managers, hardest part of the job is when short handed on busy days, and the most enjoyable part of the day is that you get to meet new people from all around the world because they all love Ross's low prices. Ross is a great place to get started for young men and women since they will give an opportunity to those they believe could have great potential and grow inside the company."
good,I really liked working at Ross Dress for Less. The store has great management and a friendly welcoming environment.
good,Working at Ross was Fun. Ross made working fun because the environment and co-workers were very friendly. By working here it made my customer service skills way better than before. The management there was fine they company store was always in order and things barely got out of hand there. The hardest part of the job was nothing to me and the most enjoyable part of it was my work team.
good,fun job but lo pay
good,A typical day consisted of maintaining a safe and secure environment. You have to be very alert and aware of your surroundings
good,A typical day at work would be to come in and get right to work I usually would be in the fitting room or cashier and I would help every customer in a timely fashion. The hardest part of the job would have had to be closing if someone didn't pull their load in the previous shift then you would have to do their work and yours in order to close the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was cashiering and interacting with customers on a regular basis.
good,"As a retail associate for Ross's, I enjoyed the job. I was never rushed extremely and most tasks were simple to do. My co-workers were respectable and dealing with customers was pleasant."
good,Ross is a great job to have if you love retail. Its currently doing exceptionally well with its business. The management team supports one another and it becomes a second family. The hardest part is the work schedule. Ross stays open late and its hard if you have a family. The most enjoyable part is contributing to the great success of the store.
good,"Manager always cooperate with associates, I learnt lot of things over here, there is also chance to move forward etc"
good,"I liked Ross a lot, especially because it's some where I love to shop. The jobs assigned were very easy and understandable."
good,A typical day at Ross Store is hard work but can also be a fun place to work. When working at Ross Store you get to learn a lot of new things. Co-works at Ross Store are so helpful and end up feeling like family.
good,"Ross offers good benifits, and gives you room for advancement in the company. The only thing i really wish they would work on is doing more for their associates to show them what a good job they are doing."
good,"Overall it’s a good place to work at life balance work environment and associates are nice as well as our customers....you can"
good,I enjoyed this job. The corporate supervisors really care about the little guy. They have a set plan in place that assists work going smoothly. Management work with you on everyday struggles.
good,"Aprender a trabajar bajo presión y estrés,  ayudarse mutuamente"
good,All employees are respectful and everyone there seems dedicated to accomplishing the tasks that must be completed. Managers are open to being flexible with other work schedules as well.
good,"Lots of gossip in the workforce,  but I liked it, it helped me develop more people skills. I will miss working here but it was time for me to move on."
good,I have not been at this job that long but for the short time I have been their the training and orientation was professional and friendly. I do like the job and staff however the drive is longer than I expected along dark country roads that become very foggy.
good,Nice place to work but not enough opportunity for growth. They do a lot of training to help you learn your position and they also have a lot of great employee incentives.
good,"The work can be challenging and rewarding, but it can also be frustrating.  The management is easy to work with and helpful. I would recomend this company as a good place to work."
good,"Ross was a very fast paced environment. But there was always great support from upper management. It really felt like the ""higher ups"" truly cared about all their employees. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross during my time, I only left once I transferred because I was not fond of management at my new store, I plan on working there again."
good,Mangers were very friendly and understanding with my work Schedule. Coworkers were nice and helpful when I had questions. I learned how to charge quickly and do returns.
good,Ross is a good company to work for. The experience was great and the staff was good. I learned a lot. The supervisor was always welcome to help with any of my needs. I also had additional training in fortlift operating and Bulk unloading
good,Really easy there's always something to do when it comes to either dealing with customers or reorganizing the clothes there is never a dull moment except with there's nobody there shopping
good,"Work is definitely fast paced. The work isnt so bad but the management can use some work. The favoritism  is this company is very much in your face and you can only move up if your supervisor likes you. so if you get on your supervisors good side then you will like the job. If you dont then you will have to keep your head down and just work away. I personally did not have a bad experience but i saw it and a lot of people would come to me and complain about it. Also if you were seeking for a raise the managers and directors would just BS you all the way but never gave it to you. They gave you uncooked food for Thanksgiving, Christmas and a week of ""associated appreciation week"""
good,I had 3 managers since I been working there for 2 1/2 years. I did whatever they ask for me to do. I help out with looking for items and from cleaning the restroom and fitting room.
good,easy going and all work is completed would be a average day at ross . the hardest I  would say might be the cleanup after shoppers our discount days and great changes to our store
good,Overall I like working there it’s not as bad as people say I’m there to make my money and go home!  It’s a very good company to work for it’s just what you make of it
good,Multi tasking at its best. The company will set you up for success. Each department has no less then 30 associates. Not only will you have to know production but HR issue relations as well.
good,"Overall Ross is a good company to work for.  Your experience will really depend on the particular store that you work for, i.e. management and co-workers."
good,Very fast paced. Lots of work keeps you busy  your whole shift. Time goes by fast. Monthly potlucks to celebrate anniversaries and birthdays. Recognition cards hung in breakrooms.  Fun work if you like work.
good,The main manager was always on top of things and easy to talk to. Everyone was always willing to help or compromise. A great fast paced work environment.
good,"Ross is definitely great starting job. You can be promoted very quickly if you do your job efficiently. Pay could be a little better for management being that Ross expects a lot from them at times . The negative things I will say about Ross,  is that the dress code as far as covering tattoos and piercings  is ridiculous. This is not a ""high-end"" store  and customers are regular everyday people and don't judge Associates based on that so neither should Ross. Louisiana is a very hot and humid state and the store stays very hot, so having to wear long sleeves  for a 7 to 8 hour shift is crazy. Times are changing, and Ross needs to get with the 21st century. The biggest issue is safety is not their number one priority for associates. This area has had stores close down recently, but the hours continue to be late at night which can definitely be dangerous for an only female workplace. It definitely seems they're more worried about payroll than having more Associates there for safety at night. Corporate should definitely look into shortening the closing hours for this location"
good,The best place I have worked at so many nice people the job is a lot of fun great people to work with a good work environment the work is good too and the customers are usually nice
good,If you don't pick up what they're telling you within 2 days you'll struggle for the first few weeks.  But if you can understand it fast ask questions and just do it with a smile it gets easy
good,It’s a good place to work it’s busy but simple . It’s a comfortable work place and anyone should apply here I appreciate the experience it’s giving me
good,Excellent company to work for. They understand that you have a family and they come first. Birthdays are paid holidays and your yearly Anniversary is as well.
good,I appreciated my 3+ years at Ross. I liked how my managers were able to work with my school and work schedule. I have recommenced Ross to family and friends.
good,I learned organizational skills and time management. My communication and interaction with co workers and supervisor increased.Supervisor is great with communicating goals of the company with employees. The is employee of the month rewards as well
good,A typical day working at Ross is pretty relaxed yet quick paced. There is always something to do. The job is rewarding and the whole sector including management functions regularly as a team. I learned many of the different policies that Ross stores function under. And the culture is that of a typical retail store. There is nothing too hard about the job itself besides lifting some of the heavier merchandise. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is the meeting and greeting of customers.
good,"Most of my coworkers and management were very friendly. The only negative thing I have to say is on the customers. So much theft and very rude customers. I had been in retail 2 years before this job and never experienced some of the things I did at this job. You'll get rude customers at any job but not necessarily bags of clothes being thrown at you, threatened to be assaulted, etc. Just have thick skin if you work here."
good,"Ross is a good entry level job it will definitely give you work experience that you never knew you had. it gives you the opportunity to work in a fast paced, team oriented environment and will most definitely sharpen your critical thinking skills. You'll learn how to be a self starter and be able to prioritize assignments from most to least important. Management is absolutely the best and very understandable when it comes to school and work scheduling and they most definitely acknowledge hard work when they see it. The associates here are very helpful and friendly to newcomers they'll easily grow on you and become a small work family. The only downside to this job is that it kind of takes forever to be promoted into a higher position but overall its a good entry level job for those that want to start building up work experience."
good,Fun and friendly work environment for associates and staff. helpful management team with great supervisors. Overtime always announced before hand. overall well done.
good,"Friendly atmosphere,  great customers, employee discount a plus especially double discount days.  Great teamwork.  Popular store based on word of mouth recommendations to family and friends"
good,Ross is a well organized company. Offers great benefits and secures a job for you. It offers great perks and works great with personal schedules no matter the s
good,"Both positions that were filled within the store gave me a great job to tend to. I really appreciated my alternate managers, and the atmosphere within the store. Each day customer service seemed to dim down less and less, and I was eventually all around comfortable with the position."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working with Ross, even though it didn't last very long I had really nice and funny co-workers who were very friendly and helped me open up to them in order to accomplish all that was needed."
good,I love it. It was very relaxed and the environment was motivating. The management team was helpful in every day activities. I would recommend this job to anyone
good,As soon as i walk into the store and my coworkers see me or any one they'll great u. When u go on break they'll tell u (to enjoy) the only hard thing was that we are always busy and have a hard time maintaining cleanness throughout the store
good,"Easy-going environment with opportunity to advance. If you like a medium paced environment with decent pay and benefits, I recommend this place to you."
good,"As stock lead my job is to make sure that we are set up to start the unloading of the truck. Making sure I have a rally meeting covering any changes to the way we process merchandise. "
good,"It was great! My coworkers were great, my boss was bossy. Many people were friendly to me. As long as you work hard, the company is going to give you more hours."
good,"I was hired as a retail associate in June 2016."
good,"This place was good to work at because of the pace that you have to keep at. Classic experience while working there, good management and nice people to work with."
good,Working at Ross helped me learn how to work in teams to get projects done by a designated deadline. While it may be very busy it helped improve my group skills in a professional environment.
good,"A typical day at work is working in the stock room, cashiering, watching fitting room, or sales floor. I learned that working together as a team helps get the job done way more efficient. The management is well run and gets things done. The culture is mixed between men and women. The hardest part of the job is trying to get things done in the stock room before the night is over. The most enjoyable part of the job is the teamwork. There is a lot of cooperation."
good,"Ross was a great experience as job during my college years. Schedule was flexible and the hours of operation were at decent times. They worked with me around my other job (PubIix) and part time college. The pay wasn't that amazing, but they made up with it by giving employees awesome discounts on their merchandise. Most of the time my paycheck went back to them, because I would go shopping there as soon as I got paid. I only worked their for a year, but I am still close to some of my fellow associates and even some managers. The hardest part of the job is cleaning up the store at night. It would be a MESS, but most of the time we had the right amount of people so we didn't get out too late. Definitely recommend it if you are looking for a summer job, or as a part time."
good,"Ross is a great starter job. Specifically, my manager was not that great and I still liked the job very much so that says a lot. A normal day would entail cashier duties, being on the sales floor (picking up merchandise, organizing clothes, putting new stock out) or being in the stockroom. The best thing about working there is the exposure to the deals before the general public gets to see them. The employee discount is also a great incentive. I worked this job all throughout college and it was great and flexible for the most part."
good,"A typical day at work is cleaning and marking shoes with three breaks in between. I’ve learned how to work at a quick pace, it’s a little bit hard when you first start working there but we end up building up or pace. The management is good as far as I’ve seen I don’t have any bad reviews for management."
good,"fun place to work, everyone is supportive. Overall my days at Ross were good, I had good relationship with workers and management. Due to my relocation I had to quite, if anything I will return back."
good,"Great place to work, team is very hard working and friendly. I enjoyed training new hires, and high potential internal candidates. Lots of opportunity for growth."
good,I love this job it was amazing and fun but it’s serliouly stressful and messy on Black Friday especially if your working for the changing room. But the environment is awesome to be in.
good,"Good work place nice environment . Co workers were nice , made a couple friends . One manager wasn't too nice but hey , besides that everything else was cool"
good,I worked for this company for many years.  The company has great opportunities for advancement in a very high paced environment.  I learned a great many things working with a manager who put my training and self development first.
good,I really enjoyed working at this store.  There was a compassionate and efficient management team that worked with the staff regarding any concerns that arose.  They demonstrated inspired leadership and encouraged advancements on personal and professional levels.
good,Everyone hates working the fitting room. Your feet are on fire for standing there for 4+ hours. Cashier and working the sales floor was good. Only thing sucks are the hours. Very little. Then they keep hiring people when they already have little hrs to give. Seems t hst only the people who've been there longer get the hrs.
good,"Working here was often chaotic, as items in the store were always missed placed and rearranged from the busy customer traffic through out the day. But I learned to organize quickly and efficiently to get the store presentable and back in order. Also, that keeping a positive mindset helped things get done smoother. It was always a relief and a satisfying weight lifted seeing a clean, organized, and appealing store, knowing that it would make the customers experience pleasant."
good,"My only problem that I had while working here was when I came to management for a request for more hours... they told me to bad unless I wanted to work somewhere where they told me I was not a good fit! I also asked multiple times if there was a full time position open and they told me no, but yet I see they are hiring a full time position right now on indeed.com"
good,"really good enviorment to work in"
good,"I just started a couple months ago and I already love my co-workers. We never fight and the managers are really nice and understanding. I had to switch my days because my uncle passed and they found someone right then to take my spot so I could switch shifts with them. They are amazing people. You start out at 9 dollars an hour, but it eventually goes up."
good,"After 21 years I retired from Ross.  I should have stayed on, I really enjoyed the company and the people I worked with.  It is hard to find that and I may go back after trying a couple other companies over the last couple years."
good,As an sales associate it was important to have good customer service skills and there was always something to do. There was good opportunity for advancement as I was promoted to full time from part time within a few weeks.
good,"Interaction with wide range of customers. Great atmosphere to work."
good,Ross is a great place to work. Great for students and people with little to no work experience. They offer great flexibility (opportunity to make schedule) and benefits.
good,Typical day is fast paced being on the register ringing customers or recovering the sales floor. Doing sizing and recovery on each department. Time goes flying there.
good,"A typical day at work starts off with unloading trucks when they come and processing the goods they deliver. After properly processing them we get them on the sales floor as fast as we can so we don't have to deal with customers when the store opens. While that is happening we check out the front end of the store and make sure everything is prepped and ready. The rest of the day is just clearing out the stock room, cashiering when needed and maintaining the sales floor which is pretty simple if it wasn't for the fact that customers exist."
good,"Even though there were flaws, I've enjoyed working at Ross. The hours were flexible, the managers were quite understanding, free food for team success and there were always new opportunities. I loved working in the stockroom and helping the team not only when needed, but to help them reach their full potential. There was plenty of fun and laughter.The major issues here are somewhat poor management and poor strategy which causes some avoidable and unnecessary negative reactions."
good,"I found Ross to be an enjoyable place to work. I was able to get along with the other employees as well as the management. I also loved how Ross was willing to work with your availability even if there happened to be a change, for example, your new school year was going to start. All you would have to do is put in a request two week in advance. I thought the pay was fair but I wish I could had better hours for the availability that I had. But overall, a good store to work for."
good,"fun place to work, friendly customers. one of the best place to work. usually time goes fast. Friendly managers. The training is good. evey once in a while they bring food for everyone."
good,Amazing management great team members smooth working environment great work schedules overall amazing store very respectful to customers and other employees
good,"Working at Ross was a good experience, I loved working with all the awesome employees. They were helpful and also friendly! Ross also has good stuff. Get 20% off"
good,Working at Ross was a great experience. I enjoyed the professional growth as well as building personal relationships and learning the flow and the process of the Distribution.
good,"This Company is great. Good pay ,Great Benefits, Great Staff. I got nothing bad to say about Ross.Inc .They listen to every Employee there and have monthly meetings with the employees to listen and understand them get feed back and try to fix every issue they can and make work easier for the employees. Moving up throughout the company is easy if you work for it. Amazing Management"
good,"It's an ok job. The entry process is fair and well balanced. I've worked at the orange city and the Southwest Jacksonville locations and the managers are great, they're some amazing instructors and friendly with the employees. The work environment is awesome too."
good,"A typical workday is working the sales floor, working at customer service, fitting room, markdowns, stock, and anywhere they need me. I have to do manager on duty training as well. I learned how to be a manager and ensure the store is running accordingly. Management was there at times, but mostly came out if needed or towards closing. The hardest part of the day is cleaning the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,great teamwork and nice place to work management was friendly while being able to be very professional as well. i learned that teamwork and communication can provide a very stable workplace
good,This an environment with people from all walks of life that come together as a team. The teamwork is key and even throughout the company. This is a great place to work for advancement.
good,"I loved working here, it was always fun but had it's challenges. "
good,"Buen ambiente laboral con jefes y compañeros de trabajo, aprendizaje de manejo con clientes."
good,"It was a fun place to work at, you meet all kinds of different people that each bring something different to the table. It can be tough at first but with the right training you'll get there."
good,cashier was the first i ever work i was really excited becoming a accountant at the time i didnt have a high school diploma but i was trust worthy to do the work
good,Ross is a simple company caters to ALL women.I enjoy helping people look and feel Great.If you like making people happy Ross is a great Company.
good,"I enjoyed working at this job because it taught me new things that i havent been taught in the work enviornment. Learning how to approache customers based on their needs was a new learning experience for me, This job definetly kept me busy and i enjoyed the hours that they gave me. I learned how to keep up with the face paced enviornment that was consistent all day. The hardest part of the job was putting the go back away after the shoppers had once left, especially during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it made my time useful and iwas working towards a goal .Once i left work it was an enjoyable feeling know i accomplished something i was working hard for."
good,The management is great. The co-workers work together to get things done on time. I learned a lot of my skills working here. The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to see new faces daily customers coming in. Helping them find exactly what they are looking for. I  Love the discount. The hardest part about this job is not being able to clock out for the day/night without buying something.
good,"Great place to work and interact with customers. I get daily feedback from management about my work performance, which is important to me. I am respected and valued as an employee."
good,Its not bad at all during busy days. I like to keep myself busy and during bausy days get me going. Love to assist customers needs. Enjoy working there.
good,"my typical day at work is fun , energetic , friendly workplace. I love my co workers and ross staff, everyone is caring and loving. we make sure we complete every task the TRUE way."
good,I loved it cause it was a place that let me advance very quickly. It was a place that was very easy to maintain and the people had attitudes but easy to maintain
good,"Started my days with an assigned duty (changed daily) and then proceeded to my assigned job. Sometimes I would work as cashier, dressing room attendant, or even got the opportunity to organize and run racks. My coworkers were always helpful."
good,Ross is a good place to work. Management is good and everyone is willing to help. The most enjoyable part of the job was working was fast paced kept me motivated.
good,"Amazing management with friendly co-workers that make you look forward to work the next following day. Everyday is a learning experience while working for Ross Dress for Less. The most enjoyable part about working for this company, is the customers. They make my day brighter when I help them find the right products they are looking for."
good,"flexible schedule"
good,Work hous are 4 - 10 schedule with 3 days off to relax. Fast paced and well equip to help with moving product. Company is very huge.
good,"It is a part-time job,  when i arrived at work I'm in contact with people that I like, there merchandise needs organize and customers who need help, and time goes by very fast. I like what I do."
good,"Work at Ross was always fast paced to meet our daily numbers but it was also fun. The atmosphere was never dull, our managers and supervisors were always there when we had a question or would motivate us to get our production done in a timely manner. Sometimes we would receive merchandise that was difficult to receive and we could not meet the daily number due to bad merchandise."
good,Very fast paced environment where there is always something to do. This position gave me the skills and experience to branch out in other career fields. Co-workers are happy and hard working who strive for results daily. I enjoyed all the associates as well as customers.
good,During my time working at Ross on my first day co workers were nice and help me out by teaching me how to ring up and the policy of returning. I managed everything during the 3rd week it was kind of easy after putting time and learning during the process. My hardest part of the job was costumers were doing returning but their items was over 30 days and they don't realize it and was expected for their change back and I solve it by like telling them they can get their full amount back as a store credit but not in cash cause their items are over 30 days.
good,"The great thing about Ross is you will have numerous opportunities for advancement. If you display the right mindset and work ethic, you could be promoted into managerial roles no less than a year."
good,"The thing I like most about Ross would be the managers and co-workers. The work is so easy and the workers are so friendly, it actually feels like I'm getting paid to hang out with friends."
good,"Ross is a very active working place, requires you to be flexible and able to multitask, but overall nice working place with good employee discounts."
good,"Great management turned an average working environment into a good experience. Everything was well organized, people knew their role and how to execute the tasks they were given. Managers held us to only as high of a standard as they were willing to hold themselves to."
good,"Ross is a great place to work with lots of opportunities for advancement.  Great team culture, work environment and job security."
good,a typcial day at work was very busy especially on weekends and as a manager. I have learned to communicate a little better. But all managers at the store and district managers do not communicate well at all.
good,While working at Ross I was able to learn and improve many skills that I can now apply within my job field. The staff worked as a team and worked diligently to create an organized and comfortable work environment. The job also offered versatility as it allowed employees to work in different positions and learn how to be effective within the company overall.
good,"a good place to work, and its a place that you can improve your self there and get a prmot by the hard work. moreover, you can get a a lot of experience in those places because it's a big company"
good,"a typical day at work is too check in with the managers, and talk too the cashier on duty. The most enjoyable part of the job is basically meeting all kind of different people, while the hardest part would be that be alert all the time because I'm apart the Lost Prevention Team."
good,"A typical day at Ross is a very busy, productive day. It involves meeting hundreds of different people and helping them with questions about product placement in the store. It also involves recovering the store and keeping our clientele and increasing our clientele."
good,"Unload truck"
good,"Ross is definitely a great company to work for. They offer rewards for employee of the month which is nice. work schedule is typically flexible. When I had to get squeezed in for a last minute appointment to get my teeth removed, I had no issue working that out with the store manager."
good,"-A typical day at work would be I clock in then I do my department walk to make sure nobody is trying to steal and make sure theirs no damage items"
good,"This is an amazing first job. Amazing work environment and very fun place to be. Great management and great company over all. Typical day is very fast paced and fun. Normal floor staff go between working a register and picking up the store or working fitting room or stock room. No day is ever the same as the last and each brings new challenges and opportunities. I found it easy to move up into a management roll and loved that position even more. Movement beyond area management is a lot tighter and not quite so easy but that is only because there are less positions that become available. This job starts at minimum wage and with very few exceptions only offers one very small raise every year. It has a very large turnover rate because most people have it as a first job or transition job and leave once they find a higher paying job. But once you make it into a full time position, money is a little better and the benefits are pretty good."
good,"A typical day was reviewing sales, payroll, and key performance indicators in order to make educated decisions for the current and next business day."
good,Great place to work they compromised with my schedule when I was going to school to further my education
good,"Get to meet new people everyday and the coworker are friendly, and get to learn all the aspects of what makes ross function as I learn all the areas of the job, and everyday is assigned a different task which does not cause boredom."
good,I enjoyed working for the company except the pay rate for the amount of work
good,"Over all the job is not bad. You will need to learn to keep yourself busy or else you will become bored which can cause complacency. As long as you keep moving and active your hours will pass. I learned a lot in a short amount of time about retail work. If you are a hands on security professional, this is not the line of work for you. The name of the game is checking, checking again and numbers. There are a lot of managers to work with, so everyone has different expectations of your job description. Learn to be flexible with your work style as you will be asked to off the books tasks. Over all I enjoy the work, it keeps you busy."
good,"unload truck into stock room. Sort out the merchandise. and running them out onto the main floor, where costumers can purchase them. also running the register. and also clean up the store.."
good,"This was another great place to work. It was my first time in retail, and my managers certified me in every department. The hardest part of the job would be working the stockroom. I met many different people, also dealt with the not so nice customers, but still one of my favorite jobs."
good,"task are able to be completed "
good,Fun to work at. A typical day at work was enjoyable because of coworkers.
good,"As long as you do your job no problems would come your way. It's a great place to use your keen observational skills to perform loss prevention duties. The management is fun, but very biased. The hardest part of the job was the ineffectiveness of maintainig. the store's appearance"
good,"From thee Front to the Back of the Store Gave Clean, Organized, and Great Scenery Which Allowed Customers to Feel Free to View All That We to Offer. Management Made It a Strong Neccessity to Fulfill This Characteristic. The Most Enjoyable Part of This Job Was to See My Customer Smile, ad Gain a Great Experience at My Disposal. Me and My CoWorkers Got Along Well, and Developed Strategies to Hlep Us Become a Better Team Each and Everyday."
good,"This was my first job, and still miss all the people I worked with there. The men and women I worked along side are by far the most intelligent and hard working individuals I ever had the pleasure of working with. They are willing to teach you anything you want to know, and they take pride in what they do."
good,A day at Ross is very fast paced and productive.  When I started working at Ross I was a cash office associate.  Within a year I was promoted to cashier and floor associate.  It is very possible for advancement with Ross with a lot of dedication and hard work.  I advanced to Area Supervisor in my third year and was promoted to Assistant Manager.  I helped develop co-workers that were customer service friendly and very focused associates.  My co-workers were very dedicated hard workers that enjoyed their jobs.  I didn't feel any part of my job was hard I enjoyed every minute of it.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing satisfied customers and positive co-workers.
good,The hardest part of the job is being understaff not being able to complete a floor move or not having enough people to recover at the end of the night.
good,I had an awsome experience working here. I worked more than i was needed and i enjoyed that so that i could get more hours.
good,"Enjoyed Ross very much. Aside of your usually grumpy costomer now and then, there was nothing really bad about it. Ross had the best co-workers ive ever worked with and loved working there, the only down side was low pay."
good,"I have only been an employee for a little over a week and I must say I love my job! I helped open the store also which was tiring at first but those few days flew by. You can serve many positions and your position for that day is given to you at the beginning of each shift. Management seems to work together and adheres to employees needs as quickly as they can during peek hours especially when busy with customers. Very easy to catch on to and coworkers have been nothing but helpful and good team workers. Some would say pay is a little low (which it is compared to previous jobs I have held) but I do not feel that I have been asked to do anything out of the ordinary that would make me complain about pay. You are told your rate at time of interview and the requirements of a retail position is self explanitory. Of course you will get rude customers at times but that is expected in any line of business. Overall I must say this job is pretty nice. I also highly enjoy the discount , the energy that builds up through teamwork and seeing happy customers all day! "
good,A typical day at work would consist of me recovering areas of the store and stocking items. What I have learned is how to manage my speed while displaying items on shelves. The management was pretty good I might say. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. They were all like mentors towards me. The hardest part of the job was learning where certain items go when the store was moved around due to change of seasons. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know how the store's environment and bonding with the atmosphere of the customers. I also enjoy assisting customer who had no knowledge of where particular items were located.
good,In a Typical day of work at ross I have to work under pressure. We have the responsible for the productivity of the stock room work. The greatest thing in this retail store is that the management is always seeking to be helpful and cheer us when we have done a great job. All of my co-workers are happy people to work with and we work as a team.
good,i am always growing with all this companies and getting new experience on how to work with customers.
good,This company had a great stock team and willing to make store always look good for customers. I think management could have been much better.
good,This store was a fun and efficient place to work. I enjoyed catching people and sending them out of the store. Had to work very closely with management and with co-workers. I kept a very friendly demeanor with everyone I worked with and it was returned. I still keep in contact with my manager and many of the coworkers as well. Worst part of the day was being attacked verbally by people with a guilty conscience.
good,"People were great to work ,"
good,Learned alot at this job as in forklift and the rf gun. Also about shipping and receving.
good,I really like ross working here has helped to alot. Ross has a grat work enviornment the management is very friendly and understanding. the employees are friendly and easy going working at ross is one of the best jobs that i have had... The ross location stays pretty busy on a daily basis but thats part of what make it fun to work there because you have the oppurtuinty to meet many different people.
good,Ross is a company that really cares and appreciates their employees. Everyone works as a part of a team and no hard work goes unnoticed. The wages are not important to me because I enjoy going to work everyday. My managers are fair and respectful as well as my coworkers. This is a great job if you enjoy doing many things at once and keeping busy rather than sitting around all day.
good,"The store was always busy and the employees/ managers were great to work with. I learned how to run the front end and perform customer returns at the service desk. I loved the customers who shopped at Ross. They seemed very pleasant, it is the South. LP (store security) was always helpful to both employees, management and to the customers. I especially loved the clothes and domestics department. The only thing I didn't like was that the job only paid minimum wage and that if I wanted to transfer back to the Northeast, they only have Ross in New Jersey, NYC, and in Philly. There aren't any in Boston :( I really enjoyed working there!"
good,is going to the fitting room and giving custumers numbers and counting cloths organizing toys cloths and stocking shelvess
good,"I loved working in this job because I am easily intrigued by fashion and clothes. Working around clothes made it easy for me to do my job and have fun while doing it. What I learned was how to interact with people on a professional level. It is not hard for me to be social and speak to people I do not know, but there is a different protocol that I had to learn when dealing with a customer. I would say I was glad I learned how to properly interact with customers. The most enjoyable part was at the end of the day I could go shopping though I may have been tired it was glad to give back my services to my job and the money on such great deals. i would not say there was anything particularly hard about my job seeing how I caught on so fast. One thing about the specific store was there was no training, it was kind of like they threw you in there so that could be one thing that changed, a little more guidance. Not having guidance did not hinder me but it could have been the least bit more help. I loved going into work at 9 am and at 12 pm and 3pm you get that rush of people coming in that want to buy something really quickly. I was excited because then i would get on the cash registers and personally interact with so many characteristics and talk with the customer about their purchases and share some of our same interests in things. My previous job had a great impact on me. It taught me things I needed in life and it humbled me because I can now walk into a store and know how it feels when I see an employee cleaning up or helping a customer. Those everyday experiences meant a lot to"
good,"I would clock in and go straight to my manager to see where i would be working that day. I learned how to use the cash register there and how to work fitting room. I also learned how to take sensors off clothes. My managers were nice and always there when i needed a question answered. As for my co-workers, i made some great friends there and they were a big help when i needed it. The hardest part for me was picking up clothes that were dropped and then going back 10 mins later and more clothes were dropped. Most enjoyable would have to be working fitting room."
good,"In my almost 2 years with Ross, I have had the great pleasure of working with some great management who have helped me grow as a person and a leader."
good,"Everyday was a new task and I learned something new about the store. I learned how to make the best out of your day even if it's feels like its not your day, its just one day. My manager keep me productive and I had no complains. Working with my co-workers was like working with family we all got along well. The hardest part abour working is the end of the day, closing. The enjoyable part to a job is working with the different customers was the most exciting and productive part ."
good,"Is a great place to work and a great learning experience to work at in retail. You can advance very quick if you want to go to the next level. For example, starting as a sales associate you can advance to work in a lead role."
good,"A positive and organized company,positive environment, has too many workers so that effected my hours but other than that Ross is a fast growing company where work life balance can become challenging. As an exempt employee you will be required to work many of Saturdays throughout the year and you will not be compensated for your time as a manager and above."
good,"A good part time job with flexibility if you are in school are have a second job, due to certain months when Ross business there can be slow ,depending on the season all the situation. If you are a cashier you have to be fast and give great customer service at the same time. I give this job from 1 to 10 and 8"
good,"Ross is a fast paced environment, there is always something to be done. The employees there are very nice and easy to work with. Management team is always there to help."
good,"A Typical Day At Work Depending On The Shift Is Clocking In And Putting All Of Your Belongings In The Break Room. Once That Is Done You proceed To The Front And You Have A Task. That Tasks Tells You Your Section That You Are Either Cleaning Up, Working On, Or Improving By The Time Your Shift Is Over. If You Work As A Cashier You Also Have A Task But Your Tasks Aren’t Really Shoved Down Your Throat Depending On If The Store Is Busy Or Not."
good,It was really a good place to work i felt save there but the management wasn't that good. I worked there more then 3 year but after awhile i felt like it wasn't good enough for my courier
good,It is an easy place to work at and doesn’t require much skill to be a stocker. It is easy for people who are looking for a part time job to help get some money if they are a student.
good,A typical work day is fun. The system they have is good because they work around schedules and it’s a fun place. The enjoyable part of the job is that I just stand and make sure people aren’t stealing or anything bad happens
good,"As a full time student, i found it a good place to work. my manager made sure i knew my hours ahead of time and if i wanted overtime. he worked with my school schedule."
good,"complete autonomy of area, true off price buying."
good,Ross was a great place to work. People were really friendly. The environment was always welcoming. The company had a lot of benefits. I would honestly recommend.
good,Its a good place to learn an to communicate with people..as a security im there to stop internal theft.from costumers an employees.the the number one is command presents.to engage the customer an the employees.
good,"Before leaving for my study abroad in Washington, D.C, I worked at Ross in Tulsa Hills for 4 months (end of July- Dec 2018). While working at Ross, I was a full time student. They were willing to work with my schedule and were very understanding. My coworkers were pretty nice and I didn't have any problems. However, I only worked during the weekends due to having classes everyday throughout the week. The weekends were probably some of the busiest times of the store. I will say that the job is not perfect, and every office, store, and etc have its issue. However, overall this is a nice place to work if you are a student or a parent due to the flexibility. The pay is not that bad for Oklahoma as well. You get paid $11/hr, which is not too bad for someone who has not earned a bachelor's degree yet. Now that I got all the positive out the way, I will state one negative I noticed in my short time there. It seems that there may be favoritism in who they chose to be management. For example, in my store, there was an employee who had been there for a couple months. She was good at her job, but the store management have not promoted her to be a supervisor or anything. Keep in mind this was in December before I left, so that could have changed by now. That was just my observation."
good,"I loved the job and my co-workers. The management is very understanding ans works with you, especially if you are a college student looking for a summer job. The work is hard, but you get used to the tasks at hand."
good,Everyday was filled with different task some due the same day. Training new employees while providing exceptional customer service became a everyday task for me.
good,It’s all about how you make it! Ross is a very good company to work for ! As long as you work hard everyone can have fun!! They have very good incentives!
good,"Annual pay raises"
good,"Ross was very cool, fast pace never left room too be tired. lead staffs where great and was always encouraging you too thrive for more in the work place. Also gave awards to people that didn't mind doing the work."
good,"I really enjoyed my employ with Ross. The managers were very knowledgeable and answered questions quickly and efficiently. I was either the Front End Supervisor, Cashier, or Stock Clerk. "
good,I had the store preventions specialist jobs and that job was extremely boring but for the money it pays ill do it again...............................
good,"Ross Dress For Less is indeed one of the best bargain stores out there for everybody. Nobody is left behind including bargain items for your fur pets! Love working with people and seeing their smiles when their experiencing their, (what I like to call), Retail Therapy. Working at Ross is an enjoyable place the staff including all management are kind, courteous and very helpful. I'm glad I am A current employee. Not to mention great benefits are offered."
good,"Ross is a teamwork environment, you have to be very flexible and now how to manage your time. "
good,I enjoy working at Ross.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with the customers and my co-workers.  There is no hard part of the job because I enjoy my hours there.
good,"What I learned at ross was how to work in a fast paced environment, it taught me how to manage time, I had to clean up, out items away, organize, and many other things while also sometimes helping out customers."
good,Its a great company to get your feet wet but don't stay here. They want you to have a degree to advance in management its a bit unfair but life is unfair ya know?
good,"working at Ross was a good time Because i grew as a professional learned how to cope with difficult situations, a typical day was customer service 100% i enjoyed  sizing and organizing the racks , processing merchandise new arrive freight and rolled it out to the sales floor. the hardest part for me when there was no enough payroll and figure out how to make our sales goal with little team members on a busy day. i did loved working with this company every day was something new."
good,"Pay was alright nothing major I had graveyard shift "
good,Fast paced work place. Management made sure team members were taken care of. Company policies were enforced. Hardest part of the job would be not having anything to do. Workplace culture provided positive work enviroment.
good,always cutting hours. very poor management   i was given 12 cent rate after one year. i was ganged up against. i was not even trained . they have no orientation program
good,Ross was a great place to work at starting off that they paid me more than Macy's did. I was given tasks that I could complete on time and my co-workers were great. Management was excellent as well and was really flexible in my scheduling since I was going to school at the same time that I worked there. You don't have to worry about opening credit accounts and you get a discount of items that are already low in price.
good,It was a long commute and the warehouse was not that clean. I worked until I had a severe asthma attack and they made me go to the hospital. When I returned they suggested I find a different job.
good,Worked in stock room. Things can get a bit cramped. Hard tags painful. Enjoyed all of the team work.Great people. A lot of opportunities.Can Move around if needed. Worked with my schedule.
good,"I work well with others, and a on time employee. I was uplifting to other employees and customers. I take the initiative to perform duties that are not assigned to me."
good,"Fun workplace overall , but management sucks 2 years ago this was a great company to work for, but as there was a change in management the company started going down the drain."
good,"Working at Ross is a great place to work at, everyone is helpful and work as a team to get all jobs done. It is a fast working place and I love its fast working environment, there is something for you to always do."
good,"Loved working here and was sad it was only seasonal. Loved my coworkers, customer service is always hard, but having good people to work with makes the time fly by"
good,"Management I found to be very flexible with finding shifts to compliment busy personal schedules. The crews I've worked with are friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about their respective departments. I don't think there's really a ""typical"" day when you are working in the retail business but the biggest satisfaction I get is the personal interaction with the customers."
good,"I worked in the fitting rooms. I counted clothes, gave #'s to the customers, and put away the clothes that they didn't want. I'd have to go in the fitting rooms periodically to make sure there were no hangers or other clothes left behind. I hung the clothes on a rack and put clothes in order from sizes, mens, and womens clothing. When it got full someone on the floor would come and pick it up and put everything back on the floor where it belonged. Once in a while I would straighten the clothes on the floor and made sure they were in the right place. I would also clean up the area that I was in as well as the bathrooms. I never got trained on the registers though. The co-workers were nice. I never got a chance to talk to any of them since I was mainly in the back of the store. The hardest part was sizing on the floor because you had to move fast. The most enjoyable part was being on my own and having time to think to myself.I didn't like that I had to stand the whole time in one place. I'd find myself pacing back and forth just so I wouldn't be in so much pain. Some places actually sit down at a desk or something while they are sorting out the clothes."
good,"Outgoing,Independent,Motivated. I Love Working As A Team And A Part Of The Team. I Love Seeing My Customers Smile And Coming Back To Our Store. Great role Model"
good,This company really dedicates time to developing internally as to promoting from within. The focus of the stores are great culture it provides is driving it to success.
good,All of the associates I work with are polite and hard working. Each one will go out of their way to help with any issues or questions I have had. The managers are well trained and easily adaptable to any situation that may occur.
good,Ross distribution has a very competitive staff which makes for very productive days. I chose to not fall behind and tried daily to maintain a good work percentage. Many of the employees have worked there for many years so it can be tough to compete sometimes. all in all a good and rewarding experience.
good,I like Ross because the job was always different from day to day and you never felt like you were in a rut! There was always something new and challenging!
good,"Great company.  Friendly environment. Enjoy working with my colleagues. Retooling takes time, but management is willing to work with you."
good,"It is very upbeat, never boring.  I learn new things everyday because the store is rearranged for every promotion or season/holiday.  Management is great, they are understanding and flexible with me being a student.  My co-workers are great and very helpful.  The hardest part is keeping the store clean being it is so busy.  I love meeting new people every day."
good,"This company shows great appreciation for their employees and always tries to accommodate their personal needs. It's like being payed to have fun, if you are passionate about customer service."
good,"besides being graveyard, you work in a fast paste, so time goes by fast. not only do you have to put things away, you need to keep area clean."
good,It is a cool environment everyone is very welcome. You are on your feet for mostly all day but there is always something to do. Time flies. The hardest part is saying no to a customer.
good,"Customers are some times a pain but you learn to deal, coworkers are the coolest but no one ever get their job done, at the end of the day you'll be cleaning up after 20 people"
good,"Ross was a great learning experience. Everyone works hard to achieve the company goals. Management is always willing to help the associates to pursue career opportunities within the company. Over the years that I have worked for Ross, I've learned to develop a better team by having a consistent communication between the associates and management. I've learned to deter theft and fraud by providing excellent customer service."
good,If you work hard you benefit if you just want to be lazy this is not the place.
good,"There was always something to do. The co-workers were very friendly and always willing to help. The managers were always encouraging and professional. It was always hard to do an accurate job in the time expected, however."
good,"They work well with my schedule, organized and I feel comfortable to go to my managers if any issues occurs."
good,"Great place to work, new challenges everyday, safe and productive environment to work in. Management supported and worked with its veterans through all situations."
good,"They work with your schedule and complaint you may have with the way things are done. Co-workers are nice, active, and social people, everyone gets along just fine. Although it may get busy at times, you always get a chance to finish your job and they never miss your break or lunch."
good,"- My shift at Ross would start at 4:45am and ends at 9:15am or until my job is done."
good,Working at Ross I worked with a lot of happy people who loved helping customers. The hardest part of the job is actually having too pick up everything in the store when your closing. A typical day at work would be checking out customers at a fast paste and greeting them as they walk in and leave
good,"I started as part-time with this company and moved my way up in the company very quickly, the best thing about this  company is their benefits and discounts."
good,"I like working with co-workers, and customers. On a normal day i would operate the cash register and assist customer with selecting merchandise and provide a friendly environment."
good,"I love working for this company because I enjoy the fast paced work environment. I have also been able to promote quickly within the company. The benefits that are offered are very good they have dental, vision and health. They also offer 401K, vacation pay, sick days and you can get your anniversary (DOH) as a paid day off. This is only of course for the full time employees.The HR department is very involved and does anything that they can to keep associates happy."
good,The Company was awesome and the vision was great. I just wanted to leave the retail environment to spend more time with my family.
good,My typical day at work was to provide the utmost Customer service experience by ensuring every Customer walked out of the store happy. I accomplished this by helping Customers find the merchandise they wanted and running the register fast and efficiently. The management was great. Every Manager cared about their Employees and offered private assistance when an Employee needed help emotionally and brought their emotions to work. The hardest part of the job was handling Customer complaints because the Customers were angry and often rude in some cases. My co-workers were fun to work with and we became good Friends and worked well as a team.
good,"Me fue muy bien , me trataron igual de bien , mucho trabajo y poco dinero"
good,I really enjoyed working for Ross! It was hard to let go but the opportunity for advancement was not there at the time and had to seek other ventures. I learned most of my managerial skills from Ross and they had an excellent training program.
good,A typical day in Ross for me is ideally just receiving our merchandise from our company truck and making sure we get the merchandise into the sale floor. During my time at Ross I learned to be a leader and how to lead my team into finishing our trucks in a timely manner. One of the hardest parts of my job is making sure I get my fellow associates into the designated area the need to be on time to make sure we finish on time .
good,"A typical date is when we clock in and then we all go to the back to receive merchanside.The most enjoyable part is team work, there is good environment and a lot to do. They are always so productive and they help you if you have any problem."
good,When I worked there some people were being treated more fairly than the rest. Other than the horrible management and District manager it is a good place to work. I was a stockroom leader and if that truck wasn't complete I was told I had to stay there to finish it. It was an amazing store and wonderful co workers but the management was just terrible.
good,"fast-paced environment, always something new going on. Learned valuable skills in time management, project management, and organization. excellent managers who are friendly and want you to succeed. great on-boarding and internship programs. growth and advancement."
good,"I'm a full time and I've never worked my 40 hours. If the store doesn't sale as much they expect, they cut everyone's hours. I understand it's business but i need the hours to pay my rent every month."
good,Working at Ross was a really great experience for me. It was refreshing to try something new in my management career. I was an area supervisor and my job was opening and closing the store and managing the employees and money handling.
good,"The people at Ross are great, you get a discount, you and you can meet friends that will help you because any time I needed help getting home ppl always offered"
good,I have just started my employment with Ross and everything is looking pretty positive. This is a Part Time position for me as I am already employed full time at another job. Since I have a lot of Security experience I was given the option to go on a fast track path to becoming a Store LP Manager and eventually an Area Loss Prevention Manager. Afterwards I can go all the way to corporate. I am very excited to see if Ross keeps its promises for me in the near future. I recommend this job for anyone who is starting in the LP or retail field. I also recommend this position with an Security or LP experience looking to get into leadership as long as you make it clear to management that leadership is where you want to go.
good,"Ross was a great place to work, it was fun and everyone there was friendly. You get to help customers,  and you as an employee get help from your supervisors."
good,"Great place to work for, and really allows for someone going to school or in need of work life balance a great place to be. Advancement in this company is very easy to obtain with determination, and a great work ethic."
good,"Just like any job, it's going to depend on management. I enjoyed working with lower management but the store manager not so much. Lack of respect for female employees and just all over the place all the time with what needed to be done. Overall a great experienced. Moving up is a great possibility if you work hard and pay is great for retail"
good,"Excelente experiencia trabajando aquí, adquirí nuevas capacidades basadas en el conocimiento monetario, trato al cliente, y el manejo y formación de una empresa grande."
good,"ROSS truely cares about its employees, they helped pay for my schooling and my mangers worked great with my school schedule. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude and obnoxious customers. At times, I would find it hard to defend myself. The overall best part of my job were my co-workers, they made it so much fun and made work very tolerable. Not to mention the employee discount, that was always enjoyable."
good,every coworker communicate really fun work environment and outgoing mangers easy to talk too. everyone basically share what they brought for their lunch the only hard part u have to be fast but not supper fast u just have too keep on with work and not be a lazy worker.
good,Love my co workers and management team. Customers not so much. I enjoyed growing and learning new things about this job as a full time and part time worker.
good,Was an amazing experience for me loved working at Ross and moved up quickly in the company as long as you are a hard worker!! Friendly company and great  environment.
good,A typical work day is fast paced but fun and exciting. I learned a lot while I was there like cashiering and eventually the security aspect in the company. They have great opportunities to move up in the company to any position that you are willing to work for and earn.
good,I worked for Ross during the Christmas Season. The people there are hard workers and they enjoy their job. The team work is awesome. You never felt taken advantage of.
good,"A fast pace, fun typical big box retail environment that is best suited for those who exhibit excellent multitasking skills with a focus on time management (short term vs long term plans). There are three areas to manage and work in daily in the big box; stockroom, sales floor, and the front end checkout..."
good,"Busy work days Monday through Sunday, nice and caring co-workers, great management team; very nice and caring. Most of my experience as a retail associate and cash office associate was taught here."
good,It's a very fast paced work environment. The customers and the people you work with make it a very fun and exciting place to work.
good,I started my career as a stock room team member and gradually rose up to a lead position in my stores loss prevention team. they give you the tools to improve the knowledge to advance its on you if you want to be a success. Co-workers were amazing to work along side. hardest part of the job was greeting customers entering store some will reply back others wont that's just how it goes. my most memorable moment would be my wiliness to assist a family under duress in my store.
good,"Good management.  Safe place to work.  The supervisors are professional at all times.  They listen to your concerns.  The hardest part of the job would be maintaining a good percentage with the work there is for the week. And it gets really hot during the summer, fans don't help much."
good,"It's a great place to work. I love my co-workers its like a second family. I really love the customers, they're great. I know a lot of them by their first name. The management at this Ross is wonderful they really know how to communicate with the associates."
good,friendly staff and great team members. always fast paste and highly productive
good,"Love working on team projects"
good,Ross Is a overall great company to work for. This company allows advancement to managment fairly quickly.
good,"i learn how to sort , and  load and unload"
good,Ross was a great place to work in the time I spent with the company I was given the opportunity to advance to a higher role and supervise over a small group of employee's 
good,"I have been working for Ross on and off for about 10 years. Yes there have been problems but for the most part it has been a great place to work. If you do your work as requested and not complain about everything the managers (most) are very respectful. The manager I work for now is absolutely the BEST manager I have EVER worked for at any job I have had. He listens and cares for his employees. Yes, there is drama as there would be at any job but it will only affect you if you choose to listen to it. DO YOUR WORK, DO IT IN A TIMELY MANNER and any job will be pleasant. Complain and boo hoo and that is what you will get in return. I personally want to thank my manager and asst. manager for their respect they show to the employees at the store I work at."
good,"Always a mess at the end of the day, but I cleaned after putting clothing racks away quicker than anyone who worked there before. I was sweating by closing time. It was awesome to see customers react to good finds and great deals. I always encouraged them to try all the clothes they had brought to try on in the fitting room. I always maintained a neat, clean and organized work environment which was their motto."
good,They are customer friendly. Very good at making sure I wasn’t just stuck in one area I learned multiple things in the store. Stock room markdowns and cashier.
good,"Professionalism at its best. Ross is a very professional and inclusive company that values their employees and customers. They keep a safe and friendly work environment. They focus on safety, happiness, and respect for customers and employees. A very beneficial place to work."
good,Loved working here and the managers are amazing. Great partnerships throughout the workplace and very easy people to relate to. Very happy I worked here.
good,I like working at Ross. It’s a good place to work at. But they don’t pay you a lot for what you do. Like I go in every time they call me and I feel like I should get paid more.
good,I really enjoyed my job.  But they don't appreciate their workers. Everyone is replaceable no matter how much time and hard work u give them. It's a fast paced company
good,"Finding the treasure is the most enjoyable part of this job . You do not know what are you receiving until the day of the delivery."
good,"Great work place , management was amazing , schedules are flexible and it’s highly recommend to use this as a job if you’re looking for quick cash . Great business"
good,"I like working  their, Love doing customers service and working in retail,  manager made me if like a family member, he was always on the floor with us and by our side in case we needed  him, and willing to work hard as his employees."
good,"I liked working at ross there was a assist manager whom yelled at me and told me to go home. I left . The other associates where friendly , the store was need to have more associates to pic up merchandise"
good,i loved it just wished it wasn't seasonal. a typical day would be waking up at 6 am to be ready for work at 7:30 am it would go by so fast. i learned working fast paced and having things looking nice and presentable was an accomplishment. management was cool they were understanding just didn't like the way morning stock would have to recover after night workers duties. workplace was awesome. hardest part were dealing with the huge boxes. loved running merchandise and still having more time to do extra.
good,The management was amazing. the co-workers were friendly and enjoyed helping when needed. the hardest part about the job was keeping up when we got busy. the best part of my job was being around my co-workers.
good,"I liked working here especially with the discounts but oh my god people were rude & gross & just threw things on the floor "
good,After leaving the mess of jewelry television job I grew to love Ross I love our manager. She's very professional. Apply it's not a lot of hours in the beginning but it's worth working there
good,cheap and nice clothes. you have to clean up the mess. you get a good discount. you can put aside the clothes youd like to purchase. sdfgd dfgdfg dfgdf utuhg ufjgj. ypou can transfer.
good,"I interact with customers everyday. I learned so much about the company. My coworkers are great they are always so helpful. My management team is outstanding, they have helped me succeed at being a cashier and as a new sales associate."
good,"Love the company just not don't pay enough. You can advance in the company if you apply yourself."
good,had a great day at work at a fast paste and moved on to the next project
good,a very fun place to work . meeting different people from all cultures and races.
good,"When I started, it was a grand opening, and it was the greatest thing ever. Walking around and talking to customers and sometimes being security was just fantastic. My management was the greatest influence on my job. My co workers were some of the most amazing people to work with. The job really wasnt hard. It was laid back but you were always doing something productive. This made the job very enjoyable."
good,its a wonderful company the team work together like a unit i miss it so.
good,Ross had opened many doors in my knowledge of the customer service industry.
good,fun to interact with customers and being able to get along with co-workers.
good,A typical day at Ross is just providing great customer service to customers I was an Front End Supervisor My Duties Included Cash Deposits Tiling Drawers Cash Office Assisting Customers My CoWorkers Were So Friendly And Nice There Wasnt Really A Hard Part Of The Job I Enjoyed Most Meeting New People
good,"pretty hard to work with no organization at all and no having a really good team to work, they where rejecting to be teach and learn how to progress in the company and make the store better"
good,"I didn't work at Ross.  I worked at the warehouse in Moreno Valley, CA.  It was always an 8 hour day which was good so I was able to get full-time hours."
good,I came in to build the store but got let go with a lot of other employees when store did not need services. I just did my job. I guess I was impressionable because a manager that I didn't know knew my name personally.
good,its great working at ross and the job isn't hard at all.. the co-workers and managers is another thing.. managers don't know how to trip each other equally and we they don't know how to manager there jobs
good,"Due to the fact that I had been there since 2003  I was able to see the company actually grow over the years by adding exciting programs.I loved my job there since I started out as a regular associate and grew to be head of my own department as well as became a part of the management team where I begin to open and close the store.I enjoyed training the employees on all the new programs as well as watching myself grow into one of the great leaders of the team.I loved to deal with the customers the happy ones or the not so happy ones,because it was all part of learning for me."
good,I cried every day after work  I never want to go back    I hate shopping there  I never got hours     Mangers only wanted there friends     I gave my 2 week notices and never looked back
good,enjoyed the new items created a great customer experience great operated the register using the correct polices and procedures
good,"Working at Ross was easy, I was a stocker I had to be at work from 10:30 am to whenever we were finished with the truck. Some days were easy and very rare we got long days."
good,Ross is a great place to build your work experience. There is a lot of room for advancing. The most enjoyable thing about Ross is the new people I meet and help everyday.
good,When I worked at the Rockwall Ross Store the manager said things he shouldn't have said. I feel you need to get you sales people in check sometimes but not when they leave to store crying because you were taking in the back office and got talked to like you just destroyed the store. He treated everyone very unfair.
good,"This was a wonderful company to work for. The store location is good for business.However, the store had become mismanaged and there were several unprofessional supervisors in this store that would not treat their customers or fellow employees with courteousy or respect."
good,Ross Is Not A Bad company To Work For There's Just A few Things That Need To Be Fixed Management Can Be A Little Better With Communication overall Good
good,"A typical day working as a fitting room associate would include: directing customers to the fitting rooms and bathrooms, sorting clothing and correctly sizing and nubbing the merchandise, distributing merchandise from blue bins, hard tagging handbags/ purses as well as lingerie. Merchandise would end up on hummers and would need to be re-shelved in it's appropriate areas. DON'T FORGET TO SMILE AND GREET EACH AND EVERY CUSTOMER!"
good,"was force out of my position "
good,I had a blast when I worked in the stock room at Ross. We were the number one team in the district. The hours weren’t the greatest. Usually 30 hours a week if I was lucky. I don’t know how people survive on that.
good,loved the job it was only the management that was a con for me at the time when i was working there but a typical day in the stock room was fun and hard and sweaty
good,Ross is a great place to work but they do not give enough hours one week I had got only 8 hours which lead me to leave that place but overall it was productive and a great learning experience.
good,"Very unorganized, no job advancement, minimum wage (need I say more), management needs improvement, love the customer's some anyway."
good,"I enjoyed dealing with customers, helping them with their needs, stocking shelves, and handling the fitting room."
good,Enjoyed learning about different aspects of the law.  Daily client contact on the phone and in person.
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross very much. The management staff and employees were all fantastic people, just not to work around. There was way to much drama, I'm a strong believer in leaving the drama at the door as soon as you walk into work. There was no chance of ever being promoted, it seemed like all the advancements were based off of favoritism. Also, every one of the managers were not good managers. Goofed around too much and didn't really take anything seriously. I felt as though I was treated very unfairly there and did a lot more work then what had gotten recognized."
good,If you shop here & i do then you know the everyday scenery i enjoyed working there. Always meeting new faces.
good,"Have fun and enjoy it. Do the best you can. Have a positive attitude with the customers and be nice. Enjoy every moment, keep psus in ng even if it gets hard."
good,I loved working here. They switched manages around to different stores. We got a manager from Salisbury who is very unprofessional and very ignorant to the employees.
good,I loved working for Ross but most employees were absolute jerks to me and others. It made it very difficult to enjoy and want to come to work every day.
good,"management is great and the job is wonderful your always happy because the people you work with keep you laughing all day"
good,A typical day is coming into work to begin my routine of cleaning up after the last worker who was there and to ring customers up with their purchases
good,"Managers are nice, respectful. Maybe one or two of my co-workers were respectful and work along with me, two redhds make my days the worst, disrespectful, not counting my work, been racist with me on manager back, I'm a person whose speak three languages yeah I have accent two native languages and one by choice at least I know more than one that means more opportunities. Now I'm grateful I have a job that pays me for each languages I know and pay me by learning one more. I hope those girls the best of luck in their life."
good,"Very fun, in the sense that it was very paced,I almost always had something to do. The work hours and scheduling was great. The only downside was that,since it was a stocking position,getting product wasn't always guaranteed,and with no product to stock the sales floor with,means so no work."
good,i like helping customers put outfits together for there kids or interviews attire. helping customers solve their issues .. i like seeing the smiles on the customer face when they leave the store. there was always something to do and learn and which made my job very interesting i never gotten bored with the job.
good,"no hours like before coz the budget is very low"
good,I loved working here.  I had great managers who taught me how to be a cashier.  My co-workers were amazing at helping me out when I needed them.  THe hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for so long.
good,"It is an easy job over all they had me agree to ""voentaraly"" revoke my lunch brakes and work you 5 hr shifts every day if you don't tell them you need specific days off. The management so far is one of the best I have ever had out side of the messed up lunch things."
good,I really enjoy the atmosphere here at Ross . The manager is great and the working hours fit my schedule. If I didn't have to move I would not want to quit this job
good,It was so unorganized didn't like it. the management you have to go find them when you needed help with something. They was never at there desk. I did learn a lot from this job.
good,"Typical day at work was assisting customers, stocked merchandise, assembled merchandise for sales floor, worked as cashier.   I learned to be a team player on a large team. Management had a open door policy, creating a great culture to work at.   The hardest part was the inconstant hours.  The best part of the job was the people I worked with and assisting customers."
good,The job was great but the people that I shared the store with wasn't very work orientated. I enjoyed getting to know my co workers but wish I had more hours on my schedule.
good,"I worked the customer service desk for almost 3 years. I loved the people and my co-workers. Very nice place to work, loved talking and meeting new customers."
good,You can almost go into ross and whateva brand color fashion your looking for and you wont even pay half the regular price for it at any other store ive been to so far.
good,"I worked for Ross Stores Inc. for two years and I enjoyed the company and the culture. Many people who work for Ross are hard working and dedicated individuals. There is opportunity to advance and cross train within the company if you have the drive to do so. There are clear goals set, guidelines and it can be a very fun and fast paced environment. But its just like any job: stay away from negativity and work hard and you will succeed. The only negative aspect is the pay. Extremely low and un-livable just as in any retail position. This is a great position to work in as a college student to get managerial experience and work with a diverse group of people."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Ross Dress for Less, I met amazing people and I loved the fact that I was worked around the whole store. During my time at Ross I learned every aspect of the store and I appreciated the management for making sure that all of the employees knew how to do everything and anything so when any problem aroused, they had numerous people to fill in."
good,Ross was a new experience for me but a valuable one. I learned a lot about working with the public and patience. You also learn a lot about teamwork and customer service. I loved that I was given the schedule that worked with my family and I loved that I made some great friends that I still have today.
good,"The management can be rude, i have noticed the managers would have favorites. I enjoy working with my co-workers and the discount."
good,It is an okay job if you are single with no children. Highly recommended as a stepping stone career wise but not much more. I do not know what else to write.
good,Ross is pretty laid back however there is room for improvement.  Management needs to learn to appreciate there employees by addressing them with respect.
good,"Attend customers"
good,"i love this job other then dealing with the managers, the hardest part was the holidays at night time but we got through it as a team, i loved that it was relaxed,peacefully, no drama"
good,"The company overall is okay, I dont like the fact that Ross scores you on register, you have to be a speedy super human on register I guess is what they expect."
good,Working with the public insures everyday brings something new. You are able to crosstrain In multiple departments within the store. That allows you to be a even bigger asset to the store.
good,Mostly didnt enjoy the fact that they didn't really train but then management  would get annoyed if you asked what to do.  Then if you want to learn more they would happily do it but you wont be put on it ever again
good,"I have learned every step of the job, and am currently a back up manager. I have been offered three full time positions as management, but turned them down due to personal reasons. It can tend to get a bit too gossipy and drama filled but it is easily avoidable."
good,The company is great but the store I worked for was not exactly managed well and there was a lot of favoritism.This meant that people who deserved promotions didn't get it while others that didn't deserve them got them.
good,I loved the Gap. They really taught me what customer service was really about.. They taught me how to fold and merchandise the heck out of a store... Gap is awesomre
good,"My previous job included an almost non-stop 10 hour day of physical labor, Ross managed to make a 5 hour day worse. "
good,Its a good company to work for if you are in college. Its a fast pace job with a lot of detail that going into it. I have learned a lot with this company like how to flow a department and how to set up new event sections in the store. The part the i enjoy the most is being on the floor fix the store and making it look nice.
good,"Ross was a nice company to work for. They gave everyone good hours, tried to work around people, and had great customer service. I would work the cash register, clean up the floor, and work the fitting rooms"
good,I loved working here but once the management changed i stopped getting my hours. I was working 2 or 3 days out of the week or not at all.
good,I stared as stock room hand unloading trucks and putting security tags on shoes then was made Loss Prevention when the store first started the position. as loss prevention I walked the store making sure security tags were good and helped customers if needed.
good,Ross is a great company to work for. I currently work for them and its fun. I love being in customer service and you like customer service this would be an ideal job for you.
good,"Work was usually repetitive. I enjoyed helping my associates under me succeed and learning about their lives to create a personal yet professional relationship. "
good,Moving at a pace that was timely manner. In charge of Dressing room and putting back all racks of fitting room items. Markdowns and unloading of trucks. cashiering.
good,unload work truck onto conveyer belt sort new merchandise sensor tag and route new items out to sales floor to stock the shelves and fill up the racks greet customers with friendly attitudes helping them locate whatever it is there searching for managment was great very understanding. there was nothing hard to do about this job i most enjoyed working with others
good,"typical day learning english from different people, I learn any type of jobs, management : They are equal to the workers,co workers they are friendly and hard working, For me I never had a experience about a job being hard, and the most enjoyable part of my job is communicate with different people."
good,"a typical day at work is task filled, fun all my co workers are easy to talk to and get along with. i enjoy it very much."
good,stock shelves and attend to customers. make sure all customers are satisfied.
good,I was there almost 5 years I enjoyed every body there and customers I just wasn’t treated fairly when it came to shortages not only my responsibility but only blame on the person with draw. How can you work with that threat hanging over your head! And have a great attitude I was told!
good,It is an alright company to work for. There is so many epople employed though it makes it difficult to know your employees by name and ectas well as managements.
good,It wasn’t e beat job but it helped until I found something better and not so far out the way I really liked it nice environment and people were easy to get along with
good,I love working there especially since I see new faces every day and interact with some good coworkers. I appreciate the many doors it has opened for me .
good,"Management and HR were a little on the corrupt side when I was employed there, however I believe none of them are still employed there now. Other than that I enjoyed my job there alot. The pay was not that great but it was better than nothing, and they actually give their employees a really good discount compared to other places I've worked. I'd work there again to be honest."
good,Working at this store is better than when I started about 5 yrs ago. Manager are a lot better and helpful. Managers before weren't not good for the company at all. They were about themselves and their friends that worked there with them. The Manager and Asst. looks like they want the store to be successful. The company needs to have a better Loss Prevention program.
good,"Fast paced, yet simple tasks, management mostly had control of things, location was under poor conditions. Was not able to get as many hour or working opportunities, would have stayed for more hours."
good,"In the Stockroom We Always Had A Okay Day "
good,Management wasn’t as good as it could be and when we worked we work with not enough help. The store stays busy and it was a challenge to keep customers happy when we were always short handed on weekends our busies times
good,"I liked working at Ross the discount was amazing. "
good,Wish there were more hours and less change. Seems like there is always a rule changing every week that we have to adapt to and then all of a sudden theyll change it again. Can never keep up with the new rules. Maybe if some of the supervisors and managers acknowledge you when you come into work it would be nice. But they do not. They walk right pass you and do not even say hello or good morning. Instead of them thibking they are just better by not greeting you. Managers and supervisors expect you to greet every customer that you walk by BUT when they walk by a customer they do not even greet them or even smile. Its always a mean face.
good,"I enjoyed working at Ross,the manager was nice but firm at the same time. I met friends there that were hard workers as well.we had stayed connected thru out the years."
good,Ross is a great store to shop and work  Its high a speed work place.  you have to be on your toes and ready to work time you step through those doors.
good,This job is a great part time job to work at if you are a student or not looking for a full time job.  The moral in the store is great between all of the employees.  They are very flexible with the hours that they give you and will work with you.
good,its a good company when you first start working. management changes often. compensation is little. the messes are grand. customers are rude. policy change often
good,"very understanding , fun positive work atmosphere. flexible hours , works with students schedule , friendly cool and understanding manager , gives you howevermany breaks"
good,I enjoy working hard and making it to work on time. I also enjoy making customers happy and satisfied. I am very dependable and always wiling to work.
good,The hardest part of the job was walking around for eight hours.  There was only a 30 min break.The management team and co-workers were always friendly and helpful.
good,this place is a really great starter job. I enjoy working there at times but I knew I could do more. I didn't want to settle for less.
good,"I worked at Ross for 2 1 /2 years. I worked in the cash office, stock room, primary cashier. I was a heard worker and was available to them at any time."
good,"Good place to start when you really need a job. Typical retail work place. Co- workers are good. Not a really hard job. They really should lift employees wages. Even though it is not a hard job, its a lot to handle."
good,I've worked at Ross for 8months now and I like what I do. I work with some of the hardest working employee's and they are good co-workers. The hardest part of the job is of course the demand for a limited amount of products that we receive everyday.
good,"Clock in, work, clock out. This was a fairly easy job. I didn't talk to coworkers very often but got along with everyone. Shifts were very quick and usually always busy. Management was always dependable. I enjoyed working the p.o.s. machine above all. I didn't care for the customers who came in, not the best clientele."
good,"This a no nonsense work area. Every second counts."
good,"my typical day at work would be answering phone calls checking the shipment seeing what has to be shipped out for the day receiving the shipment and enter the cases into the computer scan all cases, file all of the invoices and assist lab as needed on a daily basis"
good,"Loved working here with the great people."
good,Ross stores is a part time job only. with benefits such as discounts on items within the store.
good,"Sales Floor "
good,"Dept Store Associate, clothing sizes. Management was o.k. The hardest part of the job was daily routine and the most enjoyable part was pay day!"
good,like any other warehouse environment good people the hardest thing ill say is loading the trailers but after a wile i did it with out a problem
good,"My typical day at work is fun and very fast paced at most times. I learned team work and now have better manners from working here. Our management team is fun and outgoing, but they get the job done. My co-workers are great, for the most part. The hardest part of my job is knowing when I mess up. The most enjoyable part of my job is giving my customers a great shopping experience"
good,"Fast paced retail store. With friendly regulars and friendly coworkers!"
good,I loved working there and the people were amazing but the work ethic was a team effort type of place.
good,"Ross Simons has been in the Atlanta market for over 20 years at Phipps Plaza. The store needs to be updated, but there is merchandise for every budget. The Store management team is great to work with if a customer should have a problem...Typical day is making sure the customers are greeted in a timely manner, and that their jewelry needs or repairs are met...The best part of my day or of my job is feeling that I have helped my customer."
good,Was a great and friendly atmosphere. Easy work! Taught me how to deal with difficult cutomers and trained me in every position thoroughly. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,Overall great place to work. Everyday is a different day. The people are nice and helpful throughout the daily process. I enjoyed working for this company.
good,Seasonal work offloading trucks. Busy atmosphere with lots of work around the holidays. Fast-paced seasonal work with steady hours and a good work environment
good,we would all work together to unload the boxes from the truck that would come every day and separate them in different categories so we could take them to the store and stock them.
good,"I was fortunate to work with a great team.  My managers worked with me regarding the schedule I needed and they were helpful, supportive and fun.  There are opportunities for full or part time and growth in the company.  I found the company to be very fair and very stream lined and organized.  I enjoyed my time working there."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. They worked with me to have the hours I could work. Happy and positive. I learned a lot about working in receiving and security.
good,Overall the company was fantastic. The work environment was very professional and safe. The best part was able to interact with the customers. I enjoyed the fast pace working environment.  I learned how to multi task while putting a smile on the customers face.
good,"Always busy with the location being in the downtown area. Be ready for a fast-paced, lively workplace every day. Must be efficient and quick thinking as well as work well with others."
good,I was able to learn how to handle money and take care of customers. I was also able to organize shelves and greet customers. It was a happy environment to work in.
good,The management and staff are friendly and willing to work with you outside life. Very understanding as well as clear when it comes to all questions regarding work.
good,This makes you feel at home. If you have fashion and you love picking out clothes for others than this is definitely the job for you. Making people happy makes me happy
good,"This company offers a good position for many college students at a good pay rate. The hours are longer than other retail stores but they are very helpful in accommodating your availability ,  need and comfort."
good,"I loved working for Ross because I’ve always wanted to do retail and it was just what I thought it was a great day everyday, I’ve learned that retail is more then hanging and folding clothes I’d definitely go back to retail such a fun experience"
good,"As an employee for Ross Dress For Less, it was an experience like no other, it was always busy and all the customers that has come through those doors were glad to be greeted as they enter,  the other employees were great and easy to work with that we became like family, and the other departments were just as friendly and helpful."
good,"A typical day at work was full of energy and teamwork. I learned how to unpack merchandise, sort in correct order, and how to properly stock material on floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team members to ensure everything was in the correct place."
good,"Moving up with the company due to the high turn over and lack of ambition in retail was key. Being accountable and working hard led me from loss prevention specialist, up the ranks to become assistant store manager. Stressful during holiday season, as in all retail, but well worth the return when you put in the work ethic."
good,"great place to work and interact with people everyday was a fun day "
good,It was among the 2 jobs I had the best. I like the fast paced environment and the friendly co workers.  Every day there's something new in the store.overall the best job ever.
good,Amazing pay and management great people to work around sweet discounts. Very motivating work place with tons of learning and customer service opportunities
good,It’s a good company. Nice people and fair amount of work. The hours fluctuate and can at times be disappointing. Primarily has part time positions. Good for those who have a lot of afternoon responsibilities.
good,"Excellent training. I started with Ross in 2006. I have been in Distribution as a (Garments On Hangers) G. O. H. Operator. I was an Area Supervisor. and I have been a Cashier. Loved every position. Loved every chance I've had to work for Ross. Would LOVE to work for them again. Excellent morals. Excellent atmosphere. Incredible and realistic standards. Overall, amazing company."
good,"Really nice environment to work. i learned how to stock and sort out lots of clothing. Super great deals. Learn how to use their new technology, and i enjoyed talking to costumers"
good,"Ross is a great job if you want to learn different parts of the retail world. At Ross they will train you in different parts of the store, which helps build experience."
good,the job okay to work for but they want you to do so much an the small time they give you to do things at the company they pay was okay but what I was making there as a manager I went to another company making that as a associate now smhd
good,"I treasure my time I spent working at Ross. I loved the actual work I was doing and got along really well with the management and my fellow employees. Maybe it was just being able to work in a clothing department, but it really left quite an impact on me! The management was very generous and understanding in regards employee needs. If given the chance I would work there again."

good,"Management was in sync with employees most of the time"
good,Very easy good paying job I enjoyed working there very good environment to work. All the clients were nice and very fast pass job always keeping busy and making sales
good,It can be fast paced at times but usually that just helps the time go by a little bit faster. I would recommend this job to someone in school or someone looking to only work few hours. It says part time but they usually don’t give more than 15-17 hours a week. Which makes me feel the pay should be atleast a dollar more because of all the work and because it’s biweekly pay.
good,Ross was a great experience for me. I enjoyed working there and was a great leader to my team. I was always on time and gave great customer service to customers.
good,"I would spend most of my time at the front as a cashier. This was my favorite job duty, it made time go by fast and I was able to gain more experience.

good,I became more of a people person and less shy. I learned I to manage my time properly. Become more aware that my actions do not only affect me. Became an even better team player.
good,"Working as a back office/Cash office representative at Ross can be quite fun. Pay is biweekly, the benefits are standard. But the job itself is good, often case the coworkers are alright."
good,"Knowing shoppers are happy, customers are safely,  store activity is respected , management is agreeable, employees are encouraged to work more effectively"
good,There were fun times at Ross. Managers were always throwing a party for appreciation of the employees. I would definitely work back there. It was good times

good,Great place to work. Great people to develop work relationships with. I learned a lot while working at Ross. I started as a retail associate and moved up to become the Area Supervisor of Operations.

With it being that we had to be at work by 6 and out by 11 you would want to work as fast as possible because there was a lot of hard tagging ond price changes that need to be made with in that time period. Management at this company is very fun and loving, although I was only a seasonal employee I felt very comfortable working in this particular enviorment.

good,I really enjoyed working at Ross. The people were friendly. The management was nice and considerate. The hours were flexible. I like the location and it was actually a very nice place to work
good,Ross Dress For Less is a good place to work. As far as a new person like a teen to the work force or A person that like a relaxed work place. Management is fare and doesn't micro manage the sales team. The real problem is hours you may get only 10 hours in a week or not week for a whole week at all. As you can see this is not a job a seasoned worker with bills would ever want. Good for a new worker trying to get their foot in the door but unstable hours makes the $11.00 dollars a hour starting pay useless but for around holidays.
good,"I worked at Ross for over 4 years loved it. Loved my co workers and management. Loved the employee discount. But , I would suggest to cooperate to make more opportunities for advancement."
good,This company values their employees. Meetings are held to equip the employees with knowledge about career advancement. They offer flexible work schedules and good management.

good,"A great workplace , More importantly very flexible with time."
good,"Fun place to work just not enough hours and pay to make a living, inconsistent scheduling. Great first job to start out with and get into the qork force."
good,A typical day at Ross Dress for Less was easy a bit fast paced but easy. most of the time co workers are nice but the assistant manager is a horrible lady and thrives on making it impossible for the employees
good,It has been a while since I worked seasonally at Ross. But I did enjoy it while I was there. It was Christmas time so it was a very fast paced place to work.
good,"Nice place to work really love my coworkers. It's just a lot to do in one day, but I blame the customers for being so messy all the time. You work hard, especially if you're closing."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work on the cash register. loved working with customers. very friendly person. i could interact with everyone and still work.
good,"I would mostly be checking people out and bagging their items. I always smiled and said hello and made small talk. I disliked having to wrap glass items because it would slow down the line. I enjoyed seeing all the different items as they came through the line. I learned customer service skills, counting  back change, bagging clothes, folding them neatly, and cleaning the store at night."
good,Ross was a great job to have as a college students. It provided for a very flexible schedule as well as a good work environment as well as discounts on store items.

good,I learned a lot from ross and had a great experience and I would work there again. It was just a temporary job but picked up skills while working there.
good,"The job has a friendly environment.  Time goes by quickly beause its always busy and get to meet new people, also if u love to help customers this job has alot of customer service.the managers are really good at working with your times and giving you flexible hours."
good,"Its a very mandatory job, you have to be in movement all day cleaning constantly and attending the customers at the same time. Its a place with a lot of shoplifters so you have to be attentive"
good,I loved my job. As long as there are the right mangers that know their jobs. Ross is a great place. But with out a good manger then the job stinks. You can meet amazing people there in other employees and in customers. You can also see some outta this world people come in. The job can be very slow or fast pace and it's never a dull moment.
good,I was cross-trained to do different things. I worked a schedule that accommodated my needs. I got along really well with my coworkers and the management staff. There was advancements for opportunity. I would recommend this place to anyone starting out in the workforce.
good,"This job gave me the opportunity to meet & great customers along with new co workers and earn extra money for Christmas."
good,Loved working there and loved the people i worked with i also liked the fact that they worked around my schedule for school and being a single mom  of a amazing 3 year old. Management was good to me when it came to my schedule and the hardest part was leaving all the wonderful people i worked with
good,"The management does a great job with running the store, treats all the employees with the same respect no favoritism's. Iv'e learned every roll they have in the store i could work any position. Dealing with disgruntal customers was very challenging."
good,The associates are all like a big family. we look out for one another and it keeps work fun. we always back up each other and help each other with tasks.
good,"Easy work environment. It's a fun environment, other than the rude customers. Management is kind and easy to talk to, able to work with your schedule."
good,ross is a very good company to work for if need a well paying but part time job. only downside is there is little room for advancement as the company does not tend to fire terrible workers unless they do something really bad (you are given many chances) sometimes its hard work during Christmas time it tends to be busy but most of the time it is not hard very flexible hours great if ur a college student.
good,they i good with people but some time team work is poor i learn alot from ross love working with customer and helping with they need my help

good,"Ross is a store were you dont work more than 15 hrs per week"
good,"I have learned how to manage my time properly by working at both jobs. My coworkers were very nice and sweet , they would help with anything if ever needed any help. The timings were flexible"
good,I loved working here the people the manager was okay. The manager I had is no longer there. I would work there again defiantly.
good,its teches hoe to work with people. workingwith all typ e learning to be funcatiol
good,I had a night shift and it was good not to busy like the morning time we was short staff. So I did double the work helped my other associates by cleaning up the sales floor putting items away. While also balancing ringing up customers on the registers.
good,"loved working for this company, no stress, management was excellent, they put place you where you are strongest...they saw some of us were good and fast when came to closing and that's mostly the shift we would get....only thing is you hardly get hours also..I loved it though just wish there were more hours and pay more...only 4 or five hour shift...cashier time I believe is way off..the people that worked a lot got good cashier time."
good,A typical day at work was usually calm. Management was amazing and made sure the employee's weren't overwhelmed with the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was that there were no tension and everyone knew what they needed to do.
good,Fun place to work. Nice management and people. Little room for advancement.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of being on the cash register, helping with customer service, answering phones, doing projects manager assigns, putting clothes on the floor, and keeping store clean and organized. The associates made the work place a fun place to work. it was stressful at times but I learned how to handle the stress. The hardest part of my job was keeping the store clean on a busy day. The weekends were the hardest. Other than that the job was easy."
good,The company was ok to work for...But not enough hours of work offered....

good,It was only 3 miles away from home so it was only a 5 minute drive to get to work. A d I really liked that. My favorite time working was after hours until 2 am during Christmas time.
good,"This was a good ""for the moment"" job. My managers were wonderful and worked well around my schedule, since I had another job. The pay wasn't great, but they were far about raises when you deserved them."
good,"Ross Dress For Less was a fast paced, family oriented, fun environment to work in! This was my very first time working at a retail store and at first it took some getting used to, but i caught on quickly.

good,"I LOVE Ross! It was a Great Company to work for however, the pay wasn’t fair to me .The Management Team was lax about being on the floor.Peak periods it was hard to get a Manager on Duty for a customer issue or complaint.So I was the Front Line Lead Cashier I had to take charge an handle any situation that needed a authority figure.There was no promotion for Growth there."
good,He wouldn't give me less hours. I work full time during the day. It was impossible for me to work five nights a week for 6 hours after working 8 hours.  He knew I had a day job. I begged him to cut back my hours. There is no way I could work 70 hours a week.  I had to quit my part job I loved. I loved working at Ross. It is hard work but It was fun!
good,The best part of the job was being able to talk to people from all backgrounds and cultures. I learned how to be quicker on my feet and handle any situation from dealing with customers in any mood.
good,I really enjoyed working at Ross dress for less management really cares about their employees but the hours are really low there is a lot of workers working and everybody is super part time almost everybody has a second job it is hard to advance you will only get full time if you are a manager
good,"The company itself is very demanding of its leadership. The Ross stores in general are a great place to make long lasting friendships as well as learning how to master customer seevice skills. This work setting can be very fast paced, but help is always given when needed. The company is very fair with lunch meals and breaks when It comes to the associates. This company is great for anyone who is a student, Ross is very flexible with your hours."
good,"The store has good merchandise, it's more corporate policies that should change a little. And I mean it more in the workplace as an employee than as for customers."
good,Great place to work. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Working over nights is new for me but everyone is friendly and helps you when you need help
good,"As a sales associate you go to work, clock in and check what store are are you in charge of. You organize that area and place items back where they belong. Also, help out on the registers if needed."

good,"It's always something to do at the store, so you're never bored. Although it's soo much to do, it seems as though there's never enough time to get things done on the sales floor. It's a very fast paced environment. You basically have no choice but to work under pressure."
good,Its easier to stay being a sales associate and not undergo training for doing returns. Once you know how to do returns they give you more responsibilities.
good,There was a poor management team that held you back from advancement...they are very flexible on hours and cery understanding about situations it is a hard fast pace working job and you need to be willing to learn step by step process

good,"Nice management , no complaints there. Always works around your schedule. Everyone is treated equally and always a team effort to get things done. Nice work environment"

good,"Good place to work meet new people everyday, the training was good, strict to a point, as long as you followed dress code and did what you were suppose to do you were left alone."
good,"it's cool not to bad, really like retail though, so if you enjoy retail you'll love this job, great with college students, but bad hours"
good,"Very easy once you learn product knowledge and placement for store requirements. arrange products, assist customers, maintain store, restock , assist in all areas as a sales team.  all coworkers on the sales floor work in all areas and help each other contribute to running the store. must be flexible, able to perform all different duties and responsibility associated with the job of a sales person, from cashier, stock, closing shifts, fitting room, and recovery of store . once you have become an expert in all areas you will easily gain job security and advancements."
good,I like the company and the people. Great discounts.They worked with my school schedule which was nice. You can move up if they see you want to and you have yearly reviews.
good,"On a typical day at Ross I would receive my truck sheet with that days delivery. I would then have to factory how much time it would take to be processed. I would prep the stockroom and the team while assigning work stations. Once the truck was unloaded I would work with the team to make sure they had what was needed to be effective and productive. I would also assign breaks and lunches. This gave me a over all understanding of the importance of every job and the employee that performed it. Management was frequently chancing but provided structure. While most co-workers often stayed it was dominantly female. The hardest part of my job was dealing with all of the personal problems the employees brought to work; however, it was the most enjoyable because it provoked my collage major."
good,"A typical day consists of going to work, getting the stock room ready to receive the truck with the merchandise we have to discharge from the boxes and get ready to put out onto the floor. The energy is good, and the people I work with are great because they always have a great attitude. The hardest part of working on the job is being fast enough, because we have a set time we should finish unloading the truck, but it keeps me motivated to be faster."
good,It is only part time but it works great for students looking to get some extra money. They pay better than most retail and work with schedules.
good,great place to work for those in school or in need of a part time job. Hours are good and the pay isn't bad either. Make sure to wear sun screen tho!

good,"I truly do enjoy working here the management is great, the co-workers are all nice and respectful and its a professional environment. The hardest part is the pay and the hours. I need something with me of both and really only reason why I am leaving."
good,"Managers was okay. the days was always nice and easy. the hard part was picking up clothes and folding them and finding its place after customer.i love my 20 percent discount i love that the job had activities outside of work for the job employee to do. i dislike the 7.25 ans the 14 hours, needed to be more."

good,"A typical day at work is work, work and more work. I begin the day greeting customers, smiling and ringing up merchandise on the cash register. After three hours of cashiering I over look my department and recover misplaced merchandise. Upon placing the merchandise in its proper place I begin my routine of replacing merchandise, removing damaged merchandise and finally organizing merchandise. By the end of my shift I department is well supplied, clean and the cash register is never short or over in the money transactions. "
good,i really enjoyed working at ross I started as a stockroom associate and within 3 months promoted to sales floor associate I worked hard everyday never missed a day I learned while working at ross that a team is more important than working as an individual my coworkers were awesome the hardest part about working there was getting up everyday at 4:30 in the morning to get there at 6 the most enjoyable part was working with all the customers I got to meet everyday

good,Couldn't make a career out of it. I hope to get more hours. Schedule is great though.
good,"Working at Ross as an associate from the stock room has been fun and i also have learned a lot. I am a new worker, I've  only been with the company for three months so far and it has been great. describing a typical day would be clocking in receive merchandise and processing and organizing at times i am also called in to work in for cashier. "

good,"i enjoyed working at ross, reasonable hours, not very stressful, not a lot of har work"
good,"I love my work and the people I'm working with.

I have learned new things such as cashiering, inventory, hard tagging and re-ticketing."
good,"They have a lot of requerments, but the pay is not lot. With this pay it's hard to support two little kids. The manager are great people, it's a pleasure working with them, also employees are great too"
good,"Great job experience, but not a career for me. No benefits, not enough hours a week, and only minimum wage pay."
good,Friendly staff and environment easy to do job description and always friendly customers. Job duties are easy if you willing to work and you must be able to work with others
good,"When I started working at Ross I barely had any retail experience or management experience. I started as a part time sps with minimal understanding of the job title. I slowly started growing thanks to my sps team and management. It really comes down to the people you work with. Those who want to see you grow will be on top of you, making sure you know everything that the job title requires. I’m thankful from those who i learned from that helped me grow in my professional career."
good,"Was a great first job , management was very friendly always treated you good, positive environment. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people you worked with whether it was co workers or managers"
good,"A typical day on the job would be you clock in and you do your lap around the store. This is for you to see what you might have to work on and see what needs attention to. Following going to the back and receiving the truck load and unloading it and also processing and separating the merchandise. After they are separated we would run them out on the floor and fill in the products. From this job i learned how to work with my time by focusing on what route is the most efficient to place the products away to optimize my time. The management was great, they are super friendly and supportive and they are willing to give you help if you have a question or if you are having difficulties. The work environment was good, everyone got along and had fun but the hardest part of the job was to not get upset with my own performance because i personally strive to do the best i can in what i do and if someone is better i try to exceed them but that is my own fault."
good,"N/A"
good,"I learned how to greet customers and team members to create a stress free environment,  helped customers search for clothing ,purses, shoes around store. "

good,"It's very busy at Ross, any position gets overwhelmed throughout the day but when you get through that rush you feel accomplished. I recommend it often but for me I feel too stressed out to be at that job. I loved my co workers and the discount made shopping very affordable."
good,"The people that work there are great, and the pay is good more than average. But it is never a set schedule, so you might work full time hours even tho you're just part time. Due to the lack of people showing up or various other reasons. Their will always be alot of work to be done there since so many people visit the store every single day.In conclusion it's a great job to start out in because there will always be work to do there and it's not complicated at all."
good,I personally enjoy my job at Ross  a pleasant place to work with great staff . Overall great experience with Ross I would recommend it for a great place to work & to shop
good,My work day starts with reports and ends with meetings and more reports. It was a great job but i became complacent and stagnant. Not enough room for advancement.

good,A typical day at work for me consist of being a cashier and back up manager. However I don't do this every day so the days I'm just a cashier I typically help a manger rearrange the store. I love working at Ross the work atmosphere is amazing everyone gets along I enjoy going to work each day because of this reason.
good,Ross is extremely fast paced and ideal as a customer service based job. Working as a cashier and on the sales floor you become the face of the company and learn to represent the values in the company.
good,ROSS is a very good company to work for it is a easy company that you can move up man you just will have to put in hard work not a better company to work for just put in hard work if you like
good,This is a good job they train you well and don't just put you on the floor to work and fail if you are starting out this will be a great first job to get the feel of warehouse jobs

good,"I love working at Ross! I love the people i work with and i also love helping the customers with their needs.

good,"Typical day at Ross was almost the same routine. Clock in your either on register your whole shift,fitting room,or on the floor organizing."
good,"Ross was a nice place to work at. The employees were cool, the managers were cool. The only con was that they did not help work around my school schedule and the pay is minimum wage."

good,All together good place to work just live to far away. Work is hard and will challenge you at times. And safety is a number one.
good,Working here is a lot of fun but is very fast paced and you don't really get to give a lot of face time to customers. Management is usually pretty good about working with your schedule should your availability change and buys the staff pizza at least once a month. Worst part of the job calling out fraudulent returns. Best part there are vending machines in the break room. Co-workers are all team players.
good,i enjoyed working at ross maybe it was the store i was with because the store was unorganized and the mangers was uptight an sneaky. but i enjoyed some of my co workers.
good,"I loved working for Ross and loved my employee discount especially when it was time for school shopping for my kids. When I first started at Ross I had great management who really cared about their employees, but towards the end that all changed due to new management it was sad."
good,There is usually a high turnover of employees because this is typically a entry level type of place. The managers and supervisors worked well with each other and lower staff when policy changes were implemented or discussed. The most difficult aspect of the job was working with customers who wanted items with a greater discount.
good,Meet great people very friendly. Easy to work with. Nothing in the company that I would dislike. I would say management is just fair.
good,Management is ok not the best but ok. The employees are great and the bond is even better. It was a great job to start at

good,"I enjoy working at Ross, the people that work there are great and everyone helps each other out. It's very easy going, although there are times we do get very busy."
good,"Ross is a nice place to work at if your situation allows you to work only one or two days out of the week. So, if you are a college or university student, working there wouldn't work out for you. A typical day at work would be running go-backs and if you operate the cash register you would always have a full and long line of customers, which is good."
good,Ross is a fantastic place to work. Everyone treated everybody like family. Just not given enough hours. Management is fantastic. The most enjoyable part of working at Ross was seeing all of my co-workers smile.
good,it was like any retail clothing store you either open or closed and closing was the worst becuase you had to recover everything and put it where it belongs till you finished
good,"The co-workers became family and leaving was so hard, but I was not happy with the stress and hate I was growing towards my job, The Co-Workers definitely make it worth staying though."
good,"Over all, it is a decent jobs. You can apply for benefits after working there for a year; but thats only if you can survive the low hours long enough to make it that far. The store and general manager were both great people that helped me find an appartment when I needed one. Truly great people."
good,"I get to work at 5:45a we clean the stock room and prepare to unload the truck, I've mainly learned about team work while working for Ross and my management team is incredible, they keep us in the loop and answer every question. My co workers are all pretty laid back and pleasant to work with, I'd say the hardest part of my job is lifting the boxes, the most enjoyable part of my job is going into a bright and joyful work place and getting a sense of accomplishment when everything is finished."
good,"for stock work it starts very early"
good,Coworkers are great people to work with. Very Friendly and helpful. would like to have coworkers like this. They make the time go by fast and are always will to help.

good,"I was employed with this company for one year and the reasoning as to why I left was because of school. I got along well with my co-workers and management seemed to be available if there was any need or questions one had. Ross consisted of mostly cashiering, customer service, and organizing. in which I had no issues with excelling.  "

good,"One of the easiest jobs in the world. Very laid back workplace, smart, fun, and easy to work with coworkers."
good,What I enjoyed most when I worked there was when  we we do the register or markdown you have to have a high productivity so I liked challenging myself to get faster
good,I like this company because I can do many different things. I have enjoyed learning because I have not worked in this kind of retail before. They tell me what to do and I do it. I do not have to have someone looking over my shoulder all the time during my work shift.
good,"I love working for Ross. The management has been very helpful when I wanted to transfer and then helped me transfer back to the same store. They listen to me, and help me out with every aspect of the job."

good,Great training process for new retail associates! (training videos & hands on training). You get a flexible schedule and the discount will always come in handy!
good,Thanks to Ross Dress for Less I can confidently say my time management skills have highly increased. Multi-tasking and gaining problem solving skills have very much been a benefit and I am so proud to have these skills under my belt thanks to this company.
good,"Ross is a company that is very home friendly and strives to satisfy any customers needs. It also has great health benefits and other benefits as well, like 401k."
good,Very disorganized and very messy store but great people to work with.  Lots of autonomy and it does not feel like a camera is watching your every move even though it is.  Very quick hiring process.

good,"This company truly helped me when it came to people skills. I learned how to multitask, and stay calm in stressful situations. I noticed that my customer service and organization skills has improved immensely."
good,"It's a stressfull environment especially during the holidays, they are usually short staffed and keeping track of the dressing room can be strenuous and you constantly have customers asking questions or upset about different things, like finding an item with no price on it.  Overall, the culture is fun, the people are nice, the pay is not the greatest and to be promoted is not easy. "

I am a Front-End Supervisor at Ross and no job has ever given me a supervisor position before and I am grateful that Ross has given me the chance at a position like that.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my amazing coworkers and the customers.
good,"A typical day at work is looking out for suspicious people and watching them while they shop through out the store, keeping close contact with the manager on duty letting them know whats going on and greeting customers at the door."
good,I loved working with people and helping meet their needs! I love clothes and fashion and shopping and eyeballing all the treasures! its the perfect fit for a mom who has kids  to make just a little more supplemental income! The co workers become like a family and I loved working together to keep the store at its best!
good,The work place was great to be in. Management and fellow floor members were very nice and easy to connect with. Everyone eager to help me. Management very hands on
good,A great place to work and shop. Working there has a very flexible schedules for employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships with other co-workers.
good,"Fast workplace and constant cleaning and organizing. Learned that no matter how much you tidy up you'll never finish. Management is great, they encourage you to move up and push you in doing better.  Hardest part is seeing how careless and ugly most people are, but at the end of the day enjoying that you get to go home with your monsters and relax."
good,The managers were always fun and motivating. There is always something to do and always plenty of customers to help. You'll never get bored working here.
good,I hate the fact that at my position we are powerless when it comes to theft. We should be trained and allowed to protect company assets. Currently customers can come and get anything they want.
good,"Working. At Ross was easy because it’s the same thing every day, at the same time. You know when the truck is coming, you know when the jewelery will be dropped off, you can banknon every day being the same. But it made it the easiest job in the world"
good,"While I worked at Ross, I experienced the best management by far. The manager there is super nice and super helpful. The employees are also very nice and welcoming. The work is easy and fun to do on most days. The only reasons I left was because of the location and because of attending school. Overall would highly recommend."
good,"I enjoyed working at ross mostly, except that the managers could be a little hostile at times. I loved the fast paced environment. But would have benefited from more direction"
good,It is a great work environment overall. Everyone welcomes you in and   gives you the right direction. I recommend this job for sure to kids in high school and college. As a part time worker you don't receive too many hours.
good,Great managers and staff members. Can be a fast paced and stressful job especially during holidays and back to school season. Overall pretty easy going job once you get the hang of it.
good,"Ross was an interesting place, had a very wide culture of employees and customers, here is where I learned my management and people skills, this job taught me a lot and for I taught as many employees as I could. Job can be stressful at times but all jobs can be. Definitely recommend this place to others, can honestly say hardest part was turnover rate for my store had several college students coming and going, but other than that awesome company to work for and grow with."
good,Ross was a good company to work at. Nice people but breaks weren't that good sometimes. Also some of the rules weren't fair or clear so sometimes it wasn't a good place to work
good,"I did really enjoy working at Ross. They cross train you to do everything in the store so that you can know hands on how to handle every section. The managers i had were really nice, but the pay was so little that i had to find another job."
good,Our old manager was the worst but once we got a new one the workplace changed for the better. Only thing I felt I was let go unjustly. If I could go back I would! Also I felt the 20% discount should have been for the whole store not just certain places.
good,The role of the SPS is to watch customers and associates to prevent theft.  I learned many things.  How to observe people to look for potential thieves.  The culture is team oriented.  The SPS team is kept separate from the other associates so we are able to watch and report any suspicious activities.
good,"It's a fast paced working environment with a lot of tasks/jobs to do, so everyday was always different. The people I worked with were friendly and helpful. Management was always there but constantly busy in the office but the only bad thing about it is that it's understaffed and they usually call you on your day off to cover someone who didn't show up which is also good if you want hours."
good,"Working with little work experience was easy in a difficult time what I learned was to be reasonable the management was fair enough the workplace and culture was a challenge, the hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy every customers needs, the most enjoyable part"
good,"I absolutely loved my managers, they were so kind and understanding. Very flexible and overall great people to work with. When it wasn't a holiday season work could be slow but can't complain."
good,"I'm only seasonal, but they place has been great and everyone is super friendly. Paid breaks is great and you get 30 minute lunches.  Long hours and super busy during the holidays, but definitely enjoyable."
good,Worked for several different Store Managers over my years of employment.  All the management staff really liked me because I would come to work when another associates would call in.
good,The managers are wonderful and friendly. They are very understanding and will help with anything they could to make this a great work environment. I love this place
good,They made you work like a dog for little pay and would push you for the supervisors own bonus. Some people were very lazy and expected others to always pick up their slack.
good,I only worked here for the holiday season. The hours fluctuated but I worked as long as they let me because once the season ended so did the job. They do give you the option to stay on but the regular hours are scarce and tend to be given to those with seniority.
good,"This is the first retail company that I have worked for and it taught me a lot about the business."
good,Ross dress for Less is a great company to work for. It's very easy to learn each job position they offer and the managers are amazing. By far one of my favorite companies to work for.
good,"My time at Ross so far has been pretty great. I have complete control over my desired work availability, which is every college student's dream! My fellow associates are easy to get along with and the management cares about your well-being!"
good,"Ross has this really fun and open environment. Everyone here has a great sense of humor and is so friendly. The employee discount is great too especially on already low prices. There's always something to do and is extremely fast paced most of the day so you stay on your toes whether you're in fitting room, recovering or in a cashier box. All in all an amazing place to work!"
good,I loved working for ross.It was a Great team work environment everyone worked together only thing I disliked was the lack of hrs and they were unorganized.
good,"Nice colleagues, management will always listen to you. great work flexibility. busy atmosphere, good part-time job.Customers sometimes are worst part of the job."
good,Good times with this company. Great people. Management is awesome. Can't get a lot of hours anymore working there like you could when I was there. Nice place to work.
good,"Demonstrate courtesy, respect, friendliness, and professionalism at all times. Provide prompt and efficient responses to customers at all times. Handle all customer issues in a courteous and helpful way, calling a member of the Supervisory Staff when needed."
good,"A typical day would be a short shift from 1-5. If Im the afternoon cashier I would make sure my register/work area is organized and set with bags. Then I would check out customers. 15 minutes before my shift is over I would clean up my work station. I would put my hangers in the correct place, clean up my alarm tags and process my returns. Before clocking out, I'd make sure my area is clean and organized for the next cashier."
good,The job was great. Pay could of been more but overall ok place to work. If you like fast paced and staying busy work here. I enjoyed my time here. Unfortunately I moved.
good,Great Prices to Shop in a Huge new store. Hours of Operations are wow amazing ending at midnight and some times a little pass one am. Formerly worked at Ross dress for less on 17th St. 33316.
good,"Working at Ross Dress For Less was a great experience, My manger 's were very patient and respectful. The hardest part of the job was closing because the store is really big."
good,Great place to come to work. Every day you learn new things. working together as a team just feels like family. Its a very inviting place to come and shop at any time of the day.
good,"I love the company, just want more hours. The management & people are awesome. Very nice work environment. I enjoy the interaction between customers. Enjoy everything about working there, except not getting enough hours."
good,Greet every customer who walks in and thank every customer who walks out. The job was very easy. The only thing i didn't like was that most of the time there wasn't things to do. So the most enjoyable part of this job is having things to do.
good,"Great place to work, and has a positive environment. Definitely a great place for a college student to work because they are flexible with your schedule."
good,I work during the holiday hours. It was fun and challenging. I learned cashiering and managing my front end cashiers. Hardest part of the job was working the late hours. Best part was the family orientation the whole store gave.
good,"Productive. Good part time job for a teenager. Benefits for full time workers. Great discount. Short hours for part time workers, so if you're applying, apply for full time."
good,"If you enjoy working with people and helping them find what they need, this is a good retail store to work for. It's people based and enjoyable to work here"
good,"ROSS was a very positive experience for me.  A very peaceful, pleasant place to work.  Well managed and organized, clean and drama free.  The store I worked at was filled with honest, hardworking people who I am honored to know.  The only reason I left is because I needed full time.  If you are looking for the perfect part time place, I highly recommend ROSS."
good,fun place to work associates are great management easy to talk to flexable with your schedule procedures change a lot great place to work
good,"I enjoy the work environment, I am was quickly promoted and the compensation was fair. My management worked around my schedule, and I would work for this company again."
good,I was a sales floor associate and a cashier when needed. Because being a sales floor associate was extremely boring I had to quit. I loved being a cashier but I only was able to do that a few times including grand opening day. Management was extremely awesome I loved them very good at there jobs and friendly
good,Well in the eight years of me being at Ross it was a great work environment. I was a good worker but never got notice or nothing for my work I did at the end of the i didn't think it was right for me to have not get no recognition for all the hard work I put in. Overall I wouldn't say that's its a bad place to work. Just that u get looked all over. I was told I needed to change my availability which is and was not true she never told me that. Truly would love my job back at a different location.
good,"A typical day at work was to clock in, go to where you are stationed, Cashier or Floor Sales and make sure your area and nice and organized. Customer Service was good."
good,"Our management is great, they work side by side with their employees. I love my co-workers they are all very caring and great to work with. Working at ross i have learned many different things, but my favorite is how we process clothing."
good,"It's a nice place, I enjoy it overall. I think there should be more security to prevent theft. There are a lot of people who steal and it sometimes makes customers and employees feel uncomfortable."
good,This is a great place to work. I really enjoyed it here. The only reason I left is because I ended up moving away very suddenly. Great management and flexible scheduling.
good,I loved the co workers I was working with. It made it easy and comfortable to get the job done.The only hard part about being a stocker was when we opened up the store the customers couldn't really shop like they wanted because we were still putting out merchandise.
good,"I like working here, but if you don't know how to handle stress this would not be good for you. You need to be working in a fast pace and with excellent customer service."
good,"I learned a lot of things at Ross,  i love working there, hard working, good communication with the Customer, i really appreciate it, and enjoy it."
good,The co-workers make it really fun to work here. Everyone is really nice and helpful. The only downside would be that most positions are part time.
good,help customer in charge of the front end of the store.  Great experience for me something different.  co workers are fun and nice great people to get along with
good,Shortly after working here I learned that my job wasn't just the cashier but it was everything else. All the workers pitched in with each others jobs which made it nice to work there. We were all like one big family and I really enjoyed working at Ross Dress for Less. Everyone was there for each other and were very encouraging. My only complaint is that we were constantly understaffed and not very many people would be stationed at a cashier so I was left on my own several times. I understand that they were busy and just doing their jobs but it would've been nice to have at least one other person on a cashier.
good,They are very flexible with working around your schedule and the overall culture of the store is great! Management is great to work with as well.
good,"It Was Good Experienced Working for this company with professional Associates"
good,"days generally passed quickly, We were always given the chance to advance and learn something new. My supervisors were wonderful to work with, as well as my coworkers. The hardest part , was working with loud machinery . I enjoyed being replenished for my hard work."
good,It was always a good time. Never a dull moment. I learned a lot about customer service. My co-workers were always there when I needed a helping hand.
good,The staff and manger are awesome. Just there weren't many room to grow. Whatever position you get there you'll mostly be staying on your foot for the full time of your shift
good,"In the 3 years I have been with Ross I have work on 3 different shifts,  I have oversee multiple areas of production,  I was promoted from Supervisor to Assistant manager within 2 years."
good,"The job is great, the work environment is wonderful to be around. The people, the coworkers and managers are always trying to make it a great experience to have"
