rating,review
bad,"Bank of America is easily the worst company I have every worked for in life. The management ""leadership"" is disgusting. They expect entirely too much from you with giving you absolutely no support and then wonder how you're not succeeding. Nothing is EVER good enough for anyone and they never acknowledge your efforts. Workplace culture is horrible, the people are all MISERABLE and RUDE and it shows. This job will literally drive you insane and question your motivation and self happiness"
bad,its not a good company to work for. They don’t value good employees. they are only concerned about what’s best for the company. they don’t care about your career goals or advancement unless you are kiss butt then they like you and will help you. otherwise they feel like you are expendable
bad,"Sales, sales, sales. Sales, sales, sales. Do anything to sell sell sell. Customer service? Nah, just get the sale. You get the idea. Ultimately, you will be fired if you try to help customers but don’t get sales."
bad,"Management is corrupt. They only care about sales. Do not treat employees very well. Barely give breaks. One teller gets busy. They could try to treat employees better than just ""sales associates"""
bad,"When interviewing at the time, I had 4+ years experience working in a call center environment. With both front line and management experience. I accepted the position due to the ability to ""advance your career quickly"". The entire time I was employed not only did they not promote, but let go, and closed various departments."
bad,Just don't work there its not worth it. Pay was good but not worth the stress and unhappy work environment. The management team sucked and there comfortable with providing horrible customer service to their customers
bad,"Performing a variety of duties regarding personnel actions including implementing personnel requests and coding personnel actions for processing."
bad,Place is brutal and will term you over minor details even if you are a top producer. I am stunned at the poor working environment and would not recommend this company to anyone else. DO NOT WORK HERE
bad,"Working as a temporary worker in the post room and loading bay, but I didn't have a great experience, as the managers were disorganised and unhelpful. I wouldn't work there again."
bad,"I work for Bank of America for almost 3 years, over these years I have learned a lot in the financial industry. Especially in the field of sales. I met so many great people including customers. However, I concluded simply Bank of America is not a great place to work for those who started at the very bottom. This company is only threat well top leaders managers and those who are at bottom are living a stressful life from day to day."
bad,The management with ATM Debit fraud servicing is horrible. There is no clarification for new policies being implemented. Once you are in the department they make it hard for you to transfer.
bad,It is a fair place to start a career. The salary was very low and I believe the   biggest problem was that I had to stand on my feet for 8 hours plus overtime hours.
bad,I currently work at this place in the beginning was great but things turned for the worst when management changed and the requirements they ask for is ridiculous and no one on the floor to help you at all I would never recommend anyone to work there and the manager s stress you out
bad,Extremely understaffed.  Work loads consist of consolidated positions to reduce payroll.  Training is meticulous.  Effective training depends on management and their desire to be patient until training is completed.  Due to short staff there's a possibility training may not be completed.
bad,You will be working in closely monitored environment. Do not expect anything rosy with this organization. Many felt there is no career with Bank of America. Hire and fire company. Even very senior level managers have been sacked on short notice.
bad,Employees are not cooperative and very backward with technology.  no one to help when you are on boarded onto the project. Managers do not have time t
bad,Bank of America is a micro-management Environment with a small Salary for doing the Most for Nothing. The Managers and SOCALLED-Coaches shows extreme favoritism to employees they like not the performance of an employee. The on the job training is the worst they throw new hires on the floor speaking to live bank of America customers NOT fully understanding what to do.
bad,Horrible environment.  10 to 20 employees either quit or fired within the 1st year of employment. Managers are the worst and far from unsupportive. You are not told during the hiring process or training what is expected on a daily bases for profomance. Therefore you will fail and your career is forever tanked at Bank of America
bad,"Even if you hit your sales goals, they'll still find a way to get rid of you!!!  This is ludicrous, and totally wrong!!!  I did learn a lot, but it means nothing when they get rid of your position and tell you to collect unemployment!!!"
bad,Only the tortoise knows what hides under the shell. BOA offers great benefits and there are many perks including free banking and incentive ratings for employee mortgage and auto loans.
bad,I can't say anything good about this company the healthcare at Bank of America was good.  They give the employees a medical card with 250.00 for medic
bad,I loved working for Bank of America when we were still Seafirst! In the last 8 years this company in the retail devision does not care about their employees what so ever! They have eliminated just about every teller position and allow their customers to wait and very long lines to see one teller! There is no real incentive to work for a company that does not take care of their employees!
bad,"Years of service nor experience is valued , your experience should further your career not others. In other words they will expect you to train your new boss."
bad,Management was never there to help. If you have questions they make you feel like an idiot for asking. No flexibility in hours. Full time teller are there all day with little to no breaks and interrupted lunches.
bad,There KYC programs is Horrific and the leaship is questionable. I'd not only not recommend working there I'd suggest not banking with them as well. WORST WORK EXPERICE EVER
bad,"Remember you are a number with a army of spineless managers and you will be ok. If u can find anything else to do try it, this should be last on your list."
bad,Besides pay being descent . This is the most guetto unprofessional call center ever. Im miserable here & if it wasnt because looking for another job is impossible i would of been left
bad,"I had a very short contract so I don't have any information to provide on this company."
bad,"They care more about the numbers accounts than you as a person rude awful Managers "
bad,"I was only their for a few months working contractually, they were a shell of their former selves. After Fidelity gutted their entire work base, they just exist now. I worked in the 401k dept. which was fun at first, but when I figured out the one person who actually made it to a permanent position, had to work under contract for 2 years, I realized it wasn't the right job."
bad,fair it was ok  lack of work life balance too much stress. there is a lot of sales pressure. team associate good but management ok slightly not fair otherwise good
bad,Don't like it. Bad management. They will never teach you other parts of banking. Tellers Don't get compensated for sales. Only managers take their portions.
bad,"Poor management, they don’t care about you. None of your thoughts or concerns matter to them and they love to terminate or give many probational warnings or write-ups for little to no reason at all. Seen and heard of it happening, personally had 2 write ups for something management was at fault of but like I said, they DON’T care. This company also had many law suits, you cannot sit down.."
bad,"Horrible place to work if you like your branch manager cussing at you and making you feel incompetent then this is the place."
bad,"Management is extremely ridiculous on numbers and what you have control over as the associate. "
bad,"Bank of America use to be a great place to work!!!"
bad,"Bank of America attracts candidates only because of its name. The Washington DC market is a nightmare to work for especially if you have had other work experience.  Income is the lowest in the area, management is abusive to employees, incentives are deceptive, advancement is not available for internal retail staff unless you make bank of america your life.  Management doesnt  respect employees and just be prepared to be treated like a daycare child. "
bad,Management cares more about the number of sales. Micro managing is intense on a daily basis. Pay is low but expectations are high. No Christmas Party provided by the company
bad,"Worst company with the worst training and the most  unprofessional,  incompetent managers that do not offer sufficient support or training. No room for growth whatsoever,  they have  a  ""system for existing management teams  that  spend all day walking around gossiping and talking about their private lives even in training classes  and then after spending the entire day  talking "
bad,Tough to meet sales goals. You have to really like talking to people and selling them products. You have to work weekends which can be a bummer. If you meet you goals its a nice bonus
bad,"After they merged with Merrill Lynch, BOA is not the same company. They lost all their employee base to Fidelity, because they treat people better than they were treated at BOA. Only take the job if you have no other."
bad,Not good they don’t appreciate there employees  they pay is not good and the hours are worse. You do too many different jobs and your not appreciated for. And there is always someone breathing down your back.
bad,"Worked in a project for a production team and the experience was the worst in my professional life. Management team was never on the same page, there was no clear instructions of what was required to do on daily basis, one particular supervisor love to take credits for things she didn't do. Overall it was bad and I will never want to work at this place ever."
bad,"The culture is the worst. They do not offer ramp up for new employees which is why people turn them down. The pay is the lowest in the industry and the recruiter admitted they lie about employees making six figures to get you to work for them. They have no proof of a six figure salary for more than 2 employees from the last 2 years with basis point decreasing quarterly. More tenured people are leaving the company and until they make changes, the turnover will continue to increase. Top performers are finally realizing their worth."
bad,i was misplaced in a position way over my head so it was a quick 3 months made some friends retained some project management skills. high expectations right from the start when i was told it was would be more entry level
bad,Dont work for this corporate giant criminal! They are corrupt and Management is horrible and use you for there own benefit and will cut your throat and wont think twice about it
bad,Bank of America only cares about employees meeting sales goals.  They can set the goal at 7 credit cards for example once that goal is reached they would say next time get 10. Nothing is ever good enough.  No flexibility.
bad,"Bank of America service is horrible - the worst.  The stock does not move, and their clients dislike the support.    It is boring and the management does not care about staff."
bad,Very stressful upper management don’t care about the employees not enough employees to do the job they expect to be done when asked for help you don’t get it you work hard and you are not apreciate
bad,"The work environment had more turnover in management then a restaurant. Each manager was less professional until the last manager was so unprofessional (gangs tats on her wrists, dressed inappropriately, used curse words as clients left the teller line and screamed at two clients that I witnessed before finally quitting)."
bad,"Too many obstacles...after new management, couldn’t use my cellphone in bank as a loan officer, couldn’t make cold calls from company phone, couldn’t come and go as I please to network and whatnot, training was not good, 2 new managers were not supportive...I should’ve listened to my friend In title who told me not to work for Bank of America...he was right...this was a horrible experience!"
bad,Terrible place to work for.  The only thing I can say is that I needed medical benefits.  I have worked for many big banks.  The management was horrible and broke at least 4 HR rules every day. So happy that I got another job offer at another big bank and left without a notice. Good bye.
bad,"People run the mouth to talk the way out by cuss & curse on a daily basis. Don""t even report it to management or HR and you would be targeted and out."
bad,I worked at BofA for a short time but in that time I witnessed first hand management belittle and treat employees like trash. The turnover rate at my location was high because of the management. They stressed everyone out and expected you to be perfect. But if you weren’t perfect they’d go off on you. There was no understanding or sympathy given by the management. They made my experience here miserable.
bad,"At first rainbow and sunshine as a banker, training program designed for the novice.  If you have skills, dont show it in training, you will be singled out and forced to quit as they will ensure you fail the final test.  As a manager there I had first insight as to the seriousness of the problem.  Upper management just dont care.  Hi pressure to perform.  With the training you get is a joke.  HR is not your friend.  It is common that people will call HRfrequently for anythingbthey find offensive.   Stay away from BOA."
bad,Hard times click inspired atmosphere. Hard to get into the right click. Not what you know but who you know...hard to get the appropriate guidelines and connect with the right click so you can excel in this environment
bad,"Branch manager was so competitive with other branches that she set the daily expectations for add on service to a unreasonable amount.  She even got to the point that you had to keep a written tracking of the leads and if you didn't get enough one day, you had to add those to the next day's expectations.  Branch manager was so incompetent that she would hide in her office all day long to avoid customers and wouldn't answer the phone when we would need her at the teller lanes.  Had to actually leave the lanes to get her attention.  she would also leave early all the time, take long weekends and basically try to be out of the building because no one was reporting on her to the district manager."
bad,"With all the layoffs twice a year, everyone was always on edge wondering if they were next.  Every time one would get called into the mgr's office we would all look and say ""oh no, this is it"".  The pay is very low, and it is VERY hard to move up or over to another dept."
bad,ML was embarrassed to be owned by BofA and that hurt our financial planning side. BofA is terrible and pays terrible. ML keeps the bank afloat.  The new initiatives never made sense and just wasted all of our time.
bad,"We were micromanaged, yelled at, talked down to and reminded daily that they were ""paying us a lot"" so we should just sit there and take it. As a contractor, I cannot remember the last time my job was held over me in such a way. Forget that they didn't want us to write (which is why they hired us), they demanded a lot of loyalty for a group of folks they treated like rats. "
bad,this place was a joke - that's why it became m & t bank.  BOA couldn't find the proper vp's to run anything proper - all they cared about was their own little corner offices
bad,"High stress and management is not there to assist you but push you for unnecessary work. Is number based job, however, you are required to stop assisting clients in order to answer calls."
bad,"Company benefits are not as good as people think. Management does not listen nor have a true vision on a direction.  "
bad,I worked at BOA for 8 years in their Kennesaw location and I can say that I would rather work in fast food than to EVER go back to that company. The work life balance is horrible no flexible scheduling the pay is horrendous. The opportunity for advancement is not there the leadership is clueless. I can honestly say that it was the WORST company to work for.
bad,i did not like this company i was only there for a year... they were the worse mortgage group that i ever worked.I was not happy there and their operations were out of hand.
bad,No room for advancement. Favoritism is very real. The team leads and managers look out for their favorites. The managers are disrespectful and push their religious beliefs on you. You don't get recognized for the overtime hours you work. They don't care if you have family to come home to and spend time with. They just want you to work and come in on your days off. If you don't you will not get a raise.
bad,"While I think Bank of America could be a great company, internally there needs to be a lot of changes made. Management is made up of all “ grandfathered in” employees stuck in old school of thought and good ole boys club mentality. New talent and knowledge is frowned upon and when illegal activity or employee misconduct is reported, you will be fired in retaliation. As mentioned previously, a lot of illegal banking activity takes place and certain managers are in certain capacities in order to push these activities though the books. They also have many patsies in place to look the other way while bad deals and dirty money are layered on the books. I think with a management overhaul and new leadership, the bank could be revived alongside greater regulator oversight."
bad,I was the relationship banker and then they changed my role to be more of a teller and I didn't sign up to be a teller.  I always enjoy working with the customers and selling product.  In a teller role you don't have those opportunities.
bad,I intended to grow in this Company. The manager signed me up for failure because I did not agree to do everything by myself when there were other employees that were hired to do the same job. I feel so sorry for customers who really think that this Bank does the best for them.
bad,So many layoffs but the work never decreased. 10 man team went to 5 and all wound up working 60+ hours per week. Then they got laid off eventually as well.
bad,"The worst part of BofA is the management and executive team. Every year thousands of people lose their jobs so the the CEO can get his multi-million dollar bonus! "
bad,"Horrible stressful lack of leadership, they dont care about you at all, there is no work life balance, if you call off you will get fired, if you get promoted you wont get a raise they call it a lateral movement"
bad,A one star rating  is generous at least  in the Delaware  market. Promotations are based upon your oral presentation skills  not about job performance.  Tips  for success  be a pretty  young woman  or a master's coke dealer.
bad,its a call center that is filled with mindless zombies who all hate their jobs. there is no chance for advancement in the company and there were raises promised but never granted.
bad,I currently work here in Wealth Management. The callers are all wealthy snobs that talk to you like you are an idiot. Call center work is hard enough. Managers are always changing so its hard to get an understanding of direction. I have had 4 managers in one year. Advancement is based on how well you kiss butt and who you know. Atmosphere is full of young people right out of college or this is their first job. No one with any prior experience in the professional world has any business doing this kind of work. Schedules change every 6 months based on performance. Went from a 6am-3pm to a 10am -7pm on 10 hour shifts..hated to show up to this place only because I have bigger dreams for myself and so should you!
bad,Management does not care about you as an individual. There are opportunities to move up only if you have an education or you know the right people. I would not recommend it.
bad,"Working as a RM, The first 2 months of training are ""okay"" 9-5pm for 8 weeks. Just doing a bunch of role plays and assessment tests. Not much hands on till the last 2 weeks of training."
bad,"Bank of America is a terrible workplace. Pay is only adequate for the work required. It was a very stressful environment with far too much emphasis on precise requirement varying for each class of client, and much too punitive action for the slightest error."
bad,"stressful with no time to pause. the workplace environment is challenging , answering customers questions and concerns. including but not limited to angry customers."
bad,"Was a great place to work and  the job was fun. until the company was bought by another company and all employees were let go. "
bad,"Very strict and rigid company culture. Many employees were suffering from stress and anxiety and I witnessed many that were crying at their desk from the pressure that was put amongst them. You were given a bathroom break allowance that if you needed to go outside of that time, you needed a Dr.'s note!"
bad,They mask their widget pushing to seem like they’re helping people financially. When in reality they prefer to hire people from sales to just sell you products you don’t need or want
bad,"Too much work in day shifts and biased environment."
bad,"Bank of America is really HARD on their employees!!  I hd the worst experience there!!  Do NOT apply for this company!!  They do have good Medical benefits, though..."
bad,poor translucent company i do not recoomend this company to anyone who is willing and wants to advance. it all sounded good until i got in. its a shame i turned good jobs down for this company. Do you know a branch manager called me a liar. i have never felt so low and disrespected in my life.
bad,"opening closing procedure. sales driven, you ave to make your goals, there's A LOT of coaching if you don't. stressful environment. never given the right resources, they ask what they can do to help, but never do. management at my location had favoritism."
bad,"The company is nothing more than a revolving door with no regards to any loyalty and their employees. The management will constantly hire and fire within the year only to appease their budget and personal pockets. This is the worst company to work for and thank God I can say, I'll never work there again~"
bad,Always left jobsite almost in tears and this was on a daily basis! Customers are ruthless they speak to one as if we are dogs and representative may not disconnect call. Had to take all the verbal abuse. Management is a joke only way to move up is if you know someone that has that kind of pull. Hated every minute of it.
bad,Bank of america is not good employer. You are going to work so many hours for minimum wage. Management is terrible. If you see yourself in this environment apply.
bad,"People think banking is easy and fun"
bad,"This company is so unprofessional. I was asked to do full time hours, even overtime but was only paid part time benefits. When I asked if I can get full time benefits they said no since they didn't want me to work full time for that long. "
bad,"No raise for 3 years.  Had to work weekends/holidays and always had to check my emails at night.  To anyone considering to work here - hope you like lots of meetings as your calendar will be full every day and no time to do your ""day"" job."
bad,"Run don't walk from B of A, worst professional experience of my life.  They have zero concern about their clients or employees, only what is best for them.  The atmosphere is toxic."
bad,"I worked at boa for 3 years with no raises, when I was offered a promotion they wanted to raise only 2 dollars on my pay and give me way more responsibility than what I should have with the position. Poor training, inexperienced management that never knows how to answer your questions. Nobody wants to work because they offer such a low pay and always short staffed so constantly you have to skip breaks, do half hour lunches and stay overtime. A lot of pressure and stress."
bad,"I was interview for a Position I was well qualified for. During the interview process I was informed I meet all qualifications for the Position & would receive a call shortly. Approx one week after interview I was offered a Lower Trainee Position, they claimed my Position was taken out of budget. (Turned out it was a lie, a friend of somebody received it from outside the bank.) Being just layed off from previous Position I accepted the Trainee Position, just to find out advancement opportunities didn't exist. Training was horrible, Had to ask for Performance Reviews which only gave you a salary up to the current minimum set for your Position. Human Resources  was horrible. If you complained about Upper Management, it was referred back to your Manager ASAP, and you were treated like a DOG. Would not recommend this company to anybody. My review was my experience, somebody else may have different. However I've spoke to other ex employees and they all pretty much said the same."
bad,"Not a bad place to be, really. Pay could be a lot better, but the benefits were pretty fair and the work/home balance was pretty good. Not a bad place."
bad,"The star assignments, lay offs and other events will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. They do pay more than competitors, but they hire predominately individuals from overseas which may hold fake credentials as they are severely lacking in skill and basic knowledge of their positions for which they somehow landed a job."
bad,this place has so much corporate bureaucracy and unfair employee treatment I don't know where to begin. management was terrible to the point corporate finally fired entire department. Employees opening accounts in customers name for sales credit. a lot of dishonesty and loss in trust.
bad,"It is a relaxed job if you like to sit at a desk and work from a computer. You can stay to yourself and listen to your music in most positions. But it is a very stressful place to be.  Micro managing, poor pay, stressful work environment. You may need SSI's after working here!"
bad,Position was new so they didn't have a structure yet with the new hire employees. I would tell someone to work any other job before applying at this company. I tell everyone I know who tells me their applying to BOA to get ready for stressful days and constant headaches.
bad,Highly stressful company to work for. Unrealistic goals for bonus targets and terrible management personnel. I wouldn't recommend this position to anyone who has a conscience.
bad,Employees are treated like slaves and contractors are treated even worse. Management is incompetent and will replace you at the snap of their fingers. People at the lower levels are disposable to them.
bad,The overall work experience prior to the ML merger was excellent.  The ML associates brought a tension and cut throat working environment that ruined the spirit that you mattered.
bad,"Not a good environment to work in, poor management and no team playing efforts, everyone for themselves , very cut throat environment.  Would not recommend working at Bank of America."
bad,"Bank of America is one of the worse companies that anyone could work for. The structure is Dog eat Dog. The management upper and lower, encourage the same behavior that WellsFargo go in trouble for."
bad,Very disjointed operations.  Each department does not work together and itś evident in how the client experience comes out.  Very lapse when it comes to compliance as well.
bad,The company can be stressful at times but the benefits are great. My coworkers are always helpful and managerment try there very best to provide each associate with whatever they need.
bad,"Long story short= Went in initially for a managerial position. my timing was off, a position was taken had to settle for a relationship manager position which its a glorified sales rep position. Was told that it would work out because I was overqualified and once a managerial position opened I could apply and would be even more qualified due to my time as a relationship manager. "
bad,Never will go back there. Does not value you as a person or associate. They only care about making as much money as possible and not being responsible to their associates
bad,"No I think I’m going to keep it to myself."
bad,"Management, senior management and all those involved with decision making only care about themselves and will do whatever they can to protect their own...."
bad,"The leadership at the site I worked at was very poor."
bad,"To big and sales culture was false and phony, a lot like what has been in the news about Wells Fargo Bank.  Upper management forced and encouraged this."
bad,You feel like just another number or a person filling the seat.  The work was stressful and the management was not sensitive to life situations nor were they empathetic.
bad,"Horrible work place in simi valley ca. The manager is very dumb, does not know anything about the business or helps the customers properly. Do yourself a favor and work for a better bank."
bad,its almost like they look for ways to write you up.... you made the bonus but you missed one bucket by 4 percent thats a write up smh its literally a kool aid culture and they want you to swallow it
bad,"The environment was not defined and close to WallStreet meets Lord of the Flies.  There was no direction.  No customer need focus.  It was repeated that we are to sell fear to prospects.  Before that, I sold neuro imaging to surgeons."
bad,"I was a credit loan officer that was forced to take calls of extreme complexity and I was tied to the stringent call time frames of a customer service associate. I was in positions where i was forced to do an entire credit and underwriting process while the customer was on the phone. At that time, no other bank allowed the consumer to even speak to the underwriter. I worked in the only credit underwriting department for Bank of America in the country. Then they merged with MBNA in an ACTUAL fly by night merger that left 800 plus employees unemployed in a tiny little town with no other jobs of that skill set available within hours of the area. The CEOs literally flew in on a helicopter in the middle of the night to complete the merger. The next day, they brought in a team of people from the unemployment office to conference the entire site regarding their ""options"""
bad,Do not work at Bank of America as a frontline employee. Extremely high sales goals and high turnover. Advancement is near impossible. the pay is terrible.
bad,They were just about money. How could you squeeze another dime out of every customer. Constantly being threatened every week for more referrals or get replaced but someone else.
bad,This was the most stressful employer I've ever worked for especially dealing with irate customer. This is all I have to say in regards to this employer.
bad,Don't have much to report here. The environment is not very healthy. No work life balance. I didn't see much advancement oppornities. Over all not a good experience for me. This may not be true for you. Please experience the work environment yourself.
bad,"If you like the idea of having a sells goal that is nearly non-achievable, and have to sell your soul to get what they want. Then BofA if right for you! Management turns over very fast, people stay 6 months to a year. The production line belt thinking of NEXT on all positions."
bad,"They do not even give you a proper restroom break, the manager was unfair, I would not recomend tihia place for working, who is able to live in miami, with just a part time."
bad,i worked in the customer service area for three years I didnt like the work environment  Hostile rude male chauvinistic I didnt have room for advancement Male dominant no opportunity for women
bad,manager demands a lot and when you meet goals its never enough for them anyways. no overtime and you get coached for going anything over than your suppose to.
bad,Not the best company to work for. Management is not helpful and they are not easy to speak with.  The salary is very competitive but  does not make up for the amount of stress and mistreatment at the company. I would not recommend this company to work for.
bad,"Very sales driven to the point of being unethical. Everything is based on sales no matter what your position at the bank, even tellers have to get so many ""referrals"" to keep out of trouble."
bad,I love customer services you are meeting different people everyday I was doing credit cards it was  relaxing the training teacher  had teach me very will
bad,The work atmosphere was stressful which did not bother me.  In the course of time I was there I went through 6 supervisors as well as numerous department heads.  The daily job included programming credit card machines through various computer applications to the customers specification
bad,"I was on the third floor and it was like working in a ZOO! There was NO  management, as far as keeping the work environment professional.  I have been working for 42 yrs. and never worked in such a place as this, it was a FREE FOR ALL!! Balloons being batted around, balls being bounced, people on the phones would stand around and  holler at each other, laugh uproariously, talking loud about their personal business, I was not on the phones and had a VERY hard time concentrating on my very sensitive position. I would not recommend working in  this place to my worst enemy!"
bad,When I lived in Illinois I applied for a job in Arizona as it was looking for a credit analyst. No where in the phone interview or training did it mention it was a call center and all phones calls were recorded and you would be trained and coached on them. Very mislead as I moved from Illinois at my expense
bad,"Not all the specifics around a job title is disclosed."
bad,I just did not have  great experience at this company for I had to put in a 2 week notice to resign after work there for about a 1 1/2 years. Others may have a different experience but I can't say the same for mines.
bad,They lied to us. They told us we had a year contract. Right before Thanksgiving they called all of us up and told us we no longer had a job. They never told us what was going on and changed things everyday.
bad,I was not happy working for Ban of America. it was demanding with little pay. I would ask my manager to move up and they wouldn't want me to. I was fed up and left to a different company.
bad,"The leadership continues to rely on outside consultant opinion over its employees. Projects are lead by consultants who leave and then there is a knowledge gap. Consultants, even bad ones, are paid more and regarded more than employees"
bad,"I've worked as a UAT coordinator in this company. It doesn't add any technical skills to your resume, but it's a good pay. The management is not the ideal you are looking for, very demanding and micro management"
bad,"There was a lot of discord within this company, and I don't think the set up was very fair for all employees.I would not refer this as a place to work."
bad,Double standard culture. Pressure to sell and bad treatment of employees there was not even one day that one employee or other didn't cry. The culture was understand your customer and be human in dealing with your customer but at the same time abusing their employees over one bad review of a customer and why the employees are not producing and selling unneeded credit cards . Over all a culture of modern slavery.
bad,Management is not ideal and does not care about employees.   there is not any time off.  They want you work plenty of overtime.  They do not value other opinions to make projects better.  Money is wasted on bad projects.  The turnover rate is huge.  They do not keep good people and let experience and knowledge leave constantly.
bad,Merrill Lynch is not a very respectful company.  Management does not try to help the employees but adds more stress to the situation.  This is not a company that you can make a career at.
bad,Management is not at all professional. Co-workers including Team Leads did nothing but gossip and start rumors. The overall environment they create is very taxing on a person emotionally. Also if you are not used to sitting down for 8 hours then this probably isn't the job for you.
bad,"Bank of America was a great company to work for however, for us consultants they promised so many permanent opportunities but they did not come through at the end of the assignment."
bad,Most of all my Bank of America assignments were awful. Management was usually the biggest problem in that they would usually try to micro-manage their employees.
bad,"I had several managers told me not to hire black people because there were too many in the retail banking centers. If employees complained to managers about treatment, they were blackballed from applying to other positions."
bad,its a good company to work for but I just looking for a full time position and a company I can grow with. I have over 10 years of call center experience and I all have almost one year of face to face experience. I am very good with people on the phone an in person.
bad,"Bank of America provides good employment opportunities to their employees.  Also, Bank of America provides financial resources to their customers and the Charlotte community.  This bank also provides donations to United Way, churches and other organizations"
bad,"It all flows downhill, top management's drive to please Wall Street as opposed to their customers and potential customers placed the employees in a bind to meet high goals.  The only ones benefiting from the pressured sales goals were upper management which received huge bonuses verses the employees that produced the record profits received significantly less."
bad,They don't take the time to help you grow within the company. You aren't compensated well enough for what they ask of you. They don't take the time to listen to their employees and bring too much stress to their lives.
bad,I had nothing but stress filled days working for BoA. If I did not hit my sales goal I would be yelled at by my superiors. No training what so ever and good luck dealing with people complaining about long teller lines. Use the atm lol.
bad,You're just a number and I do not agree with that it's hard to get put on part time when need or necessary steer clear the pay is nothing to complain about if you can deal with the anxiety part
bad,They make you sell bank products to every customer constantly hold your job over your head if you don’t make your goals. They allow managers to verbally abuse their employees
bad,Most horrific experience of my life. I was literally traumatized by the machelvallian style of management which was leftover Countrywide. The B of A management was probably much better.
bad,I hated working here.  There is nothing more I can say.  This was the worse time in my life. I honestly contemplated ending everything on a weekly basis.
bad,"Represent Bank of America and our clients when international transactions take place"
bad,Great place to work if you do not mind being talked down too be belittled. Bank Of America is a very political place and will never treat you as a person .
bad,"The company is only about profit.  Does not care about the equality of life for its employees.  The only way to really get ahead in the company is to leave for about 3 months and come back to the company at that time they will pay you a lot more, instead of promoting from inside the department."
bad,"If you want to be known as a number, this is the place for you. It's all about goals and numbers, customer service is out of the window. You only advance by stepping on toes. The front facing employees are lowest on the totem pole, the most expendable. I don't understand this company. How do you lead a team, balance a vault and focus on pushing products on people that don't need it?"
bad,A regular day at the bank includes testing to OCC guidelines and monitor risk controls. Participate in Audit walkthroughs to enable line of business in strict paramaters of the regs and laws.
bad,This is none of your business you should not force people to do this - this is patently unfair and predatory - you have no right to force this info from me.
bad,"bad company to work for they force employees to sell and if not you will get written up, very stressful that's it always has new people there because it stresses you!"
bad,"processing night drop, commercial teller line in drive thru, referrals was the hardest since I saw the same people everyday and they would roll up their windows so they didn't have to hear what product they were making up push that day. When they started to write us up every hour that there was no referral, that is when I quit."
bad,"call centers are the worst. do not go here if you enjoy life they will make that stop. never do this, the people are the worst part, you will loathe everything here"
bad,"the work culture is horrible,  you are here gone tomorrow.  they like to hire and fire regularly to show to share holders they are cutting the expense.  in fact they are losing money this way, as no knowledge is transferred.  new people joining the company have to relearn everything.  they like to pay above average, but it's not worth it as you will be spending time looking for new job.  Employees will not share knowledge as it's for their own job security."
bad,"Benefits were great, but too much horse play with childish employees, too much gossiping on the floor. Mandatory overtime that you could not get away from. When they ran out of work you were let go."
bad,"This job was stressful, and the management refused to take calls when the customer specifically asked to speak to a manager.  Most of the time, a customer would call in and would just ask to speak with management because they knew it was outside of my scope of practice.  Understandable.  My manager would refuse to take all of my calls, which left me looking like an idiot trying to resolve something that I could not discuss.  The job sucked; there was way too much stress; and the workload was absolutely ridiculous.  I quit and found another position because this job caused many health issues due to stress."
bad,"Managers are biased, Southside location offers no opportunities to grow in other proffessions.  Management is not supportive of people who want to grow with the company."
bad,Hired to work as a Project Manager for the Broker Dealer Applications.  Wasn't that busy of a job and wasn't that demanding.  It was a contract position that ended.
bad,"Working in a sales call center. No one gets out of their seat, no laughter or joy in the day to day. You will not make money here. They threaten to fire you constantly."
bad,"typical day at work - stressful"
bad,I would recommend someone to work here. Bank of  America is a great place to work. I would definitely recommend this place for a career. I worked here for a long time.
bad,"Bank of America pays much less than other bankers. their quote is high, and upper management doesn't care about you, So it's always you are on your own"
bad,Worst work environment I've ever been in. Hostile employees and management. If I could give zero stars I would! They care nothing about their employees
bad,"After selling off most of their processing to First Data, BoA proceeded to fire all full time employees and hired in temps to do all work.  There is no future in working for BoA in Louisville"
bad,"My work experience with Bank of America was not the most pleasant one. I would never encourage anyone to work for this financial institution. The culture is horrendous. "
bad,"treated contracted workers like indentured servants. Our group was responsible for bank achieving significant goals, and yet we were deliberately left out of the bank celebrations.  We couldn't even eat the Friday doughnuts."
bad,"They hire higher Management people without any related experience. Manager give training to District manager and district manager don't even know about what type of account bank offer to customers and whoever get hired they fired previous employees to get a new employees with less wages, its all about sales in this bank don't expect to get any customer service. Try it go busy branch and ask u need 12 month statement its urgent they will say we can only print 3 months max rest we have to order just because they don't want any sale leave from the door. its all because of sales pressure that management makes who don't even know what bank offer to the customer."
bad,"The management here was good.  They trained us well and we had a lot of work to do.  I liked the job, but it was only temporary and when it was time to go, it was time to go."
bad,Working here was bad the manger does not care about there employees and only cars about them self.The manger was rude to clients and always yelled at them and warned them that we had a arm security grade
bad,"I was hired, and they has just fired half the group. They were laying off people on the floor the entire time I worked there. It was just a matter of time before the group I was in would be dissolved."
bad,"today's view is not about offering Customer Service, but on to the next call.  Big business has gotten away from handling a client with care, but with a sense of urgency! Get your client on the phone and off, that all business THE NUMBER GAME!"
bad,"not a great place to work,it's a stressful work place and managers do not make it any better.also pay wasn't up to par and managers indulged in having favorites and gossip."
bad,"I worked there for 10 years and their always seemed to be an issue with the pay, lack of diversity and fair treatment. The culture did not support inclusion."
bad,BofA was the worst job I have ever had in my life. People would do anything to get ahead and get you behind. horrible managment. pitted everyone against each other.
bad,Poor management
bad,This place is an absolute nightmare. They don't care about their employees at all. You are under a microscope and you have to upsell people mortgages and credit cards or they will find a reason to fire you.
bad,"Poor management, lack of concern about associates health and well-being.  Compensation does not keep pace with industry.  Continual layoffs of talented people are perplexing."
bad,i think the managers there are awful they dont help out what so ever and all they care about   are their numbers.. their benefits are not that great either
bad,"Very disappointed with this position, no training, no flexibility with work hours.  Horrible management, favoritism towards certain employees.  I do not recommend."
bad,They were extremely rude to me after my father passed away so I left the company. I would  never work for or bank with Bank of America ever again. Management was extremly compassionless.
bad,Countrywide cut corners on loan quality and was largely responsible for the recent mortgage crisis. The management was very hard on the operations staff. I was not happy working there. It was like being a cog in a giant machine.
bad,will never work for Bank Of American ever again! Employees are treated very unfair. The Management system that they are using is one of the worse if not the worse.
bad,"Too much of cost cutting. Only management knows where is the team going, everyone else thinks they are moving in circles. Work hours are beyond normal."
bad,I choose not to respond cooperatively with requests to provide personal evaluations or opinions of a prior employer with an employment website. This is my review response.
bad,"Any help from management has to be directed to upper management.  Training is too long,  and taught without access to necessary systems and is also very long and ineffective. Upright and uncomfortable. The pay isn't worth the stress."
bad,"Management treated our group so poorly by substantially increasing our goals each year, reducing our overall pay each year, and telling us that we were lucky to have a job.  We were not allowed to voice any type of constructive criticism or we were ostracized."
bad,This company does not do background checks or drug testing. The building was filthy with bed bugs. Management is clueless and will not assist even at customers request
bad,I started working for Bank of America due to a merger. I was a fully vested part time employee with full benefits at that the time of the merger. I lost my job along with a lot of others within the two years of the merger.
bad,over all  experience was to learn financials and budgeting. very stressful environment to work in. Upper management are never on the same page and poor communication from supervisors
bad,I would not recommend this office to anyone. There is no support there for new entrants to the office. To cold and unfriendly and not a sharing of idea there
bad,"*A typical day would be taking back to back phone calls trying to assist small business clients with there accounts and trying to cross sell more items to them at the same time."
bad,"no diversity.  very cutthroat.  managers are out for themselves.   no guidance.  nepotism. lack of skill, training and motivation.  not a fun environment"
bad,Bank of America was a wonderful company to work for when I first started as a Senior Teller.  The company then decided to change the name of certain positions so they could pay less. Teller operations specialist was actually the Assistant manager position. The company is a micro-managing nightmare company. I would never tell anyone to apply there.  Worst job experience of my life.
bad,"Under trained management.  Bank of America has about ten thousand Assistance Vice Presidents, most of which arent qualified to run the fry station at McDonalds and I know because I was an AVP. I was told that BAC would be a great place to work if I didn't have a lot of bills, which was true for awhile; however,  for those associates that sincerely care about delivering customer service, they are up against seasoned managers whom are unwilling to change thier old ways of delivering sub par customer service."
bad,"There are way to many VP's you have to answer too.  You were to do mortgages and then after a client spent an hour or so with you they wanted you to refer them back to the Relationship Mangers to sell them a credit card or open an account which in the mortgage world is a big no no.  You had to answer to your boss, the site manager, the VP of marketing for the region etc."
bad,Their management is horrible. They focus so much on sales that they forgotten about their employees. Very stressful job and I plan to NEVER go back there.
bad,"Not really a meritocracy as their core values dictate.  "
bad,"If you like to be verbally abused, denied breaks and lunches, called in to work 3 hours but forced to work 8 hours without lunches or breaks, if you enjoy being called dumb and given dirty looks by your boss... if you enjoy having your vacation days scheduled and approved for 4 months out then having them make you take a vacation with a 12 hour notice forcing you to cancel your real one, if  you enjoy HR calling the branch to tell them you called HR asking to help to make sure you are getting your breaks and lunches which in turn makes your bosses retaliate... then by all means work here."
bad,Company was more for the pocket than for the customers. Management expected unrealistic expectations. Bank America is not a company that allowed you to move up or get hired on directly
bad,Bank of America has very poor management and is inundated with bureaucratic policies that create non-productive associates.  Compensation is stagnate and unless you live in the north there is no opportunity for advancement.
bad,"Working in GBAM in Compliance was not a great experience. I didn't enjoy working in Gateway (Charlotte, NC) and the work wasn't the best. The only positive was, I enjoyed my coworkers."
bad,Loved working here at first and then it went downhill fast. Managers started hurting their friends. They laid off good employees and managers and bright in New hours of the street who made more per hour and we had to be the ones to train them.
bad,"The company has one agenda and that's to take care of themselves. They inform all the managers when there are layoffs and the employees on the floor are given two weeks notice, then they put a hiring freeze on the department so that you cant get another job within the company."
bad,"Bank of America is one of the best companies in this area to work for. They have a great culture, excellent benefits and a strong industry. The only thing that I have noticed is that they recycle their best talent out to hire new people and pay less."
bad,I was often working through my breaks and not compensated.. My manger was grossly underquaqified for the job and the Pay was terrible.. It was hard to get promoted if you were a female of color.
bad,Working for Countrywide was great - when Bank of America came in they wrecked everything.  All new mgmt and new culture - very bland and impersonal with employees and clients.
bad,"Horrible place to work, mandatory weekends, long hours, terrible pay. Incompetent managers that will pull you off of your assigned job to go do something else for half the day, & then turn around & ask you why you didn't hit the metrics for the actual job you were hired to do. Very stressful."
bad,I felt that it was a sweat shop with low ability for advancement and low pay. I would not recommend people to work there just for those reasons also I don't feel they are honest
bad,"management is awful, lack of leadership and training is not quite relevance. No advancement, unless you love kissing butt and losing your dignity. Worst of all the banks."
bad,Bank of America created production sites that only cared about the production and hardly gave attention to the employees. Management did not support the employees.
bad,"As a teller they will tell you that you have the opportunity to advance, however this is not true.  If you start in the Bank you will stay in the bank.  There is little opportunity for lateral moves, and you have to outsell on a regular basis to even be considered or allowed to advance."
bad,"Not the best place to try and advance your career here, the people will suck you dry as so will the job. most of the time you will just want to leave as soon as possible"
bad,"Answering client calls, taking payments, scheduling payments, client inquiries, legal guidelines, quality control, client information, wealth management specialist"
bad,"Unless things have changed in the past 15 years, this company disregards what you KNOW but advances you on WHO you know. If you have energy and strength to fight your way to the top, this is place!"
bad,"Don't work there very unforgiving , stressful pressure to complete tasks with no support , nothing is forgotten  past mistakes never truly forgiven , reps are very judge mental"
bad,I do not like the management. My coworker are nice but mostly we don't like to have to ask customer to open so many checking accounts or saving accounts
bad,it was long ago. for me the experience was not pleasant however it seems different when i go in to conduct business. i can not give a fair assessment  at this point in time. i would hate to deter someone from a great opportunity.
bad,"Took a new role that I was absolutely miserable with. Asked to be transferred after four months and was told I have to wait a year. Company does not care about you or your career. They will hang you out to dry without a second thought. When I resigned, no exit interview was requested. I cannot recommend working here unless you absolutely have to. I gave 12 years and have nothing to show for it."
bad,"I was laid off from Bank of America Mortgage.  It was a good company to work for, but they moved out of my state and left around 1000 people without jobs."
bad,Very stressful work environment. you are given very tight dead lines with little time to complete the job. need to work extra hours and in weekend also to complete job.
bad,Bad culture. No collaborative efforts. Mentality was each person was out to get you and blame you for when things went wrong. Your manager never had your back or stood up for you.
bad,"You are punished for using your sick time and they do not take doctor's notes.  It is like pulling teeth to be able to schedule and take your vacation.  One department I worked in had mandatory overtime and we were sometimes there until 1am with threats if we needed to leave. Horrible management, horrible HR."
bad,Do not start your financial services career here. You'll only work for a year or two until they fire you and keep the clients you've brought over. A horrible place to work.
bad,"i have worked here for one year and there has been no consistency in the work. When i was hired it was for a sales position, but now it is morphed into a customer service role"
bad,"no review"
bad,"While working at bank of America I have been through 3 managers within a 1 year period, and each time has been very poor selections. Market Manager is also not very qualified and has little knowledge of company policies. I have had the worst career experience the year I was there. They push you to forcefully sale a product to the client that doesn't even want it or said no in the first place. I absolutely do not recommend working there to anyone who wants a ""Real Career."""
bad,"low pay in comparison to industry standard."
bad,"Purchased from Countrywide, where the culture was wonderful, pay outstanding and everyone was respected.  B of A purchased it and it fell apart so quickly that if you made over 15 an hour you were let go.  B of A brought in a lot of their people who worked for the cheap and if you were a key employee over 40K a year, you were let go."
bad,"Not really a temp to hire job, the turn over rate was terrible and the overtime was mandatory and did not pay well. You had no benefits, no PTO, and their managers could use some lessons in manors!"
bad,"Very stressful, high turn-over, poor management, no room for advancement."
bad,"Bank of America occupied my company Healthlogic Systems and failed to run because of unexperience management. Actually banks line of business is different then Healthlogic Systems line of business. As a result, they closed Healthlogic Systems and laid of  all employees with very bad attitude which is not acceptable."
bad,"High pressure sales goals mixed with cutthroat, draconian  management style and overall culture. Long hours and little pay. Not an investment bank anymore, just sweatshop for mutual funds."
bad,worse place to work for. will never go back to bofa. i had nightmares and did not want to go to work. Never had a manager while employed at bank of america
bad,"Working here is so stressful and lack of customer service and urgency to deal with issues on the work place ."
bad,I will never work for this company again. Financial predators. Objective was to technically get sales goals regardless of clients situation. Fees were killing clients.
bad,This job gave me advancement in banking . I've always been interested in working for such a large company such as bank of america but the structure and environment was not put together. I was hired for a position that no longer exist that position was available for about 9 months
bad,This call center no longer exists. They only have retail operations at this point. They closed these doors for a reason. They monitor everything including potty breaks
bad,"I was hired as a contractor for a 12 month contract. Having complied with all policies of the company and producing my work on time and to the full satisfaction of the product owners the contract was terminated without notice after 6 months."
bad,"Very professional environment and lots of company outings. Very big on building company morale, however, you will be micromanaged so if you like that kind of environment this job is for you"
bad,they are not ethical.  they do not communicate well.  advancement opportunities are limited.  salary is not reasonable for the amount of risk you take.
bad,"Sales, Sales and more sales. This company culture is based on sales and not financial security. The company really to not reward you on customer service but you are awarded for how much you sale."
bad,"Bait and switch job where hired as an entry level position and paid as such but assigned as a manager/lead. Upper management is awful and will make life miserable if you want or ask for job growth opportunities. Workplace culture is all work, no fun, and use of micromanagement. Turnover rate extremely high."
bad,Very stressful work place with high production demands.  Not much job stability.  We didn't know our days off or hours per week until the week of; Schedule comes out the same week.
bad,"place sucked to work for"
bad,"the hours are extremely long when there's enough personel to make a better schedule, the management team does not care whether you go to lunch afte r 4-5 or not sometime lunch is taken after been working 7 hours a day and is only 30 minutes lunches."
bad,They have great products to offer but they don't care about their employees.  You are basically just a number.  Good Benefits but very stressful and micro-managed.
bad,Too slow to embrace change. Legacy people with legacy mindset are huge impediments to progress and growth. Talent management is poor and culture is superficially good but deep-rooted bureaucracy still exists unfortunately.
bad,I chose not to comment on my previous job.  They can do better as far as pay. Modern day slavery.  Also they can do better in a lot of areas.  he rich will stay rich while the poor will be poor.
bad,As a business teller I was responsible for completing small business transactions and also held accountable for other customers extending their business with the bank or establishing new ones (i.e. open accounts!). They allowed only 30 min for lunch and 2 15 min breaks which were usually bypassed because you felt the need and urgency to attain all customers in a fast paced busy city area. A very manipulative company to work for.
bad,This was a very stressful company to work for management can be good depending on who you work for. Many challenges in the process to be successful and advance
bad,Just was a temporary job they usually do every year to help with taxes. Even though it is temporary they expect you to treat it as if its a permanent job.
bad,typical day of non stop inbound calls from extremely irate and frustrated card holders who's card were denied due to suspicion of fraud.  overall training for the position is unacceptable.
bad,Not a great place to work. There's absolutely no employment security at BOA. A new manager can decide he or she wants to layoff people . not a recommended place to work.
bad,"Productive & Fun"
bad,"Dealing with the clients was the best part, but dealing with the branch manager was the nightmare."
bad,"contact customers whose card account payment was past due, work with the customer to set up  payment(s) to bring or keep the account current."
bad,"They layoff to many good employees and keep the riff raff. There is favoritism Managers don't know how to manage people "
bad,"Bank of America's Consumer Division in New England is a disaster. You're unable to build a relationship with management, I have had 4 Managers in under two years. If you're a relationship manager, you're on your own and have to fend for yourself. The culture is not conducive to any of the companies core values. My friends and family warned me before I joined the bank abut what I was getting into. It was absurd to think that a Bank that continuously extorts its customers for millions would treat its employees better."
bad,typical bank a lot of chiefs and not enough Indians.  to many higher ups in the company and there doesn't seem to be basic employees.  tho there is a lot of opportunity to grow if you survive lay offs
bad,"I did not have a good experience within the particular business support call center that I worked at. The call center environment did not feel productive, rather, there was contention and animosity between co workers and some managers; the management team, however, did not address key issues within the environment, further exasperating the tension."
bad,I did not enjoy working at then Lasalle Bank but it was a pay check.  Bank of America has taken over and they are not an employee friendly place.  The company in my opinion is very cut throat.
bad,This job is order taking at its finest. 200-300 calls daily on a dialer system. You cant get up or break and you must upsell every customer because BIG BROTHER is watching and recording your conversation
bad,no one knows how to get anything done. Departments refuse to cooperate with each other. No job security no matter how much work you do for them. it was the most stressful job I have ever had.
bad,Horrible stressful place to work filled with racism. Not a moment to breathe in between called. Very short staffed. Disparity of treatment. I recommend no one to work there. They use you up and split you out when they are done. The managers need personality training and we'll add people still classes. They are not approachable or willing to help you advance.
bad,I would give my two front teeth to have never left my previous firm to go to the God Forsaken Place.  I I would never ever ever work for this firm!!  It was the worst management I have ever witnessed.
bad,working for this company was cut throat. everybody was looking to get over on everybody. dealing with bad attitude. management have their favorites. very bad
bad,I would not recommend working for BAC mortgage as the line of business is not fully supported by the bank.  The management is extremely lacking in capability and skills.  This leads to an environment wherein it is almost impossible to get business done in a manner respectful of the customer.
bad,"Poor manager, unethical practices, Management was lazy.  I wouldn't bank here if my life depended on it.  Not enough staff, little to no training.  Terrible experience."
bad,This place does not care about anyone. The executives might think they are doing well but they don't care about them either. This company is all about the board members only. The customers do not matter
bad,I do not recommend BOA to anyone!  Their business model and how they handle their customers are awful.  They micro manage their employees and the managers our unprofessional and inexperienced.
bad,"contractor job, job culture not the best, never was included in any of the events they had because we were ""contractors"""
bad,While working for this company. The management team were disrespectful to the staff. The breaks were way to short and the environment was completely miserable.
bad,"As one of the largest banks and being international. It is sad that Bank of America delegated its highly profitable jobs to a third party company whom clearly did not have the resources, training, or labor to complete the tasks at hand."
bad,"Horrible culture where they don't care about anybody."
bad,"Enjoyed working with the team in the city, but culture was greatly affected by market collapse."
bad,Working at Bank of America they only cared about one thing...getting sales and retaining customers.  We would have to push products on customers knowing that they may not necessarily need them.  We always had to hit our goals and there was no way we would compete.
bad,"Expected to cross sell too many products, management did not know who you were.  Not enough workers to match the expectations.  Shut down branches with no warning"
bad,"The company is changing fast along with technology, and job titles and responsibilities and expectations change right along with that. I found myself always wondering if I would have a job the next day, always worrying about supporting my family, and whether or not I would meet my numbers in order to keep my job."
bad,Company does not appreciate employees. Bonus taken away from employees. Management is not fair and very fake. I'm very glad to be away from this company. No advancement regardless if you're a top performer.
bad,"This is a horrible place to work for.  They treat their employees badly.  There was an associate with cancer and they made it so difficult for her work and do chemo treatments that it was cruel.  The pay is decent and the insurance benefits are great, but the staff is treated as numbers instead of people."
bad,"Don't Do It. Company absolutely Horrible to work for and each department blames another for problems, totally horrible to explain that to frustrated Customers. Management does not care and see you as just a tool that they can throw you away when they loose interest."
bad,other banks pay wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more.  You don't advance often if ever.  Every job is an on the phone job. Managers have so many HR issues and violations.
bad,Management wouldn't be on your case everyday if you didn't meet quotas. You had to sale to every customer you spoke to. Customer service issues had to be resolved.
bad,Bank of America Home Loans is an outstanding work environment experiences I have had the pleasure of in my career. I highly recommend Bank of America as the leader in Financial industry. Thank You!
bad,"Company is run by people who have never been in a position to interface their own consumers. If they have been in that position now they are sheep that are herded by the others. "
bad,"Managers in procedure management play favorites. If you don't share your personal life and play the game, they freeze you out. No promotion, paltry raises, minimum $2000 annual bonus. Try to move to another area in the second largest bank in the world and they shut you down."
bad,"Not a safe place to work for. Job work / Life balance ; Compensation 0; Job Security terrible; the management needs more improvement; ...etc. "
bad,"Pay was poor. Management team were not supportive. Goals were unrealistic, staffing was always short, unnecessary stress, low employee morale. No support from upper management"
bad,"Started out great but quickly became strictly about sales and nothing else. High pressure work place with Wells Fargo type of pressure. Customer needs not stressed only sell, sell, sell. Job was threatened on a daily basis."
bad,Difficult environment.  Hard to make progress.  Learned very little except that management and promotions happen based on who you know not what you know.  Do not recommend.
bad,Difficult environment. Poor work life balance.  constantly reinventing the wheel.  Management is incompetent.  Promotions happen based on who you know not what you know.
bad,"Senior management is garbage, recruiters are garbage, hiring managers are garbage, front-line managers are garbage, just a lame company to work for. Go work for another company. Managers and everyone say to just get an entry level job and stay with it for a year and then post out. Well, when you apply for other jobs and try to contact the recruiter, the recruiter will never answer you. If you do get a response back its probably cause you had to email their manager. If you do get an interview and you don't get the job and you ask for feedback from that manager. You wont get a response. They pay by job bands so say you start off as a job band 8 and want a job band 5 job that you are more than qualified for, and after you've been in the entry level job for more than a year, you wont get it because they have some stupid HR rule that says you cant get that big of an increase in your pay. Never ever heard of that in my life. Stay far away from Bank of America."
bad,"When I was working there. was a teller day she uses plenty of bank time to do her personal activities, buy she was a good friend of the supervisor, and both was looking magazines or surfing the internet, instead doing their jobs."
bad,"Contracting with this customer is very risk, they do not value their contractors. Managers will cut your contract when you may become a threat of out working them"
bad,This company is just like any other bank. The overall objective is to gain profits at any expense. If they like you then you may have a chance at advancement.
bad,"*Cross balanced in all products graded poorly by mgt."
bad,They do not value the employees that are loyal.  Overtime is expected without making you feel that the work you are doing matters.  You will change managers at least every 3-6 months.
bad,If you like being screamed at from people that have not paid the home loans in 2 years and are upset that they are being foreclosed on. Then that job is for you.
bad,"60% of ranking is based on others option, even when their option is based on a company policy and nothing to do with you.  Request for time off is only based on what the company needs not that a once in a lifetime event in one personal life is taken into the decision."
bad,"The workplace culture was lacking in a number of areas. Workplace ""Cliques"" operated openly. Minimal to no flexibility available. Instead of pay-raises, wages were frozen and bonuses revoked."
bad,"Managment is Worst and especially STS group. The resource managers and Functional managers doesn't have mutual understanding. The group that I previously worked for is no longer there. In my experience when working for Bank of America, your just a number. There is no job security, the pay is awful, and you may get the rug pulled out from under you."
bad,"run... there are better options out there.  Management moves up who they like versus those, who are competent, seasoned and hungry.  If you do have to accept work here, have a side job... something that you like doing, to counter working a meaningless dead-end job."
bad,"Constant  complaints from customers, yet the company will do nothing to modify.  Simply add new steps to the process to make it even longer.  The employees are miserable.  Home Equity dept in California acquired by Accenture."
bad,Bank of america has good benefits but treat their employees as a number and not people. Bank Of America is a company filled with greed and is only out to make their number look good and employees uncomfortable.
bad,Bank of america constantly pushes metrics on you in a negative way.  They have many company policies that encourage refusal of refunds and putting the company over that of the client.
bad,"You are only as good as the products you shove down the depositors throats,  Chastised for not being aggressive enough in offering products to customers on every call.  It was all about the money you could make for them."
bad,The culture is great for the people who have been there for 20 years but is not good for new people trying to start their careers off. No one to look towards for help.
bad,"Bank of America looks at employees as a number and not as a person in my opinion.  I was fortunate to have a job during this period of time, but as soon as the marked picked up, I left the organazation."
bad,"No matter how well you perform you are constantly told you can do better."
bad,"Since Bank of America is switching from customer service to atm's taking care of 90% of customer needs, people are getting very angry. If you want to be a teller, get ready for a lot of hours, little to no breaks, no back up or support, poor managerial skills. If you want to be a PB, get ready for such pressure on you to preform you will quit within the first year from massive anxiety. This place is a joke to work for."
bad,working at sykes was like working in mountains with tons of layers on trying to stay warm. They change up staff so bad that half of them ends up back on the call floor or out the door.
bad,I worked for Bank of America for almost six years. The company is constantly laying off their best staff and hiring incompetent people for positions of power. They do not provide training for manager which is a disaster for employees. When you raise your concerns about your job to management they will find any reason and make up fake policies in order to fire you. They lie and manipulate you and make you feel like your best is not good enough. You could be at the top of your department and never receive acknowledgement. If you value your dignity you would not work here.
bad,Hardest part of the job is inter-company communication. Too many layers and not a lot of answers. Too many rules when interacting with the retail banking division. Seriously flawed and needs a major overhaul.
bad,Unfortunately it's too big of a company to care about the good people at the bottom. There are too many managers trying to please people above them rather than caring about the ones below them.
bad,"if u dont know spanish dont apply. you will literally lose the job to someone who knows spanish, all the other skills u acqiure are irrelevant! Oh they only promote spanish people too. if ur not spanish u wont be growing with the company, they'll use u til they get a permanent spanish speaking fill in."
bad,"management has an agenda, and listening to the front line management is something that is rarely done. This was the case within my division. They will not allow for holiday time off it their demands are not met."
bad,"Worst company to work for! They lie about what goes on and switch your positions without even giving a 2 week notice, they also do not work with your schedule esp if you have kids."
bad,Every market just make their own rules and goals just keep increasing. Everyday you walk into the bank with a fear environment about if you still have a job or not.In order to advance is all about who you know and not how you really work. And you see people let go for ridiculous excuses while others that have been doing a lot of bad thing still have a job. In other words just a complete and absolute waste of the last few years of my live.
bad,The managers at the company did not know how to coach their employees and the schedules were not good. I would not recommend this department to anyone.
bad,Not a bad place to work.but just like every place no one want to pay employees enough money 12 and 13 dollars hr is no where enough money to live off of and the CEO get billions take a little more pride in your employees pay the a decent wage there will be a lot less turnover and more dedicated employee because they will feel appreciate
bad,Poor compensation combined with poor management.  Did not learn much since there was little or no cooperation between colleagues.  The hardest part of the job was getting to the job.
bad,"This company does not care about families, or their employees and customers. They think everyone is a tick mark. They will fire you for the littlest thing no matter how good you are."
bad,my overall experience would be very bad. I was new to the banking industry when i accepted the position. i applied so that i could learn a new skill start a new career and the banking industry seemed a good fit. the atmosphere was great but the training and support from the management was my issue. i had to learn the banking system on my own or from just plain failing then being corrected.you can not expect perfect scores if the training is inadequate.
bad,"Call Center position, you cant leave you desk. Bad training, and the training doesn't help you with your job. So when you go out into your position, your really not ready for the position."
bad,"Not the best environment. Stressful environment, training isn't hands on which makes it difficult to learn. Hard getting help when you don't get paid enough to deal with upset customers and to be in a stressful work environment."
bad,This company does not have a sense of loyalty to the employees. They do not have a good sense of work life balance. Once they have learned this concept then it will provide them with a better employee engagement formula for success.
bad,When I first start I love working for this company.. I have relocated with this company a few times.. With my last position I was ready for a new change and disliked my job with the company..
bad,"Management has no concept of leadership, they are an abusive passive aggressive organization. Zero care for employee well being."
bad,annonymous it can be a challenging company.  management is not consistent with task. it is never enough
bad,"wasn't a great bank to work for, was very happy for the first few years of working with the bank, but as management changed the work life balance become very bed and all the management were very much under trained at the time. after I life bank of america mostly everyone I worked with left the bank."
bad,"not a friendly environment depending on your manager You never know if you are doing something wrong until you get yelled at for it weeks later. high turn over rate and understaffed. hold times for each department rang from 5-45 min everyday plus the customer service is your incentive if you did a perfect job but the customer was on home for 45 min u fail the call no incentive for the month "
bad,"Bank of America, I do not need to say much more, big company knows everything.  Bank of America is not interested in hearing any feedback from employees."
bad,"People are extremely rude, and they kept on running their mouth to bad mouthing people to cause hostile work environment even management and upper management staffs are doing the same things."
bad,"I have worked for a number of years at Merrill Lynch which was taken over by Bank of America. During my tenure before Bank of America, working in Operations felt as if you contributed something and you were treated with respect but once I moved into IT, I felt that respect was taken away and it only became worse after being taken over by Bank of America. My transition removed any hope of higher compensation which I thought was strange since I always thought that you would make more money. I was told by the hiring manager that it would be a lateral move and even though I left my previous position with a far exceeds rating, that would not transfer into anything when it should, you work hard, put in the time, when it comes to rewards it should amount to something but unfortunately, that was not so, my bonus did not factor in my work ethics. Right away, I should have realized what was in store for me at the ""Global Service Desk."" On a daily basis we would we would take between 60 and 80 calls with 1 morning and 1 afternoon breaks, if you missed your break, you lose it. There was no room for advancement here, it was definitely a brick wall, where any motivation was often removed and replaced by criticism and nepotism. There was the chosen few that was always taken care of and pushed into secured positions. Some of these were warranted but if you looked around, there were some that had no idea how and what they were doing in the positions they were given, while there were talent that was just willfully neglected to be given a chance to shine. The ones that were given the opportunity"
bad,A diverse environment with exceptional teammates.  It is a great place to build your career allowing multiple opportunities for advancement.
bad,I worked for them via Sitel so i dont have much to say.  I can tell you about Sitel.  I just took care of their customers.  The task that BOA ask of us were not hard at all.
bad,If you want to be successful at Merrill do not report issues and learn how to be heartless to clients. Just answer phone calls and move on as fast as possible. The Benefits contact center has the worst leadership on the street.
bad,"My co-workers that were grouped on one team helped each other through a group chat where we would exchange processes, procedures and how to handle different customer issues/requests that would come up."
bad,Stressful place to work. Expect detrimental health issues after working there. They use people up and then toss them aside like yesterdays garbage.
bad,"Advise Customers, Attorneys and MA Attorney General Representatives with Loan Modification Programs and Progress"
bad,Bank of America is not the choice for individuals with experience from other Companies. Accomplishments made at other institutions regardless if applicable or not are not recognized at Bank of America.
bad,Bank tellers should just process withdrawals and deposits for customers. Banking has become the new retail market. They write you up for not maintaining quotas. They make you volunteer your time for charity or you get written up for insubordination for not going.
bad,Management was terrible.  The systems were broken at best.  You could only process an average of 6-10 loans a month here because their processes and systems were so terrible.  Other places you could average about 25 loans per month. I felt threatened everyday by either the customers or the management.  Not a good experience.
bad,"The two Bank of America's in my city were sold to a local bank. The customers and accounts were traded like cattle and treated terribly by Bank of America and the bank that took over the accounts. Big bank mentality. Bank of America doesn't want anything to do with anyone that makes less than 100,000 a year. Anything below that makes you worthless to them. Knowingly charges overdraft fees on accounts that are less than a dollar in the hole. Knowingly lies to it's customers about the true state of it's financial affairs. Hands down worst bank in the country"
bad,"Lack of training,  and when you ask questions they act as if your bothering them. They count every minute your away from your desk, including bathroom. 1 minute is late in any circumstance. I would never expect this from BOA.  More than half the employees have taken leave. And the other half have just left. All management cares about is making bonus, and could care less about their employees."
bad,"I work with this company for almost a year, the worst place to work, the training is not that good always been judged."
bad,Work and personal have no boundary.Every associate knows your business.Unprofessional and Unorganized. Just goes with the flow of things
bad,"Low pay, high stress, management sucks, they promote poeple that do not have real management experience or skills. They keep you tied up in long unnecessary meetings while still keeping an unrealistic expectation of managing a large number of litigated cases. Most of which fall through the cracks."
bad,There is nothing positive that I could share about this company. I am not able to move past this process without adding additional information. There was no support from management and my co- workers were great to me! The only thing I miss is seeing them everyday at work. Hardest part was watching co-workers walked out every day. Nothing much to enjoy.
bad,The branch started to busy as the referrals grew and it more difficult to grow relationships. Great company with even greater personalities .
bad,They don't care about  their employee's. They tell you that there is room for growth in the company but it is not. You will not get paid what you deserve. Nothing is consistent it's always changing and they will find a way not to pay you or give you a raise. Job work/life Balance is horrible. You won't have one they don't understand that people have families.
bad,Learned a lot in Bank of America. Worked in a very good environment. Team work and co-operative to each other.Introduced my friend to open an account in Bank of America.
bad,"By far the worst company ever to work for.  You are just a number, they don't care about you or your career for advacement, just the bottom line.  Burn them and turn them.  Would not recommend this company to work for to anyone."
bad,"Call center - Office bullying is typical of how management treats employees. Constant threats of termination if all stats are not met and are monitored daily. The main focus is not the customer but sales. There is discrimination of race and age. Year end performance review is set up to where only a small percentage does get increase. favoritism is constant. Management is not there to help you but to make sure all stats are met to increase their own bonus. Not a good work environment due to high stress and no tolerance, no rewards, no appreciation. Not provided the tools needed to do the job you're expected to do. Very abusive atmosphere. Corporation does not live by its own core values."
bad,"all they care is about customer with money. They treat employee like is another asset to the company, you better produce or you be fired. Forget about calling sick. they will write you up for it, Stay away from this company is not worth it."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of being harassed every morning as I clocked in at 7 am. Management would tell my co-workers and I that we need to hurry and get to my seat to get to work. As I worked at my work station, team leaders would frequently gather on the floor and have gossiping sessions about other co-workers. At times, even the floor manager would gossip with her employees about other employees. From time to time the team leaders would try and stir up drama between co-workers for their entertainment. Management blames other employees for errors. No one wants to do their job in management. After completing my 10 hour shift I would get off at 5:30 pm. I was always glad for the end of the work day to come. I would leave the negativity at the door and when it was time to go back to work I dreaded it."
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for. They don't care about their employees, and they don't care about their customers. The management only cares about themselves and doesn't care screwing everyone else over. They give you way more work than necessary and they don't think twice about it. I dread going to work every day and am desperately looking for another job."
bad,Great place to work but management gets very personal which in turn affects work ethics and cost innocent people their jobs.
bad,"Hostile work environment,  Worst company to work for , abusive non ADA compliant, under staff, poor training, management is driven to exploit workers"
bad,"Woking at this company is plesant. Works well with co-workers, easy to get along with. Responsibilities are easy to learn."
bad,I am not very happy with my current position I am a contractor that doesn't get any paid time off or any time off at that matter.  I am under contract for 1 year part time no benefits and work every major holiday.  I took this job because I was  laid off from Chase for close to a year.
bad,The worst year of my life. Hired from another bank and given absolutely no training for my new job at all. When bringing this up at a meeting with DM was told it was my fault and I should have done it on my own AT HOME! New manager transferred in and had severe problems not screaming four letter words at emplyees at end of day. Fidelity HR did absolutely nothing for us.
bad,"a typical day at work is receiving inbound and making some outbound collection calls related to personal and business credit cards. i actually like/d doing that and speaking with people and helping them get back on track with their credit card payments. "
bad,this is a great job and was nice to all employees . the building was nice and they had great benefits. we had a lot of files that we had to store and scan in daily.
bad,"Metrics are not well thought through or business savvy. When your manager cannot do your job when you are gone, they are worthless."
bad,They have such a high turn over rate due to lack of compassion for employee's.  They are always under staffed.  Horrible ethics!
bad,This company has awful communication at all levels and no one is ever on the same page at  one point. Everyone I worked with is in agony and looking to leave.
bad,"Bank of America might be a good place to work, but the one in Federal Rd is not, at least it wan't when I was there back in 2004."
bad,The company have great benefits for single individuals and associates with families. My department have flexible work schedules.
bad,"Processing limited to use of title companies in the east coast,  title prints taking 2-3 days or longer, health benefits were scaled back and the use sub contracting company to verify employment.  Internal departments were delegated to obtain subordination/condo request to which took a long time to process.  Co-workers were pleasant to work with. The hardest part was keeping up with all the reports and inexperienced loan officers.  Most enjoyable part of my job was closing loans for the most challenging borrowers."
bad,"In my department there were no opportunities for growth and very little chance for a raise, raises in income and position were based on favoritism"
bad,"Establishing, retaining and deepening relationships meeting clients financial needs though conversations to archive credit card, checking, savings, IRA, small business quarterly sales goals."
bad,"the management has no idea of how to work with people...the systems used are archaic. They do not promote from within, and never even bother to offer employees credit cards."
bad,"Don't work for this company ."
bad,"I do not enjoy my job it makes me hate life honestly"
bad,"Review daily volume of emails & faxes coming from customers requesting for draw from their lines of credit, Loan Officers and lawyers. Verifies signature on each draw request before processing. Review all loan files for completeness.  Set up all ACH for monthly draw. Review all  legal documents received.  Update any changes on ACH and personal information on line. Assisted call center on their incoming calls as needed. I enjoy my immediate co-workers though I noticed that other departments are not taking some calls. t. Majority of calls are being forwarded to our department. Our major work load are behind because we end up spending 80% of our time on the phone. No job stability. Employees get terminated for simple mistake. There are also employee favoritism."
bad,This job was ok. There isn't much to say about this. The job had great benefits and I didn't really enjoy the work. The job was just satisfactory.
bad,"Very workaholics {fun} primarily a call center job. a haven for underachievers, a great place to be when I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. Too bad it fell apart and let go huge numbers before the melt down"
bad,No support from management. Not customer Service Oriented. No place for individual growth. Not a diverse place to work.
bad,"Bank of America made there employees comfortable in allowing breaks, coffee and a lunch room.  Managers handled themselves very professional."
bad,No room for advancements. Management does not know how to do their job. Associates are not knowledgeable in their field. This is a job for start up high school students. If you have a degree its a waste of your time they don't pay you what you deserve.
bad,"A typical day at work is having contest against other teams."
bad,"Great place to work, excellent benefits, incentives, flexible, with room for advancement. I consider BOA the best place to work."
bad,In a typical day it was nice to assist customers. when available we laughed and had fun. The crunch time was over bearing. Keeping a smile on my face.
bad,"Reduced FTE yet long lines, closed drive through and not enough associates to take care of customers. Clearly BOA focused in making money by reducing operation cost and not concern about associates at all."
bad,"My view on Bank of america edd program is not that great.  The management was terrible.The job culture as well. I would assist billingual, spanish speakers with their accounts. Their was high a high call volume everyday."
bad,"On a daily basis we use to be like a big family that helps each"
bad,"Company closed doors in Ohio,  nothing now to review.  Big company lacked leadership."
bad,none that I would like to say at this time due to being laid off after 12 years with this company and no opportunity to be moved to another department
bad,"very stressful company"
bad,"make collection calls to homeowners to collect on payments, offer payment options, payment plans, modification hardship assistance."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. it was a ghetto company to work for. management was so dramatic like they were still in high school!..
bad,"Temporary position in a call center for loan modifications.  There were daily goals, work weekends after a 40 hour week ,  lunch & breaks scheduled at the same time for all workers. As a temporary employee there were no benefits or opportunity to become permanent."
bad,good scheduling terrible management overall horrible experience working with this company
bad,Very dishonest company. Very poor management. Management was dishonest.
bad,Systems software is very old. Procedures could be a lot more simple. Not so much unity. Each branch is completely different and sends out different vibes and messages as if owned by different people.
bad,u just have to work hard for what u want and make sure u reach ur goals
bad,The Bank is no longer about Customers.  It will hire and fire at will.
bad,"A typical day at work was hectic, very poor management,there is definitely no job security, very unethical company"
bad,"Bad Work life balance, the management made this up as the day went on. No educational training."
bad,"to much pressure from bosses"
bad,Very poor management team in the Houston Region. Micro managed and all branches are under staffed creating a negative associate experience.
bad,it was a good company they had many different thing to other people
bad,"Never liked BofA I have closed my account with this company as well.  Managements are horrible, do not know how to treat the employees no work ethics."
bad,"Enjoy the work, Nice job & learnt various work & computer programe"
bad,they do not look out for you at all. All they care about is the money.
bad,I wouldnt recommend anybody to work for Bank of America Unless you are serious with your life otherwise run away.
bad,"The most rewarding portion of this position was helping others achieve their objectives.  Otherwise,  I don't have much to say that would be positive."
bad,The call-center environment does not provide work/life balance is extremely stressful.
bad,great benefits but terrible office environment. from what i understand since the site was converted from mortgages to card services it's just really terrible there. i wouldn't work there again.
bad,I enjoy working at bank of amercia. the company is a great place to work at
bad,"Worked as Teller-ii in Vault office. Count cash, maked bundles, and balance sheet."
bad,Bad company to work for. I found out my manager was sleeping with another employee. My manager was married and Bank of america knew this. They never reprimanded this manager and even was as far as to move him to a bigger branch! He was a horrible manager. The only thing he was good at was kissing butt and flirting inappropriately with women clients!
bad,"loved this company "
bad,"Micro managed, mandatory OT, co-workers helpful and willing to teach"
bad,"The multiple duties the job required kept me interest, alert and content when completed duties required to be done.  We had good chemistry with our co-workers that allowed us to work together and as well as independently."
bad,"the bosses here have unique traits:"
bad,You have to be ready to coach and be coached. A place you can defenetly grow!
bad,"after working for them all those years, in the end there was no stable option but to accept the layoff."
bad,I was infact surprised that it was an highly unplanned and uncooperative environment. You would never know when and what things come at you. Unrealistic timeliness and lots of stress. Management has to mature to industry standards.
bad,"I have always liked the people I have worked with.  A day at work,"
bad,"We start our day by having breakfast at the cafeteria. We usually talk about our family and other staff. I learned a lot at Bank of America. I learned how to process fraud and non-fraud claims by utilizing the bank system to determine if customer has chargeback rights. I  also learn how to manage people when I got promoted to a team lead position. Management was great. They always recognize staff members when doing an excellent jobs, by giving them incentives. My co-workers were great too. I had fun and enjoyed working with them. The hardest part in my job when you talk to an irate customer specifically when you have to decline the claim and tell them that they do not have chargeback rights due to insufficient documents.  The most enjoyable part of my job when I make the customer happy for giving good and efficient service."
bad,"Management makes you feel like you’re disposable. Many people haven’t gotten raises in years. The bonus they give are scraps. They have weekly meetings that tell you how well the company and division are doing then tell you to cut back on supplies, travel expenses etc. When review and bonus time come around they tell you what a great asset you are, what a great job you’re doing but there wasn’t a lot in the pot. "
bad,I love working at the company love the pay each week on Friday and the co workers were great. The Management team wanted to be sure that you succeed on the floor.
bad,I appreciate the experience but I need MUCH BETTER!! My department is a place whereby one can learn but there is little room for advancement.
bad,"the work load does not equal the pay, they are very unfair.  claim to be family oriented but not in the least"
bad,Always short staffed and would not give over time. The two people in charge of the department spent more time playing the internet or shopping and not helping out with the work
bad,My day started very busy where I had to do many daily reporting to the manager and to our sales team.  Then thru the day our team members would reach out to me to resolve their needs for their loan files by researching more in depth to find the problem. Always fun with co-workers to come together and work on a problem matter as a team. The most fun was when we would have in Person meetings and the whole team would come over to the office for a meeting/presentation.
bad,"Bank of America is one of the financial firms that has been under constant scrutiny from the Federal Banking Regulatory firms. The merge with Countrywide mortgages left BOA in a very bad place across the board. Clients had misfortunes of departments lacking any processes of housing loan information and when clients would appeal for a modification in their mortgages they would wait some times it could be a year for a final decision. Although policies and procedures are in place to benefit customers and potential customers other departments do not make the inter connection of being under the same team working for one company. The overall sales force driven behind each quarterly campaign is difficult if your in a branch location that has no volume at all. The salaries may not be in the competitive range depending on your requirements. Research everything to find the best outcomes that your striving for whether it's a potential employer, or seeking anything in life."
bad,My job was just to help the beginning stages of the loan process. I worked as a temp. I was the registration department and keyed in all information and made sure paperwork was in proper order.
bad,"I learned how to process FHA, MHA, and conventional loans with on the job training. I managed to obtain my level 1 authority within one year on the job,which mean I can clear all level 1 conditions and final approve my own files. I love hearing the happiness in my customers voice when I am able to help save them money or from losing there home."
bad,worst training I've ever received. Horrible management and no concern for the customer. I would never work for that company again.
bad,"horrible position, horrbile company.  do not let BOA to sell you with their tales of culture and acceptance. they hire like crazy just to have warm bodies!"
bad,Mid level manager are clueless.  Leadership is missing and the employees suffer because of it.
bad,Really a review is not needed for this company. It is odd that a review is required for me to move on with this process. Poor company to work for!!! No further comment
bad,"too much micro-managing, cannot utilize my skills but rather need to follow manager's way even if my way works better for me, having so many logs with redundant data, as well as constant updating of journals and case notes that no one pays attention to anyways. no conversations with management to more effectively and efficiently do the work, constantly having new tasks and more work, but no consideration for proper compensation. witnessing numerous layoffs despite being assured of job security, and actually having the mantra pressed upon to ""do more work with less,"" meaning less salary, less co-workers, and less tools."
bad,I enjoyed the work as a teller but the environment was entirely too negative. Worst management ever!
bad,a typical day required answering the phones constantly one right after another. The hardest part was my inability to move throughout the day.
bad,"Would not recommend working there unless you're in sales, really pushy, grade you on how many referrals you get in one day and get ""coached"" if standards are not met"
bad,"A typical day consisted of call taking, trying to make financial arrangements for customers in financial difficulties,"
bad,"Was a contracted employee. We were expected to provide same job as permanent employee, but there were no perks for what we did. A typical day at work, sign into computer and phone system and hope that you make the CTI for the day. This would be giving great customer service in 3 minutes or less. Co- workers where fantastic. Management didn't want to assist in any situation and if you needed them to take a call, you were advised to put them on old, basically until the caller hung up. The most enjoyable part of the day was going home."
bad,"•	Involved in architectural discussion of the project and injected significant ideas for establishing the base project."
bad,Thkey have the worst trainging program I've ever been a part of. They download you with daily micro managment tasks and it takes away time and your ability to handle daily tasks.
bad,busy day not a competitive pay. Does not balance work life family work every week 6 days a week
bad,"try to stay position, not alot of growth with this company to be seen, it who you know not what you know."
bad,"From day-to-day you don't know what your job is going to be like, and once they do tell you, its wrong because some ""big boss"" can't communicate effectively with his peers or down the streamline. So you spend all day not knowing what your job title is, what you are doing, for what reason you are doing it, and no idea what the outcome is supposed to be. On top of that, management keeps everything ""secret"" to their employees. The culture - well there is none so to speak. The business is comprised of contracts from banks and other vendors, yet they don't offer even decent training, or guidance on effectively using your knowledge to complete projects, so by the end of said contract - the company loses it because of the incompetency of those running the program. It's all contract work, so no room for growth, no benefits, just lies of constantly being told you will go permanent but instead layoffs happen because they can't keep a contract, they loose it to competitors who have a better business mind."
bad,I would never want to work here ever again. Management sucked. The morale sucked. and there were no advancement opportunities available
bad,"Bank of America, does not work with employees on anything. All the managers are verbally rude ugly and hateful. They do not support encourage or support the employees in any way. But I do have to say management have their favorites, So these employees may not get the verbal and emotional abuse from the management staff."
bad,"Loan reviews for conditional and final approval are assigned by team lead and are available upon arrival.  Typically each underwriter is assigned a minimum of 5 tasks. If all tasks are completed prior to the end of the work day Team lead will assign additional tasks. Underwriter is required to finish all work assigned to their inbox by the end of each day. Underwriters work with the loan processing team to complete the tasks and make a decision. All loans are reviewed by an audit department when they are sent for loan documents to be drawn for signing.  "
bad,HSBC is a place where we really enjoy the work that we are doing
bad,Prefer not to comment.  The only comment I can make is my co-workers are very hard working and loyal.
bad,"Sued all the time, don't care about customers, got to be in with higher ups to ever move"
bad,Bank of america does not care at all about their employees. All they want you to do is sell their products
bad,the financial industry is nothing stable. typical work days are managers coming in a screaming and everything trickles down to those under the totem pole
bad,Is a fun place to work because I get to meet so many people.  It bring me so much joy.
bad,"I would not recommend this place for anyone to work, at least in my office.  I wouldn't trust any of those advisors with my own money.  There is discrimination going on, and most of the people working there are no different then used car salesman."
bad,Do not recommend.  Continual harassment and 50% turn over rate
bad,I worked there for 3years.8 months   it is all about your friendship to the VP as to how far you can go with this company. It is a very toxic environment. I am glad to be out of there. .
bad,"I liked Bank of America, It was a nice company with nice people too. There was am work out  room for men and women. The bank also supplied us with sauna to keep us feeling ready to work."
bad,Stressful!!!! I would not recommend anything beyond entry level.
bad,Underpaid and underworked. Bank of America has destroyed the culture of Merrill Lynch and everything it once stood for.
bad,"it was great working with Bank of America, management and team member were very good & i have learnt many thing from this company"
bad,excellent company to work for. Had an excellent training program in place whenever new policy and procedures needed updated.
bad,Production and numbers was what BOA wanted. Unethical company.
bad,"As a mortgage loan officer, I was responsible for generating my business through networking and self-financed marketing.  The management was not supportive and often not available.  For example, in a span of 14 months, I had 5 different managers."
bad,"Busy day at work because of the workload. I have learned to sell products and services to customers and consumers. I developed a close relationship with my customers. The management could have been better. The co-workers were adorable. the hardest part of my job is to satisfy the customers requests. I had to follow my rules and guidelines set by my company. The most enjoyable part of my work was to sell products and services to customers who would benefit from them. Customers would be close to their financial goals, retirement plans, children education, buy a home, a car or save for the future."
bad,"I have been previously advised that if I have nothing good to say, then don't say anything. Thus my review is ""no comment""."
bad,"30 people waiting outside every morning to be helped, so prepare yourself for a busy day. Processing transactions, selling products, and stressing out wehn you are out of balance."
bad,"Actively communicate with Clients, Mortgage Loan officer regarding the loan process, "
bad,"i only thank them for helping my banking career, but the way i was treated. I would only thank them for that."
bad,Supervise 10 underwriters. Unreasonable goals.  Misled by senior management.  Inconsistent guidance.
bad,I don't have anything positive to say so I'll keep it at that.
bad,I have nothing positive to say so I wont say nothing at all there is nothing to say good it is well over due to leave this company
bad,"Alot of broken promises. I worked there for 7 months when my contract was for a year. Everyday I entered in a hour early, I passed my assesment test, and did everything i needed me to do. They told me they were going to make me perm in the company then after a whole month of waiting to be perm, they laid me off."
bad,No one knew what they were doing hr will not tell you the truth.
bad,worked there for 13.5 years. put my soul into the company and they did not value me at all.
bad,This is a corporation must i say more.This company does little for employees and is very non supportive of customers.Very stressful when dealing with someones money and constantly finding reasons to take it.
bad,"great benefits, you meet different people everyday. your coworkers are cool too."
bad,very uncaring but def room for advancement not good management at all
bad,"Could care less about you working 7 days a week, 14 hour days, etc. The moral of some of the people who worked there was awful."
bad,"This is by far the absolute worst place I have ever worked. There's no way the positive reviews are written by real people. The only thing I learned from BOA was how office politics work, and how to avoid working for really bad companies."
bad,I have to say that my time here has been great.  I have managed and worked with some of the most talented individuals around.
bad,Arrive at work 30 min early to give my time to check emails and follow up. What I've learned was my customer was always pleased after speaking with them. My management was an awesome leader however you had some who lack in leadership and communication skills. I had some good co-workers who was willing to help out other and you also had the slackers. The hardest part of my job was when i was unable to get the proper information for my customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers
bad,"work/life balance is ok, management is good, job advancement is encouraged, great values and benefits/compensation is excellent."
bad,Answer calls for collections and mortgage modifications. I learned I am not a collector and I do not have the heart for it. Management was not easy to work with on moving to another position to get out of collections. Co-workers were great people who would help in any way possible. Hardest part of the job was telling people they did not qualify for modifications when they would tell you their story about what was going on in their life and the reasons needing the modification. Enjoyed working with my co-workers and the camaraderie that most of us had.
bad,"Overall the worst working experience of a lifetime. Some staff members have their positions due to who they know and while that may be a part of how life works, ""the people"" meaning customers shouldn't leave their money to chance. Customers trust in the financial institution it sets out to be unfortunately most of the people I dealt with did not have a greater economic, nor financial knowledge... believe when I say if they want to change or rebrand themselves it starts internally and for those who already work there I don't mean customer service but the structural process of creating successful employees who have a secure, universal, and consistent, place to go to build themselves. Try Chase or somewhere else."
bad,assisting cust daily with modification and processing documents. Its an ok work place
bad,"They consistently broke the law and knew they were.  I had to break the law or I would be let go.   I spoke to corporate attorneys when the mortgage fraud investigation happened and none of the vice presidents who committed the frauds were ever brought in.  "
bad,Learned a lot but had to pray everyday that the office politics wouldn't spill over into my professional life
bad,"There are constant management changes which result in contant changes in direction and the work load constantly piles up resulting in a challenging work life balance. "
bad,"I didnt like working there, the management was not at all nice.  They favoritized certain people only and move them up instead of people that has been there way longer than new people that barely new anything all because they were known by management.  They were not fair to workers at all."
bad,"horrible! knew from day one it was a mistake, couldn't wait to leave"
bad,"Great benefits. Typically days are hectic, lack of growth within the company."
bad,Job was consistant everyday. I knew what my duties was everyday it never changed
bad,Hiring manager was great but then a new manager came in 4 people left.  Manager treated customers poorly unless they were individuals with a lot of money in accounts.  Very rude to employee's and disliked when employees went above and beyond for customers.  Said it was a dis service to others.  After 1 month of being the only teller working in a very busy branch and yes working the drive as well as the lobby there were times lines would start out the door and manager would refuse help from other branches.  Lot of pride not enough common sense in this manager.  Now they are closing the branch due to poor customer treatment revenue started to suffer.
bad,Workinf at Bank Of america was fun and friendly coworkers and customers who I attend to there everyday need. The job was never hard always laughing are making a customer day.
bad,Bank of america is a bully. worst bank in the world. they even bully yheir own employees out of a job
bad,"Worked on the Par Loan , trading desk - directing calls, administrative functions, screaming out calls to co -workers was hardest part of job. Travel arrangements. I learned that the trading floor atmosphere was not for me. Did what I had to do in a bad economy. Most enjoyable part of job was taking with fun brokers and and other clients."
bad,"Tell us about:"
bad,"Managers are only able to do what comes down from corporate.  The level of customer service that we were able to perform was very poor and many issues go unresolved for weeks if not indefinitely.  They discourage you to think for yourself to do the best for the customer that you are with.  They offer promises with no solutions.  A typical day at work consisted of managers being scared of losing there job for some dumb reason.  All of the co-workers are very paranoid about doing something wrong to lose their job.  Instead of providing coaching to better employees you are written up for any meaningless occurrence.  Make an innocent mistake...there is a write up waiting for you."
bad,If you want to work for a company that doesn't care for their employees then this is the company for you!  The company also does not care about its customers as the employees are pressured to throw products at them in a 5 minute window without really addressing the customers needs.  There is also lack of training from tellers to management.  Real human interactions are not apart of this company.
bad,"Horrible, horrible, horrible.  I have been in the banking field for over 30 years.  I have  never seen such poor management and belittling of people as I did at B of A.  I am embarassed to have worked there and  will shout from the highest mountain of how much I hated it.  I've worked on Wall Street for Goldman Sachs, Lehman Bros., Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase.  Nothing is as bad as Bank of America."
bad,"I have learned alot more information about the mortgage industry,however nothing is consistant and you do just about everything on the loan with little to no training,excessive emails daily."
bad,"Co-workers were for the most part, really nice folks.  Some of the managers were really great.  I worked in the retail branches in the East and in a back office in the West.  Back office is much better with holidays and weekends and nights off.  Pay s**ks all over the place. Upper management has no idea what's going on and they could care less.  The job of upper management is to KEEP their jobs. How bout that?  Most middle and upper management is a bunch of slimewads. "
bad,"ML is a place to learn basic values in investment finance. "
bad,"I would not recommend that anyone accept employment at the Charlotte Office because the Management is questionable at best. One minute I was receiving praise and recognition, the next I was being screamed at like I was a poor quality domestic servant who worked for a mentally unbalanced person. Not good. I got out of there as soon as possible. I don't mind hard work and long hours. But I do mind being mistreated."
bad,Job is based on being robotic and referrals with unreachable goals that need to be completed daily. BOA needs to improve their system to make it easier on the teller and customers. Management in the branch I worked was very unprofessional. Some good co-workers who actually help you and others who only look out for themselves. The most enjoyable part of the job is closing.
bad,"As a teller, I entered transactions for customers in various fields.  I help maintain existing customer’s accounts, help set up new customers and sell new products to both new and existing customers to help better their financial futures."
bad,"no benefits, too high stress and low pay to appreciate position.  very stressful job.  poor compensation."
bad,Learned more about communcation and networking. Coworkers said I was a pleasure to have
bad,"Training was very informative and good. Once on the floor you were all on your own with no help or assistance. I managed to accomplish my goals using the BOA software, and along with other new hires we worked as a team to handle the diffrent aspects required."
bad,I was not there long did not get the opportunity to really explore my possibilities in the company
bad,Bank of America is a very good company to work for. It has good benefits and compensation package. The training that I received with them what very good and it was always on going. Their was always an opportunity for advancement. Stands by their core values.
bad,"No structure, weak management , Lack of leadership, no training,"
bad,"My personal observation is that they try to pay as little as possible (i.e. undermarket), that they look for every reason to get rid of you, and that they want you to be scared that you will lose your job....you just get the feeling that you are a slave, and that you should count self your lucky to have a job....this goes for full-time employees and people who got hired via an employment agency....if you have another choice for a job, choose that route...it's horrible at bank of america...maybe it's different at Bank of America branches, but I doubt it..."
bad,All I have to say about this company is that they are very unethical and try to pin the blame for their inability to train employees on the employees themselves.
bad,Dont even want waste my time writing a review for this people.
bad,Management was fired from another mortgage servicer and should not be in a managment position. One of the most negative work environments I have ever experienced
bad,"Minimal daily work assignments, associates goals completely skewed to their favor so even the worst employee in the department still made 800.00 in bonuses. Low expectations of Management and associates. Reporting numbers rarely correct so each manager has to double check their own teams scores, report changes and have them approved and re-printed. V.P. had no drive or ambition."
bad,"Cash checks and pay out money after verifying that signatures are correct, that written and numerical amounts agree, and that accounts have sufficient funds."
bad,"Totally low paying, they take advantage of your naitivity, over work and under pay, they do not reward for acheivement, bad work culture and bad work-life balance. its all about sales and meeting sales markets and nothing else the management or people there dont care about you or to develop relationships."
bad,too focus on making a profit not on customer service
bad,This was the worse job I ever had. The internal employees were worse than the customers calling in!! I was working in Tech Support for online Business banking. They did not have good training %80 of the time people were calling about something you knew nothing about and when you called the help desk or level 2 they would rather test your knowledge or tell you what to tell the customer instead of taking over the call or ask you a thousand questions while the customer is holding which was like the blind leading the blind !! The worse part was the personal bank reps that called in demanding things but had no idea what their client was having and issue with and acted as if you were a mind reader then had the nerve to be rude with you!! Omg just writing this is stressing me out brining back memories
bad,Bad environment to work in
bad,don't value their employee's
bad,"Used for a few months, then let go. Hires in large volume, fires in large volume. Unreliable job stability, No work/life balance, discouraged from taking time off: sick/vacation. Constant lies from management. No structure or chain of commands."
bad,"a place of employment that not only taught the business aspect of banking, but how banking affects us as a society"
bad,"Management has created a very hostile environment to work in co-workers are the best part of the job, hardest part of the job is not getting detailed information on a project. most enjoy part of the day is lunch"
bad,I was very disappointed with the structure and working conditions with bank of america.
bad,"Employees are not their number one priority, business first, employess are replaceable and their future with the company is not safe. This is not a job security company, it's not family oriented and you are not given room for human error in this company. The managers, and even the Unit managers are not responsible adults, and there is inconsistancy in the work ethics and priorities in the company."
bad,"Working for Bank of America has taught me alot about team work, using the knowledge to climb the corporate ladder and enjoying what you do."
bad,"They hire new Financial Advisors, let them generate as many new accounts as they can, chew them up, and then spit them out, and turn over your orphaned accounts to their buddies and favorites at the branch."
bad,This company lacks the managerial and organizational skills that's needed to retain not only their employees but their customers as well. The environment is very unprofessional which was a shock to me. Now I understand why the company's customers are furious with them. This company is not organized and the value system is based on money and not the well being of it's customers. Corners are cut in order to maintain certain governmental contracts yet the customer suffers. If you have a conscience then this would not be the place for you to work.
bad,Banking job are always good to work at because you learn a lot of thing. Like handling money and helping customers and learning how to manage your money.
bad,"The managers in Jacksonville, NC are HORRIBLE, wont let you off for appointments and do NOT work with kids. They are very selfish and push push push products they dont care about customer service as long as the customer has a bunch of money. The more the money the better the management treats them. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE COMPANY !!!"
bad, Initiate contact with customers who have defaulted on their mortgages
bad,"Is a company that treats their employees and their customers as a number. You have constant checking in with your manager as to how many widigits you have sold within the hour. So employee are not allowed to do what is right for the customer, but they have to meet their goal."
bad,I worked for them for almost 6 years and couldn't take it anymore. Worst company you could possibly work for :(
bad,"Worked in the Lockbox It's an okay job they don't pay much they expect alot out of you. They expect for you not to make an error. As a whole you meet deadlines as a group all the work gets out but, you are constantly harrassed about numbers and errors even though the deadlines are met. Supervisory is poor they talk about employees with other employees which is very unprofessional. It's a temporary job till you find a better one long term is impossible they have a high turn over will get rid of you in a heartbeat."
bad,Ability to lead small team of employees through out daily projects.
bad,This was the worst company i have ever worked for. the managment is not supportive or good at training employees.
bad,Worked on system upgrades.
bad,"If you are educated and qualified to do a job, it doesn't matter, unless you are in the ""in"" crowd. I hope that I can get out as soon as possible and never have to work there again. This is the worst company I have ever worked for!"
bad,"At Bank of America, someone distributes you work to you (they make a LOT of mistakes) then some one pushes you to finish as though they get a bonus if the work is completed by a certain time. especially you team leaders...they have their picks and chooses. if you are not in their ""circle"" you must fend for yourself. and heaven help you if you disagree or speak up about the distribution of work or anything else. that is how i was tricked into termination. i took some paper towels to line my car seat (as I had an accident and did not wish to mess up my car seat) some one saw me and that was it...I was stealing...REALLY?? I took a ream of paper to my desk...I was stealing..the paper was still on my desk when I was terminated... I could get a lot of people terminated but I'm not like that..........all I can say is watch out."
bad,"I started as a licensed advisor in 2008. This job was like a Boiler Room. You are constantly told to give clients wrong financial advice so they will churn in their accounts and the company can make money off of the commissions charged. You were expected to work massive amounts of overtime and in many instances not record the time. You basically end up working there for free. This is no place for anyone who wants a work/life balance. If you are married or have kids (which I didn't) do not even bother applying as you will not see your family. It is extremely hard to move up the ranks. I was considered a Top Performer but I still made no money. This is the a good place for those just out of college just trying to get experience. After a year, move on, which is what most of the talent does. Very High Turnover which they even addressed in a Big Meeting as ""their dirty little secret"" but still made no effort to improve."
bad,"The environment is stagnant, with constant layoffs and reduction in force."
bad,Good company to work that is all I have to say
bad,Typical day at work consist of coming at 8am and completing the task of procurring loans and title policies....contacting title policy or attorney’s office or lender...
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, it was tough constantly dealing with customers being upset due to fees and charges to there accounts. Not the best place to work if your a happy outgoing bubbly person like myself."
bad,Bank of America is not a stable career move.
bad,"Great company to work for if you want to do nothing but work. 60+ hours a week, with management breathing down your back at all times."
bad,do not care bout employee's strictly based on how much work you do.
bad,"A typical day was all grinding computer data entry. We had to practically beg for training it was as if they didn't want to invest in training for Contractors. Was horrified at management. The Team Leads showed tons of favoritism towards their pets, Associates (received benefits). They complained constantly about having to work and were very unprofessional..constant public gossip about their private lives. The hardest part abvout the job was dealing with hostile resentful co-workers (Associates) and management. The Contractors were held to different unfair standards and high production numbers while Associates played computer games, made personal (loud) phone calls and surfed the web, right in front of TM's. Contractors were used as scapegoats for low production numbers. The best part of the job was being fired."
bad,This company does not have the proper training for upper management to deal with their teams.
bad,Their customers aren't the only ones being treated like garbage.
bad,"Bank of America puts out a new compensation plan and bonus structure each year, however, they always change the pacakage when it is time for bonuses to be paid. They look for ways to not pay out promised bonuses. Performance reviews are one sided and do not consider employee input, any pay increases or bonuses are decided without emplyee feedback."
bad,I enjoyed working there just looking for a different opportunity
bad,Company would not stand by their employees. Very numbers oriented and not proficient in their training and follow through.
bad,Co-workers do not enjoy coming to work. Upper management did not appear to be aware of all the problems and complaints the branches incurred.
bad,They are actively replacing American IT staff with H1Bs who will work for half the rate of long term US staff. The jobs they have posted have already been offered to contractors and you are not going to be hired if you apply. They readily admit they are doing this.
bad,"Staff untrained, federal laws ignored, employees do not work or very little."
bad,"BOA is a great name in the industry, however once inside it all depends on the management team an employee such as myself is under. Management knows very little, they are not go to people as you would think they would be. My manager had to question everything with associates on the floor because she did not know the answer herself it was humiliating to know this is the type of leadership that I was under and just how far would I move up in this company."
bad,"Good benefits,but everything else sucked. They treat employees like cattle I felt like a number."
bad,Bank has a high level of managerial problems. Favoritism and discrimination has been highly recorded and it has been sued lately for it.
bad,"Worked as a contract employee in St. Louis, MO. The main problem is that there were unrealistic goals set by individuals with little to no knowledge of the title industry. All they are concerned about is production not quality. Since, I was a contract employee I had no access to benefits. Worked there for well over a year and was not hired. Instead they hired a man that had been there for less time and had only a basic knowledge of the job."
bad,Poor work compensation. No job security. Very Poor compensation and weak management.
bad,"A very pleasant place to work. Great management and benefits. Was recently transitioned out of collections atmosphere, much to my dismay."
bad,"They are not a good company to work for as they treat their employees like they were in a refugee camp. There is always someone listen to conservations, watching you and made you feel like there was and evil spirit around all the time."
bad,"Look elsewhere for Merrill Edge is nothing but a boiler room by any other name. Absolutely unconscionable! Nothing more then a semblance of fiduciary responsibilty to cover their constant push, push and push. Oh yeah, mandatory, unpaid overtime because your legally an ""exempt"" employee."
bad,"Lack of management support "
bad,"The title pretty much says it all; however I am a person who would tell another to not let ones view influence theirs.  This place is a definite experience you won't forget. No matter where you go, you'll never be paid you're worth; however a little appreciation and financial recognition would go a long way in reducing the turnover rate."
bad,How they didn't  get caught like Wells Fargo in forcing sales? Your entire success depends on how much you sell. Your incentive was fiction since everything depends on your manager
bad,Wealth Management side has much room for improvement.  Hostile and lack of inclusion environment.  They have no true desire to be inclusive; the ads are just PR.
bad,Company tells you to do something then fires you for doing it. If you are securities registered they put your licenses at risk. The company doesn’t have any conscience on how they treat their employees
bad,"I’ve been in sales roles my entire working career, however you have unrealistically high goals as a CSR/Teller and you’re not compensated at all as far as commission is concerned. There’s no incentive to get new accounts as a teller. On top of all of that you’re expected to balance to the T, even when you’re the only one there sometimes!  My direct manager is great, but the other tellers can walk all over you with no consequences."
bad,You will learn here... however this is not a fair environment. I’ve worked here off and on since ‘99 and have only come back when I was desperate and couldn’t find a job. You have to “play the game” and kiss butt here to get ahead. It’s soul crushing... I have refused to do that and have only had what is a entry level job for 20 years despite having a degree and being licensed. Stay away unless you need your license!!!
bad,Very stressful when your a new employee. Hard to get assistance at the moment you need help. You have to search for the answers in a system similar to google.
bad,"If you stick around long enough you will make too much money, thus you will earn your reward by being fired so the company can hire someone else for less money."
bad,"Management hardly facilitated a balanced atmosphere, disregarded employees needs for assistance, displayed inappropriate personal attitudes/beliefs toward 'temporary' staff (don't even bother with temp work they almost never hire temps and go through them very quickly). Head managers create a negative work space culture as a whole. Bank of America is a failing institution that mishandles millions of peoples finances. It is NOT worth the time or frustration. I'd love to sit down with the CEO someday and refer them as a whole a new home retention specialist management team."
bad,"Goals are unrealistic and you are expected to sell no matter what a customer calls in for. They don’t give full disclosure on what your job really is when you get hired. We got hired saying we were customer service with a chance to ear incentive. After a few weeks it was clear that we were to be 100% sales. 4 managers in one building and none of them are ever on the same page. The turnover rate is crazy, they can’t keep the place full at all! If you’re interested in being a slave to"
bad,"I worked for B of A for 4 years and had 7 different market managers in that time, which was very disorganized.  I found employee fraud and defalcation at both branches I managed and had to terminate  many employees.  The previous branch managers and market managers never noticed it going on right in front of them for months and years, but I saw it very quickly.  My last Market manager would pretend to visit monthly, when she really hadn’t done so, and expect me to sign off on the review, which I refused to do since it was a formal document."
bad,"You are brought into BOA with the best introduction possible. everyone seems friendly at first and you sit through classes at first to learn everything. disregard about 80% of what you learn in this class because it will be completely irrelevant to what you actually do on the phone. literally 20% of the information is used when you get on the phone. for the first few months you will be greeted by a friendly environment and a friendly management team. DO NOT BE FOOLED! These managers are mostly incompetent with very few actually knowing what they're doing and very few will help you. when you first arrive and get on the phone, for the first 3 hours you will have no managers available so if you have a manager call that's just tough. when you need help your customer will have to wait at least 15 mins before you can finally get a manager on the phone even if you talked to them right when they were requested. be prepared to do a lot of their work for them. also when managers are present, they will spend most of the day in away status or unavailable so you cant contact them through your computer and instead have to get up and try to find them. the management referral system is by far the worst. also BOA employees quit very often. the entire class I came in with that had oer 30 people is now down to just 3 after 5 months and managers regularly quit or ""change to more needed role"" so they can avoid the horrible schedule. be prepared to work 10 hours a day and just sit on the phone getting yelled at all day and struggling with the computers(systems are guaranteed to crash at least once"
bad,"Bank of America is hands down a terrible employer to work for; unless you enjoy being micromanaged, get a thrill from the looming fear of being laid off due to the constant office and departmental closures. God forbid anyone goes out on any sort of medical leave and tries to return to back to work. You will quickly be put out to pasture and forced out of the company. At best, they have no ethical responsibility for their employees"
bad,This job was focused in a call center environment. Department was broken up into 12 teams. This location was consider a top performing location even with an extremely high turn over rate. Management clearly play favorites amongst the staff. There were several personal relations going on between manager and employees.
bad,"Unethical management and Loan officers,  stealing loans from each other, selling loans to other companies,  even branch managers are making money on stealing loans to give to their friends in other lending companies. "
bad,"The company does not have flexibility,will not work with you .People have walked off while working there.Not a good company,very racist,manager s are not considerate"
bad,"Needs a higher pay for the work and always having classes for other departments and not getting a raise for it , working for the fraud department and having to do other departments jobs"
bad,"Inexperienced management, lazy employees, no training opportunities, lousy scheduling, unfair treatment across the board, unwelcoming environment, sold out to Washington Federal in 2014"
bad,Bank of America managers don’t care about the employees only there pay and hr doesn’t care about the workers either they will fire u over petty small things and they go by he said she said things they don’t care about there employees at all and u can never talk to the ceo or anyone higher they always make up an excuse
bad,"Management was Horrible, Hostile work Environment. It was who you knew, not your performance. If they determine they do not like you, not your work ethic, They set you up to FIRE YOU...Management from the highest level should be looked at."
bad,"Branch manager was crazy."
bad,I would not recommend this company. They perform poorly in side of the company as well as outside of the company. I am no longer a customer either. BofA needs complete transformation.
bad,"limited support, a lot of compliance work, poor to little management support. Was fired after a solid 2 years of work because rates went up mortgage business slowed down and then was fired after being moved around to 3 offices after making the first one a success. No management support on hard mortgage deals. You have to deal with customers while they refuse to approve hard loans."
bad,Just smile and nod and you will go far. Delegate all your work but never learn your job. Perks area the same as all other companies. Bank of America is a follower not a leader. Perfection is expected but never reinforced. Expect multiple group feedback sessions but no punishment for people specifically.
bad,The CEO makes all the money here. Not the tellers no annual raises or parties nothing they give nothing back. Find another job perhaps behind the scenes back office
bad,"Sadly my time at Bank of America was not good.  I did learn a lot, but not from their training, but on my own.  They did not give the managers proper tools to help their employees.  They would create an environment of harsh competition and a scorecard that was impossible to meet."
bad,"Your just a number, not a person, no one cares about you breaks are denied, they mandate OT, they will force you to come back from a surgery related medical leave early, deny you time to have stitches removed from your body, but they will pay you okay, to hate yourself and your job"
bad,"They are getting worse and worse, there are many job openings because employees leave constantly. Wells Fargo is nothing compared to Bank of America when it comes to the pressure they put on their employees to meet sales goals. Skipping your breaks on a daily. Interrupted lunch hours. Threats of being written up for not reaching your goals."
bad,Bank of America was a challenging environment as it was undergoing merger activity at a level not before seen.  There were 5 mergers in 6 years. It made servicing the clients next to impossible
bad,"Too much favoritism, constantly threaten people's jobs, do not take family life into consideration.  Make people go to work during state of emergency snowstorms when people are not to be driving, but they say they don't have to follow those rules and force people to go to work."
bad,"Bank of America focuses primarily on the bottom line.  If the stock price is too low, expect layoffs in the following weeks. Bank of America focuses on contracted offshore resources."
bad,There is no room for advancement. The role of manager was taken on by many people. The manager was not very people friendly. Horrible place to work!!!
bad,"If you enjoy feeling dead inside, stressed, unappreciated...this job is for you.  If you enjoy being micromanaged, made to feel like 100% effort is not enough, you'll do great"
bad,"Following Wells Fargo Greed and sales practices. They won't use the word sales they hide behind the cloud of relationship management but have serious sales goals and you are totally micro managed, and if you don't meet them they threaten."
bad,"This position was an internship position through a program. The internship seat was in stocks where you need certain certifications to do the job. To obtain those certifications, you had to be referred. I expressed interest but I was not given an opportunity to do any work no matter how many times I offered."
bad,"Exploram trabalho de temporários e estags, não há divisão de tarefas por hierarquia. "
bad,"The people were great but the work load was way too much for one person. The reports that had to be done each da took up your whole day and then you could start working on your loans at the end of the day and you would have to work a lot of overtime, That meant time away from your family."
bad,"Management is cut throat.  Would not recommend. You must be in the click. Was countrywide employee bought out by BofA, used us until all was running smooth, and then let us all go."
bad,"nothing to say. After working for over eleven years, cutting hours, being top performer does not count, you get transferred, start doing job sharing not loose the hours."
bad,"While I had nearly 10 years of a good working experience on Merrill's trading desk, the advisory side in 2008 was a nightmare. The firm was in constant legal and financial trouble and management consistently provided false information regarding the firm's future. Horrible experience."
bad,"Bank of America has great products and services for the clients of the bank.  Locally, the management was not the best.  I didn't agree with their tactics to motivate employees.  There was a fear culture.  You worried about the security of your job."
bad,"Horrible management,  there is no respect for the employees and no matter what the customers case is we are expected to make a sale on every call. The only way to get anywhere in this company is if you are a favorite."
bad,"Constant reduction of workforce with no regard to the employees quality of work of work ethic. Increased job responsibilities with no training and unrealistic deadlines. In addition to upper management not knowing or even attempt to educate themselves with their assign areas, to be able to make decisions."
bad,Once transferred to Edwardsville location i hated working for this company. Management uses their power to make work life hard and upper management didn’t care to hear workers opinions.
bad,"They want every one to read scripts and don't be human. Only cater to clients with money. Don't care about blue collar class."
bad,Very racist and very bad pleeeease dont get a job here I hated it soooo much I never liked it here hence why I dont anymore save yourself stress trust me.
bad,"This is has to be the worst investment firm I have ever worked for. I came into the PMD program which is supposed to be the best training program in the industry but it is the opposite. They basically just send you down for 1 week of in class training and then you are on your own. They don't teach you about the platform or products. "
bad,"""teams"" take a large percentage of your commissions while telling you that you 'can't do it without them'. Management pressures you to do more and more until you burn out. I brought in $750,000 of new money per month for 18 months; no respect."
bad,"Working for a bank depends a lot on your manger. For example; I liked my first branch because the manger was very helpful, understanding, and was free to our opinions and suggestions. Our last manger was like a principal of a school. He was like a dictator and was extremely hard to work with ultimately leading me to quit."
bad,"They paid minimum wage, gave minimum hours and then got mad when you didn't pick up extra shifts even though they know you work multiple jobs. I had many different managers while working there. Some were great, some were so-so. Quick turn-over for management positions. Tellers seem to stay longer."
bad,Senior Manager she is not fair with her employees. She favours people who will pick her grand daughter from school or will tell her employee to tell her husband to fix the gate. The Manager at Lincoln village branch needs to be rotated she thinks she is above the law and can do whatever she wishes.
bad,"front line producers metrics were not in line with how managers were rated"
bad,"Was not an enjoyable job. Management constantly looking for ways to terminate employees rather than develop.  Management is smug and not shy about showing you how better they think they are than you.  Meanwhile, running front lines to increase their bonuses, not your own."
bad,"As a cashier, no one is allowed on your computer for transactions or in your till SUPPOSEDLY.  Management is constantly pushing you away or interrupting to do a transaction for their customer, from the branch manager to assistant to supervisor to accounts."
bad,The job motivate me to try Collections and Fraud Analyst.This was an amazing 12 years that ended due to needing an increase due to the coat of living going up so much in California.
bad,"Long hours, lack of support, employees FTE changes without business justification. Top Executives unaware of the business decisions made by upper management - as long as it doesn't go to CEO they would turn a blind eye to request for support, of day to business, associate security and client concerns"
bad,Not an actually place to work or not a good place to work and to stay stable or to start a carrer and they are not fair they have a lot of favoritism starting with the team members from your team and a lot more you won't like
bad,Typical big corporate - no chance to move up or advance if you don't know anyone/unfair pay/long working hour/poor management/lack of work-life balance
bad,Bank of America was very cut-throat with making sure that their tellers meet their sales goals. It was difficult trying to talk people into products that they might not need.
bad,"The culture is high pressure low reward. Not enough staff to fulfill sales goals. Making the impossible, possible is in you job description. incompetent and cowardly managers who do not have their employees backs. Easy enough sales goals, not enough resources and lack of team work will make them hard to fulfill. No commission for anyone but bankers. No real training and coaching, just intimidation."
bad,Not a particularly great co. to work for. They are very bad at negotiating rates for the contractors and the working conditions.  Don't seem to care about the treatment of the contractors by the end employer.
bad,"everything is based on favoritism. chain of command doesn't work, they push people they don't like out the door, don't provide adequate training, and don't provide you with tools needed to succeed."
bad,"Wrong management. racist company."
bad,"Very bad place to work.  Zero work life balance,  no fixed HR policy.  No HR to hear about employees suffering.  Managers think they own the company.  Job distribution is hopeless.  There are lot of hiring defects."
bad,"The managers had little job experience, and were rude, harassing, and unethical.  I am surprised that more people have not sued the bank for what they were forced to endure."
bad,I was only at this job for 4 months due to the horrific call centre culture that was enforced. Every cliche you could think of was real and the aggressive manner in which telesales were pursued was soul-crushing.
bad,The company is in a routine of constant lay offs.  This costs the shareholder millions and millions of dollars.  They keep laying off the workers and none of the cut throat senior leadership.  They have a ton of incompetent senior leaders who have been promoted to the point they have no idea what anyone below them does.
bad,"Bank of America is a great company with a great structure, but the environment is horrible.  Managers who have no experience in the area they are managing.  They have control over employee livelihood with no training.  The middle managers have no experience in how to deal with complex situations. Also with the huge layoffs in the past few years being a top producer does not guarantee employment you are faced with the anticipation that you could lose your job any day."
bad,"Working here was a nightmare. If high stress, non compassion, long hours, and robot automation interests you? Then this place is a winner. If you are idle between one project and another for 10 minutes, you will immediately be visited by your supervisor to see why you are not on a project. Are you kidding me! If this was a government it would be labeled as a dictatorship!"
bad,"Your day starts with a huddle to set accountability for the day. You debrief with your bankers and set accountability. Through out the day you lead manage and coach behaviors, activities and processes. you create a customer centric environment. At the end of the day you debrief celebrate successes and coach to opportunities"
bad,"I have worked for many corporations and I understand how they work, but BOA is the worst of the worst. They don't want a person, they want a robot. Every second of every day is micromanaged."
bad,"The actual position in itself was great, however all of the constant changes and complaints from management about how we the employees never seemed to meet the expectations set forth became too much especially when we were giving it all we could. Low compensation jut made it even worse when we were always short handed.The best part of the job was the customers for the most part."
bad,"I'm working in the banking operations team handling trade finance operations. The typical work day is processing trade finance related transactions. The operations management is not really that good and is very biased in their approach towards employees. co workers and superiors are also  unsupportive in nature."
bad,"Bank of America was an exceptional employer with great benefits and opportunities. However, over the past six years it has declined because of poor senior management, goals unattainable and inadequate staffing. The culture is only focused on sales with no work life balance and if the sales are not delivered the consequences are extreme. The hardest part of the job is there are too many focuses, and the change is moving faster than anyone can keep up with. The customers are always screaming and acting out in the lobbies, and the staff is stressed out. It's sad what a great company they once were and the employees are not appreciated or valued."
bad,"Nothing but stress, high pressure sales, harassing customers to get them to buy more debt that they don't need. You are instructed to be relentless, push and use high pressure sales tactics to bully customers into loans, credit cards or any other det=bt we can get them into. My blood pressure went to the roof, you have to call customers, peruse their spending habits on their bank accounts so you know what products to cram down their throats. If you enjoy doing all that, this is the job for you. If you have a conscious you will never be able to sleep at night doing the things the demand you do to reach extremely unrealistic sales goals."
bad,"If you like long hours, with no direction other than do it, with only the most perfunctory semblance of on the job training, advancement, fair pay, or basic respect this is the job for you."
bad,"If you are looking for a position with an health work life balance then this is not the company for you. Far as promotions and it's easier to get promoted outside of this company. "
bad,"job security, no communication from management  and higher up executives. co workers start rumors. never know what going to happen the next day. employees   and managers leaving each and every day."
bad,"It was unrealistic how much they wanted you to sell to every client that walked in the door. They do not focus on customer service at all, they just want you to sell-sell-sell. Even products that they do not need."
bad,"Slave drivers, Schedules are never the same, have to beg for bathroom breaks, works on skeleton crew so if someone is sick"
bad,"Just don't waste your time. They will use you, abuse you, push you to the max and then threaten to replace you like you're a worthless piece of trash. They don't value their employees at all and all of their moves are strategic only to feed the top executives who only see you as a number to make their pockets fatter. If you work there you will be a peasant, you will experience stress, overload of work, terrible non functional slow tools that don't assist in your success. Expect random changes in company policies, performance goals and added uncompensated job responsibilities. You will walk on eggshells and NEVER BE GOOD ENOUGH no matter how hard you try. Managers will come down on you with the third degree if you are not surpassing goals. High turnover with employees, game of politics & favoritism to make it anywhere to a higher level within the company. This company is the worse place I've ever worked for. I didn't go in thinking I would say this but it's true, it's heartless corporate America and you will be a depressed robot wondering if anyone knows who you are and if you'll ever be good enough."
bad,"Alk I can say is.... I hated it......do not go there at all... they are not there to help their employees and do not care about they, nor do they care about the ones who would like to advance blah blah blah"
bad,"Unfortunately can't say nothing negative about the bank but who runs it! No consistency overall including managers all doing different things. Teams were scored  with  the same metrics,   the system had a flaw and even though it was exposed numerous amount of times from ex employees nothing was ever done to correct it. I would never recommend this Bank to anyone.."
bad,Was a great place to work until Bank of America came in and cut staff and completely changed the workplace culture.  They used to care a lot about their employees and unfortunately that has drastically changed.
bad,"Following the disaster that was the Countrywide acquisition and subsequent termination of Countrywide executives, Bank of America leadership continued to pursue plans put in place by the people they fired."
bad,"I worked in this office for a number of years, and it perpetually worsened over time. High stress sales environment heavily weighted on benchmarks. You are only as good as your territory and product which constantly change. Management has a ""deal with it"" mentality when products were discontinued and credit guidelines became stricter. In terms of advancement it's not what you know it's who you know. This office is notorious for promoting friends and family members when other hard workers are better qualified. The people at the top just play politics and aren't forthright about internal issues or the company as a whole. There is no diversity in positions of power or real authority. Attitude reflects leadership, and there simply is none."
bad,"I experienced descrimination, no work / life balance exists at this institution. I felt as if I was a in prision! No lunch breaks, working 70-80 hours a week when I'm salary.  I wouldn't recommend this institution to my worst enemy."
bad,"it had a very high turn over for all the company was going a different direction then helping the customers ,and  it became a place were you were not comfortable at all at work ."
bad,"nope, nope, nope.  Never have I felt like more than just a number.  Employees are measured against multiple sets of KPI's and metrics with no cohesion.  I was transferred between three different banking centers within a year's time and I had to get the same vacation request approved by three different managers.  The last manager I worked with refused to approve the time after I had already booked flights and hotel rooms.  Luckily, I found a new job right before my trip.  Management has 100% discretion over who gets paid commission and how much.  I wasn't paid my last quarter's commission even though I attained my sales quota."
bad,"Executive team on retirement projects, balance short and longterm goals"
bad,"This began as my favorite job, but over my four year career the culture has changed quite a bit. Compenation is not competitive, Management micromanages, and responsibilities continue to increase."
bad,Worst place to work at unless you like the public embarrassment.  This company does not care about their employees.
bad,people would call in to activate pin numbers and to double check on there wire transfers.
bad,"they promote a herd culture. I would not work there again."
bad,This job will overwork and under value you. I got out of there as soon as possible
bad,"Working in the call center is horrible, poor work environment, no work/life balance, and terrible management."
bad,"I joined Bank of America through a merger and saw the company steadily go downhill during my years of service.  Instead of being based on performance, promotions and raises were extremely political.  Being a top performer (based on performance reviews) made no difference in titles or compensation. "
bad,"a typical day at work, Involved in BAU activities and handling day today work"
bad,no department would respond to customer inquiry within the specified time.
bad,The work load that you are provided is not reasonable for the time provided. Treated as a number not as a person.
bad,"-Manage staff of 4 to 12"
bad,"Not a good company salary satisfaction, no incentives, no bonus, only one side cab.. overall not satisfactory"
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck that's it
bad,"Bank of America does a great job at providing tools to transform employees into leaders. I greatly enjoyed over the past 9 years using and suggesting the leadership tools provided such as the mentoring programs in different business areas, having an opportunity to read the Harvard reviews daily and taking advantage of all the numerous tools that the associate development website offers."
bad,"Micromanagement is the culture, if you like working in a retail environment then you will love BOA."
bad,Big Company that does not really care about the employees. Just want benefits the company.
bad,Can't speak for the whole bank but the Loan Department is still run by the past Countrywide management.
bad,Responded to clients requests and sought new business; learned more about the ability of banks to churn their clients without being concerned about their actual needs. Management was disconnected from the client and the bank officer in that they continually changed the sales goals without any feedback or consideration for the impact on the employees. Best part of the job was meeting the owners of the companies.
bad,Banking Center is dirty has not been updates in over 30 years no security what so ever not looking out for the safety and security of their employees
bad,Bank of America is finally shutting down the old Countrywide offices!
bad,management and employment treatment is horrible. very poor management.worse company to work for
bad,Aweful experience. My manager ignored his group; spent more time trading online than managing.
bad,"Typical day at work is sales, sales, sales, numbers, numbers, numbers. Un fortunately all of the big banks are like this now. I learned banking is a numbers and cold hearted business. I am not saying this as a jaded individual, this is just the hard truth. Management is in and out, here today, gone tomorrow. The hardest part of the job are ridiculously aggressive sales numbers and the fear of losing your job if you don't make them. Management doesn't care, so you are on your own. The most enjoyable part was all the friends I made over the years, unfortunately most of them including myself were let go unjustly."
bad,"I worked for the bank for 5 and a half years and was laid off along with about 450 others. Initially we were told we would have other employment opportunities, but, only about 40-50 people were extended job offers. Almost everything concerning the layoff turned out to be actually very different once we were officially severed. I reported to work every day on time, did not call in sick, and met my goals. Favoritism runs rampant,"
bad,"Very unprofessional,promotions only given to favored people. Got laid off for no reason as I was handicapped,but they kept all the do nothing female minorities"
bad,No advancement opportunity. Management has their favorites. You are micro managed. They watch & listen to everything you do. Don't work there for under $55k. No matter the position. Pay discrepancy between men and women. Coworkers are cut throat. They don't know what they're doing. The good ol boy mentality lives on...mandatory overtime on weekends.
bad,"A typical day in a position at bank of america is VERY productive, VERY stressful. Lots of work , little to no training often times, you would have to be a quick learner by all means. Co-workers were resourceful at times, Management was questionable; meaning we always had to find out things together. The hardest part of the job to me was not being able to meet the required goals in such short time to obtain the bonus. The Most enjoyable part of the job was ""The Town Hall Meetings"" (Food/Fun).."
bad,Interesting enough the corporate culture from the Nations Bank world was the same as the BofA world. I interned with NationsBank while I was in college.
bad,"Unrealistic goals to satisfy customer issues within an unrealist amount of time per call within their Tampa, Fl call center."
bad,"Dictatorial nepotistic and unprofessional managers who treat ""associates"" like children."
bad,"Managed by the leftover Countrywide ""sub primers"" - uneducated and mean spirited. Bank of America is in serious need of a management change before things get turned around. It is sad because a lot of talent is stuck there."
bad,It’s not about the people that make the company. It’s about the people that bring in money and sometimes that’s not even the reason for this bank. Shareholders are the only priority
bad,"Many of the employees I worked with were condescending & arrogant. If you weren't a part of the club, you weren't treated fairly. The job security is a joke. Don't be fooled. They will cut you for no reason or will find any reason to do so."
bad,This place is full of people who lie to you to get what they was out of you for my I had a manager who made me feel less of a person she got me thinking I was so little by telling me other mangers thought I didn’t have it in me that they actually say that and In 6 months everyone had Saturdays off at different times the manger the fcom the tellers the banker when I worked every single Saturday for 6 months.
bad,Very strange environment nobody speaks no proper training no culture no benifits high expectations with no give back. People dissappeared all the time or never turned up for interviews. Took 5 months for interviews and background process of your bank records financial circumstances and all addresses in the past ten years.
bad,"After five years wasted, I rather not say. You are just a number in a corporate world anyone can be replaced . Consider a work life balance Corp. trying to turn humans into robots. But you must have superior customer service. They do not care about their employees"
bad,"If  you love being micro manage threw out your work day then this is the job for you ,  You will feel like a number working at Bank of America , your manger is allowed to mistreat you and talk down to you without any repercussion, never apply for a relationship banker position because all the revenue that walks threw the door is given to the relationship manger or your manger. I however did meet two really sweet manger while training at Bank of America who seem to care about there employees but other than that the company shows not compassion for its workers."
bad,"Bank of America loves Diversity, therefore managers are given the position that are not qualified for the job. I was exceeding in my position until a new manager came in and decided to place our whole team in another position to put her Friends in our position  Had to leave BOFA after 12 years.   Very Poor Management"
bad,"Do not work for this company...they will just get rid of you if you do not show that you can be a ""yes massa"" person.... this company is ran like a plantation and they do not care how they treat you!!! Run as fast as you can....do not buy in to they will hire you permanently and you will move up."
bad,"if you tick off even one senior, you are out. i am an example and on my way out just because one senior has set their mind to get rid of me and that person does not even sit in the same city as us. constant nagging from manager who was fired and new one is here but even she is under pressure,"
bad,Company sucks. Management sucks. Office us old. Horrible work environment. Favoritism is rampant. If you dont fit in with the click you will be bullied.
bad,"Terrible place to work, turnover rate is super high because they push sales and offer rates on every call but the quarterly incentive (that's right they only give u a bonus every 3months) is middling at best and with the role being service to sales it is very hard to maintain the proper sales focus when all they give u is customer service and card activation calls. Management doesn't listen or care about the strict work environment they just tell you for lack of better words ""well mY e this job isn't for you"" when it really isn't for anybody who doesn't like to be overworked and under paid  "
bad,"My experience working there was the worst.  They treated temps like low class citizens, had 13 people in one room, it was always hot, when they had free lunches for us they monitored the food and told us how much to eat, I’m not lying , I don’t recommend them at all..."
bad,"Extremely stressful, always someone talking you down and always something wrong with what you are doing. Nothing is never enough for them. If your manager doesn't like you then you will get fired without a warning for anything you do wrong, while people around you are warned many times over. Bonuses are based on performance, but without overtime, you will struggle immensely."
bad,I am unable to share my experience at BofA. I had to sign an NDA in order to effect any type of fluid transition out of that organization. My experience there was the worst in 25 years.
bad,Things are not done proper. Way out of company compliance when it come to the way the managers want you to sell. Benefits are good but not good enough for your to stay in such a toxic job environment.
bad,"Upper management has lost touch with their employees and their customers.   They do not care about the little people.  Yes you get paid a livable wage, but it doesn't mean much if you despise going to work.  Loved the people I worked with,  but could not stand the company as a whole and the direction it is going."
bad,"They had an issue with someone with similar name to mine had asked for Leave of Absence. They knew it was coming where my systems were going to be blocked at some point. However, they just left it as is. Once they ""fixed"" the issue, I still wasn't able to access systems that were needed to do my daily job. I kept on sending emails to my Supervisor which seemed like if they really didn't care how long it would take."
bad,"Company does not have realistic goals, training says YOU CANT  FORCE A CLIENT INTO A PRODUCT yet Managers  Sales Pressure you EVERY DAY ALL DAY. It wouldn’t surprise me if it goes down like Wells Fargo did."
bad,"Managers are told to stay in the lobby all day to manage.  This means taking complaints all day because they have cut staff so thin and the clients are tired of waiting in line..  If managers jump in to try to help clients, they are ridiculed by upper management.  Upper management’s view is that if the client doesn’t want to use electronic options, they can wait."
bad,"My first day of training was great and felt very welcomed. My initial impression was this was going be an everyday thing. Come in meet with the manager and then get on the computer for training no problem. Then came time for my observations and the manager was not helpful at all. So I contacted the recruiter and said could I move to another branch due to manager inability to talk to me and tell me my day to day. Apparently me asking for that was asking me asking to be “coddled “. I didn’t know asking a manager to assist in training was coddling. I decided to part ways. Best decision I ever made. My new job has better pay, better training and better management. Not worth the time if you can’t even have a manager manage."
bad,Will discuss upon request.  I was wrongfully terminated and was not given a fair chance to defend myself.  I was a victim of retaliation for discussing a personal HR issue.  I gave that company 15 years and was sent packing because I raised an issue.
bad,"This company is sells and money driven. For all the work put in the return in compensation is poor. Too many repetitive trainings, alot of managers take their authority too far, customers are rude, etc."
bad,"Management lies, they rig the queue's for the ones they're going to hire so their stats look great. Hated every moment of it  and I finally quit. Spent hours in training on procedures used every six months or so, not truly focusing on procedures used on every single call. Extreme vague information. It would take more than a few minutes looking for an answer in the system. Zero floor support. Management treated their favorites well, and blew the rest of the department off. One person's cubicle looked like a kitchen, food everywhere...snacks everywhere. A tacky portrayal of what is supposed to be professional? One person actually wore slippers to work....The whole atmosphere was like a cheap carnival act."
bad,"1. Poor management"
bad,"Supervising and coaching teams on the proper behaviors, sales techniques, service expectations and compliance guidelines, while modeling the same. Creating workforce stability by cultivating an engaged, enthusiastic, and well-coached team. Responsible for leading a team of sales and service professionals to meet and exceed sales goals and service targets."
bad,"So I worked in a smaller area so it was different. When i had my son I was working nights. I am a single mother and I barely got any sleep because I worked nights. I begged to move to days and no one helped me. Finally after a year I got the opportunity and they pretty much forced me into a demotion. I felt discrimated against as a single mother. I was having constant mental break downs from sleeping like 2 or 3 hours. I would cry all the time. So in the end I left the bank after 8 years all because I became a single mom and no one would work with me on a better schedule. I wasnt what they wanted so they ""managed me out"". Its a term my managers in my department used. It means your not on any documentation so they have to try and find a way to get rid of you."
bad,Horrible management!  Forced into a job that I was not properly trained for.  Changed my hours after 12 years of glowing reviews. Horrible company to work for as the manager was clueless and only had the position due to diversity and nothing else. They are a money grabbing company that treats associates like they are disposable garbage.  They are all about money as n nothing else
bad,I Highly hate this place and do not recommend this sales culture to anybody.  Management stinks.... You basically fetch for yourself with no help from your manager.
bad,"I was deployed twice.  Upon my second deployment and return, they made the position unavailable and then gave me a position as a CA and assigned 8 low producing advisors with me.  It was a set up for failure---and yes they decided to fire me only asking me to walk away several times so they wouldnt fire me."
bad,"I do not want to go on to much about the three years i spent at Bank of America. They hung the idea of a promotion over your head while constantly changing goals to make that promotion impossible. Aside from the manager harassing me, I was made to shove products down the throat of people who did not need them. I worked tirelessly trying to reach the goals they set only to have them constantly raising them as soon as i reached one. One mistake can cost you years worth of time to repay and overall i would not recommend working here unless you're desperate. Specifically the retail banking side of BoA is where i had my horrible experience, but who knows how deep the corruption and self serving ideals go."
bad,I had to go to class every day for several weeks. We learned their policies an procedures. I really enjoyed learning this information and learning their system.
bad,"The company changed once acquired by Bank of America in 2008. The culture changed to the typical corporate culture. Cold, profit focused and disinterested in the employees."
bad,"Bank of America is the epidemy of corporate culture. Cold, unengaged and focused solely on the bottom line. The work culture is poor and employee satisfaction was generally low."
bad,"I was with Countrywide Home Loans when Bank of America acquired the company.  The acquisition of Countrywide Home Loans after the market crash of  2007 resulted in my position being terminated, forced into a different position with a decrease in pay, causing a substantial loss of income."
bad,"You are given a goal which you must achieve....the problem is the goal is usually 15% higher which depends on location can be unrealistic."
bad,"The bonus structure was reduced almost every year for the past 10 years while the stock price has increases along with exec compensation.  There is little or no career planning or professional development and the work atmosphere is rigid, behind the times, unimaginative and stale."
bad,The corporate office continues to change the expectations to make it better for them not the employee.  They micromanage employees and make it a very unfriendly work environment.
bad,"Management bullies people into mandatory overtime, will find any excuse to not let you take preapproved vacation time or allow you to post out to another dept."
bad,"Started with the company as a teller, and moved up the ranks to end at an Assistant Manager.  Major issues where that people are doing their banking online/atm/electronically so the foot traffic slowed down and method has changed to loans/investments."
bad,"- Too much micromanaging"
bad,"For an organization as large as Bank of America they are so disfunctional. They make up rules as they go. No real direction! All they want to do is push sales to people who are already happy with the services they have! And, high pressure sales at that. You will be better off at Wells Fargo!"
bad,"The most challenge part of the job is the lack of staffing at the financial centers. In addition, not having support from your manager or peers. Its a great place to work in the operations side of the bank. However, on the Retail side its garbage to say the least."
bad,"There are some really great managers at BAC. Your outlook on work is defined by your hierarchy.  If you get in a bad group that is not progressive, you will be stuck. Unfortunately, the latter is the case for most. Firings are more common that career advancement, mentoring and training."
bad,"Micromanaged environment, constant pressure for sales on daily calls. Monitor the conversations you have with your clients. "
bad,"They let go of over 1000 employees in one day 'due to a "
bad,"Leadership and work/life balance needs to improve.  Leadership constantly re-organizes and makes unnecessary changes, to the point that nothing ever gets done."
bad,"I was not employed by Bank of America too long, but I was not happy working for them. I don't agree with the tactics used to practically force customers to enroll into products that they did not need or want."
bad,Long hours with no compensation
bad,"Although I was a contractor there, hated every minute to every hour I was there (8 months). The team lead I had provided me with incorrect information, then question me on why I did what I did, and I would explain that what was suggested to me. I rather not say anymore regarding this position."
bad,You can never have a planned day due to sudden issues from some else lack of planning
bad,"Management is null in void, they expect you to just sell. They don't care about the clients at all, just numbers. Expect lots of drama as managers are promoted without having any experience in finance."
bad,"It was a during the down turn in the economy and they truly did not care the the mortgage loan officers were starving with low property values etc.  When I left for another bank job else where, there were 3 people left in the local mortgage dept.  Later I heard the entire office was shut down due to every loan officer leaving."
bad,The social politics for job security were insane. You would see people get let go all the time after being there for 10 and 15 years. It was like being on the military.
bad,"My particular branch is always full of drama, and everything gets talked about. Hours are extremely long, and when customers get upset, management takes their side every time. Customers can get abusive, so this job is not for sensitive people."
bad,"The bank does not promote a positive environment, very poor management and does not foster a positive environment for success.  Threats of performance are a constant problem with out proper guidance,"
bad,"Bank of America simply has a terrible work environment and culture.  It has had this for a while now, it hires, keeps, and gives preferential treatment to people who know people.  Gives them higher management positions even if they are extremely underqualified or even completely unqualified. The more influential the person or people you know the better off you are.  Otherwise, you will probably be laid off."
bad,"If you work in IT you basically are under pressure to keep up with how indians work in india...overtime and weekends...for free...they won't force you to work extra but they won't keep you around either unless you understand the ""unwritten"" rules."
bad,"Horrible training experience! Was constantly talked down to and compared to other peers!  Management was horrible, treat you like a number and all they care about is Sales goals!  Not what I expected!"
bad,When I worked at bank of America i dedicated my whole day to work as hard as i could. i went to work to work and make the most of it. i was great at achieving my goals each quarters and a big part of that reason was that when it was slow in the branch i would step out of the branch to bring in new business.
bad,Advancements take wayyy to long people working for 10+ yers and barley getting promoted. Doing more then your pay requires and get no benefit. Its all about a buddy system you make friends with bosses youll move up no matter how unqualified you are.
bad,My experience was with a soul-sucking environment that does nothing but treat you like number. No one appreciates your work ethic or dedication but only as another number to add to their profit. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT WORKING HERE.
bad,Very poor working environment. The entire company is negative. Management is not helpful and lazy. Customer service is a non-issue.  Extremely political. Employees treated like numbers.
bad,"Would never recommend this company even to my worst enemy."
bad,They are very old fashioned living in the era of stone age with mainframes as their tools for hunting and fishing.Company depends on your skills.Everthing they need for freeware and free tools.
bad,would not recommend. work is nonstop with little recognition by management. I would not recommend this company to anyone I know or don't know. The name is just that.
bad,"Management is terrible.  It's never enough.  You hit the numbers and it's never enough.  Recently, It has turned into a call center environment. terrible"
bad,"Terrible management. They push employees to always sell like Wells Fargo did in California, causing employees to harass customers every day with sales. You work there with the fear of being fired if you don't sell to each and every customer. Managers are not to be trusted. They want you to trust them but will not support you when you need them the most."
bad,Working here was horrible. I offered credit cards to old ladies and broke students. I watched as customers incurred crazy fees. The environment was needlessly competitive.
bad,"BOA Banking Centers were sales driven, daily sales coaching to nag clients to open credit cards, car loans or mortgages then at the end of the day you will need to report your sales to management.  You are frowned upon if you did not make a sale"
bad,You need to be strong in sales otherwise you'll get terminated. The branches are full of people who gossip and do not carry themselves professionally.
bad,This is not the best place to advance your career if you are in the Regulatory Compliance industry.  Old habits die hard at this organization.  Advancement is not promoted here.
bad,They keep the banking centers purposefully under staffed which causes a very stressful and high strung work environment. The pay isn't terrible but not worth the stress.
bad,"Forced to open accounts customers didn't need.  Definitely not concerned with the customers best interests in mind.  Had a great branch manager who saw things the way I did, other than that, not a great experience with BOA."
bad,"Getting yelled at all day by customers, to then get yelled at by bosses for not being good enough. During my time there, I found that the standard percent everyone was held to ( so many sales, so fast on phones etc.) was based on the best statistics from several different workers. This created an environment where anyone could be fired for not meeting an unreachable goal, which were all based on percents (I.e 1 bad call out of 100 = failed statistics)."
bad,Poor management selection due to no where to go other than management and most should not be in a management position. Raises if you got one were very low and then taken back from you after you were given one and told your salary has been capped.
bad,You work with an old culture that encourages harassment and  bullying. They will work you to the t and never appreciate or make you feel of any value. Run by dinosaurs who fear change.
bad,company focus is completely on how much money can employee make towards the bottom line with little to no consideration for the employees who do the work.  Company has thrown away quality employees and hired cheap staff to pad profits.  Does not operate with normal ethics.
bad,"Contractor on a project. Rate was stupid-generous and the project itself straightforward, but I worked with some strange folks, who were mostly too busy spinning within their own individual hamster wheels to actually work together or communicate across teams. I'd not been in such a cliquish and passive/aggressive environment since I was in high school. I worked my tail off on my own time to overcome the many obstacles in my path, but in the end still got thrown under the bus and kicked to the curb. By far the shortest and strangest gig I've ever had. Happy it's over."
bad,Not a fan but don't want to burn bridges! Upper management are bad. Company isn't sure what direction to lead their employees.
bad,"Very process oriented, management doesn't provide support when needed."
bad,"Bank of America has lost the culture of assisting their customers and replaced it with a very mundane sense of lost duty. You don't know what to feel when you are told to tell people that it's your fault that you pay any insane fees for services that should come natural. When you leave customers with a smile, it's not appreciated by management. I remember that being told to not smile so much on the phone with the customer. I was even written up for telling customers to ""have an awesome day"", after being told not to say that for so long. The craziest part is that I maintained one of the highest ratings in the building for customer appreciation. I was even visited by the regional manager and advised that he had been hearing about my success with the customers and to keep up the great work. I don't understand how that contradiction could continue, but it did and, for that, they are a horrible company who cares about the money. They could care less for their employees and the customers, just as long as they get money out of them in one way or another."
bad,poor company to work for.hostile management. they love to threat employees every day and have an unpleasant work environment.
bad,"No job stability, lay off people at least once a year. "
bad,"I give this company a poor rating and don't recommend anyone work for them.  Terrible culture, terrible advancement opportunities, treat highly qualified, extremely knowledgeable employees like badly behaved third-graders.  Don't do it."
bad,I don't really remember a lot. It was a long time ago that I worked there. I like helping people and being in customer service. The only down side I remember is working with irate customers.
bad,Work culture promotes favoritism. Not a nurturing environment for all to reach ambitious goals. The workload is heavy and when analyst goes above and beyond the only response given is do it again! Deprives employee of basic human respect and left a bad taste in my mouth.
bad,"Got my licenses.  Learned about their culture. The workers are much better than their management. Overall, got me back to the job market and know better what that company is like."
bad,"Unfortunately, what was once a fun, productive, admirable place to work has turned into something far less.  There is an incredible lack of leadership which allows for people in subordinate roles to feel they are entitled to more than they are.  There is a great deal of turnover with both management and support staff, and a lack of understanding when it comes to work/life balance."
bad,"Bank of America has been a great place for benefits and pay. But that's about it. everything else is an aggressive working environment. They DO NOT like when you take FMLA even though you have a legal right to. Every time someone I know goes on an FMLA, when they return, the managers fish for things to reprimand you for. eventual you'll end up without a job."
bad,"Continual layoffs, the best employees with tenure are being let go.  Zero job security or loyalty."
bad,No one cares about customer service anymore BOA makes u try to manipulate people into opening accts and applying for credit cards that they don't need totally unethical practices.
bad,"I enjoyed working for Bank of America, I was the Assistant Manager at one of the largest Banking Centers in our Market. We had a great staff that was like a second family to me. Everyone worked well under pressure."
bad,"In the several years i worked there overtime for management was simply expected and necessary to complete basic job functions."
bad,The banking center at Piedmont Parkway is by far the worst location. They have poor management.  Every year whole departments are shut down. Advancement is not based on skill set or knowledge but rather who you know. Bathrooms are disgusting at all times. Pay for performance is a joke.
bad,The co workers I got along with and the management staff was there to provide support at all times.  I took inbound customer service calls for a bank.  The calls ranged from balance inquiries to ordering checks.  The most enjoyable part of this job was helping customers
bad,"was a wonderful company to work for until they purchased Countrywide. Countrywide made bad loans (sub prime), had bad computer programs(fossil) and bad management (wardens). Bank of America welcomed this disaster with open arms and ruined it's reputation, lost their good employees and all respect from customers. So bad that this division has been closed in Jacksonville."
bad,A typical day meant working 12+ hours with minimal breaks and feeling unappreciated. The resources were good for doing my job but the support to get my job completed was nonexistent. Everyone was underwater. The work-life balance didn't exist. The workload was overwhelming and management was less than sympathetic. Turnover went through the roof as we tried to give feedback about the model of our set up but no one cared. If you were a complainer you were given bad jobs or cases to work on. There were the favorites of the team and those people got the special projects and committee roles. It was very political and like being in high school all over again. Very sad because it's a great company. Too bad I had to work in a group and with a group of people that made it miserable.
bad,"The work day normally begins at 7:30 or earlier, and may not end until 10pm, which includes both working in the office, as well as again at home.  I have learned much about diverse way of thinking as well as leadership.  Particularly, leadership skills demonstrated from Sr Execs not necessarily understanding the actual work completed by employees, but criticizing the same and harshly at times.  The hardest part of the job is the constant daily change that does not reflect in procedures and processes that are publicized for the employees to follow.  Therefore, if there becomes an issue, as management, we are to coach the employee, however, we have not given them clear understanding, proper training, nor the procedures to complete their work correctly.  The most enjoyable aspect of my job is always the employees who work for me because they will always put their best foot forward, as well as attempt to contribute in any ways they can.  I have always wanted to protect and serve the employees that work for me because normally they take care of the work, so that I may take care of them.  I always want to do the best I can for the employees that work for and with me, as well as the clients and customers of the organization I work for.  It would be commendable if the company matched those same ""wants."""
bad,Every client that came in was mad about something every day. No one would do anything to help anyone. Micromanaged and handcuffed with everything you try to accomplish. Horrable place to work.
bad,"Poor leadership, not enough compensation for the work to be performed, takes too much time to get through decision making process, too many layers of leadership not required."
bad,"worked in the area of credit card lending/collections/customer service for 22 years,  low morale, senior management only concerned with numbers and not the people who for the company, Management taking steps to cut costs by eliminating tenured associates"
bad,"Nepotism in the workplace, based more on who you know rather than your work performance and seniority.  Management caters to complainers and no holiday recognition.  Very corporate."
bad,Overall the job itself and the tellers i worked with was great. Management and the company is a whole different story. Constantly changing managers and never knowing what direction the company is heading. One month your told to advise or push customers toward this product and the next its something else. They would also cater too much to the wealthy. In my experience BOA does not care for the individual .
bad,"The only good thing about this place is that it pays my bills, and even that is on a tight budget. The work itself isn't very hard but management and all the higher ups make working there comfortably impossible. They don't care about their employees at all. All they care about is sales and revenue. Its a struggle getting up to go to work every morning because the work day is so hostile."
bad,Now concerned for the customer nor for fellow workers.  Building was dirty.  An overall air of superiority with no justification demonstrated by skill or ability.
bad,"BofA does not have a work/life balance. In a management position, as well as mywork, or work from home positions, the expectations are unrealistic. The workload is unbearable. There are tons of associates that are frequently on LOA's for medical purposes related to the job."
bad,The training process was deficient and the management approach in many cases was unprofessional. Although my performance was good the management had no tools or skills to motivate the employees.
bad,"No support from supervisors, your hired thinking you will have a wonderful schedule and weekends off, support from managers, open door policy and NONE of that is true!! They make up rules as they go along, nothing is in writing! The managers talk bad about everyone from reps to upper management, the environment is unprofessional!"
bad,Unable to provide unbias review at this time. too many variables
bad,"Perhaps the worst employer I have ever had.  The salary and income potential is well below industry standards, and women are paid less than their male counterparts.  They expect you to sacrifice your free time to engage in prospecting outside of the bank, additional meetings that are uncompensated, and brow-beat customers during every meeting for additional revenue driving products which the client does not need.  The management is subpar and reactionary, rather than transformational in nature.  Every day felt like the worst day of my life"
bad,This is not an appropriate question to ask interviewees to answer about a previous employer.
bad,"Not at this time.  Management seem to be not very organized and there were confusing task that change much on a weekly basis."
bad,"consists of being glued to the computer, micromanaged, no encouragement from management, no advancement unless you willing to back stab or boot lick.   Felt like being in a sweat shop."
bad,"Co-workers were awesome, and very nice, every time I needed help they were there to support me. Teller manager was too stressed most of the time, assistant manager was a joke always seemed like he did not want to be there and had almost every weekend off. The manager would hardly even be there, and all three enjoyed writing the employees up. I've been to many banking centers and all the tellers would have chairs to sit in, we got our chairs taken away because a sick employee sat on the chair while helping a customer, this is not allowed when there is a customer there. So the manager came snatched the chair from under and wrote her up, so as you can tell it is a great place for employees to work and feel at home. So while we stood all day the teller manager, assistant manager and branch manager would sit comfortably in their office so there is definitely equality in the work place, this happened while there would be line to meet with one of them and they would sit inside the office and pretend they were having important discussions, when in reality they were talking to family or their friends about something, So as you can tell management really cares about the customers too. Teller manager would always have an attitude toward the regular customers and would yell at the tellers from the time to time, doesn't matter new or old. Also is you are in school they will definitely work with you on that (I said sarcastically), because of them I have missed many classes and have hurt my GPA they did not want to work with me, they even made a big issue that I was in school and said that"
bad,In the individual branches you have great people you can work with in which you can make it fun.  It is a very corporate based company who claims they care for customers and employees.  Customers are only treated well if they have a lot of money.  The goals they have set for employees in the centers are not realistic and are not easy to reach.  When it comes down to it employees arent treated well either.  The turnover rate for this company is outrageous.  The managers are pressured so much by the higher ups that they get very stressed and have no difference between their lives and work.  It then shows in the banking centers with the other coworkers and even the customers can see it sometimes.
bad,"Lots of files to process, changes on daily bases, Management change , overall not a fun place to work."
bad,"Challenging, Demanding career.  Work / Life balance was modest."
bad,"BOA Mortgage division is not a great place to work."
bad,"Document collections, I had 400 loans I had to touch on and keep current and get moved to underwriter"
bad,"Very good place to work with monthly incentives and food treats from time to time, good co-workers, the hardest part of the job was customer negative communication when faced with foreclosure(understandable ) Management were great team players always ready and willing to assist with employee needs to give the best demonstrated practices to enhance services for the customers."
bad,"Training was a joke.  You learn all this stuff and then get told not to use it.  Customer verification is so poor anyone could call and guess the information after a couple of hours.  I am surprised more accounts havent been defrauded.  One good FINRA audit or big lawsuit and this place will get shut down."
bad,Really Bad company to work for CEO needs a better understanding of the Banking industry.
bad,"Excellent work environment, great people to work with. Enjoyed assisting customers with their needs."
bad,"Data entry, dealing with clients. Working to deadlines. staff sometimes friendly. Very badly managed."
bad,"This is my personal opinion. It may differ from other associates still employed there, however I can say this place is terrible in all sense of the word. The pay isn't that bad, but there could be more incentives considering all the ""hats"" this position wears. My manager lacked professionalism and the team lacked morale, which is very sad since we had to spend so many hours together. The environment was so mediocre starting by the site lead who always walked around munching on something. This comment may sound absurd, however per policy no one was allowed food at the desk on top of not being allowed to have visible phone or paper ""clean desk"" policy. However, not her not only was she pigging out all day she walked around with her cell phone on hand. I believe she should've been the example. I am so grateful I am not there any longer and strongly believe for the pay you can find something with better working conditions if, you want actually stay and advance. This was a call center environment and I know what you're thinking all call centers are strict, but I have worked at others and it was more flexible. Again, this is just my opinion."
bad,"Wouldnt reccomend to anyone. sorry no more to say. A good point would be"" a happy employee leaves a happy company"""
bad,All over the place and not enough emphasis on investments and does not represent the program and they will have you opening up checking and savings account for 50 bucks.  Management makes up everything as they go and they do not have experience
bad,"Bank of America had excellent employee benefits..However, as for life balance and work environment...negative."
bad,"My work experience has been nothing but top notch. When I competed my college degree, I went right to the best company in the city and was hired on the spot. I was able to use the 1st two weeks of time asking all the best questions to learn as much as I could as quickly as possible. Working with the best of the best has made me an asset to every position I have had."
bad,"job is very stressful, treat employees like they are numbers. It is hard to move up unless beg someone. Cant trust managers."
bad,"I started working here in Oct 2012 in customer service.  We were informed not to worry about the layoff situations as we were essential to the Bank Of America team as being front line associates.  only 9 months into the employment the entire site was laid off so they could turn a profit by selling the building.  funny thing is the quarterly profits that were reported were very high and there was no legitimate reason to shut down the site and eliminate over 250 jobs"
bad,Horrible place to work. They take advantage of people and there is no job security.
bad,"not a good company to work for. individual management does not care about anyone, even customers."
bad,"Managers all ""hide"" in their offices or take extremely long lunches or ate always on ""conference calls."" Managers have no idea what they are doing and can't support their staff! Managers (am and bcm) never ""override"" transactions because they're afraid to take the lost. Rarely ever room for growth. Horrible company! Medical benefits are even worst! Pay, well you're lucky to even get a 2% increase annually. Too many employees (tellers, bankers, sss', tos') work their butts off and never get recognition. By the way, who makes an employee work a full 11 hour work day but makes them take a 3 hour lunch (so there's no overtime)?! That should be illegal!"
bad,"it a enjoyable job,it alot of work and alot of pressure,but over all it good a and my over all rating is a 10 for execellent"
bad,Customers are horrible. You are micromanaged. No one ever thanks you for your work. The stress is not worth the pay at all.
bad,The environment is unorganized with no management style or proper training for the position you are hired for. The is extreme prejudiced used in any type of promotion and very little opportunity to move up or out of the department. The technology is minimal and no formal manual to help you do your job well. Also pay is not comparable to other banks..
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers. The worst part is the managers they only engage in negativity and that aren't about seeing others grow in the company. Most of the management staff is very vindictive and all about themselves, its more of a do what i say not what i do enviroment and the managers are never held accountable (i'm only speaking from the location I work at). A typical day at work is checking voicemails, returning calls, getting four or more emails about the same thing from different managers, and completing work for other sites that never get there reports completed. Its a world were if you complete your work all the time on time you are rewarded with other peoples work. The ones who never do their work or never held accountable so they cycle continues. The only thing I've learned from working there is that I don't want to work for a company that doesn't care for their customers or their employees."
bad,Senior managment does a very poor job monitoring the behaviors of lower members of managment. Many associates are discriminated against for varying reasons which are not appropriate for any reason.
bad,asked for time of to take daughter to cardiologist and was told no. computed work time so that employees never worked overtime. They would have you work Monday thru Sunday but give you a day off during the week so that an employee would not incure overtime.
bad,Deadline after deadline. There is no room to move up. Co-workers stab you in the back. Management say very mean things. If you make too much money you will be laid off. If you have to take a leave for any reason including military you are likely to be laid off. Huge turnover rate.
bad,Bank of America Modification division is more concerned with the money received from the Federal Government paid on a per application basis than actually helping their customers retain their homes.
bad,"Collected, analyzed and interpreted all types of credit information on existing and prospective customers and portfolios."
bad,Skills and hard work is not rewarded. Politically driven atmosphere.
bad,"Work in a cubicle with a computer that has a database of defaulted home loans. Loans are put into your que and using a mathmatical formula to see if customer qualifies for a loan modification. If customer qualifies, you check Iportal, to see if customers paperwork is complete. Then, you download customers paperwork, and submit their modification package to an underwriter for approval. If not all there, you contact the customer relationship manager and have them contact customer to ask them to fax it in. The job is very structured, and tightly managed. If you are a sales and marketing type, this job is not for you. I have a background as a self employed mortgage broker, where I work independantly. This job had alot of structure and supervision, which I am not used to,"
bad,BofA tend to cost cut and this has an impact on the customers. They are not willing to spend anywhere near what they should on operations technology compared to Wells.
bad,Mangement was very poor Gave reviews every six mounths Mangement did not understand how to do half the job we were doing.We trained our self. If you did not have the training already.You were set fail.
bad,"You work from 7:30-6 every day - Monday thru Friday and also on Saturdays. Management is all about the numbers - and not about the people that work for them. They do have great benefits. They talk alot about having community ""ties"" - but they do not incent their employees to get involved in the community - and when you work 50-70 hours a week - it's hard to give back to the community and still have time for your family. There is no loyalty for long term employees - is all about what they can get out of you - not what you give to the company. Management changes yearly - burnt out or from realization that they are a number and nothing more. If you want great benefits - great place to be - but if you want to be valued as an employee and a person - not where you want to be."
bad,Great place to grow and learn. Lots of room for advancement. Hardest part is managing time.
bad,Co-workers were great.
bad,From a technology standpoint. This company overworked there employees and provide very minimal management support. Typically Technolgy teams are chopped around November/December for showing positive numbers on the books.
bad,"BOA was and is one of the worst companies that I worked for, horrible Management Practice, sub-par training, and ever changing comission policies. You could take 1000 great calls, for that 1 bad call,, you could be written up for!! Stay away!! at least the call center in East Providece, RI"
bad,"No matter which corporate building you work in, the same management is prevalent. They have no concern for their workers, and do not exercise professionalism at the least bit. Avoid this employer at all costs, job stability is very short and not worth the hourly rate they pay (which is decent). Holistically, this company is not a good employer."
bad,I have worked for this company for 7 months and already worked at 4 different locations. I did not signed up for a float position nor is it told to you that you will bounce around they just put you where they want and tell you without much notice. They don’t care about your work life balance. Only 1/2 hour lunch breaks even on 9-10 hour days
bad,"Not well train employees, lack of training, management ignore subordinates. Lack of communication between management and staff personnel.Frequently you can see internal problems between management staff. turn over rate is unbelievable 75%"
bad,"Morale is terrible, they treat people likre human garbage.  They have no management style and give employees no sense of purpose. My group never gave anybody positive feedback, only sressed the negative."
bad,"The work life balance might be good but you go home completely exhausted. All sales - systems don't work. Terrible management. This company will be the next Wells Fargo. It's all transactions and money and no relationships. They lie to you about how many Saturdays you work and how great the company is. Everyone at my banking center hates it, doesn't feel supported, feels even abused at times - they are all looking for other jobs. No culture, toxic environment, micromanagement. No time for break except for lunch. They work with skeleton crews to save money and force people to online banking. I've seen my manager lie several times to customers. People call in sick a lot because this place makes you sick! Do yourself a favor and don't entertain this place - don't bank here!!"
bad,You look fun in the beginning and now it just feels so dreadful working there the managers don't care they keep pollen on more and more work in don't wanna pay more. So much micro managin going on in this Place
bad,"B of A does not care about employees and treats them indifferent.  When I went to work for them, they were still rebuilding their reputation and status in the banking industry after being found guilty for “illegal business practices “ by the US government.  The worst experience of my entire career"
bad,"It is the worst company I have ever worked for . Managment is very political, they used and abuse you and there is no career advancement, stay away from this bank . They don’t care about their employee. This is like Wells Fargo ! But they put in behaviors to avoid law suit whoever gave them this idea or maybe idea they stole , upper manager is incompetent and so is the managers in the branch weigh no college degree"
bad,Nothing much to say. The general manager has proven himself to be untrustworthy as well as possessing an unfair management and communication approach towards African Americans.
bad,"I have no comment on this subject."
bad,Bank of America seems to make a real effort to hire the most incompetent managers on the face of the earth. They behave like children - picking personal little petty battles and issues just because they dislike an agent . The managers are so bad they’ve led me to misinform clients multiple times. I’m sure 1/2 of the upper managers there have no idea what they’re doing.
bad,"Experience and exposure was great. Management was inexperienced and selected unfairly. Instead of promoting by business performance; individuals were selected by how much the ""kissed up"" to upper management."
bad,"I have worked for many companies in my life, this is by far the absolute WORST company. You basically sign your life over to this company. THEY will move you to a branch that is on the other side of the city without notice.Thanks to them constantly moving me, I have had the luxury of working with many different associates who are all depressed, stressed, and anxious because they are miserable here.  Work/life balance is a complete joke because they refuse to staff banking centers. They spend time complaining about giving overtime but force you to work overtime. there is so much pressure to meet unrealistic goals and your sales goal go up every year. This company will also draw you in with ""growth opportunities"" but what they do is add to your workload, tell you it'll help you get promoted and leave you in the same position. If you treasure your happiness stay away from this company."
bad,Bank of America has no morality. They push so many products on its customers and they get angry at you for not selling enough. It makes the customers irate and is very awkward. Very slimy experience.
bad,"Management was horrible. You get written up for not meeting goals while your pipeline is clogged up with title issues of current B of A loans and you’re treated like you’re the blame for it when nobody knows what department to put you in touch with to resolve said title issue when they had originally recorded title in the wrong county. Never in my life was I aggressively looking for a job 6 months into it. When I gave notice, I was I couldn’t be happier. At the time I did, they were doing mandatory 50 hour work weeks, supervisor asked me when are you working your extra 10 hours, my reply, I’m not!"
bad,"When I started working at BofA, I was working with an amazing VP and amazing, smart and respectful team. Unfortunately, new management came and expectations without proper tools to complete the tasks placed employees on overload stress."
bad,"I was working at BOA full time for 3 months. How I made it that long, I don't know. The work environment is stressful. Back to back calls, with no time for a breath in between! I've worked at other call centers prior, and this is the WORST one! Don't take a job here unless you don't care about your weekends or nights, or unless you're just down right desperate! From day one, no clear rules were outlined about attendance and every time I would ask a question about it, I'd get a different answer!   No 5 minute cushion here like other call centers. Either you're on time for your shift, or you are late. Be prepared to hear about it too, but only after you actually are ""late"". No set information in regards to attendance either in the handbook either. It seems as if it is a free for all, and the rules are made up by the managers. Don't get me started on if you need to take a quick bathroom break while you're suppose to be on the phone. They treat you worse than a child here. You'll be watched like a hawk to see how long you were actually away off the phone. Anyway, I wound up quitting here, too much of a headache!"
bad,Empresa é apresentada como um ideal de vida. Tarefas diárias não são claramente expostas antes da contratação. Péssima experiência. Vc opta por dinheiro e não pela qualidade de vida. Colegas de trabalho se aproveitam de pessoas novas para empurrar trabalho. Não há cooperação. Gerentes de área omissos e debochados.
bad,"The management onsite were either retired or reserve military. The site was managed like a military site. All of my 60 coworkers had developmental issues. My immediate manager teased many of his team in a way that was just short of bullying and at times brought members of his team to tears. When he took that attitude with me, because I was older than fellow team members, I stood up for myself. As a result I was held back from advancement and pay raises, and was regarded as a threat to ""managerial authority"". I would be happy to address this personally with anyone who may want further information."
bad,Horrible Market  Management.  The Market Leaders have plenty work life balance but not the sales individuals in the Financial Centers.  Over Worked and under paid.
bad,"Some groups have a great culture, while others are led poorly and have a toxic culture.  Definitely depends on the group.  Hard to feel motivated with poor leadership and the constant push of do more with less."
bad,"The experience I had was management not leading you to the right path for you to succeed. Management did not education properly on production knowledge and policies and procedures, instead they pushed sales and referrals upon employees. I would also get reprimanded for not pushing products on clients. The manager wasn’t professional, Showed favoritisms in the financial center. Overtime isn’t required but I was scheduled overtime without my consent and worked 6 days straight since the beginning of my employment."
bad,it had amazing benefits and thats the only reason people stay the management is awful and encourages a toxic work environment by pitting team members against each other and instead of giving constructive criticism to help you succeed they put you down
bad,"Direct management was lazy , goals were high with no support from management. No recognition for people that over achieved their goals. Pay was low for experience and responsibilities. BofA needs better direct management. Leaders that want to help their team to meet their goals. There was favoritism within the teams, managers had favorites that ran the show per say."
bad,"If I had known I was being hired to be a designated sales rep and not a teller, I would have never taken the job. The title of the job is client service representative but it should be client SALES representative. You will most likely be the only teller working, people will complain about this. You are expected to constantly refer clients over to the relationship banker for credit card offers and home loans, auto loans, etc. Horrible job. You are a glorified cashier with sales goals."
bad,"Management became scattered and unorganized. Portfolio's were not evenly distributed throughout the department. Special privileges were given to those of equal or lesser rank. The bank was releasing employees due to relocations and reductions in force taking place throughout the entire organization. At a minimum of once a week, we were being called into special meetings only to be informed that another group or individual was being terminated, although promised in our most recent weekly meeting, no more reductions in force would be taking place."
bad,Corporate America at its worst. One is constantly reminded of their position in the Corporate Pecking Order. Play the Game or you are gone. Get the Customer off the phone!
bad,Branch culture is monotone and depressing. Management is completely out of touch with clients and associates. Opportunity for advancement has a concrete ceiling. Useless processes made to keep associates seemingly busy.
bad,"High turn over, no one stays at this company. there is no home/work life balance as stated in there job description. this is a poorly  managed company. even the customers hate this bank."
bad,Bank of America preaches in every meeting at at the beginning of every shift to make ever client interaction a positive one. In reality they want every client that is not a sale to be put on the phone with customer service. The sales goals were extremely high and upper management is is extremely pushy. All BOA cares about is sales numbers any way they can be had.
bad,"I didn't have a great tenure with BOA, while the interview process was very good, the culture around problem solving for customers was very poor... why would we sign people up for credit cards if they can afford to pay their mortgage?"
bad,"When i first started with Bank of America it was great, In was promoted many times . I wanted to learn about mortgage sales and loved my boss, however when econony was down I was nervous and decided to go back to branch banking."
bad,Bank of America has terrible management and no ethics when pushing for sales. They made the worst decision in corporate history by buying Countrywide Mortgage and then paid for their losses by making it impossible to reach bonuses
bad,"I worked in a call center as a wealth management client service agent specializing in credit card. The training was extremely lax for all the things required as a credit card agent, and additional training to fill in any knowledge gaps was non-existent."
bad,"Wonderful manager"
bad,"for this to be one of the largest banks , their pay was awful, $19,000 and $22,000 for the head teller, my main reason for leaving was the pay , I could not take care of my child on that income."
bad,"While BofA offered a competitive salary, it was the worse place I've worked at in all my 25+ years in mortgage banking.  Specifically the Home Equity department.  I cannot speak for other areas of the company.  I will just leave it at that."
bad,"Was hired a couple months back, the hiring manager knew the home loans department was going to be moved to Fort Worth, did not care to mention, so now after a few months I have to look for another job when I had turned down jobs because I was already hired here. Anyway; hours sucked, you basically work all day and have no social life, I was written up for missing training because I had kidney stones, they did not take my ER papers as docotors notes. After finishing training I was on the phones for a month and before I get comfortable enough to work with regular customer service calls I was thrown into training for Bankruptcy, Post Modification, Special Loans, and Recast, we only trained for four days and were expected to begin taking calls the following Monday. Managers don’t really help, if you have a question they direct you to Procedures(which are not user friendly) and if you had an escalation for example if a client is irate you would have to try to calm them down even if they had asked for a manager 2 times, you get so much push back from all other departments and managers, so basically you are on you’re own.... over all WORST place I have ever worked at."
bad,"I started with a small bank, National Bank of Commerce and after 23 years of buy outs and mergers, wound up with Bank of America.  This organization came in with a vengeance and uprooted a successful company.  The one on one relationship with customers became a ""sales motivated"" agenda, which I understand is important to any company.  But it was just being taken to an extreme."
bad,"A local culture working environment. "
bad,"Once Bank of America bought MBNA, the culture changed and became a place where employees were not valued as people. All the benefits that MBNA provided were stripped and the atmosphere was terrible and stressful"
bad,Bank of America does not support their employees in advancement. They will tell you they will take care of you but they don't in the long run. Will leave you hanging.
bad,"It was nothing but stress. They push you to sell, sell, sell. Whether the customer needs or wants to product, you have a quota to meet and you have to do it or lose your job! It was awful, I hated going into work by the end."
bad,"Horrible company violates laws - no lunch given to employees.  Revolving door of managers, every year there’s a major reorganization.  Don’t work at this company more than 1 or 2 years."
bad,management is definitely not the best. a lot of favoritism and discrimination goes on and is unaddressed and ignored even when proof is brought to HR and superiors. Retaliation and penalties fall upon those who blow the whistle
bad,"hostile and stressful "
bad,"If you want to work for a company that has no idea what it wants to be then this is the place. I was an FCOM and found that as a manager you get little to no help, lots of turnover with employees, little to no training. (Point and click modules only) "
bad,"I worked in a stressful environment being harassed and mistreated daily by management.  Being passed over for raised and empty promises for raises, promotions and bonuses."
bad,"It is not a very good place to work, there is a lot of favoritism from management and no support from HR for it. They never look into why high turn-over."
bad,"As a home retention specialist, helping my customers was my number one goal to assist with providing homeowners revised mortgage loans for those who were unable to continue to pay their mortgage. It was extremely frustrating, because the making home affordable program was difficult to materialize for most.  Phone calls made to collect payment was specifically troubling, having to contact borrowers who have had their mortgage payment triple and desperately attempting to not lose their homes was frustrating for both the customer and myself.  It was a grid lock system that I feel was just to cover up all of the mistakes the financial sector made during the global financial crisis in 2007."
bad,I took this job sight unseen without the benefit of meeting the entire team I was to work with.  This proved to be critical in maintaining a suitable working environment.
bad,unproductive working environment  management micromanaged you very stressful managers  unfriendly unable to communicate or my friends with your neighbors very hostile
bad,"My specific experience at BOA was not pleasant.  In my observation management did not attempt to make employees better, it was rather a supervising environment rather than a managing environment."
bad,"If you want to work for a bank like Wells Fargo, Bank of America is the place for you.  Unrealistic sales goals and too much stress.  Managers threaten to make you stay late if you don't sell credit cards to at least 25% of customers with offers and if you don't make at least 10 calls a day.  Managers make you work Saturdays at other branches if your branch is closed on Saturdays; terrible work life balance.  Federal government needs to punish Bank of America like was done with Wells Fargo."
bad,"micromanagement company with super aggressive sales that does not care about the customer but only to make the sale. management is worst they pressure sales but hide it behind ""helping customers achieve their financial goals"""
bad,Advancement within the company was based largely on whether the employee shared a religion/gender/ethnic background with the hiring manager.  Work hours varied from 10 to 16 hours daily due to lack of efficiency in managing the workflow.Loud verbal disagreements were common place.  Management infighting turned into an ongoing event that drove several employees away from the company.
bad,"Management and Human Resources are not concerned about employees, do not mentor, train , no new hire support. Poor leadership decisions, incompetent leaders,  very cut throat and demanding work environment. Company is top heavy in leadership and not enough workers to accommodate customers. Management quick to blame employees for company lack of personnel to assist customers, pressure to sell products to clients is very high."
bad,"This company could careless about any employee, the management is horrible, and will do anything to make you look bad, I would rather die than work for this mafia organization again."
bad,"I was employed with Bank of America for over 13 years, but in the last 3-4 years the culture in the company has been on a steady decline.  Associate satisfaction results were the worst they have every been in my experience and very qualified people were leaving left and right.  I would not recommend this company to job searchers."
bad,Senior management was always changing and so where directives.  Goals were always unclear and management struggled to deliver answers or direction.  Environment was always in a state of chaos.
bad,"This is the bank of opportunity. Opportunities to deceive and dismiss good employees and customers.  My job came with 3 weeks of paid vacation and great health insurance. My job ended with no notice, right after I was given a promotion and hadn't so much as been written up during my entire tenure."
bad,"Leadership unclear on how to implement its strategy"
bad,"Company provided many leads, but not a lot of quality leads.  Company expected many additional hours of work outside of daily hours for which I was not fairly compensated."
bad,Very unethical place to work. They are not putting the customers interests first. The management turns a blind eye to its employees on all the ethics violations.
bad,I was never formally trained to do the job for which I was hired. I was shuffled around and finally quite literally stuck in a corner.  The management team when I was hired was abruptly fired for misconduct.  The new management team was less than enthusiastic or helpful.
bad,"Bank of America is an extremely stressful place to work.  Management sets high sales goals that are very difficult to attain.  When not obtained, great pressure is applied by managers.  "
bad,Very poorly managed for the Financial Adviser and their assistants.  I love the job enjoyed helping my Financial Advisers and our clients with solving any problems they may have.
bad,"good place to start but management is not good, Overall I would suggest to start here but its stressful. If you are a fun and hard working person you will find your place."
bad,"If you want to make a change (this decade), forget it."
bad,"I have been working at Bank of America several times in my career and each time it has been terrible.  They are the largest employer  and they take advantage of it .  Every year they layoff both contractors and employee to meet their yearly numbers and then rehire folks the following year.  At least twice a year they require a mandatory 2 week furlough (2 weeks without pay) from contractors.  They are known for their ""all hands"" meeting at 4:00 on a Friday for their lay-off announcements.  This has caused a poor work ethic culture.  "
bad,"Complete waste of business.  Horrible customer service.  No one wanted to work there."
bad,This place is by far the worst. They talk about family and community yet it's nothing like that. They treat their tellers the worst and pay them the worst. I was the only teller at one point with lines to the door and I was yelled at and treated horribly and management sat there and did nothing. They don't care about anything but sales. They offer all these extra benefits but if you want to use them they block you with various excuses even though they are suppose to be part of your benefits. The health and daycare benefits are the only ones I enjoyed and thought were great.
bad,"Working as a fraud analyst at bank of America is very stressful. Management does not seem to understand that moral needs to either match or overcome the negativity that comes with taking most calls. The customers often complain about the service and feel that no one cares. In reality, we care a great deal but there is not much that we can do with the tools that we are given. Going outside of ""policies"" for the convenience of the customer is frowned upon. This is understandable but no one is trying to change rules or break regulations. We just try to make better decisions on the behalf of the customer with what little wiggle room we have. We understand very well when there is some room to break rules with little to no consequences and when it is not ok."
bad,"Inbound calls all day for fraud detection, fraud claims initiation, and detailed card maintenance, with emphasis on strict authentication procedures.  Providing positive customer service became more of a priority over my time at the position.  I learned how to communicate to angry customers whose credit cards were blocked by our automated detection software.  I am very good at de-escalating angry customers.  I also was very good at detecting perpetrators calling in to impersonate customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with other wonderful fraud analysts."
bad,"Horrible company prided on extreme judgements, micro managing, and the constriction of work life balance. Managing with fear lacking modern culture and diversity in the races and religion of employees ,there is absolutely no diversity . Extremely outdated technology. Employees are coached to rate the company high on company internal surveys or face disciplinary action. Not a company that inspires any change or positive growth overall with the exception of the paid salary and benefits. Not an equal rights opportunity employer."
bad,The culture was a mix of life long employees and revolving door.  It was everyone for themselves.  Typical day was spent mostly doing paperwork and customer service.
bad,"The call center I worked in seemed to focus on the wrong metrics, placing more weight on speed and not caring about the customers on the other side of the phone."
bad,Very Poor treatment of Employees and disrespectful when communicating. They have a nonchalant attitude and if you can't handle it then they tell you to your face there is the door you can leave at anytime.
bad,"Statistically Impossible call metrics and sales goals with constant micro managing and overall hostile working environment.  Changed my outlook on work and I only hope I can go back to the way I was before. On the plus side, it was so bad that in comparison my next gig should be great with minimal effort"
bad,"All they want you to do is get the sales regardless of the situation the customers may be in, they don't care and if you don't get the sales you lose your job, its a do or lose situation."
bad,"Unfortunately, I had the worst, most condescending, abusive, threatening and disrespectful boss. Her reputation was known throughout the Legal Department but both the Head of Legal and Human Resources looked the other way when they received statements from more than one employee regarding her abuse. It is totally unacceptable to have employees who prey on those they supervise."
bad,Moral is extremely low at BofA- hundreds of employees are uncertain about their jobs and limited career advancement opportunities.
bad,"Basic financial pressure cooker. "
bad,"Company does not care about their workers. Treat you like a number, have a click inside the company that covers for mistreatment and discrimination."
bad,Bank of America leaders were not able to hide behind an email to let people know they lost their jobs. I understand its a difficult task but you have to deliver the message better.
bad,"Unreasonable expectations.  Everyone threatened with their jobs daily in this hard core sales environment.  You can be a hero for months, but if you miss sales quotas briefly, expect serious backlash.  Company claims Customer satisfaction is the driving force, not so.... culture strives to sell customers products they do not need."
bad,You will learn how to quickly learn how to dissect problems over the phone. If you survive the 1st 30 days on the phone you will have gained patience. This skill you can take to your next company as process improvements you may suggest will largely be ignored. As a contractor expect to work every holiday with one exception to choice between working a shift on either Christmas or Thanksgiving. Bring a deck of cards on those days or a book to read.
bad,they don't appreciate their employees. they keep cutting hours and people the job is easy but they make so hard. you have to work 6 days depending who you work with and they don;t want to pay overtime.
bad,"Simple. The call center managers didnt even know how to use excel formulas. BoA mortgage recovery was very easy, except the part where they wanted you to call the customer over and over for the same documents they have already provided.... we called it stall tactics and BoA was famous for it. Very few ""humans"" worked there."
bad,"Great benefits, not a positive employee work environment, very hierarchy driven.  Employees not valued told on a very regular basis how easily they can be replaced."
bad,"poor management operations, no employee support nor development. Good team work between employee. Go employee direction for employee developments. Customer service direction and expectation was bad. Limited ability to assist costumers."
bad,"Extremely high stress value and minimal compensation.  Why is it that start up companies pay almost twice as much as one of the most powerful companies in the world?"
bad,Dont waste your time end of the story. BOA is simply the worst company I've ever worked for because the customer doesn't coe first. They consider each customer as another number......
bad,"l was employed at Bank of America Chicago.  Originally I worked for Lasalle National Bank.  Bank of America Chicago brought Lasalle National Bank, and I kept my job.  Later on my department was closed, and my job went to Dallas Texas.  My day was complete, I debited and credited customers account, that kept my date busy.  I also had to bring the system up daily, every two hours we balance, and at the end of the day we closed the system Stucky.  I learned how to manage my time effectively, my co-worker dependent on me finishing balancing so they could continue with their daily work.  The hardest part of the job was being out of balance and finding out why.  Knowing that I could back-up every thing that I did to the customers accounts and every thing that I did, and  having everything documented, that I processed."
bad,"An awful company to work for. The best part about the job is my co-workers, and our large break room. The company does not care about the underdogs (a.k.a tellers)."
bad,"I worked for them for 7yrs Got promoted, then they eliminated my position. Sales and affluent customers is all that matters to them."
bad,"decisions are made based upon political and personal motivation.  minimal job security with constant lay offs. disorganized, poor technology"
bad,"Management sucks to the core!! They say they will help you when you're on your own but really, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!!  There is no assistance like a lead to ask any questions to.  Time off is a joke. I am constantly hounded by my supervisor to get the customer off the phone asap.  Do whatever I have to do to get the customer off the phone.  You're not to ask if theres anything else to assist with because thats like ""opening up a whole new can of worms"" and you always have to keep your talk time as low as possible.  That is not in my belief system and I think that is the absolute worst.  I'd rather take as much time needed to help the customer in every aspect possible but instead we are encouraged to ""dump em, cold transfer em, just get em off your line""  Don't apply here, they'll suck the soul right out of your entire life!"
bad,Management work you like slaves- they do not want to pay you- lots of favoritism- stress-and drama!!! Very unprofessional! Worst years of my life!
bad,Plenty of resources but management and the brand was weak. Co-workers were nice but we barely came together because our mandate was to be out in the field.
bad,"Because they have thrown together so many different companies there is a huge amount of redundancy.  One guy I knew had three different jobs in one year -- he would get one, it would go way, he'd get another...."
bad,Management based environment. If you want to be ridiculed and not motivated to succeed. Go for it.
bad,"BofA was initially a good job to start of from high school, but the senior management in the Simi Valley area selectively harass the employees that handles the mail. The people who work in that sector are minorities, so it makes me question her judgment of character. The other senior manager seem to be more courteous and fair to his employees in the other sector of the bank vault."
bad,"5000 customers flow per week, only two bankers. We were never staffed with enough managers...I think we went through about 9 managers that were fired, quit or transferred. No support, no help from district managers, to busy trying to save their jobs. Making customers mad about fees and mortgages and then expect us to sell on Monday! Right!!!"
bad,Senior Management lost touch with its employees like the US government has with the citizens of the US. Most enjoyable part of the day is when it's over to go home to the family.
bad,"Just not happy anymore. The company is fine, but management is not fair, or willing to work for the associate."
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone! There is little to no room for advancement. HR does not follow through/investigate complaints, instead they give management ammunition to retaliate against employees. Management condones and encourages a hostile work environment."
bad,The location closed - certain employees were targeted - the office lost 26 employees due to management
bad,While I worked there as a collateral analyst someone had their things stolen.
bad,"Customer Relationship Manager (current employee) Buffalo area."
bad,"A typical day at Bank of America consist of about 80 calls to 90 a day. Inbound and outbound call. I have learned to be consistent and follow up on all follow-ups and calls.  My co-workers were the best if nothing else we all supported and helped each other .  The hardest part of my job was not having the support from management when needed. Also being apart of the Post modification /Special loan que  very hard to get vacation approved ."
bad,Terrible place to work.  More concerned about following meaningless protocols and silly guidelines than actual productivity.
bad,Success depends on department and management. My trainers and training managers were awesome but then I got transferred to team lead who was drunk with ignorance.10 hour shifts and below average pay while they bring in temps and pay significantly more to do the same job. Stated before hiring they pay monthly when they absolutely do not
bad,"Blind calls for servicing, JD power certified call center, client delight is most focus of daily business"
bad,This is not exactly your dream job. The pay is not what it should be especially if you have prior customer service experience. You can only get a raise once a year and depends on if you pass several areas of evaluation ! The calls are back to back all day long and the large majority of the customers who call are very angry due to the reputation of the bank and numerous escalation occur. They attendance policy is a joke because you receive occurences but you can only receive 5 for the year before you get the axe. Even if your out sick you still get dinged for that ! The managers are a joke and no one wants to help...as soon as they see you coming they either roll their eyes or suddenly become busy. Any little minor thing can get you fired so pretty much I would steer clear of this place unless you absolutely need a job 
bad,They weren't too understandable /lenient on employee personal domestic issues... I was going through the toughest time in my marriage ; they wouldn't work with me on attendance although I performed at an exceptional rate... Management was a team of women who had extensive history and ran the dept with a tight leash. It would have been a great tenure opportunity for me and a great asset for them had of they been more open to understand and allow me to work something out.
bad,BofA is a terrible company and to be avoided at all costs. The referrals goals for employees are ridiculous. They offer advancement but at no increase in salary.
bad,"Working at Bank of America Call center in Greensboro NC was a negative experience for me. It was the worst company I ever worked for I never had a problem before. I worked for the company for three years. At first I could not understand why so many employees hated working for the company. I quickly learned that everyone wasn't stressed b/c of the work or the customers but b/c of managements bad behavior. I was hired in a group of 17 people in 2008 and currently no one is still employed with the company. Bank of America has a attendance policy of only 6 unscheduled absences (including excused and unexcused) in a revolving year. This proved to be impossible for many parents of small children such as myself. Attendance was the number 1 reason for people to be fired. A coworker was fired after being absent her 6th time after being hit by a car in the parking lot! I'm a positive person and a optimist I believe that was the only reason I lasted that long. Also people are promoted not always on skill, knowledge base and performance but often because they are friends with people in management. I was often shocked on how misinformed and uneducated supervisors were."
bad,"Would receive subpoenas in the morning, some days you could get up to 7 or more which doesn't seem alot but you have ones that you are still working on from previous days. Some subpoenas go on for months. Not only did you research out the subpoenas you had to make sure you were in there time frame and mail them out. Hardest part of the job was management did not listen when there was a need for overtime. I enjoyed dealing with the law enforcement, attorneys, the government. I had many great co workers and some were more interested in shopping on the computer especially when they were suppose to be our leader."
bad,Bank of America is a joke. People who are promoted to management positions don't know what they are doing and they make sure they get rid of the qualified people below them.
bad,"A typical day at Bank of America as a Loan Processor involves 200% productivity when 100% is all that is realistic. Training is usually long class room hours with minimal hands on for about 6 weeks. Monthly goals are constantly increased so you can expect a 60-80 hour work week. Some of the management has no respect for those under them. For example when you make an error they will shout over the cubes from a few rows over and call you out instead of talking to you personally about it and explain how to fix the issue. Most of the VP's only care about numbers and there job security so there is a high turnover. There are a few all star managers and VP's who are constantly trying to help you in every way they can if you lucky enough to stay on their teams. When issues come up some VP's ignore the problem. I.E. A manager was only at work 50% of the time from when you started with the company and is high on pills causing them to be unresponsive. This is an actual situation that was apparent and ignored by upper management when this concern was mentioned. The systems for processing refinances do not support the functions needed. Half of your day is trouble shooting, talking to support, or trying to do a work around to make things work. When the systems are down for a couple days you are told that this is not an excuse not to hit your monthly goal. The co-workers are your biggest help and usually a good group of people. Over all the atmosphere is free and you can talk with others. There are also fun events and opportunities to be involved in different ways if you can find the time."
bad,"I answered inbound calls all day. The metric system that was used for sales rewards, was taken advantage of by co workers. Helping customers resolve a complex issue was an exciting challenge for me. The hardest part was the amount of unsatisfied customers with there bank of choice."
bad,"They would have another co-worker train you and they would not want to train you, but would say you was not learning the work. So co-workers should not train people. Management was not very nice. I did not feel comfortable going to management about my trainer, because the manager was friends with the trainer. They would let you go without telling you why or what had happen. Co-workers did not want to help you when needed."
bad,A simply unprofessional work environment.Your training doesn't prepare you for what your getting into. The company is simply obsessed with making more money at any expense.
bad,The worst place to work for. Management was extremely unprofessional and did not take their employees serious.
bad,"Take this job, if you need the paycheck."
bad,Manager's totally unrealist with training and managing teams in Bankruptcy Department. Too much political ties and favoritism for job advancement. Not the best for those who want to play by the rules.
bad,"Bank of America tries to compensate with pay and benefits however, it is not worth the horrible culture they practice on a daily basis. This place has high stressful sales goals that are unrealistic and eventually create division amongst the team. There is no work life balance, you will work countless hours and have your vacation time assigned to you."
bad,"While working and achieving goals, the Co. gives incentives.  If struggling, upper management makes sure you act unethical by telling you to call your friends and family to come over and open accounts to make sure you're in green, you make your quarterly goals. "
bad,Ive had to runs with Bank of America. They are a good company but I have experienced racial instances where I should have said something but did not .
bad,"You get great benefits and vacation time. You basically sell your soul for this. Management is horrible and senior management is awful. The company does not care about you as a person. You’re literally assigned a person number and that’s all you are to anyone above you - a number. God forbid you get sick and need to take a leave of absence that you’re allowed after being there for a year - you’ll be gone in a heartbeat - I’ve seen it happen with so many great associates. All they care about is call volume and how much work they can squeeze out of you. You will basically be doing the work of three people and getting paid garbage for it. Most departments are not willing to work with you if you need to change your scheduled time. You have to put in a request for it and hope that it gets approved. Many departments also do “schedule optimizations” based on your performance. When they re-evaluate their call volumes, they make you bid on a brand spankin new schedule and if you’re not a top performer, you’re not getting the schedule you want/need. Overall, just a horrible company to work for."
bad,Loved my job. Did it well. I had to leave because the manager of the bank was unethical. Had an romantic affair with my sales manager.  They were both married. Unethical management...They were making decisions based on ... Personal relationship.
bad,"Big changes are happening with Bank of America and their financial centers. Pushed to give more than compensated and forced to be in situations that were unhealthy to the employees. "
bad,"Everyone in management is either single or divorced.  The job revolves around life.  If on vacation, leave the cell phone at home.  Advancement in career is slow."
bad,"The SWFL market is a terrible market to have worked in. The market leadership couldn’t be trusted, used fear and intimidation tactics instead of leading. Provided little support through training. Made promises they never followed through with. Two of the market leaders were sexist, and played favorites."
bad,"Product pushing is all the matters. Training is a false front - the only thing that matters is sales. Customer's wife or husband passed away? ""What did you get?"" Customer can be upset due to fraud and you're expected to calm them down, get a 10 survey, and get sales from them. "
bad,They forced tellers to sell and open accounts and when they didn’t they got written up. Training at the time was horrible and the manager made you feel less of a person not to mention they would allow customers to speak to employees in a rude manner I for one had to deal with people ignorance. I didn’t feel safe nor wanted there. So when I was fired unfairly I was happy about it. Sad but so true.
bad,under paid for the years of service and experience I had. No growth unfair treatment; I had been with the company for 28 years and had got laid off; People I had train was making more money than I was and I been with the company all these years.
bad,"Its a terrible place to work, They tell you to learn your first year but any mistakes you make could mean your job. The management all teach you different ways to do thing but you then find out from  coorparate that your not suppose to do things the way management teaches you then they fire you for doing things the way they taught. I work there 4 months and got fired for mistaking mixing a 100.00 dollar bill in with my 20s."
bad,My days in the call center were great however when I went to a branch that all changed and wouldn't recommend it to anyone they micromanage you to the bone and though they close at 4pm your still stuck there for meeting after meeting. Plus your privacy isn't protected and if you speak up about anything it all gets turned back to you as if you're the problem.  Worst experience I've ever had with an employer
bad,Management at this particular branch was toxic and I would not recommend anyone work there. Turnover is always at a high level and people cannot wait to leave that particular location.
bad,"It's all about  surveys to offer to the clients, make the almost impossble goals. Micromanagement is to the extreme. Most of the days you don't even have time to take your 30 minutes lunch. I do not recommend working for this company."
bad,"Negative environment, mismanaged by market leaders, insufficiently staffed at all branches.  Worst work experience of my banking career.  Only good thing was pay/benefits."
bad,Not what you think it is. Extremely excited to work for them but within the first week had to call HR for hostility. Wouldn’t recommend. Place can become toxic starting from higher up. Felt I was becoming unethical by the way I was being pressured to hit my sales goals
bad,I was a temp..management treated temps so badly. We were excluded from all company functions other than making us work all the hours permanents would not work. We were allowed 2 days a month off and that had to be scheduled or we were threatened with termination..seems like no matter how hard we tried it was never good enough.
bad,"Was a loyal employee  for over 15 years with promotions during tenure. "
bad,"It didn't take long during my 6-7 weeks of training for me to realize that this job wouldn't turn into a career. 95% of my training was virtual with a trainer based in California (very sweet lady). The other 5% was with an internal rep. This is a non-paper environment so there will be no note-taking, nor will you be giving handouts to refer to EVERYTHING is slideshow presentations or internal web-based material....oh and the simulators don't work.this is a learn as you go structure or fail until they place you on corrective action. You are micro-managed from training on forward, there is absolutely no transparency or flexibility. They're known for their high turnover rate, literally, there is a new training class every 8 weeks so trust me when I say you are not seen as an individual just a seat to be filled until you quit. The ""bonus"" isn't hard to obtain HOWEVER if you can't get a minimum of 35 perfect surveys and call handle time under 360 kiss that money goodbye. Shift bids are performanced based even for new hires (if you have small children don't even apply you'll get a terrible shift and regret it). A typical day is logging into your system that most of the time won't work or freezes frequently, calls are back to back with customers who want fees waived, don't understand corporate billing, and had their cards compromised and didn't get a notification until 2 weeks later when we finally shut the card down (fishy much). Most of your calls you will be lying through your teeth because there is never a straight forward answer to be given, your support chat will give you guesstimate"
bad,"If u enjoy answering over 300 calls a day non-stop, with a lousy fast 30 minute lunch break and having your calls monitored, and played back for you and your lousy manager to hear when a customer complains, or when your lousy manager is monitoring your calls because he thinks you're a lousy customer service representative then this job is for YOU!"
bad,"Very stressful environment. Constant pressure for higher performance.  Constantly berated by customers, with managers steering away from escalated calls."
bad,"I worked for BAML for 20 years, I was in the hospital with my 12 year old son who is terminally ill and my supervisor called me on my cell while I was at the hospital with my son to tell me they terminated my position. At times I worked 80 hours a week and once I could no longer continue those hours I was let go along with a number of my other colleagues all of whom had 15+ years of service- nice way to reward dedicated employees, best part was the day after my position being ""eliminated"" all our jobs were posted the following day to hire replacement staff, I'm sure because they can hire kids fresh out of college for half the rate. No company loyalty."
bad,"Good in early years, not so much now, benefits good,free parking,expectation to work long hours without time back, would be better to have more engaged management"
bad,"Need to train management at higher standards with basic College Degree, most only have high school. Therefore, they lack ethics, job training, skills, public speaking and social conduct engaging to say the least. If you are educated with school degrees DO NOT waste your time & career, executives don’t care about that. Only sales, sales, sales."
bad,My experience working with Bank of America was not very great! I would say this was probably was the worst job experience I encountered. As the management played a major part in my bad experience the culture was not very tasteful.
bad,Variable compensation will change any time durning the production period.  Management forced give out letter easily because it will lower the compensation.
bad,"Worked for the company for over 5 years. What once was a great company to work for has become the worst. There is no more work/life balance, your results are never good enough (even if you’ve met all of your numbers), and good luck actually getting time off approved. Management takes no responsibility when things aren’t going well, and blames the team for everything but will gladly take sole credit when things are better. Constant mixed signals and walking on eggshells.  No privacy either, as coworkers and management openly talk about other associates, even in front of clients. "
bad,overall job was very easy but tedious. Requires lots of repeated task and customer service skills while being on camera for all interactions. Each interaction was also recorded
bad,"Assisted consumer and business customers with transacations, crossed sale products, keep tracker of referals and sales and assisted customers in safe deposit box and other internal operations."
bad,"Unethical expectations, expected sales over customer experience, poor management, "
bad,"Bank of America took over from Countrywide.  They brought in a team to eliminate higher paid positions without paying severance pay.  HR department was for the new management team.  No assistance to employee.  New manager did best to get me out without paying severance. Screamed at me within two inches of my face for several hours every day, threw her mouse at me, tried to run me over in the parking lot - all reported to HR with documentation, exhibits and witnesses. No action. HR aware and supported management 'scare' tactics.  Unbelievable experience. I was one of the few that did receive a severance package.  Miss my team but not the management."
bad,"Mangement was awful. The overall company was horrible. We had two credit cards with them and I paid on two credit cards with one check. It was supposed to be $300 on one and $300 on the other. They applied the whole $600 to one card. Then took it off and applied the whole $600 to the other card. They never got it fixed right and it screwed up our credit majorly. I wouldn't recommend Bank of America or any of it's services to anyone, not even an enemy. The work environment was horrible and the boss was consistently yelling and putting you down."
bad,They can get rid of people whenever they want. No work life balance. Can't take the vacation you want and never able to take more than a week at a time. Wrong people are getting promoted. I enjoyed meeting new people but the bank is making it harder to work there. A lot of favoritism.
bad,"Poor work environment; management can be difficult to work with; however, some manager are better than others; work-life balance is good, you just have to get through dealing with the work culture and environment."
bad,"helping customers, terrible customer service, Bank of American micromanage doesn't allow employees to help customers with fee's didnt have authority. Not enough employees want all customers to use electronic avenues."
bad,"The first year at BOA was ok as we would occasionally speak to preferred customers and be able to service and sell customers with new benefits and products. As they hired more and opened up call centers across the country the preferred program completely became miserable for  most everyone involved. Most of the skilled reps were fired or quit and replaced with entry level reps.  Out of 35 in my class only a couple remained. As I made a tremendous effort to be promoted to a sr sales specialist everything changed. The call routing system was rigged beyond belief as a few chosen reps everyday got much better calls which led to them making much more money and praise from leadership. Others consistently received horrific calls from broke,bad credit,complaint tier 1 calls with no opportunity. Or got overflow from  upset customers who were already sold or misrouted and angry customers from other depts that we couldnt help.Imagine a work day everyday dealing with complaints all day long while the person next to you got mostly great calls and great sales opportunitys.. Everyday started out with threatening emails to do better or else. Micro managed worse then you could ever imagine. Hundreds of ways that they made up to have your bonuses docked,be written up and to make life as miserable as possible. Friends and Family were hired and promoted. It's quite clear everything changed so the bank would make more money. Most Managers and site leads were absolutely clueless about everything. The call routing was despicable and those involved should be fired. Everyone was miserable and it starts"
bad,"Bank of America claims it wants the best for it's employees but the reality is it wants what's best for it's business, which often includes cheap labor (and overworked employees) and a lack of empathy towards customers. There is nothing enjoyable about taking people's homes and seeing them as numbers and sales goals. However, Bank of America does offer a number of classes and extensive training where many can learn about the real estate industry and the banking industry."
bad,"Bank and mortgage side are not on the same page.  You are expected to sit in a financial center full time and take referrals from bank partners that are not quality while on 100% commission.  Your job is basically to help the bankers meet their goals while your paycheck suffers.  Even though you are encouraged by the mortgage side to go out and make relationships the second you step out of the financial center the bank manager is complaining that you are never there and you have to defend yourself.  If you are accustomed to being a mortgage loan officer that excels at selling, this is not the place for you.  Your day consists of 20% selling and 80% processing and making goals for your bank partners.  Also, you will be told a mortgage coordinator will assist with processing.  Worked there for over a year and still never figured out what they do because they certainly do not assist the LO.  You are a one man show from start to finish on the very few files you will be able to close there.    Very frustrating with zero reward."
bad,the company did try to make as many distractions to cushion the stress levels of the positions itself. It was a cliquey environment so management had favorites.
bad,"Didn't like or appreciate how they demanded that you would be required to work in a customer service role and change your work schedule. The way things were conducted was very nasty. After shutting down the mortgage department they transition into a customer service for debit and credit cards. We had to go through training during that time they stated that your schedule would not change and it did. People had to transition from a M-F 8am -5pm role to working 24/7, whatever shift they would  select. If you selected a schedule that work best for you they still would pick another schedule that wouldn't work.Then how they got rid of people in the underwriting department and did a layoff with other peers was just wrong. Dedication meant nothing to this bank."
bad,very bad managers. they were treated me with no respect. and the work environment  was very stressful. they do not give me very good training and they expected me to do all the work . when  they found out that I have Kidney problems managers tried to find any problem to make me quit.
bad,"I've worked there for 3 years and in that time have seen the company take an irresponsible turn and take out half of their tellers. This means that you're over worked as the customers become angry that there isn't enough staff to help them. So not only do you have to work quick, you have them giving you a hard time, whole your manager expects you to push products on them that they don't even want. God forbid you ever make a mistake, they take you to the principals office and give you a hard time over it while also saying ""we're all humans and make mistakes""."
bad,Toxic work environment that is only stats driven. i worked there and became a training coach. They changed our line of business and made everyone that was a coach a regular associate again. We were told we would have to start the process all over again. Customers allowed to be rude and aggressive towards associates without any relief to associates.
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"This may be somewhat dated now, but the conversations with customers were heavily scripted and aimed at up-selling. You'll work an occasional evening and definitely on Saturdays. If you work in-branch, you have a 75% chance of being replaced by a machine/computer in the next 5 to 10 years."
bad,High turn over every time you look around people are getting  laid off or out on stress leave. Horrible place to work and you would think with a name like bank of America you would have job stability.
bad,"Although I enjoyed the actual work, the pressure to get people credit cards, loans etc was off the charts.  Your job performance is based on sales as opposed to service and client satisfaction"
bad,"They talked about work life balance but the only people that enjoyed that privilege were the management, directors.... It was an open environment that did not encourage any privacy, try working with someone that talks continuously with employees and retirees and try concentrating on making thoughtful solutions to 100's of problems daily. It was impossible!!!!!"
bad,You are just a number at Merrill Lynch.  Produce or its out the door with younger employees it is a revolving door.  Pros are you can make you own schedule.
bad,"Total length of service 18 years. I ended up resigning unexpectedly because the situation I was in in the Red Bank, NJ office was so unbearable my health was suffering. Management not only did not help in a situation with a Financial Advisor who had a staggering amount of turnover, they made things worse."
bad,Due to the fact that the management in the one in tampa for the personal bankimg side its horrible . Some adjustments should be made your just anumner to them and honestky they dont care about you
bad,Work for them for 25 years had great reviews got small raises and bounces. Was told I was safe from management on my last review and five days later was laid off.
bad,"It was tough to learn at Bank of America, the training was not very good.They showed favoritism. Hardest part of the job was no days off and being contract. Most enjoyable part of the job was- I got a paycheck every week."
bad,"You live and breathe by sales, good luck if you dont make them. Customers do not come first for this company and you spend your days worried about losing your job if you dont sell ."
bad,"Typical work days are crazy busy, not enough staff to attend to customers. Therefore they get nasty and don't want to cooperate with bank polices. I had three manager changes in two years of employment. the most enjoyable part of the job work paid vacations."
bad,lousy company. not tech savvy.. the company used TCS as offshore support. Any company using TCS sucks. TCS is not good partner. I don't like to be associated with TCS.
bad,"Bank of America Merchant services was a good place to work over the years.  You could overlook the lack of quality management and sufficient training because the pay was good and the benefits were equal to what you can find in most places.  No with the Wells Fargo Lawsuits and pending investigations Bank of America Merchant Services has paniced and has set fire to anything that could link it to any hint of what Wells Fargo was caught doing.  Cutting pay/commission by over 40%.  Laying off 25% of it's workforce.  Which included it training department.  They have also put a hiring and travel freeze company wide.  One of the biggest issues is the lack of training that is provided to base level managers.  That training should include Human Resources, Ethics, Professionalism and each manager should be provided with a mentor to help them transition into management.  Most of the managers promoted from within have little to no previous management experience with leads to horrible management or no management."
bad,not the place to work there is no compassion or understanding by management unwilling to work with you when it comes to family issues and their lateness policy is nonexistent 1 min late from break or lunch is a problem they will walk you out the door when you call out sick you are calling another country other associates were nice and willing to help but if you are looking for log term employment this is not the place for you.
bad,"Poor training, unrealistic goals, outdated technology. Expected to work long days, weekends and holidays. High stress environment with no reward. A football field of cubicles!"
bad,At Bank of America I was a teller supervisor.  I have 5 tellers to audit monthly.  If their drawers were out I had to count them and find the shortage or overage.  I also ran a cash drawer myself.
bad,"For a technology consulting company, TCS internal data systems are straight out of 1999 - slow, hard to use, and poorly organized. If their clients saw what TCS associates use, they would do a lot less business."
bad,"If you have nothing nice to say, don't say it. I don't recommend this place. You will see why. Trust me, so many other banks are better. In fact, so many other companies are better."
bad,Workplace culture is one of solemn nature.  Limited room for interacting with others and therefore the stress level is at a constant high level. Staff utilizes their time off in order to handle the work-related stress.
bad,This company has a slogan and it is do more with less. They less employees the better for them. You are pretty much a used car salesman there. No work/ life balance its work 6 days a week
bad,"You are subject to lose your job at anytime. The goals were ridiculous and you were expected to make those goals. It's a very militant environment. On the other hand, they made sure you were well traded from sales to irate customer (which you will surely have.)"
bad,Learned about different cultures in the world.  Daily fast pace work. The most enjoyable part of the job were the Christmas parties. Was comfortable in position.  Should have moved around to different position.
bad,"The stress level put on employees is inhuman. The sales goals put on employees is just as inhuman as the ""Client Service Representatives"" aka Tellers, if not more so.  Sales gets you hired, operations gets you fired.  This corporation cares about numbers and sales, nothing more, and as long as you want to keep your position- nothing less."
bad,This was a rough place to work . There is no work life balance you do what they tell you and that's that. Management was more like being under a harsh rulership. This was not a pleasant experience.
bad,Unfortunately BOA does not respect the people that work in the mortgage department.  They talk about a work life balance but there is none. Management is rude and insulting.
bad,I loved this position. loved helping clients with their credit management . focused on sales and helping people increase their line credit. loved being a team player.
bad,The job was supposed to be a financial advisor but was just high-pressure sales.  The location was poorly located and dirty.  The overall process we were supposed to follow was cumbersome and not user-friendly.
bad,High-pressure sales.  The location was dirty and poorly located.  Benefits were average.  The overall process we had to follow was cumbersome and not user-friendly.
bad,It is a great place to learn but getting promoted and /or moving within the bank is hard. No one will give you a chance and it is all base on who you know.
bad,"no good managers support, no rises, low pay not about helping teams management will not support workers will not stand behind team do nothing for workers at all"
bad,"Not what I expected"
bad,"Great management support with fun thrown in on a daily basis. The management team ensured that they continued their education in order to be able to assist their team to become the best they could be. Unfortunately, the ability to advance is not easily available to those at the branch level. Additionally, salaries are lower than those at other organizations."
bad,Most jobs that pays well at bank of America requires you to work past your schedule often with out notice. It is difficult to get days off to be with family.  Management is the worst.
bad,"BOA was the end of ML and they are always finding ways to cut advisor comp by moving your accounts to a call center. They never got a synergy with BOA's branch footprint."
bad,"Far too much aggravation for the pay, not very supportive management team, many of the management team walked around with chip on shoulders and had power trips"
bad,"With a sales/business first mentality, this organization very quickly displayed a expendable attitude to its employees. I experienced everything from threats from management to relocation to a sales driven environment with little to no resources to accommodate the simplest of tasks."
bad,"The benefits are great. if you have children and not able to work weekends this isn't the place for you. "
bad,"My experience was only ok when I first started training there. Once I came out of training and started utilizing my skills, my manager would only use me at a teller capacity. Whenever a mistake happened, my manager was quick to throw me under the bus to save himself. Shortly after getting work accommodations both my FCM and Market Manager treated me differently.  I was only good if I was running transactions. I was not given the opportunity to learn more. Ultimately they picked with me on little things and let me go. They worked me like crazy  (oftentimes by myself) before the end of the year, sent me on vacation and the day I returned....they fired me. I wouldn't recommend them do anyone. They will use you up and get rid of you and replace you!"
bad,"I worked for Bank of America for ten years. Great peer training. Great benefits, vacation packages, and monthly metric bonuses."
bad,"BofA management doesn't know what they are doing and they don't listen to their employees and customers. I worked for a banking center for 6 years and over the years they have cut down on staff from 8 to 2 tellers at some centers and installed atm machines instead which resulted in long long lines sometimes customers are literally standing in line for an hour. The managers sees this, the employees see it and the customers see that the centers are hugely understaffed, management from up above would tell us to shut up they are not going to hire more people either shut up and work or quit. Many tellers ended up quitting and they wouldn't hire more tellers."
bad,I worked for this company for 2 years. Its terrible. The benefits are the only good thing about it. Video Teller Agent is a terrible job. Stay away from this place. They only care about themselves and they play favorites. Its back to back calls every day.  You do not get paid enough to do what you have to do. The customers for bank of America are so stupid they don't even understand how to use an ATM. so if you do not have patients do not bother with this job. You'll go home hating yourself. I promise you that.
bad,"Management sucks"
bad,"No matter how long you been with the company, or how hard you work to prove yourself they will not promote within. The people you work with daily are a delight. However, your manager might not know the banking world and if you are a long term employee you will then have to train the manager instead of being the manager yourself."
bad,Bank of America taught me a great deal about the mortgage business from a side I had never seen. My experiences are priceless and I am grateful for the opportunities provided.
bad,"worst politics, mostly Indian.... that makes too worst. Treating you like school boy and no freedom. too much micro management. especially when you working with Naveen, mentu, jim and paul"
bad,"We used to make our numbers and be left alone. Now there are check-in 5x a day. Essentially we are becoming Wells Fargo without staffing."
bad,"Managers and employees are not honest, employees are out to get each other, dishonesty is rewarded, back stabbing is rewarded, and taking credit for others work is rewarded. It is much better work environment when you are a contractor versus being an employee. The culture of the corporation is not good. CEO laid off 35,000 employees to get the stock price up so he could save his job. He continues to ship jobs to India which puts more Americans out of work. Maybe they should change the name to Bank of India, subsidiary in America."
bad,"I worked in the Small Business Dept in the Newark office. The job itself wasn't that bad. I just wasn't used to dealing with angry horrible customers all the time. After that, the job got pretty easy. HOWEVER, management changes a lot. My first two managers and interim mangers were great and helped me a lot. My last manager was a snake and had me fired. It was the worst experience of my life. I would never bank with them and I would NEVER work for Bank of America EVER AGAIN. Horrible horrible horrible."
bad,"Lack of support & training for teachers"
bad,Would not go back there.  No communication from management and an extreme lack of honesty and ethics. Some employees pushed to produce with a lack of accuracy being seen as second to the amount of loans that were pushed through.
bad,"I worked there over a year and a half, and thought I would love it. The job itself is easy, a trained monkey can do it. Thing is, management has no idea how to actually manage. They give positions to people that are uneducated, haven't been trained, and then get power hungry. If you're honest in the mid year review of management that's ""anonymous"" you get fired. Like me. It puts a target on your back if you're honest about the work environment. Please, do yourself the favor and apply to Capital One, Chase, or CITI where you will be treated like a human and not like a replaceable piece of machinery. HR does nothing for you, it's all up to your manage but when your manager is the problem you get ""terminated with the bank"" might as well not even bother with this place. The pay is great, benefits awesome, the job is easy, but those things will mean nothing if you get treated like scum. Stay away!"
bad,No upward mobility! Not enough pay for the amount of work and expectations. I really dont have much else to say.... If you're extremely patient go for it. If not run the other way
bad,Manage and ensure day-to-day operations are in compliance with established policies and    procedures. Assist fellow teller associates in handling more complex transactions and issues. Ensure banking center operations are in compliance with federal regulations.
bad,no one seems to know whats going on now. It's been difficult to get assistance with atypical problems. They tell you after the fact if someone has done something incorrectly. There isn't a team environment. Everyone seems to fend for themselves and there isn't a connection. The company vision is awesome. The way the company wants to take care of customers is phenomenal but somewhere down the line that gets blurred.
bad,"Helping any bank of America branch employees that had a question, comment, or help with policy and procedure, nationally."
bad,A typical day included managing a team of 60+ in resolving escalated complaints from regulatory officials.  Developing a team that worked together in a timely manner was a great part of the job.
bad,Always short staffed. Changed quotas so they are very difficult to obtain. Compensation is not what used to be. Made us work through lunches often. Then complained when we had overtime even though we were over worked. I do not recommend this company to work for.
bad,Bank of America's Loss mitigation team is stressful and poorly managed.  I will never again work for this corporation. Very few true leaders within the organization.
bad,Senior management will trample all over you and claim credit for all your hard work.  Staff get made redundant after 25 years without being offered alternative roles even though they are advertising.
bad,"Strong and friendly team environment, management was fair and easy to talk to, daily production was a obtainable without hardship."
bad,"Collaboration is a must. Always on the edge of your seat because you didn't know it today was you last day. Fast paced environment and can become overwhelming, Decent benefits and the were affordable."
bad,"A typical day would normally begin with who was laid off, or rumored to be laid off. I would then work in EPW until Break time,  I would then process and work the partial report thru lunch.  Spend the rest of the day working trustee, HELOC, loans and queries as well as my assigned term digit queries and issues in LPS (Black Night). I was learning a lot about the new Process for query research. My direct Team manager was awesome.  I loved all my C-workers."
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked for. MICROMANAGEMENT, MICROMANAGEMENT, MICROMANAGEMENT. Outdated operating systems. Relying on paper way too much."
bad,Doesn't protect their employees from inside threats. Terrible management. Make promises that they don't keep.fdbdfbdzbzdbfdbdbfdxbfdbfdbfdxbfdxbfbfdsbfdbfdsbfsbfsb
bad,"I was a contractor and was placed on an assignment to work Mortgage Research for Bank of America. They ""say"" they give 2 weeks of training but it was only 3 days and scattered at best! It took almost a month (3 1/2 ) weeks to get a badge or access to the computer so I had to sit and watch people work. I was put on research with no practice loans. When I was put in the Sub servicing Dept I asked the manager a question for a file that I did not understand and instead of her helping me, I was told that I need to be more confident in my job. I am a confident person but if you ask me to do something that I have never done before, I'm going to have questions. They have a sink or swim attitude which is ok for some but it really isn't a great idea to have a company and then not care if they are trained or not, that just makes NO sense!  I have been with many different professional companies where I have worked up to management,trainer,interviewer but I have NEVER worked for a company that has no care to ""invest"" in the knowledge or growth thereof concerning their contractors."
bad,In the 10 yrs. with the company I've been able to grow as a Leader and develop my skills. Met great people that have inspired me to reach and obtain success and to mentor others to aspire for greater things. the company is changing culture. replacing associates with machines. cutting employees from the banking centers and expecting half of the staff to do triple the work in the same amount of time as if they were full staffed. Clients and Employees are complaining. is as if they don't care that they are affecting the health of their employees. one by one they're getting panic attacks and their health is deteriorating due to the heavy pressure/stress they are under.
bad,"Extremly aggressive sales goals, very hard to hit incentive payouts."
bad,"SELL SELL SELL!!!! Bank of America no longer wants or requires qualified personnel to operate or manage their branches. The term ""Customer Service"" doesn't exist to this organization. All they want are retail sales experience. Their sales goals are unreachable and unattainable. When notifying Branch Manager of unethical and immoral practice, you are retaliated against. Regional Market Manager is just a robot with no emotion or personality. She has her favorites and watch out if your not on her list!! Some branches are operated more like Daycare centers rather than a Banking center. Management can say or do whatever they want & just get away with it... NO ACCOUNTABILITY...."
bad,Strick quotas and unattainable expectations .............
bad,Bad management and ever worse tech support from the bank. Lacking and instructor in the entire group.
bad,"I enjoyed the work but the environment was entirely too negative, which explains the high turn over rate."
bad,"The pay, hours, and benefits were good."
bad,"I was with the bank for almost 10 years, I saw so many employee's come and go. Threw the years management was brutal and everyone was fearfull of loosing their job at any time, and were threaten quite often."
bad,"no opportunity for advancement, no job security.  There was not real direction in terms of where the going is going long term.  They were very vague in terms of job security or finding jobs within the company for potential employees that were facing layoffs."
bad,"Bank of America is poorly managed and expect 60 hours for a 40 hour work week. "
bad,"I was told in the interview I would get between 25-35 loans to process. In the end they had me processing 60-70 loans. Some of the loans would be transferred and customers were extremely upset because of what the previous processor did to their file. There computer system and the way they processed loans was horrible. I spent more time trying to fix a file because of their horrible systems they use versus assisting customers with their files. They make it impossible to close loans. Their rules for expired documentation were what aggravated me the most. I had to keep bugging customers for documentation that kept expiring, which upset every customer. If it wasn't their computer system that caused last minute delays, it was their time period of scheduling a loan closing 5 days out. Their processing time was unrealistic based on their slow computer systems and documentation expiration dates. They expect you to work overtime to make up the difference. Do not expect to take any time off from work. No one covers your work while you are out on vacation or a day off. They assign a backup person to cover your files but the backup person is busy doing their own work to keep up. Things can easily spiral out of control if you miss one day. The pay was nice but the aggravation of working there is not worth it. Also, management is shady."
bad,"•	Achieved 143% of goals, by relationship building, assisting businesses and customers with strategies to improve their business and livelihood."
bad,"I started working for bank of america not too long ago. I was there for about a month and a half or so and that was enough for me to resign. It has nothing to do with responsibility or personal issues. Actually, I had always dreamt of working for a bank, since I was a teenager! I was very excited, hopeful and motivated to start a job with the prestigious bank of america. My first three days, okay. After that, I felt management was picking on my every move: my way of greeting customers(which was very pleasant by the way), but they wanted an exact phrase, my attire, which was probably more professional than other tellers, they wanted me to do transactions in an exact order, but the order I was doing was just fine (learned from other tellers)....sometimes one manager would show me something someway and another rude manager would come and completely humiliate her by overriding her opinions and techniques. When at the teller window, if there was something I did wrong or was missing, my manager would come and correct me right in front of my customer! Not only was she not courteous and professional, but she told me in a loud and angry tone. I felt really unliked and mistreated there. I saw how she would treat her two favorite tellers (friends whom she would go out with) and even guys. Once I finished my training on the computer, they threw me right on to a teller window and would get bothered (seriously upset ) if I asked a question....so much that one day, my non-helpful manager asked me ""Didn't your training teach you how to do it? Should I have you take your training all over again?"
bad,"This was my first bank job and I was very excited to acquire it since I felt it only appropriate to work as a teller to further my business experience. I learned how to handle large amounts of cash- anywhere from $4k to $100k. I balanced ATMs, ran the Teller front line and Teller drive through (consisted of 6 lanes). I also helped customers into their safe boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rush. I enjoy being busy- it not only helps to pass the time but it also helped me feel useful. I learned that I have amazing patience and perseverance. My banking center manager would hide in the office room to text constantly. She was never there to help when I needed her and she constantly told me to break certain policies that were crucial to protecting not just the bank, but also myself. The hardest part of the job was handling rude, violent customers. We had customers come in and literally throw things at us and swear. My manager told me that that was customer service. The co-workers were fun to work with, however. They were quick to help and actually helped me with my training as a teller more than the Bank of America computer system or the training manager. A typical day at work went as such:"
bad,Management is very rude and disrespectful. With this company you have to make sure you have your ducks in a row or other wise you will be getting fired.
bad,Overall job has very good benefits which keeps you wanting to work for the company. Company rules and regulations change up very often which i didn't care to much for....some branches are not very consistent with processes.
bad,I once was a Countrywide Legacy employee and I loved working for the company and I will be honest I was not thrilled about the merger that took place I had a bad feeling about it. Well that feeling I had .was completely right in the last 5 years I have had 4 different rolls because the company eliminates positions and departments and places you where they see fit whether you want to be in that roll or not. They don't take into consideration if this roll is going to play to your strengths or weaknesses and are constantly changing the rules and procedures. Over all I am not please with where the company is headed and soon I feel like there will not be one with all the lay offs they are doing.
bad,refer products and services to customers to deepen their banking relationship.
bad,I had a range of co-workers and managers. Eventually the best talent left the bank as the dysfunctional leadership wore people out.
bad,"Poor Management, poor training, poor values."
bad,The company used to be good to work for before they merged with Country Wide and then they changed our insurance to the least amount they would pay for. The management is terrible and they expect too much from their employees and you have no kind of job security it is like you go to work everyday and feel like you will get fired.
bad,"This has been one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Lied to in interview on how easy it would be to transition to a different department. I have learned a lot about mortgages and to never go through boa for anything. The hardest part of the job is there is no consistency in answers since everything changes so often, and when a questions are asked you may get several conflicting answers. Most enjoyable part of the job is when I finally get to go home."
bad,Very stressful atmosphere. Upper management does not display respect verbally to those they manage. Market executives lack respect for those employees in the actual banking center channel. Training of new hires is inadequate with all the rules changing constantly. Co workers typically are very young and lack maturity and or desired skills. Hardest part of this job was trying to accomplish all that is set forth in a short period of time and having to assist the public. All while being short staffed.The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
bad,"great job for students. good benefits but little else, no chance of advancement, hires in waves and lays off in waves and frequently, management never knew what was going on, policies and rules changed frequently without notice to floor staff."
bad,Not a place I would recommend. Their interest isn't the employers nor providing excellent customer service.
bad,When I was in the IT group on market St San Francisco my mangement was having relationship problems with the new owners. The force out was not so nice and the dummies back east didn't have a clue trying to take over the IT department from San Francisco. I heard it never happened. Technically they have the most advanced IBM software they were the development site. Lots of competiton and back stabbing. Hopefully they got over those problems.
bad,The company offers good benefits but upper management do not care about there associates. They tell you what you like to hear and do the opposite. Its all about numbers and sales . They preach about doing whats right for the customer but its not its about selling and pushing bank products to customers as a relationship manager you are treated like dirt. No matter how good you are nothing you do is good enough . In order to make incentive you have to exceed your impossible quarterly goals and crazy metrics and if your not at 70 percent in each metric you get put on a action plan and your boss and management will make your job very unpleasant and sometimes contradict everything they say . Bad company to work for
bad,No real teamwork no real dedication  too many people saying I don’t care  or even worse   WHATEVER mediocre performances are glorified so no real reason to strive to be better and no reward for those that do better
bad,severely underpaid. the work pressure was insane and there was no work life balance. great company to start off with but then there are little to no opportunities within the company. boa would much rather hire externally then to promote within. the company has the best benefits i have seen but the pay sucks. also you are allowed paid time off but are strict to when u can take it
bad,"Do not work for Bank of America , you always stress to lose your job if you don’t make you numbers , even when you do make your numbers that still not enough and they make you to call 50 ppl every week"
bad,"I worked there over 10 years ago. My direct manager was amazing. One of the best I ever had. However, the work was extremely stressful. High call volume with irate customers and no breaks in between. Some breaks are missed because of the long call. Lack of empathy for customers. Excessive fees and lack of ownership to take care of customers. Unrealistic goals and expectations. No work/life balance especially when dealing with deaths or illness."
bad,"Don’t Look here, it’s only going to Drag You Down to depression"
bad,"RM role is not what they seem to make it. Yes you can make commission off your goals, but that makes you pressure to sell products to clients who don't need it and they hide it by saying why didn't you provide them a ""solution"" to their financial life which is completely BS. Wouldn't recommend anybody to work here, especially in the Waltham area, management is horrible."
bad,Worked here for about a year. They make it impossible to hit your goals. The financial center i was at had a banker that got all the new accounts. Management thought she was getting referals when it was not. She would say her computer crashed when servicing came around. She would cherry pick clients who want to open new accounts when other clients were waiting for servicing. Management is fooled by her. She lies and is very shady. Calls clients to make sure they used there credit cards. I was told many people come and go from this financial center. Me i was not able to hit my 70% goal so i was let go. Feel bad whoever gets in this branch. The market leader is very un fair. I was in feer of loosing my job the entire time i was there. My customer service surveys were great but they dont care so much about clients being satisfied. They want you to sell sell sell. Very high turn over ratio.that is why you see these positions popping up every week. If you have a family and need job security stay away! They say they care about you but all you are is a number to them. More then half the people i trained with were fired by month 8 for not hitting 70% of there sales goal. Bank of America is not what they make themselves seem to be. I had one client who opened up an account. He deposited 5k into the atm. They held his money for 2 weeks while they investigated it. Once they found out it really was jammed and took his money they closed his account and said sorry we choose not to have a relationship with you. When they says relationship its an undercover saying for sales.
bad,"Probably the most toxic environment I've ever worked in, Poor management, no accountability. Lack of training and advancement. Do not work for the Glenbrook office in Stamford CT. That manager there will make your life extremely difficult. The work place culture is high school its not worth your peace. Its unprofessional and a mental health time bomb. I can't say this enough please do not apply for this position or company."
bad,You are just a number when employed for Bank of America.  It is difficult to advance and Management is lacking in experience.  Entry level positions will usually stay in entry level.
bad,"BofA seems like a decent place to work if you do not aspire to launch your career beyond middle management."
bad,"high stress, high turn over rate, little support from management. Very cut throat work environment with no real team dynamic or support. Customers are difficult"
bad,not allowed to voice any concerns to superiors first time in my career i have pnly ever been accused of insubordination and threaten with a write up reprimand.
bad,"Busy day with minimal support staff."
bad,"Management Could Care Less About You, In Their Eyes You Are Disposable. They Pay You To Take Abuse From Customers With No Way To Maintain Any Dignity. They Allow Customers To Behave However And Feed Their People To The Wolves With No Tools To Help Themselves"
bad,great pay just semi hostile management and no care for employees. schedules often did no reflect hours worked and so on. Upper management impossible to reach also.
bad,Learned a great deal about the financial industry very quickly. Learning occurred on the job as there was not in depth management training. Was not assigned a home location for the first 6 months of employment due to being hired in the absence of an open position. This was not thoroughly explained in the interview process. Ultimately left due to district and regional management not maintaining a positive and ethical sales culture.
bad,"Worked for the company for 10 years - started with Countrywide and then continued with Bank of America.  Met some very talented people and made some very good friends,"
bad,"As an investment specialist trainee they give some employees 2 chances to pass the series 7 exam. However, some only get 1 chance and if you dont pass they are selective to whom they give a position to in another department. The recruiters are horrendous with communication."
bad,my first job was 10 yrs with MBNA and they were bought out by Bank of America.  I worked there 5 more years and saw a big decline in the business and felt it was time to go to another company.
bad,"the company offers great benefits, unfortunately they do not invest in their leadership teams nor do they promote the right people. they do not take the time to make associates feel value therefore there is a lot of talent on the bench frustrated and they end up leaving the company."
bad,"I would never recommend this place to anyone. The management is very fragmented and cut throat. They do not support their staff and pit each other against one another. I would say maybe this was just where I worked, but I have found from conversations with others who have worked there, from my moving around the country, that this corporate culture is the same from the east coast to the west coast. "
bad,They are terrible to work for and its no wonder they don't keep employees around. I have been so unhappy working at Bank of America. Think of it as temporary. Do not try to make a career out of working for them. Managers have no respect for employees and their rules are ridiculous.
bad,"Unorganized onboarding process, to many ""market"" realignments. Turnover is bad. Pay is mediocre for responsibilities. Expect BOA getting the same publicity as Wells Fargo did with their sales pressure and encouragement to get numbers anyway mentality."
bad,Great place for young new comers to the corporate world.great picnics and family outings. The job is real. They lack in the care for there employees and customers. after being injured on the job it was neglected due to a telephone break(GA laws) and I was later fired by nobody know who. told that I was not disabled yet I am on disability.
bad,Company is constantly laying people off and fails to take the appropriate steps to improve the company culture and morale.  Pay is low but benefits are good.  Don't expect to ever get promoted if you have the education and experience needed to advance at other companies.  They only promote those who have no idea what they are doing and willing to do things the wrong way.
bad,Sad to say the fraud dept in kennesaw  was the worst .I often asked my self why did i come here.It gotten so bad my wife asked me to quit.
bad,Lacked a sense of direction for the division where I worked. No work life balance worked 70 to 80 hours a week. Politics were out of control
bad,"Merrill Lynch was not only your employer, but it was a wonderful place to work."
bad,Company is way too political for my tastes.  Those who do not take any risks tend to be promoted up the company ladder first. That is a poor work environment.
bad,"Met with 12+ clients (face to face) per week.  Also handled and took care of the banking center referrals that came in from all 3 banking centers.  Primary focus was on lending (loans and lines) for all types of businesses, but primary focus was on Doctors, Dentists, Veterinarians, CPA's and Attorneys (Practice Solutions).  Loved my coworkers, as most of them were previous coworkers from Chase.... and we were one big family, always could rely on them for help, when needed."
bad,"There is no room to even take a breath. To management you are lower than dirt. Every element of your day is ruthlessly regimented. You are not deemed capable of making any type of decision and managers will constantly talk down to you like you haven't paid 120k for your education. You are a number here, not an employee. It was a waste of my life."
bad,"I work every part of the financial center from teller to backing up the manager. Sales are pushed and the only thing that really matters. The financial center manager pushes everyone for sales even if the customer does not need the product. The CMM (financial center area manager) pushes sales just as much. You are expected to meet sales goals while on vacation or sick. Decent pay, benefits, and job security assuming your financial center is meeting its goals."
bad,"Gave many years to my employer, who did not give, or could give back. I was always willing to give a positive work environment 8 hours a day, In most cases willing to give a 110 percent back."
bad,"Highly repetitive, boring, high pressure sales expectations. Best part of the job is the people you work with. Well at least depending on your branch. You will be selling credit cards to people who don't need them"
bad,"My role at Bank of America was to get the loan process ready and to ensure that the registration process was correct. Address, phone, job info, ecto. Then sent off to another department for processing."
bad,"This was the first bank I started working for.  After a year of experience, I couldn't wait to leave.  They don't treat you good; you're just a number; they are too strict about sales and sales goals; It's a revolving door there; management treats you like a kid; too fast paste; most of the day you're on your feet; and it's hard to step aside to try to learn other job functions for opportunities to get promoted."
bad,I quit as a result of the verbal and emotional abuse. The leadership team is very black and white and quick to turn on you.
bad,"Customer service is priority  no matter what happens or his happening in the business. "
bad,I give an overall excellent review of my working experience.
bad,"I assist customer with different type of transactions, such as opening accounts reviewing account for errors if there's any. Selling the products that we have to offer , and making sure the customer has all there banking needs taken care of."
bad,Training was disorganized and sporadic. Management was inexperienced and biased. 
bad,"I feel the management at this employer is unethical.  I witnessed an employee that I supervise being verbally assualted.  When reported to human resources, the manager was not held responsible."
bad,"Productive and fun workplace with Wii games ,March of Dimes donations , Nachos on Fridays, Ice Cream doing the Summer"
bad,Making outgoing and taking inbound calls to help current home owner's bring past mortgage payments current. Also help in lowering home owner's monthly mortgage and preventing home owner's from losing their homes.
bad,This is not the company to work for if you want a career. In the beginning you may advance quickly but it wont last long. They are known for hiring managment with no prior background and not training them well. The insurance is great and the hours are great but they DO NOT cater well to pregnant women. They moved me an hour away from my home at 6 1/2 months pregnant and then later on fired me with the worse excuse. But if you last long then you may gain a great experience and thats pretty much it.
bad,"No value for hardwork but they emphase for friendly relationship between the junior and senior (like if your manager is your friend, then there are chances that you can get promotion otherwise your hardwork will go in vain).  Moreover, they cheat their employees with their HR policies"
bad,"Unprofessional behavior tolerated by management. HR does nothing despite the annual compliance training and slaps on the wrist. "
bad,typical day at work is getting yelled at or getting rude comments due to long lines with 1 or 2 tellers available at all times. BofA does not want a customer walking in to branches want everyone to use atm's or cellphones for banking. dont even try to talk to a banker with an issue they will just hand over a business card with customer service number to call if its not a sale dont bother trying. workplace culture its all about sales every customer walking in or calling a customer the bank is not looking out for your financial success just trying to sell a product they push sales all day in their emails from upper management to conference calls. management is ok depending who you have but some need more training especially dealing with angry customers that wait in line for 45 min at least bankers and tellers take all the heat while management hides in the back (some)  the hardest part of the job is all the angry customers you deal with everyday due to bofa downsizing and wants them like i said earlier use the atm's and cellphones the only enjoyable part is working with some really go people its all about SALES!!!
bad,got laid off but glad  I got let go hated going to work every day only stayed for the money but good severance package some good some bad people management included but liked the pay
bad,"Like many mega-sized companies, BofA has shifted to 20/80 Contractor/Employee ratio.  Operations are so bureaucratic; the atmosphere not only lacks stimulation but people are really unhappy; there is no sense of humor and management stifles initiative and independent thinking."
bad,"When I first started with BofA, customer service was most important, but that changed quickly, specially after the meltdown of 2008. Now is all about the product pushing and unrealistic sales goals."
bad,"people are rude,dumb, and slow prepare for all of them. pretty much non stop work, need to very detailed oriented. Standing all day. only day or morning people"
bad,Didn't work there long they laid off the department. But it was an ok place to work. Management was fair and the people were great to work with. The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch hour.
bad,"Was not the best working experience.Just thankful for the experience to know what to look for and what not to look for in chosen career. have found other, more suitable work."
bad,"There are some people who love this company - I am not one of them, I promised I'd give it 6 months and gave it one day more than that - I didn't like the environment, the stress and constant looking over our shoulder - I am an adult with a good work ethic - I felt they challenged it and overmanaged everyone - more worried about making money and hitting goals than happiness of employees."
bad,"Environment is highly micro-managed, and tightly controlled."
bad,"Everything here is a number game. Very little appreciation or flexibility for employee. Even when your numbers meet expectations, you still get treated like yur a number yourself."
bad,"Company was a primary funder towards the Dakota Access Pipeline. Not okay in my book. I would like to work for a company that does not do this. Once I learned of the outlook the company had, and especially how they treat their employees, my case for example, I knew this was not a good company to work for."
bad,Bank of America is a very profit driven company where the work day can often seem very stressful as the staffing levels are very low. The hardest part is trying to remain positive for the customers when they are waiting for long periods of time.  Positives of the company are that they offer superior benefits for working parents as well as a very competitive salaries.
bad,Highly stressful job.  Extremely busy phone lines. Co-workers were nice enough but no time to socialize.  Hardest part of the job was all the documentation for each and every call and the very strict policies. Most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy.
bad,"Absolutely horrible company to work for. Although the pay is decent and it's 'banker hours', I would never recommend BoA to anyone as a place to work let alone do business with.  Corporate management hold the specter of losing you job over employees on every conference call, ethics don't exist--it's all about the numbers, bankers are told to get rid of customer's that aren't a 'sale' ASAP, very little backup from management with issues."
bad,I was given the opportunity to start in the State Mediation department and have grown within. Gaining knowledge in different aspects of the loss mitigation review process.
bad,"A typical day at Bank of America consisted of a host of document reviews, various banking center functions, guest/customer account maintenance, performing teller transactions, meeting and directing guests as they entered and coaching/training associates in all aspects of business from sales, customer service and compliance. I learned a host of federal regulations and guidelines as it relates to banking. The management and on-boarding could use a great deal of work. While in training and new to banking I was without a manager for months and in my 3 years of employment, I had 6 different banking center managers and 4 CMMs (District Managers). The hardest part of my job was taking time for myself as I always had assist my team as well as the various managers perform their functions. Banking Center Managers do very little to affect the business and when they are at work, they spend most of their time in their office avoiding customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was a sense of accomplishment after assisting a guest with a difficult situation. Some of my co-workers were enjoyable and friendly while others were unprofessional and selfish."
bad,"Typical bank attitude of under staff and overwork. Expect excellent customer service scores but employ enough people to help half of the customer volume. Expect perfection on bank audits but give no time to do things accurately and review audit materials. "
bad,"We had a manager that never talked to us, had 2 people she favored . I loved that we worked with the  Military. My co-workers where awesome, we were like family! the hardest part of my job was when my contract ended. the most enjoyable part of my job is the cross training, teamwork we had and celebrating b-days!"
bad,"BOA is a good place to work with the right management team some associates along with some management teams can not be trusted they would lie on you to get rid of you, they do not like the true.All the good and hard working employee are all ways remove from the company, they perfer the yes one who dont know the jobs.The associates who put customers first have no chance, I fill for their customers.Benefits was good for me the off holidays was good to have.If you get a chance to work with someone who know the job an can show you the correct way you can be a winner working with them."
bad,"When you come in you are assigned files and through out the day you are asked if you can take on more. That was never an issue, it really came down to how management was. My co-worker were wonderful, and really helped you if needed. Hardest part of the day was handling loan that were in trust, it not easy doing them when you weren't really trained properly. The company did a lot of treat days and events through the day. It was nice to see that kind of incentive."
bad,The management at this company had no people skills and not enough training.. As for as the team goes everyone was always willing to help.. Most enjoyable part about this job is the pay..
bad,"Work fulltime very demanding position which I enjoy, unfortunately platform not well organized."
bad,Did not like the unsucreness of the work the companys programs we would run sometimes never lasted long or had to many close calls. this on inperticular was near done almost 3-4 times. Had to find another job.
bad,This company has the worst customer service ratings documented by MSN for a reason. Its absolutely true and the employees are not treated much better. All the small bank aquisitions were poor management decisions making BOA much too large of a company to have proper personal customer service.
bad,Atomosphere is very negative. ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
bad,"I truly enjoyed my time with Bank of America and looked forward to growing with the company, the constant changes and lack of follow thru from corporate made work difficult."
bad,productive environment and excellent diverse employees.
bad,After finding out who I was working for I planned on finding a full time job somwhere else. This job was only a seasonal job.
bad,"The job itself is wonderful getting to help people retain their homes it is very satisfying work, however, the site i worked at did not treat employees eqaully and if you were a good performer making a mid to high ranging balance they would target you to elimate the possiblity of paying you out by any means necessary even by breaking ethics and codes. They say they care about families but they have no concern for their employees families or the employee in general. They would rather keep terrible employees who do not show up for work and perform poorly and plot to get rid of the employees that perform well and show as a threat to them finacially due to bonus capacity. No regard what so ever for people or families only saving a buck by any means necessary. They do not pay to job level, they give promotions but do not raise pay.This is my opinion based on my experience"
bad,Worked from home -
bad,"Came in and advise the manager i was there, started on my reports and then took a small break at 11am. I learned alot about Short Sales and how they can help people sell their home with pride and take an incentive with them while moving. Co-Workers were such a pleasure and love to be with everyday as it was them who drove me to strive everyday! Being able to joke and do my job was the best there as well. Put a smile on my face daily!"
bad,No stable job security. Culture and platform of the company makes it extremely hard to work for.
bad,"Job security is zero ... Indian in the organization is the worst people, distoyed the image of baci. And so many of our team mate join different organization"
bad,Poor management. Orientation and initial training need lots of work. Barely learn until on the floor taking calls during OJT. almost no culture. Very robotic . Super stressful and no support for this. Not even an onsite fitness center or game room . Just plain . Water was shut off a couple times and had to send us home. Evening shift sucked because the cafeteria closes around 2 or 3 pm .
bad,"Bank of America was one of the worst places I’ve ever worked. The pay starts put descent and the raises are terrible."
bad,"To work at Bank of America for 10 years plus. The coworker are the best part of being part of the company.  All employee in the Pasadena site lost there job, with for month notice 2000 people. Employee have get years of life to end up with out jobs."
bad,I only worked at Bofa for about 6 months and I absolutely hated it. I was excited to work there in the beginning but they give so much stress and pressure. This job was horrible.
bad,I loved working for Bank of America in Conn.  My manager was there to promote and to make sure we were compensated for the work.  But I transferred here and lost thousands of dollars of my salary because they said I was over-paid.  It became with them all about their numbers.  We were stressed every day and not be compensated for the hard work.  Some where along the way Bank of america forgot the customer is the reason for our existence and I really feel like they don't care about their associates. How sad because I loved this company once upon a time and gave them almost 30 years.
bad,The job itself seemed easy enough.  You sat and talked to clients back to back for about 40 hrs a week.  Of course if you have a bad call you're let go.  Then come to find out a month later the department you are apart of is being closed down.  So they avoid severance pay.  Just a heads up for anyone thinking of working for them.
bad,"was working more than 8 hrs per day - more than 40 hrs per week and still only being paid minimum wage. tired of working the nights ad weekends and ""HOPING"" for an application to be submitted.   then when submitted it was ""HOPING"" it would be approved."
bad,"Working at the bank prepared me for the stresses of working in a high paced environment. Working the years I did, I got to know the community better and became friends with many customers. In the weeks leading up to the bank closing, customers would come in and express how sad it was for the branch to be closing. I still keep in touch with my coworkers and customers."
bad,Stressful and relentless.  Unrealistic goals for reps. Some managers don't know how to treat employees. Similar to working in a factory.  A lot of favoritism.
bad,A Lot of drama and mangement needs to follow policys.  Most of your Team Leads make it very stressful for you.  Team Leaders have there favorites on there teams and  let them get away with stuff.   They also need to hire more white people to work for this company!
bad,"work shift was 8 hours in a call center, not the type of environment many people can survive.  I made it one year of having a call ding in my ear, never knowing what was coming through, having my bathroom breaks monitored, and having occasional Hawaiian Fridays."
bad,Great full time position as long as you do not have a family . Pay is great yet the management team is a joke they don’t care if your child’s hurt or someone’s in labor you leave your jobless
bad,Very little room for advancement.  A great place for a college kid to work just getting started.  Not much development with the employees and very unprofessional at times from management.
bad,"This position requires a lot of travel, so be prepared to be relocated. It is a stressful sales environment. Lastly, managers are unorganized, and schedule meetings with no prior notice."
bad,"I absolutely loved my job and customers.  very stressful, the last year the company took turns in how we treated our customers, they wanted me to sell my customers credit cards and loans that was not needed.  They did not care about the customer just want we could sell them.   The hardest thing about the job was trying to deceive my customers, That is something that I am not good at.  I do not think You should force something on someone if it is not needed.   Management did not care about us employees anymore.  back 3 years ago are management team was the best , but then again so was  our policies,  enjoyable was my customers"
bad,"This was a stressful place to work.  Goals are high and in my experience management was punitive.  Employee shortcomings are emphasized and accomplishments not recognized. "
bad,"I was devastated losing my Job after 14 years with in the Bank. I traveled 6 times to get trained department functions and same time I trained so many associate in Utica site. Unpredictable but I guess this is how they do business. I love my Job and the flexibility we have. Compensation was not picture as promised, I always exceed in everything I do but end of the year I am getting less money due to the bank has limit budget to there employees."
bad,"An average 9-5 job. Off all government holidays with pay and Sundays. Serve customers with their everyday basic banking needs. Learn to diffuse customer complaints without escalating to manager. Helping customers find easy banking solutions, whether it be mobile banking, online banking, doing basic transactions at the ATM."
bad,"It was okay working there!, some managers were very helpful to work with when ever there was an issue!  Lot to deal with while being on the phone!"
bad,"As a BofA RM you are basically a glorified cust serv rep.  All the bank  cares about is opening checking accounts for as many cust as possible and sell as many CC as possible. Now Ive heard that every branch is different (which should not be the case) but the branch I worked at had very poor management that seemed to just be learning everything as the days go by and the bank as a whole seemed to embrace this philosophy. Inefficient systems that made it impossible to do anything in a timely manner were an everyday nuisance and everyday that I came into work it seemed that there was some new policy or new way of doing things. A typical day of work includes seeing anywhere from 10-12 customers of which the majority have some issues or complaint, resolving that issue and then find some type of product to sell to them. I did not get along with my coworkers in this branch for the most part (I had 10 different in 5 months)  About the only positive thing I can say about working here where the hours. Bank generally closes as 4pm"
bad,I thought I had worked for the worst company when I worked for a title loan company but this beat it by far! I worked in small community and I don't think I fit in to them because they let me go home for 2 weeks because they didn't like my personality! While I was at home they called me in to make up things that I did that had to be investigated! The investigation came out that I did nothing wrong and that this was retaliation towards me because they wanted me to quit! They exposed confidential information about me that should have never been exposed and when I called Advice and Councel (H.R) they told me that the manager was right in telling my personal business to others! This company is the worst! After I quit they called me asking me questions about a manager that they wanted to get rid of and needed my help! This is after I quit! Never work for this company! (btw the manager they wanted to fire was eventually fired) This bank is the worst to work for and the worst for consumers! Not enough employees in the centers and we were expected to work faster not smarter which means no time to actually help the customer! RUN FAST AS YOU CAN AWAY FROM BANK OF AMERICA
bad,This company has horrible morale. The benefits are great however they work you hard and don't care about employees safety or personal lives.
bad,"Current position resembles a hamster wheel. No sense of completion. Have been employed for over two years, and have never met my manager, or my team mates as they are located in various cities in the country. No sense of a team, and all individual. I have for countless days come in, and left, without speaking to anyone, as the cubicles create a stove-piped isolated environment. I have had many friends come on-board, only to leave within six months. Three coworkers have died from various causes, and management does not flinch, and fills their chair within the week. Simple a ruthless, cutthroat office, with no sense of them looking out for their employees. ONLY thing, is good unmatchable benefits. Everything else, forget it. I have no idea how many people who have quit under this current management team. Rumored to be the worst the office has had in 20 years."
bad,"If you are looking for entry level or high school work this may be for you, otherwise they are shady and your job is to gouge as much money out of your customers as possible. At my branch half of the employees did nothing but back stab each other and talk behind each others back and refuse to help certain other workers. This of course led to others including myself sometimes getting aggravated and stressed having to pick up their slack. Along with that our lead Teller was horrible, she never wanted to do her job and most of the time you were scrambling to get people their money because she was too lazy to do her job and keep you supplied."
bad,"No matter how many billions lost in court cases, company refuses to change unethical and criminal business practices."
bad,It was one of the best work teams I've had the privilege to work with in my career. The management were all outside contractors and so were we.  The work was difficult because the bank had us on a project they had not structured and eventually let us all go because it had no purpose.  We all found out how unscrupulous  internal banking can really be.
bad,"I worked for the company for eight years. Started out great with awesome benefits. After the mortgage crisis started cutting jobs, took away pension, and no bonuses for tellers and operational managers. Started a program called Convient Ways to Bank. Made me push the program which I didn't approve. Forced people to use atm, and other alternative ways to bank such as online banking. This caused many people to loose their job. Make products that force customers to use the ""other alternative ways to bank"" otherwise would get charged a fee."
bad,"I work in a extremely busy branch. I have to sell financial products. cross-sell, refer to partners. service customers all day. after the branch closes I have to make sure that all documents are sign by the customers, and fax the signatures cards and other related documentation to central office. I also have to do other task for the brach. I do like my co-workers, and direct managers. But upper management are insensitive with your time. Even though I like the branch where I work, because there is good customer traffic which helps on reaching your sales goals, I have so much to track and do, its hard to complete my task everything every day. I work almost every Saturday and get a day off during the week. My sales quotas are some how challenging, but not impossible to accomplish."
bad,"This is a great position for someone who enjoys hard sales. The culture is sell sell sell, Which was not disclosed during the interview. More should be done to educate new hires on the jobs true standard."
bad,"Tired of moody managers and lack of direction."
bad,They don’t appreciate that you do a great job because you apparently are disposable! Maybe I was stressed because of the idiot manager changed! But I would think you would appreciate the years all 33 of them and maybe thought I didn’t like change or the new manager who coded me as non hirable quit ! I knew a lot
bad,"I applied for bank of America because i had high hopes with them i learned the hard way at the beginning management was very helpful but after a while you would see that they had there favorite tellers to give them the morning shift while you get the scrappy scheduled after awhile management would talk behind your back or they would make you as an example why your goals are not met, my last day working there was horrible both manager where making remarkable comments"
bad,They have to many nosey employees that will target you and try to get you fired! The managers have favorites and If your not their favorite you have no chance of moving up in company. Not a healthy working environment!
bad,"Company does not hire enough staff in order to perform the job functions.  And when you are allowed to hire, it is a long and difficult process.  Company does not care about work/life balance.  It is all about working."
bad,The company is not for the employees well-being and loyalty means nothing to them. The benefits package is great have not seen another company beat them or even come close..
bad,"Very repetitive, everyone is trying to get everyone fired, not a good environments to work in. They have numbers that aren't realistic so that less Bankers hit their numbers."
bad,waste of time. Management is horrible. BAC will take 30% from you pay if the branch miss customer services . Management wants a big loan pipeline on everything promoting debt.
bad,i applied for to help clients with any financial needs and to provide excellent service that includes to answer all questions. this company is more interested in how fast you can get the client on the phone and out. they are more driven on the numbers. the most you can be on the phone with a client is 3 minutes. anything after that you will be called out and will want to you to sit down and shadow a person that has no time to answer clients questions but to provide self service. some clients have so many questions but you cannot answer all of them because you feel the pressure of your team mates and managers. you need to cut the conversation with your client and just leave them to figure it out on the self service. calling centers are not what they say or what they train you for.
bad,"I am in a dead end line of business, so it keeps shrinking with no end in sight. Managers are really lame and know nothing of management only to ask for more and give nothing in return."
bad,"Poor management, communication issues. Bad upper management "
bad,This type of job was more of a precursor to familiarize anyone with the investment banking environment in preparation for a future in larger roles inside a higher paying Investment Bank.
bad,"A typical day at work."
bad,"I was assigned to this specific training center for 8 weeks. That initial branch was NOT the branch I was hire on to. Before I started I was excited about the new career. Once I started at this branch my desire to continue this career all changed. I witness the worst management in the history of work, this person who manages this branch is the most condescending person, the way you are talked to you is like a child. Unprofessional and uses terror to manage. I constantly hear yelling loud coming from the manager. Choice of words were rude and patronizing. If you make a mistake instead of training you/guiding  you were put down for it. No one can learn this way. I eventually started to question their culture. Sure not all branch is like this however I just did not want to be a part of this type of company that allow this kind of manager to still run the branch. If your interested in this position make sure your manager isn't like this person. And make sure your manager is willing to train, vs making you feel bad for not hitting your goal!"
bad,"The call center is back to back sometimes and u have to be in camera all day . Like Skype . You have to become best friends w the mangers for a promotion . It’s not about how high or how good of a performer you are . Short breaks  all lunches and breaks are scheduled . Too many metrics for a call center to follow ! Call time , quality , camera presence , answer on first ring , are you smiling , are you spinning in your seat ? How many perfect surveys did you get ? Was the call flow right ? Did you come back 1 minute late from break ? This will show on your “availability”"
bad,"Nothing positive to add other that direct Manager was very understanding and a great person. I was going through medical issues, and my direct Supervisor was willing to work with me to keep me in the position I was working in."
bad,"I worked at Bank Of America on a Temp-to-hire position. The work was something that I had experience doing at a previous employment. They hired approximately 50 people for the same job duties, then after a couple of months they started laying people off, with no chance of being called back to work. There was no warning of the layoff. When we would come into work in the morning, there would be empty desks. After being there for 9 months,  I left work at the end of my shift and got a call on my way home that I wasn't needed anymore. Very unprofessional."
bad,I was not happy at BoA. The culture was not as i expected it would be and I was very disappointed. As my internship continued I was only assigned to do one thing and I know I am very capable of doing so much more.
bad,"The Job itself was wonderful but the management and company as a whole is not really there for its employees. Several employees were fired during extended sickness, pregnancy, so on."
bad,The best part about working here were the manager & supervisor. They were very supportive & always had the answers. The worst thing about working here was shoving products down people throats when they didn't need them. This company was not about helping its members but about making money for its business.
bad,"Not enjoyable, no support for management, very stressful and not worth the pay. Would not recommenced working here. Not much has changed I still have friends that work here and regret work everyday."
bad,terrible work place. I don't wish working there upon anyone. I hated every second of it. everyday was absolutely awful there. my co-workers were the only reason I even stayed
bad,A company that gives empty promises and uses you to make money of you and when you all your goals and make 8K of your bonuses you will only get 2500 thats it!!!!
bad,i like learning and working with different projects which inhance my knowledge and work experience.worked well with others.
bad,"The management of Bank of America was ineffective. I dont like to speak harshly about a company but as notorious as the company has been, finally working for the company gave me the worst feelings about it. I had issues with my pay, not being issued proper amounts in my 401k, their loyalty to their employees etc. The hard work was managed on a scale that constantly changed and added much more responsibility that was not reciprocated in your pay. Nothing is hard about being a teller or selling products and promoting the company you work for but with hopes of advancement, you mind as well forget it. I wouldnt want to advance within this company because i dont believe that those in authority really have faith in the products and services they are ""pushing"" on their consumers."
bad,"In the beginning It was great place to work. I never cared to much for the managers. They were so unprofessional. It felt more like working in a club with the incentives being given to those who brown nosed. I was sexually harassed at this company and at the end of the evaluation, I was told they followed protocol, but I still had to work with this employee. I was stressed, angry, and I resigned."
bad,"from the first day of working there I immediately noticed that the job was very sale based, which I knew. but it was nothing like I have anticipated. its expected to do anything at all possible to get new accounts each day. the banks rate at which you MUST meet is 11.5%. which is ridiculous, mainly because you wait on the same customers each day. when I go to the bank would I like to know what all my options are when it comes to my finances? yes I would. but I would not want it shoved down my throat every time I need to make a deposit. "
bad,"Bank of America, has excellent training. They however have 70 percent employee turnover. Middle management is horrible and there is not work life balance. They have managed to stay in business because they have alot of capital and to big to fail."
bad,Micromanaged style from management
bad,"Not a good company to work for"
bad,"I must say, I do appreciate management for working with me when I needed certain days off, on the day of, however, I had a hour and a half drive, to and from work,  unaware of the stress levels it would cause, for a starting pay of $10. There's so much lack of help with team leads, which literally feel like they are not obligated to help the agents, somehow. All of this has taken a toll, this is why I chose to leave Bank of America."
bad,"I went from loving the job to hating it in the span of two years. Compensation was good but upper management changed that. Employees are not treated with respect, they are numbers and everyone is replaceable. Suffocating corporate environment"
bad,"Bank of America, like most major banks, are changing their focus to more automation with online transactions and loans.  While working at these banks, you're constantly under the threat of being laid off due to the rapid induction of consumer based services on devices (such as the BofA app on iPhone)."
bad,"Typical call center for the most part. They were relaxed compared to most call centers about bathroom breaks. They did recognize the hard work I put in. It was stressful like most call centers. There was little to no room for advancement. Most promotions did not involve a pay increase. No paid vacations and no benefits. Overall, I don't recommend this position to anyone."
bad,Much incompetence resulting from a banker's culture unclear on the benefits of in-house technology for a financial institution. Managers are technologists untrained in management. Decisions obey business imperatives that are not understandable from an efficiency standpoint. More money is spent figuring out how much things would cost than it would cost building them. A frustrating environment.
bad,"They honestly expect so much and don't want to pay you for it. If you approve a refund for too many people you can be written up for it. If someone is off balance and you work overtime to figure out why this teller is off, you can be written up for overtime. It was just a lot of being written up for any little thing that just became too much to handle because most of the time you were being asked to not help a customer and being written up for staying over if SOMEONE else was off balance. You see, they would be written up for the balance discrepancy but you would be written up for the overtime. I felt that there was more of a concern for saving money then there was for wanting to maintain and take care of the employee."
bad,"Need to know and be attention to detail as in this job requires to be  a very high paced environment. Great benefits! However, low on salary since the requirements in the job roles requires more. Goals are unreachable."
bad,it had a work life balance and latest environment to work with mix of environment. There is no onsite opportunity and we have 2 shifts to work. this is offshore location with limited oppurtunity
bad,"Bank of America is one of the largest financial institution providing banking services, Investment services, Asset Management. Here at Bank of America we developed Internal Web application for the central login for monitoring performance and statistics of individuals and the banks. This allows the bankers to monitor and update statistics and records. This makes the business run smooth and make the requirements to be more precise and innovative."
bad,"The location I worked in was Office Space--"
bad,Due to unfair and excessive Treatment I was forced to leave this company. I would say this is not a professional company that cares about its customers or employees
bad,"Working on the phones accepting inbound calls from Small Business  customers who wanted to keep their business under one portfolio. I learned that people do not read their mail. That provide updates and changes to their accounts, the hardest part of the job were the irate client who was dissatisfied, but being able to turn that around and have them happy when they hung up with me"
bad,"okay place to work! needs new management."
bad,Managers are allowed to do Do anything they wish .... no human resource help... senior managers have no clue!
bad,"Overall I had a new manager every year and never was able to gain the support or direction needed to be successful. Managers were always asked to do more then they could handle and expected to exceed (not meet) performance. As well as manage associates and side projects at once. The expectations were exaggerated, which explains the high turn around. Also associates would have more support then the management team, unacceptable."
bad,This company only wants employees to advance in the job positions managment wants not what the employee wants.
bad,"It varies from location to location but there is NO such thing as flexibility in the work place. You will always feel the pressure of understaffing. Raises only come once a year for pennies on the dollar. I think the only thing that kept me around were the benefits. If you’re a salesman, it may be perfect for you."
bad,"Go work for them if you want to become a slave to your work, with high anxiety and blood pressure. If you have a Family you will NEVER see them. Management is required to work 6 days. They only employ 1-2 Tellers per center with endless lines out the door and average 10 hour work days in busy centers. The bankers are constantly bickering and fighting amongst themselves and management over sales and high stress setting. They pay is much higher than all other banks but so is their expectation on results. They cross train employees to perform in different roles but will not always promote so that they don't have to pay a higher salary, in other words they may have a teller that is hybrid banker but is getting paid teller salary to be a banker. They have incentives for meeting sales goals but the sales environment is so toxic no one ever achieves their goals and if they do their colleges hate them for it. There's no work life balance, you clock in at 8am sometimes 7am and leave at 6 or 7pm on busy days. If you call in sick your entire team suffers because of how understaffed all the centers are. If you complain they retaliate. Management can be a hit or miss, if you have a good leader you might tolerate your work settings for short amounts of time till you burn out go on vacation come back rinse and repeat, if you have horrible management you will eventually quit and or be forced out of the company. The benefits are good, but it defeats the purpose of overall employee satisfaction in the workplace. Go work here if you want to die young and bitter."
bad,"During my years with BoA, the upper management was disconnected from reality. The employe turnovers speaks for itself. If you have a HR issue. They are happy to cover up a problem instead of doing what is correct and ethical."
bad,"Horrible experience after working with the company for nearly 7 years. Upper Management does not care and it’s all a political game. Staffing is horrible, you will be left with 2 tellers on a busy Friday and Saturday. The company has great health benefits and paid time off but that’s all. I was treated irreplaceable after 7 years and that’s what I was."
bad,Typical day at work is to be handed a mail bin of checks for processing.  You validate data on check and scan to capture image.  Work volumes are at times very high.
bad,Too mucjh gossip & backstabbing. Emvious co worker lies too much & aiways texting and talking on the phone. The operations manager didn't mind because she is a friend & according to her she is the lead teller & so whatever she says goes She orders & buys from the company computer & no one can stop her. They get mad at me when i have food but they don't get mad at het evem ig
bad,I wouldnt recommend this employeer to anybody unless you enjoy a cookie cutter job and can handle the stress of people constantly belittling you......
bad,This place is a joke it robs people blind and then won’t give them the fees back. And the man that did 9/11 bought is plane lessons with Bank of America credit cards
bad,Very stressful work environment . The managers and supervisors we're great . Corporate made it very hard to succeed at this job . Always changing rules so you never know what is allowed or not allowed on a call. Not worth the stress
bad,no way to get around it and they will discriminate you if you are not on board with them to do their business. everyone is trying to benefit from others.
bad,Really only one thing BofA cares about......MONEY. If clients came in with customer service type questions you were told to put them in touch with the call center so they could answer questions. I was to stay visible on the floor driving sales.
bad,"Advancement within the company is encouraged an supported. Great benefits, very innovative and tech savvy. Employee loyalty is important as well as client experience"
bad,"Sweat shop. management was always keeping an eye on you.  when you went to the restroom or on break your time away was monitored and timed.  People were written up for going to the rest room too often.  Team leaders looked at what a person wore to work.  I had to go to HR for help when my team lead told me that my dress casual shoes were not aloud.  HR advised her to back off and take a look at the tight clothes she was wearing. We were not allowed to talk to each other.  Top management advised that management and associates were not allowed to take breaks or lunch together, if caught would be written up.  Management started leaving separately and meeting up in the parking.  Every day we waited to see who would me walked out before 10 am.  If you were still at you desk at 10:01 you were safe for another day."
bad,"Horrible to work for, awful awful and disgusting. Mgrs with zero knowlege"
bad,"The mortgage related divisions are an absolute nightmare. If you are a mortgage professional or someone interested in a finance career, look elsewhere. "
bad,"They are a very difficult company to please. No matter what you do it’s never the right way.  They change policy to manipulate the employees’ bonus negatively.  Quality will make sure to monitor a call that has opportunities to improve because they don’t want you to bonus. The managers are never on the same page. Bottom line, benefits and pay are great but it’s not worth it."
bad,Spent the majority of my day on the computer looking at accounts and handling any escalated customer calls. The workplace culture is not very professional or politically correct. The owners definately had their favorite employees and those people didn't have to work as hard or follow the same rules. They did not give merit raises or cost of living increases and the bonus for non-sales employees was low for the industry.
bad,"work load was light or non existent on some days"
bad,"upper management and HR was the worst to work with."
bad,Be careful of the things you say and how well you work. If you don’t have the “look” but exceed within your job title you might be in jeopardy if retaliation by colleagues.
bad,"We stopped getting rewarded for a good job, but always received write up for a not so good performance.  Management would look for ways to fire their employees.  I lost a lot of good friends, co workers, and good associates because of 1 mishap.  "
bad,The environment was not a pleasurable working one. They were always looking for a reason to let people go instead of encouraging people to shoot for the stars.
bad,Okay company to work for I started off as a personal banker & ended up as a Sr Relationship Manager. Very busy & stressful. There all about the numbers.
bad,Great Training program.  Company overall is a FRAUD.  They act as thought they are better then everyone meanwhile the Bull failed because of greed and poor management.
bad,There are far too many employee turn overs within the company. Managers that lack training. BOA is only concerned with the Hispanic base of customers.
bad,"None.....No additional comments on BOA its just a place that I would not work again. Lack of appreciation and value for employees and managers and they are Always laying off."
bad,Nothing good to say about this company.  The staff was rude and no training was given so i would be successful at my job.  I would not recommend working there
bad,"Of course customer service is a key here at BofA but there are the times that you wish that you did not have to take it.  Also the Bank asks a lot of ""extras"".  A lot of up sales."
bad,Customer service skills are good to have no matter which field you specialize in. BOA is a great company to work for the environments is fast pace and ever changing!
bad,I had an incident where a coworker circled my picture that had the workgroup in it and they wrote money next to my picture. Complained but nothing was done. I quit shortly after that.
bad,Difficult or disruptive employees were not dealt with by management.  Any kind of behavior was acceptable as long as they met their sla.  No advancement opportunities and no development by managers.  It was every man/woman for themselves.
bad,Bank of America took over Countrywide in 2009. I stayed for 2 additional years thinking things would settle down. Unfortunately it only got worse the manager that hired me left the company 2 days before my 2 week resignation was up.
bad,"Bank of America Corporation is a multinational banking and financial services corporation headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is ranked 2nd on the list of largest banks in the United States by assets."
bad,"Bank of america had great training opportunities, almost always promotes within. Management does a good job at rewarding employees for hard work. Jobs are difficult to do, due to strict regulations business procedures are constantly changing and work is always closely monitored. Easy to be written up for day to day mistakes as company risks being fined should procedural mistakes be done in the banking industry."
bad,"Any time you can call your employees in a room and tell them they are laid off with no warning. That is poor leadership and some of the most devoted and hard working people were laid off, due to the intimidation of their intelligence and work ethic. If you looking for stability steer clear of BOA."
bad,"Being a teller is fine. Being an ""automated teller"" is a whole different story. BofA had yet to perfect their system when i started working as an ATA operator. It sucked"
bad,"This training program has a lot of potential to be great, but unfortunately it lacks in the area of direction. You often times felt left alone to sort out what your job was."
bad,"Culture was terrible. People were ok. Pay was terrible.  There was nothing enjoyable about working here. Most difficult part of the job was dealing with the complaining from the people you work with. Horrible company to work for, not concerned with employees in any way, just making a buck."
bad,This is where I began to learn about the mortgage field and work with loan documents... I learned what each document was and how to apply it to buying a home
bad,I was new at banking.  Not good training for a new teller.   They threw me to the wolves.  I have moved up to a teller supervisor at another bank since.   Bank of American has bad training.
bad,You have to be crazy to work for this crooked company. No appropriated pay. discrimination on race. micro management. Dealing with rude clients. awful
bad,Bank of America acquired the company I was working for. Initially there was hope that this would be a better opportunity and environment but that did not happen. Things went from bad to worse.
bad,Very high sales goals.  Regular nightly sales call meetings were held and sales were high pressure. Manager and staff were nice but overall stressful place to work.
bad,"The longer I worked there, the more difficult they made it to earn a bonus. They also reduced the amount of bonuses every year I was there, only to fatten the pockets of their CEO."
bad,This company was very demanding but not rewarding nor encouraging to work for. This Bank was LaSalle Bank which was taken over by Bank of America. They asked me to stay but I eventually left and would not return.
bad,"I felt terrible for the customers. My first day on the job, I was calling on files that had been sitting in a drawer for over 18 months!"
bad,"There is no downtime, you are constantly on the grind. The clients are always having a problem and most are rude. The bank has lots of hidden fees that they don't disclose outright."
bad,"Overall worst case management. Most times they knew when you left to the restroom. Just a unwelcoming experience from the beginning."
bad,"Working for Bank of America, the people and management is very unprofessional, when your telling them something they accuse you of lying. They play favorites and pick and choose who they want to work there."
bad,"My 27 year experience at Norstar Bank/Fleet Bank/Bank of America was overall a good one..  I did a lot of different jobs from sorting actual checks to working in an office setting with some the best people around.  We had experience, continutity, relabiltity, and a honest like for one another.  The amount of work we had was normal, but dealing with high upper management was the most differcult simply because you did not know what to expect from them.  I learned how to work as a team, and that is why I am the ultimate teram player, willing to anything and everything to get the job done.  The most enjoyable part of the job is coming in and seeing familiar faces that i was fortunate to work with for a long time."
bad,I do not believe in stating the negative experiences I had with this company. I will just say this is a learning experience.
bad,this is a good job for ppl without a family I learn a lot about fraud  and this company does a lot for the community and is a good company to work for  a lot of changes.
bad,Bank of America is a great company to work for.  I have enjoyed my years of service with them.  I am currently looking to relocate and that is why I am currently seeking employment else where.
bad,Bank of America is a great placed to work with great opportunity to advance if you are liked.  i have learned a great number of things in the mortgage field i did not know before.  Management and coworker are very friendly will mangers do show favoritism.  which you have a hard time to advance
bad,"Learned a lot about the mortgage field and purchasing a home. Good customer service in the building. Comfortable envirnorment. Good place to work, beside the managers."
bad,Nice place with humble people. Excellent technologies but policies are weak. Decisions made as per market sometimes look haphazard.
bad,"Worked here as a customer marketing sales specialist. Was told that this position was mostly customer service was some sales. Once you go through training you'll find that it is 100% sales. You have no idea what your sales goal is or how close you are to meeting it, once you make a sale you're just told to ""keep going"". Management is terrible with helping you achieve goals. You have to force people in applying for credit cards that they don't need and will not benefit from. If a customer is calling upset about something you're still expected to try and make a sale despite the company making an error."
bad,Long hours and no customer connection. It was always trying to push something a customer did not need or want. Long hours for personal bankers.
bad,"Completely number driven and very hostile work environment, Company use a scheduling system and any deviation can be cause for write up or lost pay. Your schedule can be 4 to 5 hours straight without a break and not being able to move from the phone with nonstop calls and no restroom breaks.  Incentive shrouded in secrecy with constantly changing number with multiple goals to meet (over 20). This make inventive pay out rare and small. Management does not care about employees.  The goal is to use them up and move on to the next batch. Within 10 months my training class of 25 were all gone but 1."
bad,"Limited growth opportunity and recognition. Compensation is alright with a chance to earn bonus, but the products are too expensive and not often the best option for the consumer. Environment is loud and unprofessional."
bad,Ripping people off. Very bad management. Defrauding the shareholders. Charging to much for nothing. People are making fun of clients.
bad,"Will never go back to banking, I have moved on and bank of America is one of the worst banks to work for. have nothing more to say"
bad,"My boss always made it clear he never wanted to be there and was always vocal about how rubbish the place was and that was such a cheesy place to work. He always made sure he was 'seen to be' doing work and the amount of times he 'worked from home' and then came in next day to say he got all jobs done round the house was unreal!!!! And all for just logging on to send one email to your team...again being 'seen' to be working..what a joke..they then got in a load.of contractors who were highly paid who didnt know the job and just cherry picked the work just to meet their targets which was then re-allocated to me the next day, the work they didnt want to do!!when i raised this i was told its the way it is...the managers are all puppets hiding behind red tape..very 2 faced and nasty..if you were a favourite you were laughing and you were given roles with no targets...what a joke"
bad,The most difficult part of this job was juggling the needs of my clients against my own personal needs.  Merrill Lynch promoted their own financial derivatives and expected their wealth managers to sell those products to clients - even when those products were not the right investment.
bad,"I picked the ""1"" star rating, only because that is the lowest number to choose from. If you want a slave driven, underpaid, non-empathetic place to work, then Bank of America would be your dream job. Don't fall for the ""FMLA"" if you have a sick spouse, child, or parent because it is an absolute joke. The bonus structure can usually be achieved by those who are in management OR supervisor positions and you almost have to take calculus to know why OR why you were not rewarded for your hard work within the MATRIX. I once had a perfect month on my ""scorecard"" in which I had 0 errors and had several upsales for products for the company, but was marked down by ONE POINT that kept me from getting a large bonus, due to I did not stick with the call script on a difficult call, which I was able to complete successfully! and also sold a credit card! I have nothing good to say about my years with Bank of America. Very disorganized. Please do not apply unless you want to be dummied down in ridiculous office politics."
bad,"Although the culture is full of policies and procedures, it is also conducive to career growth and development.  Very fun place to work."
bad,"My job experience with BOA, has been a positive one."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was no Tension or no Hurry. Only Easy & Safe Job.
bad,"Management is push, push, push.  No concern about the customer, only the mighty dollar."
bad,Just do not work in the branch center. Sale..sale...sale..sale.
bad,Overall poor experience with this company.  Disappointed in how they view and treat their associates on all levels.
bad,Good place with good benefits but no opportunity for advancement.My overal rating is not satisfactory.
bad,"My responsibility was heavy inbound and outbound calls, heavy retention and dissolving customer accounts. Also, extremely great organization skills.. I learned how to wear many hats dealing with different personality in resolving customers accounts. Truly best great performance you can give customers is honesty and follow up. I worked well with management, good direction and minimal supervision. I worked well with others and was a great team player.  The hardest for me is showing empathy in extreme divert situation having to be the voice of reason to calm down irritate customers."
bad,"Bank of America is a typical financial giant.  I had difficulty with their lack of ethics regarding low-income customers. They encouraged us to sell credit products to customers who understood little about credit in general, didn't need/want credit, and were ultimately not going to use the cards responsibly."
bad,This is the worst comapny to work for. They rip off there customers and also force employees to do the same
bad,"I always enjoyed working with fellow associates, did not enjoy working for the company.  Poor wok life balance"
bad,"Portfolio  Management – Manage and oversee the organization’s high productive relationships for the HIG Texas Region. To give guidance on industry trends and present or oversee training for clients. Offer suggestions for operational  improvements, all while building a stronger relationship between the client and my organization. Proactive visit with clients are set twice a year for: relation building, project discussion, finance conversation and more. "
bad,Review active client files for fees/costs which require documentation ensure that the appropriate records are available for each fee/cost requiring documentation submit clients file in a timely fashion
bad,"BOA is a good company to work for. Great Benefits. Tuition and childcare reimbursement. There are layoffs every once in a while, But for the most part it is a stable job."
bad,helping with customer financial needs and interacting with occurring problems finding the best soulations to met customer needs
bad,"As a teller I was responsible for cashing/ depositing checks. I was also involved with sales. I was the face of the company. I learned how to treat customers with utmost respect. (This was my first job.) My store manager was absolutely horrible! She was verbally abusive and would send me home crying all the time telling me things like I'm ""ugly"", and ""you need to go do something about your hair. It looks trashy."" My assistant managers on the other hand were GODSENDS. My coworkers were okay. They wouldn't stick up to her. That was the hardest part of my job. I LOVED my customers! I would have my own line of customers waiting to be assisted by me."
bad,"I started out as a closer, input and process all closing docs, review and approve huds, review all funding docs and ordered wires. I then was promoted to processing where I process oans approved by u/w, cleared conditions, reviewed customer income/assets documenation, resolved title issues, appraisal disputes and coordinated closing activities. Mce certification obtained in 2008."
bad,"MBNA was so much better than this company,they came in laid off pretty much all legacy MBNA people.Bank od america does not care about anyone but themselves."
bad,The company does not seem to care at all about the permanent or contracted workers.
bad,"outbound calls, helped customers with mortgage relief and tried to get them to be able to stay in their homes. hardest part of the job was when the coompany had a deadline to meet and we didn't meet it we were told by management to inform the customers that we never recieved their paperwork. i enjoyed the co workers and the schedule."
bad,"They started out as a fantastic company to work for then, well, you know the rest."
bad,"•	Level 3 underwriting authority up to $1 million"
bad,"CONs:"
bad,"good career, good place to work.  great benefits and good people"
bad,position held was a hybrid for telco support and IT and made day interesting
bad,"The West Hills call center site has been one the best call center I’ve worked in, the leadership team is very supportive and easy to work with, not a day went by that I was not challenged to come up with new and innovative ways to do my job."
bad,the company is not in anyone's best interest with the exception of share holders.
bad,boa lacked in training and was not very well in the training process.
bad,Answered customer phone calls for a bank. The questions were based on personal accounts - checking and savings.
bad,"Call center environment, customer service, handle fraud issues"
bad,guidelines constatly changing to where your afraid to complete anything for fear you will fail the quailiy check.
bad,"Not very friendly to work at that level, very non flex timings, days off and shift timings goes only by personal preferences of the higher authorities, very demanding w/ fine lines"
bad,This company did a lot of bad things to customers. I don't think they have a high ethics code in anything that they do or stand for. they kept changing peoples positions so they would not have to give them raises or allow them to move locations. It was a dis-serves to those who worked their and those were patrons.
bad,"BOFA is the most chaotic, disastrous environment I have ever been around. Their mortgage division is losing tons of money, and the management and executives do nothing to fix the problems. Their idea of making their numbers is just to fire a bunch of workers at the end of the year.Their pull through ratio on loans is only 25%. Be very careful before you decide to go work here.They will paint a very different picture of what it's like to work there!"
bad,"Very fast passed. All about reach branch goals. I have not worked there in 8 years. Not comfortable reviewing Bank of American. I feel they are always short staff, leaving for a bad customer experience"
bad,Management doesn't take the time to get to know anyone outside of their corporate office. There is no room for advancement. Not the best place to work unless you love office gossip.
bad,"A typical day at work at Bank of America, for me, would include:"
bad,Each day was different
bad,"Disorganized, ridiculous expectations of employees. Poor leadership and serious lack of communication from management"
bad,Management rude and don't care about employee advancement nor cares about keeping employee's. Decides to write certain people up for small things but let other people get away with anything regardless of how bad it is.
bad,"I enjoyed working as a Inventory management, this was a motivational job that kept me working. I enjoyed this job although it was Seasonal, I seen this job very promising or a job that I would see myself doing permanently."
bad,I enjoyed working at Bank of America a good place to work. good insurance.
bad,Greedy company. does not care about employees. great benefits
bad,"Management was super unprofessional, tried to push her political views on employees, and the work place was also unprofessional dealing with other employees personal issues was daily."
bad,"I loved working for Bank of America at first.  Management was great and there was lots of opportunities to move up in the company.  Bank of America merged with a few companies and once that happened, it was very difficult to do my job.  They were doing things like lowering people's credit card limits without notifying them as well as assessing ridiculous fees on customer's accounts. "
bad,"in collections its a high pace, fast growing environments with great people and mangers to work with."
bad,"It is mandatory to to reach your day goal, otherwise  manager will verbally abuse use. You can leave to office wanting to cry. If you box at to end of the day is other or under. you must find the error. not doing so will cost you your job. You will not get paid for the overtime you spent in the banks fixing the box."
bad,Do not work here. This company does not give incentives like the other banks or credit unions. I would not recommend working here because there is no way to advance in this company.
bad,"Bank of America had a descent work environment and a good training program for their employees. They had really good health benefits, sick time off and PTO"
bad,Had a great time during my tenure of 15 years with BOA/Merrill Lynch.  Great company to work with great culture and professionalism.  Learnt a lot over the years.
bad,"I would receive emails with assigned work or pull from the newest system BofA received, once the loans were assigned I would review the loan for all completed docs received from the borrower(s), if the required docs were not all received I would then send the loan back to process support. If the required docs were all received I would calculate all the required income, enter it into the system and submit the information to the next level. "
bad,"Great culture and great people, but no expectation of stability.  Didn't feel secure since I was laid off in initial assignment and two subsequent contracts were cut short for budget reasons."
bad,This company allowed me an opportunity and I gladly accepted the position.  I learned a lot of skills and knowledge about the loans in depth.  I feel as if I could go anywhere from here.
bad,I love working for Bank of America which is why I stayed for twelve years. I get to experience to work with different kinds of people that gave me wisdom to face them easily. A really great place to work in and a really flexible schedule for people who needs it.
bad,"Love the job the environment the people, great benefits and supportive management! Great company to have a long term career."
bad,Outstanding opportunities to learn grow and move within the organization.  Flexible work schedules.... community/team atmosphere.
bad,Create a welcoming atmosphere for bank customers. Introduce customers to a variety of financial products and services to fulfill their needs. Utilize interpersonal skills to provide a positive customer experience.
bad,"The institution has strong process, and procedure, yet  plagued with unqualified managers, who micromanage, and were unable to effectively provide coaching and feedback."
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"Worked their for 3.10 years.  Awful management and awful compensation forced a lot of co-workers to resign.  Now their outsourcing to North Carolina and more people are abandoning ship.  Closing Reg department up here to cut cost.  Worked over 10 hours a day no room for advancement and a culture of sucking up to move up.  A lot of people left after being promoted.  End of year comp. was a massive joke <$1K were my bonuses and raises.  Upper management replaced people who were qualified for their positions with totally unqualified candidates and gave them promotions for doing no work and leaving others with massive work loads.  My suggestion avoid at all cost their quoted yearly salaries are not true and their bonus are massive jokes.  You want to go somewhere to have the possibility to loose your job and get over worked and educe stress related health issues then by all means work for them.  One last issue, if going to some corporate meeting about D&I or some other nutty show item is optional you will be told to take 2+ hours out of your work day and forced to go and work much later into the evening even though to begin with the meeting was optional to attend."
bad,Disrespectful of employees and their opinions and desire to improve job responsibilities. Not flexible in scheduling. Not enough breaks during each day.
bad,"Highly stressful and competitive environment with no concern for life balance."
bad,"Contractors are 2 class citizen at the bank, manager normally talks down to his team. I considered I am one of the team members, but they don't think. It is a surviving for the fulltime, and off shore resource save money but big risk in security management."
bad,Decent company but definitely a lot of opportunities to be a better environment for the associates. The company  gives good benefits and has enough resources for you to succeed.
bad,n/a--I don't like it..its very stressful and the pay is not worth dealing w/being micro managed and dealing w/the clients on the phones......................................................................
bad,"Not used to turning down business. Investor has to have $250,000 to invest otherwise you can't do business. Hated being in the office each day making calls to scrubbed list. Not used to being in an office without interaction with customers."
bad,"Worked very long days, manager was not easy to work for , they were unorganized. Had to self teach myself because no-one wanted to help. but the building had a great cafeteria"
bad,The pay rate for the job duties with out of balance and extremely low compared to other financial institutions.   There was not a whole lot of room for advancement.
bad,"Worked at the 200 Park Avenue location. Great experience in-terms of learning product knowledge and process to open new accounts. However, the culture of the office is dog eat dog. No loyalty and a lot of complacency."
bad,Stay away from ELT team. There are bunch of mediocre folks trying to ruin it for talented people. Highly political environment. No work life balance in the team.
bad,"there is no life/work balance, multiple conference calls, goals are extremely high, keep in mind I have always been a top performer, but the goals here are way to high."
bad,Management had cliches with other co-workers and were very harsh on outsiders.  I liked talking and helping regular customers.  Bank was bought over by Ameris Bank.
bad,"Management was terrible, I knew more about the job then my boss.  She always came to me for help.  I did enjoy the busy work.  My team was fun and kept the day going."
bad,"The management has lots of room for improvements. Co-workers are the best. High pressure, sales! sales! sales! if you could sell, then you will have bright future at ML"
bad,Worst place to work for! I would never advise anyone to work there. Bank of America does not help it's customer nor it's employees.
bad,Merrill Lynch is a great place as long as its the right situation.  You need be hired on a team to have any success.
bad,to process driven to get any work done.  projects to be approved by person's not understanding the job requirements and do not have the experience.
bad,"Busy office, team work environment, good management.  Every day provide the must excellent service to our homeowner and at the end be able to provide the help they need."
bad,"They treat employees like cattle. or new born children. "
bad,"Unfortunately, this is the type of company that tells you, you need to leave your brain outside the building. They expect you to say that 2+2=5 when we all know it's ""4"". I couldn't work with people that didn't know what they were doing and they expect you to be dishonest and unethical."
bad,"Bank of america had me work 40+ hrs as a part time, then occasionally cut me back to 20hrs, i didnt make enough for health insurance, also they promise you the opportunity to advance and yu work your hardest and never grant you the position . horrible bank to bank with horrible company to work for"
bad,"work was fast pace dealing with collections, learned to deal with different types of customers"
bad,The company hired a lot of people just to file the sites and it made working there hard.
bad,"Serviced and collected, via inward call channel, up-to-date and delinquent relationships consisting of deposit accounts, credit cards, loans, and mortgages. Also determined customer's reason for default, assessed financial demographics, and discussed and implemented solutions for curing the entire portfolio on a hierarchy of financial priority."
bad,A typical day at work was to research and QC work. I also made calls and research if law firms had the Notes to a mortgaga. I learn the importants to make sure that I check all places a Note could be to save the company money.
bad,The FA I worked for was a bully and due to his high production the CRM and HR team let him get away with it.  The pay is horrible as well in FL and MA.
bad,"Lack of support. Most Loans denied. Bank Partners only care about making their referrals, born the quality or if it goes through. There is No Paid Vacation or Sick Time. No overtime But you are expected to work weekends and the weekly night calls. Terrible company,"
bad,"Be extremely cautious and think twice before applying to a job located in San Antonio for BofA’s MBOD segment. BofA is an excellent company but MBOD is a terrible operation run by incompetent managers. Morale is so bad their MBOD scores low all the time. The work culture is poor and inclusiveness is a pipe-dream. It is a very negative environment to work in. BofA needs to get HR in there and clean house. "
bad,It was a very cut throat and hostile environment. Management is very spiteful and vendictive always looking for a reason to put you down and Jealous of accomplishments and prestigious college attended. Chef recycle food paid for but not used at event then served at other events which is a violation.
bad,"Not worth the effort. Many better,smaller organizations.theybwant to rule the world with the tarp money they took.they force their opinion on employees"
bad,"Zero work life balance culture. The hardest part of the job is the tight deadline with no support or training. Also, a lack of appreciation from management."
bad,Management is a issue at all banks. everyone abuses their power and the people who work the hard get fired the quickest. They want you to harass the customers daily
bad,If you have To possibility to apply and are offered a job I would recommend declining. No work life balance. Goals are unrealistic. You meeting your goals is contingent on the customer doing everything when they leave. If they don’t follow through you get nothing. Do not take the relationship manager position. It is a glorified sales associate.
bad,"Unfortunately bank America does not want to do mortgage loans,but they have to, so they don't they do everything they can not to complete a loan.   From my experience management was not focused on the client or the employee but always on the bottom line.  There definitely is a balance between all 3 but not at BOA."
bad,"Bank of America offers a lot of vacation time, which is needed because the amount of stress endured while working there. I'm sure some branches are different, however the goals that are require to meet from tellers to bankers, is extremely disproportionate to the amount of customers you have. And, if you finally meet your sale goals, there is no pat on the back, they just grow for the following month."
bad,"Too focused on sales and credit cards. Good for someone who enjoys selling and pressuring customers to get other products, people were great but management sucked."
bad,"Wealth management is different for every complex in the company and differs from other arms of BOA. The complex I was in for wealth management saw a 97% clip of their advisors not make it out of the first year, that was the case all 4 years I was there. The compensation structure is complicated by design and results in you making minimal for a larger amount of work and hurdles to hit. Their Training program, PMD, still stands as the worst training program I have seen in the industry."
bad,I feel like the bank put too much pressure on the staff for sales. Threatening their jobs if they don meet their unrealistic goals. Customer service should be the driver. Not sales and cold calling.
bad,No respect for employees.  Extremely poor management.  Most there just considered it a paycheck . . . just put in 8 hrs.   They could not care less about there customers either.
bad,"The staff meaning co-workers will make or break the work atmosphere. You will always have 1 of a few who will ride the wave of do less, scam and get lucky to get all the walk -ins or make goal.  The managers vary some can be micro-types or very good but have not been given the opportunity to be place in a higher position because they really are for the team members. The turn -over rate is high in my opinion due to the fast-food type style training. Every one learns differently, and it's not truly disclosed to you until you get there. Sitting in front of a computer all day. Mind you the computer might be in an open area accessible to fellow co-workers and it can be quite distracting.  There is also a chance you will have to hope from desk to desk or computer to computer which makes things hard also even doing your absolute best to focus. The star workers who you might shadow will not always be willing to show you the ropes. some feel you are spying and others will go over and beyond to help, so speak up in advance if you do and don't fear not following the chain of command, your job is on the line. Speak up  while and prior to on-boarding to the center. This is to make sure you are 100% comfortable and feel you have learned what is necessary to do your job because when your rooky quarter is over and you don't preform you will be out before you can pop a bottle to celebrate your one year anniversary (11 months max). If you are driven by sales and will not take no for an answer to why someone needs another credit card (because you know best) then this will be a great place. There"
bad,"Still very old school in conducting day-to-day operations.  Also, they have an incredibly slow and difficult time allowing the financial advisors to hire technical talent for their teams or allow financial advisors to differentiate based on technical chops and performance."
bad,"not appreciated "
bad,"There are no advancement opportunities for anyone over 40. When you apply for a job the application seems to go into a black hole and you don't get a response back for months.They treat you like furniture  They don't clean the office, the place is filthy. They will not spend any money to fix broken office equipment such as desk drawers and chairs."
bad,Company simple cares about what you can do for them. Not your growth or work life balance  teams are under staffed and clients are frustrated. Move on
bad,"This position was not explained well. It is a call center position, where you take incoming calls. Coworkers are money hungry sharks that will do anything to get more money. People will use others and do shady things behind their back, so always watch out. You can perform great, but management will harp on you if you take longer than a 15 minute break. If you are late more than 1 minute, you will be written up. You have set a schedule and you must adhere to the times of when to take a break, when to take lunch, etc., there is no flexibility. Management is like robots, they do as they are told to protect themselves and don't question any of the business practices. Even though you work in 1 big room, don't expect any of your co-workers to greet you in the morning. Everyone is out to fend for themselves making the working environment uncomfortable. They do hire within, but that is after years in the same job. The repetitiveness of the job will make you go crazy. Pay is ok, no room for negotiating."
bad,This positions requires a lot from its employees but does not compensate them in a manner that they deserve. You will work late hours and sometimes early mornings. You will do all your work as they have trained you to do and sometimes do it better and it still will not be enough. They hire management that does not know more then the team. they also write you up for things that don't make sense like not using a system enough even when you don't need it. they also want you to hit certain numbers a day but don't even look at them and you get in trouble.
bad,"Don't waste your time you will not be valued after many years of being employed its a slap in the face you are not appreciated. Now that i am older i have no where else to work, i sent 40 plus years of my life with bank of america for nothing to show we are nothing but numbers"
bad,"very stressful  environment, not very friendly coworkers, poor management, the hardest part of the job was always been very focused on the transactions and try best to help customers."
bad,"As with any organization there are areas and people who foster good relationships. Unfortunately, the experiences can be short lived as perpetual management changes are imminent as with the relationships to go with them.  Opportunity to learn a lot both positive, when working with the good managers of which there are a few, and negative as negative experiences are learning opportunities as well."
bad,"Contractors are made to work their a** out. While the full timers sit and have their fun(Most of the time). And for all the weird reasons, H1b Visa workers are treated like slaves, and are only brought in when needed, and squeeze the juice out of them and thrown out when the work is done."
bad,"Very competitive for a Registered Representative and only those who have large networks, work long hours, and possess a great people personality will make it beyond training. You will sell more of their product instead of helping the client meet their goals with the best product for them. The company will use you for long hours and, unless you make it through onboarding, will also have access to all the contacts you provided them during training."
bad,This was a temporary to perm position. My employment was under a staffing agency (Horizon Staffing). I wasn't actually working for Bank of America. It was a joy working with my co-workers.
bad,"Doing work of other employees as well as your own. While witching these employees walk around laughing, talking and doing nothing. Very poor mangement"
bad,with bank of america it was difficult to understand the program. there was too many places to look for an answer that the customer was having. when we would ask for help they wanted to see the steps you took to find the answer. so you would have to show your layout and have the customer on hold. when they monitor your talk time / hold time in the end of the week you would end up getting a write up if it was past the time that was given to you.
bad,Poorly managed and very little care for those who work there. In my view after my experience they should not be allowed to share the colors that represent our company. I could never work nor recommend doing business with the organization. Their actions and the way they treated people were criminal-only most were too poor to fight this large organization.
bad,I found this place very stressful to work at.  I often had to perform work outside of my job description and management was not concerned with work life balance.  It was a good way to get my foot in the door of the banking world but otherwise was a harsh environment.
bad,"Employee has to train a lot of hours every month and there is a lot of pressure to produce results, the problem is that they expect the same results from loan officers in low income areas as the high income areas."
bad,"from day one you are not given proper training and are held to same metrics as other leaders in a 3 year span our line of buisness went through three diffrent change in job roles and no real deep dive for the leaders to get proper training ."
bad,My department was below average in employee support and workplace culture. A watch-your-back environment.  Managers apparently were insecure and mine made sure contractors were as well.  The lack of respect for contract employees was shocking.
bad,Je ne souhaite pas de donner des avis. Expérience dure.
bad,"Bank of America is a very structure company when it comes how they run the company. As a retail banker it was totally different. they don't have a great training problem everything is virtue. banking is very hands on and it definitely needs some hands on training. also the work life balance is horrible, you don't really have the flexible to vacation when you want and also you are always getting called in on your off days because its such a high turn over rate.. Upper management doesn't understand giving employees time off or even trying to work with them on there weekly schedule unless it benefits them. Don't ever call out sick, because if you do you can potentially get written up... regardless of the situation."
bad,Works employees hard its not about the welfare of the employees to do their job efficiently its about bringing in numbers for the company to keep them afloat
bad,Management is only concerned with their best interest and do not build a culture to work as a team and better the bank as a whole. Unfortunate that your most valuable asset (employees) were/are not appreciated.
bad,"-Long hours"
bad,not a fun place to work. For those individuals in IT you need to move to Charlotte if you plan on having you career go anywhere.
bad,Do not come into this company as an entry level employee if your resume and skills are more commensurate with a higher level of employment.
bad,A typical day for us was longer than usual we learned about other procedures and other duties. Management was extremely busy most of the time. some of the co-workers were nice and some who were not. The hardest part of the job was doing every one else's job and the most enjoyable for me was engaging and interacting with the customers.
bad,When it was Lasalle Bank it was much more of a local feel and management was supportive and helped it's employees but when BOA took over in 2007 that all went out the window they took everything away that made it a local bank and would not pay the the transation employees the proper pay when they merged thay also would not pay lasalle converted workers any bonus the management was a comp;ete joke they changed branch managers at least 3 times  within one year.
bad,"Virtual daily changes within processes, management changes frequently, lack of direction of company, lack of logical workflow, management by reporting."
bad,"Most enjoyable part is your coworkers and friendly customers"
bad,"Workflows are very incosistant, no stability, management not knowlegable, no fair practices to customers. "
bad,"even though there are great benefits, they do not treat their people like people. we are simply a number. I like some of the people, and some management know what they are doing and work. But mostly all management are in it for themselves and dont look out for their employees. No security what so ever."
bad,I was told the training process was excellent and if I had the chance to do it properly I know I would have done much better but I was in my opinion thrown into my position being told by the Manager I train the best here never saw that happen with me. I did really good with the customer even got several letter from customer on my performance even save some big accounts. As a Christian I was also made uncomfortable because of my faith. Management seems to be overwhelmed with work and when something does not go right they look for some one to blame. Again in my opinion if you are in charge what goes wrong is you fault after all you are running things are you not?  I really enjoy working with people but and like helping to the best of my ability.
bad,Racist firm to work for if you are a minority.  Great opportunity if you come from a white collar family with a lot of connects.  Forces POA program participants to parasite off of your own family.
bad,they do not care if you have kids .they give you a horrible shift and you deal with it.
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,"Management team has/had a ""Bully"" style management approach.  Employment experience was not what I would expect from a ""Bank of America""."
bad,just a job there is not a lot to tell you would have to experience for your self
bad,"I started out great moved up quickly until someone found a personal reason not to like me. "
bad,"•	Worked in a high volume, deadline and production driven call center environment"
bad,Assisting team mates and home owners with questions in regurads to there mortgage and escrow
bad,"if boa  never closed down,  I would still be working there because it did give us good benefits & it was close to where I live. "
bad,My direct manager was great but her manager was so bad she left. Then the quality of work went downhill.
bad,"Worked on defaulted home loans. Management not that great, stability of job was not good."
bad,A typical day at work consist of answering phone calls and assisting the borrowers with their mortgage needs. If I am unable to assist I reach out to my departments for further assistance. Management is not alway precise with the information given which causes further confusion and misinformation. My coworkers are too frustrated with the miscommunications. The hardest part with work is all the miscommunication and misinformation provided. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I know I have educated a borrower and empowered them to make them better home owners
bad,Strong customer focus along with accuray and attention to details.
bad,"I worked as a temp in a Bank of America facility for 2 years. The atmosphere was tense and competitive. The ""bank"" employees were combative and suspicious of one another. The person I worked for and myself were the only ones in our department and we answered only to HQ in Charlotte. For that I was very grateful."
bad,Not a good environment for productivity. A member of Management was walking around yelling at co-workers to speed up the calls and help more customers.
bad,"Micro managed every steps.Minimal staffing. Overwhelmingly stressful. 95% of work, routine and behavior design to generate more sales & revenue. Work & life balance is non existence. NO EXCUSE & highly accountable environment regardless of realistic challanges."
bad,"very political environment. lack of communication at the management level, new to Agile world and team structure is not appropriate to scale agile standard, crowded and poor workplace sitting arrangement for contractors"
bad,"Customer service comes second, sales come first. Employees are made pressured to sale sale sale, causing the customers to get products they don't know anything about or don't want."
bad,"Workplace culture is not collaborative desired, but do what you can to get by until you get a different position, get laid off or retire.  Rewards were given to those who heroically resolved their own problems."
bad,Marketing was the worse department to be in PERIOD. They threatened to fire you if you did not meet sales goals 3 months in a row. I would not recommend this job unless you are excellent at selling someone else borrowed money because credit is just borrowed money.
bad,"Nice colleagues, training is not effective, management are in a competition against each other, creating shift ism."
bad,I was very excited for the opportunity and even planned to move to the area however soon realized I was in a very toxic and unhealthy environment. A real pity for those real nice people that work there and have no other choice.
bad,Very stressful and micro managed and even had a walk-talkie so I can be told that I was with a customer too long and I can be monitored have to review a customer profile before you sit with them and do a second review after you sit with them asked why you sold what to them but judged weather they needed or not
bad,They suck because there attitudes towards their own. And there’s a lot of seniority. Everything is a write up. You can’t even put the wrong clock in time wrong. That’s a write up. If you get my point.
bad,"If your customer doesn't have a minimum of 50,000.00 in an account they are not interested, high pressure sales whether a best fir or not for the customer. Awful place to bank and work ! Killer benefits though, low pay, non-existent raises even if you exceeded your goals. If you want to get lied to work here, they'll hire you at FT but try getting it regularly,,, not gonna happen."
bad,"I was always proud to work for BoA, and Brian Moynihan, in my opinion, is one of the finest CEO's in the United States. That said, the focus is always on quarterly results, and if analyst estimates are not met, employment cuts in all areas will be made. Knowing this, the most incompetent, nastiest employees constantly politically campaign to keep their jobs, while the competent and knowledgeable keep their heads down. The result is, constant brain drain as the most incompetent survive by eliminating the employees they fear the most. As you can imagine, there is constant chaos, stress and frustration - rebuilding and trying to accomplish tasks began years ago by employees no longer with the company. Job security is non existent unless you keep quiet, keep your mouth shut, don't try to advance, don't ask for a raise, and show no ambition, therefore not threatening anyone. This is usually accomplished by women who have sat in the same corner performing the same task for years and years, and are so quiet no one really knows they are there anymore. The majority of everyone else rarely survives more than 5 years."
bad,A typical workday is hectic as the workload is high. I learned how the mortgage industry works. Management is poor and hands off. Workplace culture is high pressured for lower level employees. The most difficult aspect was victimization from mid-management. The most enjoyable aspect is the support of colleagues.
bad,"I worked reviewing loans that had already been funded, the culture wasn't very friendly and the managers were rude and not helpful at all, they formed their own groups and it's hard to feel as if yo are part of the team."
bad,"Experience will be very dependent on the immediate manager.  Most required to work business hours in the office with minimal to no flexibility.  Employees, and especially contractors, are disposable."
bad,"Sweat shops are setup in each department, So management sits and watches the game while they hire visa workers and let them toil, fight and figure out"
bad,"The only positive thing I can say is that they have the greatest health care benefits. The job makes people to compete within your teammates instead of working as a team. Managers are very micromanaged. They track you on everything from clock in/out to how many product you sold everyday. The Call center associates are extremely difficult to deal with, either they dont want to help or just lack of knowledge to help. Most of them dont really care to help the associate when we call in from the branch with the clients because they dont need to face the clients. Overall it is a very stressful working environment."
bad,BofA has a very laid back training approach leaving many unanswered questions when you hit the floor. They are not very friendly and favor those who are bilingual more than anyone else. They do not stand by their employees and have no problem placing blame on someone else's shoulders.
bad,"Working in a call center is not an easy task. You have to deal with different personalities, not only on the phone, but in the office. I enjoy helping others"
bad,"This job was a pressure cooker to the extreme. I cannot think of one aspect of the day-to-day, on-the-job experience that I found enjoyable, insightful or educational."
bad,"During my tenure with this company, i was subjected to working in an extremely stressful work environment. The stress work culture was encouraged by poor management."
bad,"Extremely poor management. Young, cut throat uncaring people with little education and experience. There is no family/work life balance. To them it is all about closings no matter if you're miserable every second of the day. If you're not perceived as agreeing with their mentality they will make your work hours horrific and impossible.  Talking with management is a waste of time, they do not want to hear it."
bad,"They work you like a sweat shop, and they make you work overtime. Management tell you things that will never happen. The work place is dead, and everyone there is just miserable."
bad,"Merrill Lynch has a reputation of hiring and spitting out new financial advisers in order to retain what ever business they procure before they leave.  If you don't have a bunch of wealthy friends willing to invest with you, you won't make it."
bad,"I understand you need a paycheck...but willingly subjecting yourself to the burning fire while working under beelzebub hardly seems worth it.  1 teller in as branch,  unachievable sales goals,  mandatory conference calls throughout the day if goals for the week are not yet met.   APPLY SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
bad,You always had to manage with less staff than you could consistantly function with. Someone sitting thousands of miles away would control and set staffing hours and even the thermostat for the branches.
bad,The work culture is not upbeat and vibrant as it should be.  The leardership team needs more training.  The customer service is lacking and there is no accountability
bad,"On a daily basis your job in being threatened, to much micro management. managers make you feel like your walking on egg shells. I've never worked for a company that has more then  20% of there employee on medically level due to work related stress"
bad,Poor senior management. Very dated processes and thinking. Senior management rules by fear. Very few actual leaders and no room for advancement. While BofA overall had great benefits this division is a black hole within the company.
bad,"BofA may be one of the largest banks in America, but corporate culture is very poor. Management does not know how to gauge their employees' skills and place them where they're of most use. Overall, a bad company to work for."
bad,I worked as a personal banker which was just a sales position.  Bank of America repeatedly showed that they cared far more about additional sales over what was in the customers best interest.  The managers were always just the best sales people and often had no idea how to manage people or preform the job functions beyond sales.
bad,"The work environment at Bank of America was extremely stressful as a lot of overtime was required and unfairly compensated. However, i had a really great boss that ensured that everything that could be done to alleviate stress and promote a healthier work life balance."
bad,Honestly the temporary employees just had to be there to work on time and take breaks on time and we were not invited to department events non holiday lunches.
bad,"I liked the work, however, I didn't like the Senior Financial Advisor of the team I worked for as he was very arrogant and treated the junior FAs and the assistants as if they didn't matter, as if they were disposable.  The management is located in Denver and were very disconnected from what the branch in Colorado Springs needed in order to be a good place to work."
bad,"Stressful place to work. inconsistent management. separated the FC into sales and operations. The bank manger is in charge of the tellers and operations. The bankers report to someone outside the branch, for sales. The Branch manager rated 65% on things that are not within their control. The Sales executives are never in the banking center but the branch manger has no control over the bankers sales but are responsible on paper."
bad,There could have been a better balance between work and life. Management was not very flexible on the schedules. Management was all over the place and never knew what was going on .
bad,Management was not good is assisting there employees in doing better. Horrible hours that were never consistent. Not allowed any over time. When my daughter was sick and I had to stay home they were not understanding in any way.
bad,Everyone but the top producers are expendable.  Even the top producers can be fired without notice if the company is concerned with saving face on a client relationship issue.
bad,"No Respect for their imployees, no Integrity, bonus structure and how to attain it. Micro manage instead of finding solutions. Managers more interested in write ups than reaching the Team Member and making sure we understand the process."
bad,I have worked in various positions at different sites some good some horrible. BOA cares ONLY about their bottom line not their employees which are ONLY numbers and seat fillers.
bad,"The only good thing about this job was the customers. I worked in a small branch and I had a lot of regulars. The bad thing about that was selling to them. Since they were there so frequently, no one wanted anything new. My coworkers and I were always reprimanded for not selling enough of the bank product. There was only so much one can do when you don't see anyone new."
bad,They have the option to relocate you to any of their facilities. Which can be a pain and add to your travel time and commute in the morning. Overall they seem to have a high turn over.
bad,"The culture of the company has changed over the years. The desire to reduce the workforce appears to be driving the management techniques currently in use. Very sad, as it started out with such a great atmosphere."
bad,"Overall a bad place. People are not treated respectfully and there is no illusion that the staff is nothing more than a ""resource"" - a ""thing that can easily be replaced."
bad,"Continuous deadlines to be met, long days and little to no compensation. Through the years, I did learn a lot within different departments. I developed a lot of great and long lasting friendships. The management staff wasn't supportive and was poorly structured."
bad,Some of the people were nice to work with. Never would know from day to day what to expect mood wise from Administration.  Criticized for what you didn't do and never appreciated or recognized for what you did. My day started at 8:30AM and ended at 4:30PM. I would answer calls from clients and assist them in whatever they needed.  The clients were great to work with. I also managed the calendars for the Financial Advisors that I supported. management was poorly run. I learned a bit while I was employed.
bad,Hired for one job and company changed jobs without notice. Hourly pay but was sent home every day at 12 for the first 2 weeks.  Management very confused.  Not departments talk to each other.  Very unorganized place to work.
bad,Constant escalation is needed as processing and underwriting departments do not act or respond otherwise so who your manager is will heavily influence your income. I had good and bad managers while there and it made all the difference in productivity.
bad,"no overtime, only the favorites get weekends off. Unreasonable hours like working 20 hours and 4 hours a day leaving no work life balance. managers would sleep in basement and take long when needed for overrides, would have to sell to customers you see everyday who dont want promotions. only the manager would get a paid out if tellers got 100% on monthly exams. No incentive. no Benefits. Great company to keep money with . not great to work for in the instance i had."
bad,"This position they never stated that the workload would consist of an over 40 hour week to manage. Stressful, all the managers always had me nervous and scared of being fired all day every day. They were no help the last manager just gave up on the team once things got hard but were riding my back. They don't care about your family or kids they just want you to work until they shut down for the night at whatever time that is."
bad,"This company hires and lets people go way to often, to many mgrs. have their favorites.  The company has worked on several things but the stock is very low still that is a concern."
bad,"The group that I previously worked for is no longer there. In my experience when working for Bank of America, your just a number. There is no job security, the pay is awful, and you may get the rug pulled out from under you."
bad,"Poor experience overall. Company has an overzealous compliance department, high minimums, and unrealistic expectations. Furthermore, the company's new policy to not pay commissions on IRA's makes the requirements impossible to hit."
bad,Definitely no growth. Management was horrible. They really don't care about your personal well being. Not a great place
bad,"contract position"
bad,Typical day at work depended on which leader you had at the time. Leadership changes monthly within most organization. This makes scorecard/yearly evaluation very hard for managers to determine because they say because they do not really know you. To me it's just a stall tactic for leadership not to be around. Promotions were not given on how you help the company grow.
bad,"I don't want to fill this out, but twenty words are what is required to complete this stupid form.  It's really a bad way to capture forced feedback from an applicant."
bad,"Customers are not welcomed if they don't have an appointment in this branch. They rather have the tellers do the sales and let the bankers make compensation on it. They don't welcome diversity and mangers preferred to only talk in English with the customers. "
bad,The job will look great on your resume but you won't learn nearly as much about investing as you would hope. Financial Advisors are for the most part focused on bringing in more clients and it is rare for one to be fully committed to teaching you. Look elsewhere if you care more about knowledge than you do about what your resume looks like.
bad,"Legacy Merrill employees are in positions of power.  They tend to be very political and will promote people based on who they like and not who is best for the job.  If you are not in the inner circle you will not be compensated on a fair basis for your work or experience."
bad,"If you have no desire to further your career this is the place for you. Hence, that is why I left the company. Reverse discrimination is rampant and the atmosphere is suffocating."
bad,"This is one of the worst career paths one can take if you are looking for strong management, advancement, and competitive compensation.  You will find none of that here.  Granted there are a few people in Military Bank Overseas Division that this negative review do not apply to and it is unfortunate that these bright people work here.  But I have spoken with them and most of them are just holding out until retirement."
bad,"We are diversified in to SAP enterprise solutions, Salesforce.com solutions, supply chain management, financial management, client relationship management, business analytics, enterprise reporting, HR and human capital management, enterprise security and administration and web development amongst other capabilities."
bad,"I did not have a good experience, I was not provided with what they said they would provide.  I was very happy with my previous employer and the management team from the Ft. Lauderdale Complex in Merrill Lynch pressured me into signing a deal they did not honor."
bad,The workload is heavy contractors are not allowed to participate in company functions.  Co-workers for the most part are nice and always willing to help you.  AVP's are accessible and always willing to help.  Good work experience worked in both MRT and Title Curative challenging departments.
bad,"the job was very stressful and very dependent on you as a worker, you hold a lot of responsibility. The hardest part of the job was management not being on one accord."
bad,Bank of America is a very interesting company to work for. You start off your day counting your drawer. Then you just wait on customers. Also asking customers if they want to open a bank account or credit cards.
bad,"Call center, management had no idea what was going on.. There was a main person that was head over our call center and he would sit in his office and eat food all day.  Not helpful at all."
bad,Working at Bank of America I witnessed a lot of discrimination. There is no room for growth and the mangers share there personal lifestyle with the whole team. Very unprofessional.
bad,Scheduling and hours aren't ideal if you have a young family. Most of the people that work here are older women. Would be a great place to work if you didn't mind working weekends. If you attend church on a regular basis I don't recommend this be a place you apply for.
bad,Overworked and underpaid. My co-workers are the most enjoyable part. Hardest part are actually the district managers and execs.
bad,"Good company to work for, has good benefits and of course its a big company, countrywide. Very stressful job and only based on sales."
bad,"When this was Countrywide Home Loans prior to be being bought out by Bank of America, I loved the company.  There were SO many incentives with Countrywide.  Once BOA took over, the last 6-7 yrs of my employment there have not been that great.  They overlook hard working people for promotions, their benefits are expensive, there is little to no benefit as an employee...no incentives.  Layoffs started 3 yrs ago and have not stopped.  Thousands of people have been let go.  Starting this year they've had layoffs every month, even laying people off a week before Thanksgiving. As they have been laying off people, all the work trickles down to other people they too will eventually layoff, with little to no compensation."
bad,Bank of America at the time I worked for them had management which had worked with Country wide and lacked direction. I attempted to put in less than a two weeks notice and was walked out as I had been terminated. I was given a no rehire status for no notice. I attempted to provide a notice.
bad,"My experience at Merrill was not a good one. I felt that it was a page out of a bad stock brokerage movie where they literally give you a list of 10000 names (at your expense, $0.10 a name) and you start cold calling them. You buy the list, you make the script, you figure out what stocks/bonds/mutual funds/etfs/structured notes you want to sell, and if you screw up it's on you. You shouldn't work in a place where the company doesn't invest in your growth and potential. They want you to work there until you can't stand it anymore and quit, then your book of business is passed along to the other brokers who haven't quit yet."
bad,"Fun atmosphere however when you're hearing everyday that the job is about to close, it makes things uneasy. Alot of mirco-management. No room for growth or advancement. Typical production atmospehere as well. If you just need a job, apply here."
bad,"There was not much help in the way of learning, this is something you had to do on your own. If you needed help with something, you were to figure it out on your own or ask your co-worker. Not a very enjoyable place to work. "
bad,"Analyzed prospective customers’ credit information to determine risks for granting loans."
bad,Co-workers were nice enough. Job was challenging at times. We reporting to CA so we didn't have set job descriptions
bad,A typical day was very busy because systems used was outdated.
bad,Benefits was the best thing going for this company back when I started in 2008 but as years past they slowly started fading away..
bad,Bank of America only cares about referrals.  If you dont push products down customers throats they will make sure they find a way to get you fired.  All of the employees are miserable.
bad,The Co-workers are really nice people and very helpful.  The managers here do not supervise their employees and the do not treat all employees the same.
bad,"We were required to ""push"" products that were not a ""good deal"" for the customers. This is the main reason I chose to leave"
bad,If you enjoy helping other via the phone this is the place for you
bad,There was a massive layoff Pittsburgh site and other sites were closed.
bad,"I loved working with the public but hated selling them that was not needed. "
bad,"I have had bad experience overall. There's hardly any increases on salary. No matter how much you try to meet goals, there's no commission nor hardly any incentives. No breaks when working on your feet for several hrs. Etc."
bad,"My typical day began with listening to voice messages and answering each one.  Searching for documents required for modification of home loans, reviewing each set of documents for processing and sending to underwriter's.  Contacting Borrows to inform them of where we are in the process.  Adviced Borrowers of more information needed to send to underwriting. Calculate income and tax information to ensure of no mistakes.  Processing documents to prepare for underwriting.  Maintaining a calendar that would help to organize the  accounts who needed more info. Communication with underwriter's regarding the modification packages.  All types of loans: FHA, VA, etc.   I enjoyed helping borrowers understand by teaching them the process.  I enjoyed helping borrowers keep their homes. I also assisted with the process of Short-Sale and  foreclosures.  The hardest part of the job was communication with other's when borrower is told incorrect information."
bad,"When I started at B of A it was difficult learning the systems but Once I learned them it was fine. I had a fun manager who respected his team. If you had to work he made it bearable to do a difficult job. When he left all hell broke lose and the job became a real headache. Everybody on the team was looking for new positions within B of A. Unfortunately, the new miserable manager would not let anyone leave. He kept giving them bad reviews so no one else would hire them. He was a very miserable, unattractive pompous being. I don't even think he was human and he looked like an ape."
bad,Pretty blah company to work for.  You can only advance so far realistically.
bad,"The course of the day ws fast paced, beginning with reviewing emails from the previous day for escalations that required immediate attention. I'd move on to prioritizing my caseload in CRMtool Caseload Snapshot (Excel spreadsheet); loans I have decisioned for: modification, repayment plans or referral for liquidation; loans with open conditions to fulfill and submit to underwriting and those to cancel. The position requirements were ever changing and evolving. The most gratifying part of the position was knowing I was doing my part to help families who wanted to keep their homes."
bad,starting my productivity and reaching my goal each day. The most enjoyable part of my job is succeeding I try not to focus on the negative.
bad,"No structure, ongoing changes uncertainity. No money for the value of services provided."
bad,"Poor Management, no sense of direction and office politics is the theme of the day."
bad,"I worked 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, overtime and sometimes I helped out on weekends. I learned a valuable lesson in respect, how to treat people, teach people how you would like to be treated and loyalty."
bad,Productive workplace but very demanding. Very micro managed and not much room for growth.
bad,"A typical day at work is to take about 70 calls per day. You are micro managed at the job, its like being in grade school all over again. The best thing about the job is the co-workers you get to meet and become friends with great people. The hardest part of the job is telling the customers that you are unable to help them because the bank is not designed to help them during financial crisis just collect on their debt. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving to go home. Also they are not flexible with your schedule, they do not honor your school schedule if you enrolled in school."
bad,"If your child gets ill or injured, do not expect to get there on time. They don't let you leave, you must still do all your end day closing jobs."
bad,"For the location if you live in the Antelope Valley and don't want to commute, it is an alright place to work. For long term goals, I would suggest funding another source."
bad,Working for BoA was the worst experience of my life. This is a place where you fear for your job every day. There is no room for advancement. They say one thing and do another. This is a very shady place to work for.
bad,"not opportunities, only Manager's friends get to go better, you have to be a kisser to get what you want, they don't appreciate real good hard workers and find an excuse to keep them in the same positions forever."
bad,"The workplace culture is driven solely by numbers. Management cares very little about their human capital- just perform, perform, perform. Bank of America touts around buzz words and phrases that seem like they are customer centric but they are not. They will cut jobs even after customer outrage about lack of human connection and customer service."
bad,"I worked with a fairly new manager, and they are terrible. Does not know how to relate to his employees, always sends nasty emails, a snake. The company does not value certain people. Very sales pressured, but they cover it up. Employees have been doing unethical things to meet sales goals. I'll leave that there. Wells Fargo #2 I up and left and never looked back. Awful! I work in the healthcare field now and never feel how I felt at BOA!"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers.  Everyone is extremely hard working and dedicated to their work.  The employees are good people.
bad,Please let me leave this evaluation and get on with my job search. I always felt there was a target on my back and never felt any job security. You never knew when there would be a small or massive layoff
bad,Bank of America layyed off a whole department in one day with no warning at All.. Not Good. After working for this company for over 15 yrs I would expect more of a heads-up about what was going on.
bad,BOFA fraud anaylst was an awful position especially since the job requires being on the phone all day listening to customers complain. All management cared about was how many calls an analyst could take a day. I would not recommend this job.
bad,Too many changes to middle management or have left or retired early and it is no longer the same company I started working for.  Corporate culture has dramatically changed where the client is no longer the priority   Profit is the priority.
bad,The company only cares about making money. They cut back on employees expecting the ones that are left to do double the work. Promotions are held back so that you can continue to make the company money in current position. Vacation time has to be chosen the prior year. Day’s off request are always denied. Salary increases are a joke.
bad,"Poorly managed organization by power-hungry individuals with outdated philosophies and policies. Working remotely is not allowed. Executives mislead associates, spreading false positive messages, while mid- and entry-level managers are left to explain why reality is much different than what they just heard."
bad,The managers were never available and they were never interested on how the work was done as long as it was done. Not a good place to work. Too many chiefs and not enough indians
bad,I was there for 12 years and they were not fair in how they did the honest and hard working people that they could definitely depend on no matter what.
bad,"You will advance, your background offers the perfect platform once you understand operational.... yeah right.  Horrible work culture.  Favoritism runs from"
bad,"Bank of America cares deeply about the “Client Experience”"
bad,Not a place I would recommend to my friends and family. It does not provide for job security or a desire to share knowledge. Every day could be your last day at BoA.
bad,You have to know someone to get ahead. Also the only way you will succeed is if you are in a high impact location. The management was very poor and high turnover rates for staff as well. Customers hated the turnover rate.
bad,Management rather have an available associate behind a desk not doing anything than actually help assist customers. Promotions based on who you know rather work performance.
bad,"This company is like most of corporate america. Very hard to move up within the company. The benefits are fine, and it offers tuition reimbursement, and child care reimbursement"
bad,Due to high volume/loan pipeline you had to work overtime to keep up.  Over all was a good company to work for. The management team that was in place when I left was marginal.
bad,Little oversight. Strong emphasis on cold calling. No mentorship/prospect leads given by the company. Each new advisor must reach out on their own to leverage the experience of a senior advisor unless they have pre-existing relationships within the company or strong affluent connections within the market.
bad,"I have enjoyed my 25 years working for Bank of america and i have no negative words to say. I was able to take classes within my areas of interest, which Bank of america paid."
bad,"This is a basic temporary agency with a glorified pitch of advancement.  They do not provide any feedback and once you are hired, they do not check in with you after the second week. They are basically a company that processes your check and this is it,"
bad,"Market management was so overbearing that you couldn't do the tasks that they wanted. They find reasons to write people up or place them on corrective action even though they are working to do the best job possible.  it used to be a great place to work, but not anymore. You feel beat up every day."
bad,Upper management got worse and worse as the years went by.  You are not valued as an employee. Looked to advance being that I was a top performer and didn't find management interested.
bad,"Management was not trained and were there only because of their previous supervisors.  Work atmosphere was stressful and uncomfortable. There was a caste system in the office. Those higher up the caste did little or nothing. There also was an age discrimination. When we were laid off in September of 2011, the people in our group were all over the age of 45. The younger ones did not get laid off."
bad,This was a typical banking job. The company really shifted from customer service to sales. Very sales driven and all about the numbers. If you did not hit numbers they would monitor you closely. Very stressful environment if you are not  a sales person.
bad,I was not to satisfied with the area I worked in. The training was a month long training at that time which was a waste of time because at the end of training it was told that everything we did in training will not apply to what we will be doing on the floor.
bad,"Horrible experience working for Bank of America. The main issue that they don’t tell you when you first apply is how much this job is based on sales. Pretty much if you don’t sell you’re constantly getting pulled into the office and being “coached”, if you continue to not sell they’ll force you to offer anything to a customer even if they don’t need it!"
bad,"If a problem is reported at Bank of America, management doesn't resolve the problem they retaliate.    The compensation as in base was good but the bank makes excuses in paying out commission."
bad,Great learning opportunity in retail banking with a cut-throat expectation from corporate helm. It is also a highly structured organization with aggressive business expectation. Its remuneration is the least competitive among major global American banks.
bad,Bank of America has great managers but has restrictions on training to better yourself. Okay to work for a little bit but that's it. Disappointed with lack of culture.
bad,BOA never hires developers full time.  Just uses contractors.  This puts many hands on the back end software with no consistent mind frame of where it needs to go
bad,"I was with B of A during a time where they decided to downsize their mortgage business.  They had purchased Countrywide Home Loans and apparently decided to streamline operations and their market share.  This made for a stressful environment with layoffs, job changes, and downsizing."
bad,There was no talent development and no real use of talent obtained from years of experience.  Schedule changes were offered every so often and were not open to change for years at a time.  Daily you received looks and short comments from management that was not skilled or trained in there position.
bad,"The company pays lip service to mentorship but at the end of the day you are thrown to the wolves to get new clients. As I interviewed, I presented a business plan which hinged on creating many small accounts with new young clients. After I was hired the rules were explained to me regarding account size. Essentially my entire plan was moot because they only allow accounts of significant size to be opened, at least a quarter million in assets. "
bad,Everything started great.  Out of no where after heavy recruitment the site closed.  1500 people were laid off.  A good amount were recruited with me and worked there for less than a year.  Definitely an experience.
bad,"Poor pay for all the work one is required to do. Unrealistic job duties. Expected to  work as a robot with long shifts, no errors and short breaks. Daily changes to product disclosures.  Company piles on extra work for the same mediocre pay. Sales Rep make the bank loads of money but the incentive pay is horrible. Takes 6 weeks to receive incentive pay after earning it. No cellphones allowed on the sales floor by the reps,  yet the managers can walk around the sales floor making personal calls ALL DAY. No career growth in this department. They would rather take successful reps off the phones for 6 weeks, to help with training classes instead of helping them advance in other departments."
bad,"Company treats its employees very poorly.  Management was not knowledgeable on what their employees were doing.  Company pays is poor. Layoffs happen on a regular basis,  leaving employees always feeling they could be next"
bad,"Technology advice is constantly ignored.  Decisions are made by non-technical managers."
bad,Quarterly goals very important to meet. Very difficult to achieve.  Too competitive.  Always want you to sell more and more products. Must make cold calls to customers and get them to come in for appointments.  30 calls per week and 20 appointments per week required.
bad,Its a back stabbing culture. Managers only care about what they look like to others. There's no real communication here. They hire people and the new hires don't know what they're doing. They just follow instructions an wait to eventually find out what they are actually doing. It never happens. The job descriptions never match the work you do. Its never clear what the lunch break hours are.
bad,"This company only values sales people. Everyone else is unimportant to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The pay is sub standard. The atmosphere is unwelcoming and unfair, with a bias towards men. The benefits are only average. If you are desperate take a job here, otherwise move on to a more equitable company."
bad,"My first stint at Bank of America was pretty good.  My second was a nightmare.  I had an abusive manager that wrote me up for trying to talk to business partners on innovation.  I was expected to be available 24/7/365, vacation was in name only."
bad,"Bank of America could have been a good place to work however after working at BOA for more then 7 years, it was time to move on. Management was very uneducated and not a good fit for the overall worker."
bad,"I worked at BOA for almost 4 years as a Mortgage Loan Officer and then that job was reclassified as a Customer Relationship Manager.  Supervision was far more interested in climbing the corporate ladder than doing the right thing, so long as their ""Numbers"" looked good.  Funny, it is all about the ""Number"" and not the customer. I was asked to re-submit a loan package after the customer signed the package but with my exchanging some pages that did not have their signature on it, as if this is the way the customer sent the package into us. I refused, twice.  I ended up in the hospital with a stress induced heart problem as a result of this."
bad,Non talking environment. Stressful. Good as a partime job not fulltime. They try to impose mandatory overtime without any regards to your own life and other commitments.
bad,"Bank of America is all about the bottom line. You are just a number to them, as are their customers. They do not care about people, they only care about money. "
bad,This company rates everyone the same.  I worked there 5 years and see nothing but the folks doing the work making the same as the folks doing nothing.  Bonuses are pathetic.
bad,"While being employed at the bank I was treated unfairly. After a management change, the environment changed and senior management were self-serving and did not care for good performing employees. I had excellent performance reviews while at the bank and was even given a corporate title promotion. But senior management is only concerned about their bosses and their own bonuses. Qualifiied individuals are not paid their worth. There is no open communication with individuals that work very hard. A culture of management by fear prevails. After being let go, the company told me I could apply to other jobs within the bank but there was no such attempt to rehire me."
bad,It is no longer Merrill Lynch. Its Merrill Lynch with BOA products forced down every advisor's throat. Unmanagable amount of systems and lines of management that have zero cohesion. A great example of the dark side of bureaucracy.
bad,"Long hours, very stressful, no opportunity for growth. "
bad,The work place was a different environment. Many in charged were more concerned with numbers than quality efficient work. It was hard to get the Team Leads assistance in handling problems. A lot of them really were not knowledgeable in handling mortgage problems. They came from a collection background
bad,"Someone is always watching over your shoulder to point out any error, even if it's a very minor one.  Others feel threatened if your smart and try to get your job. Several family members working at same location. Not good with teaching job function as you are expected to read the material but do all your work load and don't use personal or overtime to complete anything. This is not the company philosophy, as they stress work life balance, just site manager does not view flexible schedule for non child related matters like spouse care."
bad,No life work balance and complaints from employees go unheard. The hardest part of my job was not working with clients it was trying to work with a manager that had her own agenda and upper management simply backed her up.
bad,"While there may be temporary safety in the masses..eventually your number is up.  With quarterly cuts, the workload constantly increases, bonuses that are touted as an expected comp value are rare.  Starting with first level of management on up, it's all politics."
bad,"low opportunity for career advancement.  Not enough staff coverage. However, great work hours, and holiday pay. Great vacation and sick pay. Plus also includes great health benefits such as medical and dental."
bad,Need to be 100 percent focus no room for errors and fast pace. Management pushes you to encourage and push customers to use ATM rather than walk into the bank. Need to be extremely pushy with sales so management get bonus. Not flexible with schedule at all. My manager hates kids and care less about families. And most days we don't get a 10 minute break.
bad,"This company has great compensation, great benefits and they can easily replace people because of that alone. Your numbers need to stay consistent or you are threatened with dismissal. They are only interested in fulfilling their numbers. Management does not advance you if you are a top performer. You stay to continue to turn profits and grow their Financial Center’s bonuses. My advice would be to look at other options before signing up here unless you like living under constant pressure and have no interest in advancing in your career."
bad,"Working at Bank of America was not very hard. But working at Merrill Lynch was the complete opposite. The tools, the reputation and the management is great. The issue is that you have to build your own book of business, meaning that you have to struggle for clients."
bad,"crony management on cruise control. wholly unqualified sales managers with no concern whatsoever for their sales team, and no concern for sales development."
bad,"I worked at BOA for about five years. The work culture was very toxic. Unatainable sales goals, crazy and unsupportive management. The pay and benefits were decent but not enough for the demands of the job."
bad,"Good place to growth one's career. I learned a lot from this company. However, it is not the place to stay and pursue a career. Bad Management. They need to send their mid-level management to a management course."
bad,Very frustrating place to work. Constantly asked to sell items to customers that they either already have or do not need. Management discussed job performance with other employees.
bad,"My typical work day would consisted of working assigned cases to complete research and address customer/authorized third party concerns. "
bad,"worked very long Hours, Management never happy with results, have the tendency to look only to thinks missing instead of looking for job well done. Clients were not happy with the bank"
bad,"they treat you just like a number (considering there's 200k+ of you). fine place to learn the industry, but wouldn't want to spend an entire career there"
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone. The pay is not good and there seems to be a layoff once a month. I believe other banks are better to work for.
bad,Jobs ok. Know what youre getting into. Large corporate. You play your highly siloed role. Dont expect extensive training or interest in your development as an employee.
bad,Seems to only be a good place for people who have worked there for many years. The new people are compared for bonuses with staff that has been there for years. Its not a fair measurement. They micromanage and focus on weakness instead of strengths.
bad,"demanding and unrealistic expectations"
bad,Not enough support for management team to support sales goals. Moving to only setting up appointments to close a sale rather than executing in the moment and closing sale. Tellers do not get bonus or commission so its not motivating to sale and meet goals.
bad,"I've been employed by Bank of America since October 2015. Since my time with the company, I have been much less than satisfied. 6 months into my role as Operations Manager, I was notified that the company would be eliminating my role by the end of the year. Since then, I have been flopped around to four different banking centers, without a permanent location. Also, I have functioned under leaders that are only sales focused and not interested in investing in their associates. Terrible experience."
bad,This company doesn't care about their associates. They only care about profits. Managers were never around to help out Associates. A lot of situations could have been avoided if managers were around.
bad,Not a positive place to work. Started out in the FHA Dept as a temp and was quickly hired on as permanent.  Job description kept changing without notice and no clear direction given
bad,"They have great benifits.  However, they do not value their employees. There are many positions that the bank plans to phase out. They do not take in to consideration the effect changes will have on customers."
bad,"put on notice for taking 3 sick days when i had H1N1 flu. ( and provided a doctor's note)   This was at the same time that an entire team plus their manager missed a week for the same reason with no repercussions.  Watched high performing sales people lie, cheat, sleep with their supervisors and do drugs in the stairwell.  when one of them realized i had seen them said they could do whatever they wanted because they sold more than anyone else and were  untouchable.  They were right."
bad,"very educational experience for someone new to banking "
bad,"Management team not very much into promoting within, Bank of America did not care for there employees. They did not look out long term career goal. Regional market leader was dishonest about the way he recruited me."
bad,As a high producer and multiple award winner of customer service excellence I was shocked to not see the opportunity to advance my career and continue to be a brand ambassador once there was organizational change on the Retail level.
bad,Unrealistic expectations and no outside life.  Have to work 6 days a week the first two weeks of every month.  Management is terrible and very unprofessional.
bad,"wasn't happy with treatment by the management. I can describe the place in few words ""concentration camp"". management treated me very disrespectfully."
bad,"Advancement is slow and the company is more geared more towards profit than customer service or employee satisfaction. Decent benefits, but does not make up for the low pay scale."
bad,"Reorgs occur approximately every six months and mask management failures. Annual communications celebrate company success while total compensation goes backward as the bank decreases or eliminates bonuses for non-executive staff."
bad,"I enjoyed working in Private Client Services and learned a great deal about margin and option requirements. Once moving to Client Services, I was given the entry level tasks. I duplicated a report for the clients that was not able to be produced directly from the company's system. I would manually enter corporation actions and redemption payments. Check journal entries to ensure trades settled timely."
bad,"Working for Bank of America was a very challenging position. I learned a lot about customer service, and maintaining composure in difficult situations."
bad,In this company (Merrill Lynch)  you are either in sales as a financial adviser or working in some aspect for them.   the health insurance may be inexpensive but the rest of the benefits are worthless.
bad,"Typical work day is maninly tied up in meetings.  I have had the opportunity to be involved in change control, although I have found that most meetings are not very productive.  The management style is realxed but this also lead to projects taking much longer than necessary to complete."
bad,"Peers are great but good Managers (who will take the time to explain policy, benefits and other personal items) are extremely few and far between. Any of the above you need to know must be done on your own time (lunch or break) and though you do get personal leave there are strings attached that you need to make sure you understand from BOA's perspective before you need the time away. For your work shift and vacation there is a bid system in place but management does not seem to adhere to what is requested there."
bad,I witnessed many upper level managers fratenizing in compromising positions which pulls morale down to an all-time low.  It was never corrected and continued through the 11 years that I worked there.
bad,"Do to layoffs over the past 2 years, the company is unstable and stressful. I've had 5 managers in 1 year in the same dpt. We are given projects with little to no training at all and most have a rush deadline."
bad,Bank of america hires some great employees. Seems like everyone there is eager and willing to learn new thing. Bank of America issue is that it is a company that is really behind in technology especially for being in the financial sector. They also do not have a great compensation plan for their sales people.
bad,these people that run this operation are in need of some serious help everybody wants to be the boss but nobody wants to work to be the boss
bad,Handled customer fraud; stressful environment; demanding metrics to meet; no true job security. No real team building--everyone was out for self. Management cared about meeting numbers more than employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers.
bad,They pay you well but they offer you no job security. Training Sucks they stick you in a center to do web base training no guidance. Endless amount of paperwork to do and lot of it pointless
bad,"company is cutting jobs everyday,there replacing employees with machines, theres no place for advancement and the benefits are getting more expensive everyday."
bad,"Pay is not worth the abuse you receive from employees and coworkers. This is literally the job you go to when you're desperate for money but you better not need it ASAP because your first check only comes in three weeks after you start for a whole $400, IF that. None of the higherups know what everyone else is doing, the training is rushed and if you fall behind, welp, prepare to cry. The policies are stupid and give you absolutely no stand on being able to help the customers, you have to force yourself to abandon them when they need their money, the supervisors have every power to help them but don't. We get abuse from the customers because when there is no visible fraud on the accounts, they lock the account anyway, but then people are losing thousands of dollars a transaction and the only reason they knew that was because they checked themselves and didn't get any notice of it from us! And if you try to quit for ""personal reasons"", they'll keep insisting on you trying to give them the exact reason why. DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM. Personal is personal."
bad,"Selling Money was fun, my customers made my job easy,,underpaid,"
bad,"The pressure to sell sell sell, is unbearable. Management can be cruel at times.  It was not like this when I first started. I would never work for this company again. No room for advancement."
bad,I was treated as a contractor with no sure thing that we would go permanent. because this is a 24/7 call center it was almost impossible to get time off even though i wasn't getting paid for it anyway
bad,"As a branch assistant in a small town, my position with this company was an excellent opportunity to work with brilliant people. If I could have had one job for the rest of my life, this would have been it."
bad,This company is not a place to grow if you are not in the popular crowd.  I have reported to 10 managers in less than 2 years. Although things are slowly improving there is no room for advancement.  Turn over is very high.
bad,"It involves working in a call center.  Incoming retail banking questions non-stop for eight hours.  It's not an awesome way to spend your day, but the tuition reimbursement is nice and they actually have a pension plan...at least they used to."
bad,"When I started in 2011 Bank of America seemed to be all about building relationships. I really enjoyed working there through relationship building you can serve all of a customers needs. In 2014 that changed, they wanted us to treat people with ""money"" differently"".  Upper management had changed as well as the banking center managers. The focus was entirely different, the goals were different they wanted personal bankers to get customers to do things that may not be in their best interest."
bad,The bank really needs to re evaluate how they do business.  Taking poor care of the customers and employees results in bad business.  They are intentionally trying to churn customers that aren't high dollar accounts or potential and have made it clear they are getting rid of tellers and bankers alike.  Current direction is unfortunate and makes it hard to be loyal and plan a career with such a company.
bad,calls can be continuous with no break in between. can be very challenging. moral very low. i learned that there is no loyalty no matter how much you put into a job.
bad,Technically was able to provide solutions and recommendations of the best way to utilize Quality Center.  Had the opportunity to do proof of concepts on many tools.
bad,"I enjoyed working for Bank of America and helping clients with their mortgage issues.  I also learned alot about sales, and actually won several sales awards."
bad,Very micromanage and underpaid for all of the job duties. Didn't have a work life balance.
bad,"bank of america did not have a 3 day/night work week for their employees. they had a 5 night work week with ridiculous hours especially during month-end. there was no room for advancement in my area, management showed no interest in anyone. the hardest part of the job was working 6pm to 6am for 11 or 12 days straight during peak month-end. the co-workers that i worked with were hard working individuals looking to get ahead. i enjoyed working with them. the most enjoyable part of my job was working with fellow friends that i had worked with before at merrill lynch."
bad,"i did not enjoy my time at BOA. Lack of management, unrealistic sales goals and not putting customers first"
bad,"I choose to leave this blank, because I truly had a horrible employment experience at Bank of America."
bad,The typical day was boring. I found the drudgery of it very monotonous.
bad,"I think Bank of America is a good company to work for but there are a lot of reasons this is not a good job. People are not treated fair. When you go on vacation, the time off is not taken into consideration for your monthly sales goals. Most companies gives you a vacation relief or some sales compensation to help you when you are off on vacation. I was told by a team manager that when you are off on vacation, it is just too bad if your peers have a great sales week when you are on vacation and you are held to the standard to what ever they do the week you are off, even though while on vacation I am not allowed to make any sales since I am off from work. Not really fair. They seem to provide an incentive but will give you every reason in the world to take it away from you. Too many factors that are uncontrollable to make a very stable future."
bad,It definitely isn't the same company it was 7 years ago! The senior management is inexperienced. They hire just anyone for the consumer market managers. These managers are clueless and uneducated. Only good part about this company is the benefits. They could care less about your work life balance. The pay sucks! Go to Chase or Citi you'll make way more money!
bad,no opportunity for growth. all about politics. customers are great. not so much for management.
bad,No comment regarding management and company culture. My co-workers were wonderful dedicated managers with many years of banking.
bad,"This place has a huge turnover rate and rightfully so.  If you need a job quick, then its great because the pay is decent as well.  Otherwise, I'd stay far away."
bad,Company uses out dated systems to process day to day work.  The hardest part of the job was understanding the direction of the department. Layoffs were normal every year and re-hiring for the same position at a lower pay rate 2 months later. Too many people who needed to retire with horrible attitudes like you owed them your life. Work life balance and the open door policy is a joke. I learned to save my money and not depend on my employer for anything but a check.
bad,Stressful and difficult working environment with often poor management and little to no room for advancement;
bad,"There could be worse places to work. However, this is definitely not the best firm around, either. There are a lot of deficiencies. This firm expects you to sacrifice a lot of yourself and personal life, etc...to see little, if any, payoff at all at the end of the day. It's not necessarily about the money or raise in salary with me, it's more about allowing those who actually put in the work to have the opportunity for promotion. "
bad,"I worked at the bank for 4 1/2 years before being part of a mass layoff.  I took on quite a workload as others were not willing to complete certain projects.  I had not called out for 2 years and was working towwards moving up before I got laid off.  However, the bank still has hundreds of contractors employed.  Seems unfair when you put so much time and effort into the company.  The bank keeps you there with golden handcuffs because of the great benefits, but the morale is terrible and no one including manangement is encouraged to make it better.  Upper management is very unprepared and unorganized.  Your ideas are not taken ino consideration because it's all about the bottom number, even though upper management preaches otherwise.  It's a very hypocritical environment, so if you're looking for a job you can just go to, be a robot and get paid then this is it."
bad,BOA is a place where you would meet some interesting people. A majority of the staff is uneducated and self-serving.  I learned how to stay in my office and crunch numbers and stay to myself.
bad,"Very large organization, lacking in personal development opportunities. Rapid changing environment, doesn't allow much time to get grounded for new hires.  Very high rate of attrition also doesn't allow for many mentoring opportunities. Overall culture is inviting but it does not trickle down.  Some of the best people I have ever worked with, just not for.  Highly diverse population which made for a high level of untapped potential and expertise.  Overall a very disappointing experience."
bad,"Excellent place to learn how to work independent and in teams."
bad,"A typical day at work was very demanding often times being triple booked each hour for conference calls, however, being in this environment I learned many valuable things.  I managed up to 150 employees and dealt with all the challenges that is presented when managing that large of a group in different offices and states.  Simultaneously I  was also learning project management, building new departments from scratch and learning compliance and risk management. The most enjoyable part of my job was all of the challenges that were presented on a minute's notice and being able to solve those challenges."
bad,"Company is not consistent among different regions. discrimatory"
bad,"With all the changes within banking, I wouldn't recommend working for Bank of America. They go through so many changes that there is no job security. Anyone and everyone is replaceable."
bad,"Extreme amount of work, lack of management and care for the customer, lack of integrity and morals"
bad,"Good place to learn about customer service, hard to adapt to the switching of schedules but they have great benefits."
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Company always came first, clients "
bad,"Training is negligible, management is arrived at thru longevity, no vision or leadership. Bank of America now has banking centers open 7 days a week, no work life balance and it is all do more with less staff."
bad,"Production Driven"
bad,"Unstable hours, not family friendly. You work hard don't get recognized for it . Rather go to school , in case they get rid of us all "
bad,"unethical corporation in terms of sales and finance. poor leadership, poor culture, poor compensation."
bad,Something new everyday. I typical day involved meetings and trying to get get information bank from other bank officials.
bad,"No comment "
bad,"Bank of America struggles with preparation and ability to view the ""full picture"". They change because they have to and they do little research and analysis prior to changing."
bad,"based on years working with the institution, keeps non productive workers due to fear of litigation, has poor retention for top associates. hires individuals into roles that have no prior experience. offshoring sensitive jobs with high risk. overall the worst Company I have worked for."
bad,Update Excel spreadsheet to track the status in the process for partial release.
bad,"This company at first seemed like it cared for its employees and maybe it does, but the management that they have working for it needs to be overhauled. They lack a sense of understanding when it comes to peoples personal lives. I would not recommend to work of Bank of America Merchant Services as long as they continue to allow their management to treat their employees like cattle. They expect no one to have a life but them."
bad,"Since the acquisition of ML, benefits down, jobs down, turnover high, and innovation out the door. Used to be a great company to work for but some bad M&A deals (not just Countrywide) right before the recession is what has taken it into a downward spiral. A split and ""restart"" on the Consumer side would really help BAC. Firm and Banking, they really just don't go togethor."
bad,Poor work life balance and culture of the company has changed over the years. All about making a profit and do not value the lives of employees.
bad,good working conditions friendly staff members and I was a good worker well groomed honest dependable and close attention to details.
bad,deal with people who can't management their money and have someone watch over your back while you help customers
bad,"I enjoyed going to work for awhile, but slowly started to dislike going into work. The management is horrible, everyone is very cold and out for themselves."
bad,"Bank of America has announced in 2012 that they are looking at laying off 16,000 employees."
bad,"I have learned a lot of new skills here at Bank of America including SSIS, SSRS & Excel VBA as well as improved my SQL Server SQL/Function/Stored Procedure writing skills."
bad,Over worked under paid They had bosses who only promoted there friends over more educated and/or employees who did show leadership and had tenner. When I left 8 others followed because of the extreme favoritism in just my department which was not being downsized
bad,"Very stressful. Poor management, great talent. A great place to start as a first time job but not to grow your career"
bad,"The company itself is geat, but management doesnt follow rules, they make up their own and expect everyone to follow them, including not taking breaks and not complying with drs notes"
bad,"A typical work day would be taking about 70-100 inbound phone calls a day. Throughout my experience, I've learned how to handle stressful situations and deal with different types of people. I have one manager that leads my team. I love my co-workers dearly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult people and the never ending changes in my job environment.However, I do enjoy meeting and speaking with new people everyday."
bad,As a manager I had no work life balance. I was required to work even when I was sick. the consumer market executive would target anyone that got on his bad side was investigated until they found something wrong in order to terminate them. The compensation model is designed so that it looks great on paper but achieving the targets is almost impossible.
bad,I worked for them for just shy of a year. They offered no upfront training. The atmosphere is one of when are they going to lay us off. The right hand doesnt know what the left is doing.
bad,"Bank of America is one of the largest banks around the world. When it comes to their call centers, there is a mix up in believing that your job will be safe. If they locate a training class that are willing to accept less pay than the employees they already have on payroll; needless to saym they will take on those new employees and either lay off or fire the old ones. Thus, creating a high turn over rate for their company. They bouce their employees around at will and state that it is for company needs. When in actuality, they are just trying to get you closer to the door, in order to fire you. The employees here mainly have no lives, due to the amount of work that they are expected to do throughout the work day. BOA tends to make up positions for the individuals that they favor and promote them, while all of the little people are stuck in the same departments for years."
bad,"BofA is poorly managed from top down. One hand does not know what the other is doing. They hired me without any banking experience to be their branch manager and told me that I was there to manage people. Then when economic crisis hit hard they decided to downsize and consolidate management. So, I was on the bottom of totem pole and was asked to take lesser position."
bad,This job takes me down on a daily basis. Management does not care about home life and its all about numbers. They want you to work overtime every week and don't take the time to learn the process. I dread walking into work everyday. Employees are very messy and there's a lot of talk on the floor. This place feels like more of a call center setting vs a corporate office. The morale is dead and BOA is CHEAP!
bad,You never knew what your position would be from week to week and you were put in situations that you were unfamiliar with. Horrible feeling to work there.
bad,"Management want nothing more than monthly bonus based their team numbers."
bad,"Worked ther for 6 months and had 4 managers, they only care about the numbers, they tell you otherwise but the bottom line is they want numbers / metrics."
bad,"I was excited working at the bank, but because of a poor management and unfair supervisor it was unbearable. Hours were unpredictable, never raised my salary.. At first they hired me as part-time and promised me a full-time position at the later time,  only to cut my hours to 2 hours a day! Never made their promise of a full-time position with benefits even though a few people left who had those positions.."
bad,"I worked for the bank for several years as a contractor before I was hired full time. After being hired, I continued to work as an Administrative Assistant for 7 more years before being ""promoted"" to an Executive Assistant. I saw a lot of good staff leave the bank for similar reasons and for better opportunities elsewhere."
bad,"No loyalty from management. Revolving door, employees let go, lied to about new job functions. Lot of favoritism to certain employees. Not a fun place to work."
bad,"I  worked there 12 years and if your manager don't like you, no matter how hard you work, they will still try to find a way to discount you. They have no loyalty to their employees, you're just a number."
bad,This is a very serious role if you are into banking or mortgage products you would enjoy the experience. It is a very stressful environment and always changing
bad,"Extremely high sales goals.  Told that only 4% of new advisors make it through the 3 year training program. It's a revolving door.  "
bad,"Many of us went for drinks as soon as our shift ended. Sometimes we snuck them on our breaks. Being belittled & yelled @ all day every day & being told to smile & sound confident through it, makes you ""thirsty""."
bad,Had a personal bad experience with a not so nice manager but it may have been different if located somewhere else. No room for advancement at the time working there
bad,Very bad manager and always had to have it her way will write you up for the same reason over and over and never give you a chance to correct it. and she is always right and you are always wrong.
bad,This place did promote from within.....in that they took staff from different departments and threw them at the head of departments they knew nothing about making it difficult for the staff that worked beneath them to effectively do their jobs.
bad,I dealt with multiple problems from a difficult manager and HR was worthless. My age was mentioned by a manger which should never happen and HR would not deal with it. I just wanted moved to another department and HR was set on me staying and 'working it out'. Truth is they had moved so many people in my department because of the manager they didn't want to move another. I resigned because I don't believe in going to work everyday in a hostile environment that a company will not 'clean up'.
bad,Sales pressure is way too much. The rules are way too much. Bank of America does not care about employees enough either. Bank of America should start being a little more understating and ethicalnwith their sales. If someone warmed money no one should be able to take it.
bad,"Stressful environment "
bad,"I used to love working for BofA when I joined in 2015 but the company has changed so much that I hardly recognize it anymore. I used to feel valued and respected and would tell people how proud I was to work here. Now I just feel used and unwanted, as if I'm just a number. Seriously considering switching companies to somewhere that they actually care about both the employees and the customers."
bad,poor management / no training / only for friends (tons of nepotism); doesn't offer women competitive salaries compared to men; company of favorites (friends of friends & family) hired & offered astronomical salaries that don't equate to experience or education
bad,"I worked there 19 years.  The first 9, were pretty good. The last 10 were all layoffs and everybody was miserable.  Not a happy group in any area except in the top staff or 5% of the employees and some of them must be happy either.  They were always leaving."
bad,There is no work life balance.  There is no interest in keeping employees long term.  Promotion process is completely made up.  It doesn't make sense how a summer intern can have the same title as someone with a Masters Degree.
bad,"Was hired as anticipated position. Everyone (even previous hires) in the role we’re let go."
bad,"The quality of leadership and type of culture varies by SBU/Business Group.  Some managers are good leaders but most are more concerned with getting the work completed at any cost, as with great disregard for creating a team atmosphere based on accountabilty, respect and transparency.  The hardest part of the job was working in an environment that felt cut throat and not very collaborative."
bad,Its almost like they don't want to close loans in the underwriting department. Made my client's purchase a horrible experience as well. Taking care of any pay issue will take 2 months.
bad,"After 21 years as a dedicated employee I was asked to train a team in India,  saying that they had other projects I was need on. After training the team in India I was laid off."
bad,"Bank of America used to be a great place to work, but things are changing.  The department I am in has a toxic work environment, negatives are always emphasized over the positive, micromanaged to oblivion.  Leadership with no leadership training or skills, a skip level manager who says his door is always open but if you ever try to talk to him one on one you are cut off and berated and insulted, I know this from personal experience, and after it happened I confirmed that this wasn't an isolated incident.   He is an angry, humorless man who constantly worries that the people working under him are getting away with something.  I don't know if other departments are any better, but I know the company as a whole is putting technology above human interaction.  It's sad because it used to be a great place to work.  I kept hoping it would get better but it isn't.  It's time for me to move on."
bad,"The management at Bank of America was terrible.  Of all the large banks I have worked at, Bank of America was by far the worst.  Management was terrible."
bad,"In the beginning it feels like you have people on your side, but after a while peoples true colors show. You have to figure out what mood your manger is in before you approach them. some mangers are rude. They dont leave their bad days at home."
bad,"Great organization, typical  call center culture. Hard to advance and entry-level pay is severly low. Very ""clicky"", so expect a long time friend of Management to advance before you.Networking/Volunteering is heavily advised to assist in your growth but you wont have time unless you do it on your off days."
bad,"It wasnt worth keeping with Alorica office culture, and prblems at home, the managers did their best, but it was honestly a pattern of poor company values."
bad,"With the made up sayings, the acronyms, and lying to your face about ""shared success"", while highly invested in laying off as many employees as possible, it is the worst working atmosphere I have ever worked in."
bad,"Was in the Wholesale Marketing division.  The job itself was mundane and predictable.  No room for advancement.  The management was ok.  I was not there very long, as I was offered a position with SunTrust and I decided to take it.  The company has a tendency to hire a lot of people and then lay them off."
bad,Managers need better support from upper management in order to become better leaders. Leadership skill training needs improvement. Meeting 4 times a year for feedback is not enough.
bad,"Bank of America is all about driving sales, They expect you to Sell a credit card to every customer, You are trained to believe that every single customer needs a credit card, regardless of their situation or understanding of Credit, You will be Coached and termed if not meeting these Sales Goals."
bad,"Bank of America could be a great company if the turnover rate wasn't so high. If they appreciated their loyal employees more, they would have a more stable work environment."
bad,Very stressful job with no personal empowerment or incentive. Very corporate an not very employee centered. Management only cares about goals and employees come last
bad,"The culture is compliance first over the customer and certainly over innovation.  The old Merrill Lynch people are great, it clearly was a fun place to work a generation ago."
bad,"I was a manager for BofA and i had to let so many people go due to missing consistently increasing sales goals.  You are just a number to them and the second you dont reach your goals, they let you go and look for someone else who will.  Lots of turn over!"
bad,"The training for the Wealth Management Banking Support department was horrid.  New tasks are constantly heaved on an already over loaded plate. You are not properly trained for all of the tasks that you will be expected to complete.  Management will not do anything to get you the proper training regardless how much you ask for it.  You sometimes have monthly one on one meetings with you manager, they will write stuff down but nothing comes of it.  When you try to follow up on the items discussed in the meeting, the manager has no idea what you are talking about."
bad,"I do not wish to share a Review on this company. I was not there too long, but I would not recommend. Pay is great and all, but the job itself was miserable"
bad,"Pros: -"
bad,"They are more concerned about compensation than experience.  After 32 years of loyal service, they chose to let me go.  They replace long time employees with younger people to offer them less pay"
bad,"THis was a remarkably frustrating work environment. There is no vision communicated, no regular communication, and a complete lack of teamwork on the business side. Few people are given autonomy and decisions are not communicated, thus leaving all other team members with no idea what to do."
bad,"Management of the HELOC department was not open to working closely with individual employees. As the department opened in the Chandler, we received attention. Bank of America laid off the Vice President of our division, and the remaining Vice President never interacted with any of the employees unless they were management."
bad,The work environment was not professional or helpful.  The management team was unavailable and not very knowledgeable. There was no empowerment to be able think for yourself.
bad,"There is no amount of pay that would justify the level of stress and disregard for employee wellbeing that would make Bank of America a worthwhile place of employment. My best was never good enough - I was ranked #1 teller in the state based on accuracy and product sales performance for over 12 weeks in a row - and I was still told my performance wasn't good enough. Pardon me if I'm not willing to sell high-fee checking accounts and credit cards to the homeless and mentally disabled in order to EXCEED sales goals for bonuses I myself didn't receive. Luckily though, there were more than enough other tellers/sales associates who were willing to make those kinds of sales."
bad,"Bank of America loves to give back to the community and have fun after work within teams too. Leadership in my area was very interested in developing team members, although peer to peer relationships were too competitive for me."
bad,indifferent toward valued hardworking employees.  Not a healthy work environment.  not much room from upward mobility within the company.  would not recommend to self starters
bad,By checks and balances they pit one department against another. Your bonus is based off of how many mistakes you find in other's work. Problem is people make up problems then you have to fight them and it's just endless hassle and discontent. There is always the threat of layoff. Most people including me have been laid off at least once by them and transferred.
bad,"Used to be a great place to work.  Not so any more, Constantly being laid off every year. Those with 20 years are cut"
bad,"Pretty standard big bank environment. Take in large amount of customers and attempt service to sales conversations. Sales practices and coaching were not great. Management attempted push sales tactics upon us to utilize on customers, felt like a car salesman."
bad,No organization or communication within the firm. They mislead you on how much you are going to make. You are more of a financial assistant to the senior advisor vs. a financial advisor in the TFA training program.
bad,"working at bank of america was definitely not a good place to work at, I had absolutely no management support and processing was just not up to par, loans would take over 90 days to fund."
bad,When I first  started working at BofA the management team was different and we all worked a one whole group. New management came and the atmosphere became tense and it was difficult to concentrate and work as a team.
bad,"Daily experience was based primarily on who the supervisor was, but for the entire 13 years I worked for BofA, the corporation never once gave anything beyond lip service to putting the customer first.  Raises were non-existent and, what's worse, they took away bonuses and incentives repeatedly."
bad,"at my time at this employer is was good and bad , was great at the time for growth, company was very informative with quartely reviews and annual projections."
bad,"You may be more qualified than any other team member, have more seniority, more skills, and more capabilities.  In fact, you may have trained the other members of your team.  But, because your manager doesn't know, or care to know you, you become just a number."
bad,"There really was not an opportunity to grow, you work really hard towards meeting your goals and there is no loyalty to the employee. The job/life balance is hard."
bad,"A typical day at work would be answering calls from customers, processing payments, attempting to collect on past due accounts. I learned that not every leader knows how to lead. I also learned more about the mortgage industry. The hardest part of the job was poor management. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping military customers with their mortgage accounts."
bad,Most of the manager are easy to discriminate employee especially minority and unfair decision if you complain about the job. Most of them have a favoritism.
bad,"Employees are just a number; management is not invested in their development or promotion. Management often did not have a good understanding of the content of the work itself; they simply blindly followed loosely-developed processes, and were ill-equipped to address any deviations from the most mundane and familiar processes."
bad,"From the day I started at Bank of America, I never felt secure in my job.  Layoffs were a weekly threat. Whole departments were let go without advanced notice or proper training to push their process to another team. Running joke, here today and gone tomorrow...Too many people in upper management and they have no idea who the employees are on their teams or what they did.  I learned that they don't care how much you know and how good or loyal a worker you are, if they need to cut numbers you are all fair game!"
bad,If you have a competitive manager who expects you produce daily the same results or higher even on slow days. They want you to pull a rabbit out of a hat without exposing the unethical practices if you know what I mean. Expect to be at pointless meeting on your day off and even during your vacation. I remember not being in a meeting on my because I was on vacation and got fussed at because I did't show up to a pointless that served no purpose of me being there. They don't care about you only your production they expect you to be a shark 24/7. If your competitive and want to make money taking advantage of people this is your job.
bad,Very good if you need money and don't mind having your soul sucked out to get it. Working for BofA has been the text-book definition of working in corporate america in all the worst ways.
bad,There has been a brain drain. It feels like the Countrywide Culture has infected the entire Mortgage unit. No one really works. No work ethic. Everyone bemoans not getting free donuts on Friday anymore. Very childish behavior from management.
bad,"Converted to Full time after being a contract for 8 months, took a pay cut and hopes of job security. Couldn't be more wrong not even 10 months later, got laid off while all my contractor friends stayed on. Then was rehired with 20K pay decrease."
bad,I was laid off from the bank due to downsizing. They laid off 10 employees from the same branch. We were all right at the 10 year mark and would be fully vested. They just didn't want to give us retirement money.
bad,"Worked here for 3 years, transferred out of state to help start up a new division in Texas. Upon arrival discovered that the management that was hired had NO small business background. We were there to train them as well but instead they brought over people they used to have do their work for them in their former dept. come as new hires so that we can train them and they could ask them for help instead of us. We were promised room for advancement but the sad reality was we moved away from all we knew only to be treated like trash.  Favoritism is disgusting in this company and the pay is not as good as other companies. They treat employees like they are just a number... If I could shout and expose alllll the crooked leadership from the rooftops I would."
bad,"only care about sales and clients who have lots of money. even ""non-sales"" positions are required to sell. goals are unobtainable and the pressure is unrealistic. only plus is good benefits."
bad,I love the company but the management team makes it hard for you to enjoy the fruits of your labor. If management was better this would be a 5 star company.
bad,"I was not treated fairly from the start.   Logging, filing, checks, prepping.  Only certain skills and never trained to do anything else by management"
bad,"I was very excited to work for Bank of America, they seemed to have a lot to offer but I found out the management is very out of touch with employees."
bad,my typical day includes me standing in the lobby getting screamed at from the customers for not having enough staff to run the branch. no one in the management has control over staffing. it is someone sitting in Charlotte that controls the staff and are making choices to cut staff to meet their p&l for shareholders.
bad,The company is beginning to implement databases that employees can easily complete application processes with. That is convenient! The older applications should be updated for better efficiency.
bad,The schedule and pay are nice and there are benefits however it is not worth it because the job is high stress and very detail focused. not much room for advancement and no job security.
bad,"I was supposed to be a temp to hire with BOA. The management over the contractors were not open and honest with our employment status. When hired in, they told us we would hold a standard 90 day temp status, and then be moved to permanent if offered a position. After 90 days, management did not let us know anything until about 5 months in. And after applying, there was still no word. "
bad,The place is really good to work and the environment in the organization  was awesome. They take care of the people really well & The draw back was salary and not a transparency on the promotion lines.
bad,Upper Management wasn't easy to work with !!! I was very lucky that I had a wonderful Manager but they ran him off after 31 years and never thanked him for his service and so as a Employee that really bothered me to see this .
bad,"In the Merrill Lynch side of the Bank, the average life-span of an associate is 2 years. This is because you will work long hours every week with little appreciation. The Bank has absolutely no company culture, there is being at work and doing your job, then there's not. Management is also fully aware that similar positions at other brokers pay higher, yet refuse to match market compensation levels."
bad,a competitive and almost impossible culture that takes over your life and belittles you everyday on the job. Management is unhelpful and overwhelmed. A truly miserable work/life balance.
bad,"BOA wasn't really the best company that I've worked for, but it wasn't the worst. Once you realize that you'll be stuck in your department for years upon years before another position is available, you'll be good."
bad,"As a pantry assistant I was responsible for preparing coffee and maintaining the pantries stocked. There was an incident when the coffee machine was out of service for days. An unprofessional employees illustrated a picture of an angry character with the middle finger and posted it on the coffee machine. Overall, the employees were unfriendly and rarely interacted with me. I felt offended and uncomfortable in this working environment. Moreover, the pay was terrible and there was no room for growth."
bad,"I had a terrible experience at BOA. Their training program was absolutely horrible. They throw you out to the wolves way too soon, with no one to help guide you. The management was absolutely terrible. Not willing to work with you and give you advice or help when needed. I was in banking for 7 years prior to starting with BOA and the environment is the complete opposite of any healthy working environment. Poor culture, too. The only thing that kept me at BOA was my customers. I loved my customers. I built wonderful relationships with them."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had, management is way too pushy, they change everything on a weekly basis, sales goals are unreasonable and you will never receive praise for a job well done, only negative feedback"
bad,The manager that I had worked for during my time was extremely unprofessional. This particular individual would not work with hours and or pregnancy orders from a doctor.
bad,"This is overall a good bank to work for. size is overwhelming and culture isn't very strong. "
bad,Senior management steering company in the wrong direction and they don't even care. Significant group-think mentality stifles improvement and real growth. Intimidation rules at market-level management (with a few notable exceptions) encouraging branch-level fudging of sales production
bad,I worked at Bank of America as a contractor and it was not a good experience. I was there for one year and worked in four different departments and they still terminated my contract and until this day I still do not know why. Honestly I feel like they used me. They were hiring other contractors after me and one of them were hired after being there for a little less than two months. That really made me mad. I would have loved to become a permanent employee but I guess it wasn't meant to be. This was my first banking/corporate job and I have learned that it's not what you know its who you know.
bad,"Stressful position to work (fraud analyst). Stats one must adhere to are too tight for creating positive customer experience. Shift bidding is a definite con. Vacation bidding is a definite con. Having to work every weekend is a definite con. Communication with management is a definite con. The ability to have necessary team meetings is a definite con. Not the place to be if you suffer any health problems that are exacerbated by needing to stand up, move around or go to the bathroom. Parking is also an issue."
bad,"Too many layoffs, etc. Disjointed and disconnected with employees, many periods of thumb-twiddling for too many employees. Poor use of company funds and resources."
bad,Job requires to provide world class service without giving all needs tools and systems.  Most of the managers have limited or no recent experience on the phone. Pay and benefits are decent.
bad,"There is a great work life balance working at Bank of America, if you get in with the right people. This is only way to advance at this company."
bad,"Bank of America is not concerned about their employees or providing opportunities for advancement. They will quickly layoff worthwhile employees without hesitation. Their main focus is the bottom line. "
bad,In the 9 months I've been with this company management has changed three times. It makes it diffucult to adjust when every manager is starting from scrach getting to know your strengths.
bad,"Worked with this firm for over 8 years.  Progression is dependent on who you know as opposed to what you know.  Company drags out a employee/management interaction initiative every 3 - 4 years to give the impression that they value your opinion and will act upon issues.  Real issues such as salary, progression, staff parking all brushed under the carpet as its not something that they can fix without the authority of Charlotte or there is nothing in the budget.  Its no wonder all the real talent leave."
bad,"very sales driven, you take work home most times, not my favorite when it comes to customer service and I believe that's where I have found my disconnect"
bad,"While my time was short I was able to quickly see that I wouldn't fit in with the rest of the employees at Bank of America. The environment may have been friendly to your face but they got very hostile behind your back. Each bank had a ""click"" and if you didn't fit in with the standard then you were quickly made so uncomfortable that it would make you want to quit."
bad,You can never get a true answer from anyone. Everyone wings it there. Employees know more than the managers. Raises are change. That's just a little bit of what's wrong.
bad,"Fast pace environment "
bad,"Great inconsistencies below Executive Management. Disparate Departments and Divisions not working together. I learned most processes are non-existent or non-document. "
bad,"Room for growth is extremely limited. If you're one of those who is willing to wait several years to get to point A to point B, this company is not for you."
bad,"There isn't enough compensation for the amount of work that you do. Though the manager is AWESOME, she is overshadowed by her team who are a group of disrespectful people."
bad,"A typical day is very hectic and quite chaotic. Various undocumented processes result in large number of production  support requests on day-to-day basis."
bad,The company as a whole is ok but the way certain departments treat their employees is down right horrible. No freedom to do anything but work.
bad,"built anxiety"
bad,"The BAMS wholly owned subsidiary is based in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Building in St Pauls, London."
bad,"If your want to stop seeing your family at nights, develop migraine, heart problems, stress and any other physical disorders your can imagine, please feel free to apply."
bad,"This particular call center was very mismanaged. Training was very weak, very lackadaisical atmosphere. Not surprised closed down."
bad,"This job sucks. You are basically strapped to your desk all day and you are expected to work OT to hit your numbers, which happens rarely. No work/life balance. Management is very disconnected from their people. It is like being in high school. For example, a fellow associate who thought that she was miss ""it"" liked to throw stuff at people and also liked to use profane language but, management let it go on. This is where I drew the line, I will not tolerate people like that. Training sucks-mostly web based, classroom for weeks with no regard to developing for the actual job. "
bad,"Good place to start with, the training and other stuff very lack of for a person when starting with this company."
bad,The South Jefferson Banking Center in St. Louis Missouri is under poor management. The manager is racist and doesn't know how to be professional in anyway.
bad,"Pay is decent, benefits are great, referral and sales goals are among the highest in the industry and quite unreasonable. Constant push to get people to bankers for sales, they expect you to find a persons financial fears and twist them to your benefit."
bad,"Everything is micro-managed. Every time a transaction is competed, there's a form to be filled out or someone to report it to. All of that self-reporting gets in the way of all of the selling that is expected. Emailing the entire branch is required as you go to every break and every lunch. And then again as you return from every break and every lunch. Bank of America is playing CYA and it is's employees are paying for it. "
bad,"The work environment is stressful at times and i dont feel that there is true oppurtunity for advancement in my current role. I dont feel that my compensation correlates with the amount of work that is completed on a daily basis. The company calls for ideas and suggestions to improve the workplace, but when ideas are provided i dont feel as though they're truly considered. I really feel as though i've hit the ceiling as far as my advancement with the company and just want to feel appreciated for the job that I do."
bad,"Bank of America is going through a transition of lower level management during these tough economic times. Goals and objectives are being set that are virtually impossible for Loan Officers to attain. This creates a very adversarial finger pointing situation as to who is and who is not making goal. "
bad,Good company but management is horrible. Job task are always changing. They don't want to work with you about unexpected life events.
bad,Tons of turnover. Ask Personal Bankers to do more than humanely possible. Not a good place to work. Offer lots of benefits; only a great thing if you can manage to stay there.
bad,Sales is everything; Relationships aren't a valued metric. Mentality of how to be the best of the best is skewed. Very up to date and modern banking though. Strong systems.
bad,"Respond to customer inquiries on bank products and services via phone Maintain delinquent payment files and processes payoffs."
bad,"Constant concern around layoffs and job cuts driven by costs reduction goals. General feeling that job performance means little when pressures to reduce headcount are passed down. A culture of uncertainly and short term thinking. Why set long term goals when there is a sense that your organization will realign, leadership will change or that your job may go away."
bad,"Not worth the commitment because they high from outside more than inside, true call center environment with lots of attention on punching a clock"
bad,No ability to grow and learn. Management holds you down from advancement. Never allowed to take a lunch.
bad,They seem to be telling me that there is nothing else in the organization I can do. I disagree.
bad,Nice pay but they don't want to give full time hours too much.
bad,"Working for the bank is almost like working for the Devil. It takes a toll on you mentally and emotionally. If you are not prepared to be in it for the long haul, dont do it. They have great benefits, and the pay is decent for a customer service job, but that is all. Getting screamed at by customers every day for ""stealing"" their money is no fun, plus after you get a chance to move up in the company, the grass is not always greener on the other side. If you do go with BOA, just do your research and be prepared."
bad,"- 8 to 9 hour work day "
bad,"Very Unorganized Environment, too much mess in the work Place"
bad,"The bank seems more interested in stock price rising for it share holders and managements retirement plan, vs being competitve in California, Processing is a nightmare."
bad,"i learned to sell, to respect customers at all times no matter the situation, to keep calm, and not to take things personal."
bad,"The Bank in no way values its employees and it is glaringly apparent with constant layoffs, never ending job realignment, rare pay increases, non existent bonuses for most departments, among other things. "
bad,"Between keeping people right where they want them, no matter how qualified they are for the job that is needed to fill. Every place you work there is favoritism but they promote based not on how qualified you are but favoritism. They expect too much, work people too hard, and pay minimal."
bad,"I have been working for Bank of America for the past 6 years. I was a teller, sales &service representative, and lastly a teller manager. While it was a good job to start when you are young, there is a bottle neck when you want to move up in the company. In recent year, the stress level of the job have also increase exponentially because of more demanding sales goal, less staffing and resources and higher policy standard. Basically they are asking you to do 5x the job load with less recources and people than before! This leads to a lot of stress on the job, and no time to enjoy the workplace, customer, or the benefits. Be aware when you apply !!"
bad,"Not so challenging work is there, typical hard work. No appraisal at all."
bad,"When I started working for this company I felt empowered by the culture and support within the walls of the empire that is Bank of America. After countless examples however, it is all too clear to see that it's set course in current times no longer cares about the people that work so hard for them. Everything from questionable movement in management...styles, to the brisk removal of some of the greatest people I have had the pleasure of working with. My advancement has also become an issue, and with all that I have shown myself capable of I feel that this is no longer a company I want to be associated with."
bad,"Since we were ""just"" IT people, and people doing regulatory stuff, we didn't matter."
bad,A typical day consisted of back to back conference calls with members of your management team or project stakeholders leaving you either multi-tasking during calls or you'd work long hours to make up for it.  I was able to earn my Six Sigma Green Belt certification and practice the DMAIC structure (though Measure has now been split between Define and Analyze).  I believe it was either 50/50 on your manager on whether you would be given opportunities to grow or felt threatened by your ambition.  I did like the ability to work from home in their MyWork program.
bad,nothing to write for bank of America.....company too big to recognizes good employee
bad,Productive and enjoyable because at the end of the day you were able to help others understand or answer any questions for co-workers and customers. The hardest part of the job is time management because you have to give the best service you are able to and still get the back office work done.
bad,"meeting sales goals is the main objective of a banking center. employees are forced into uncomfortable, aggressive positions to sell to customers."
bad,"First of all it was a swing shift in the basement of a 9 story building in downtown L.A. with no windows, I learned how to be efficient and accurate while performing 10-key operations. Management was like the movie office space. I met life long friends. Hardest part of the job was making sure you were accurate and efficient or else take your incentive/commission that you received for being faster than their requirements. I enjoyed swing shift because you get to sleep in."
bad,"The money was the best part, other than that I would not recommend."
bad,"I am appreciative of Bank of America giving a job. I learned a lot from this job from trainings on Privacy Act, Fraud and Liability."
bad,Its no wonder people are die from stress here just like the young man in London.
bad,There was a lot of cross training which was very helpful.  Management was out of state and virtually non existent.  Those of us in NY and PA data centers went weeks or months without any management interaction.
bad,"Fast pace calls concerning all things for credit cards."
bad,"I gained a lot of life long friends the job was not good at all"
bad,"Long hours, difficult senior management, unrealistic expectations, unhealthy corporate culture.  Best part of working there was my team.  Great group of people who worked hard and worked well as a team."
bad,"Working for Bank of America was the first ""corporate"" job Ive ever held. In this fast paced environment i gained further computer and typing skills as well as the ability to work as team yet still be held accountable for my individual work. Working under a number of managers i got an insight of the type of perseverance it takes to obtain and hold a management position. The hardest part of the position i held was trying to help and make the best decision for everyone of the 50+ customers i talked to on a daily basis. The thing i enjoyed most about working for Bank of America was the set schedule and the opportunity to receive incentive pay based on our performance."
bad,Managers dont work. They are there as cheerleaders. You are forced outside of your job role constantly. If they are given a task it is immediately delegated to someone else. It is a bad environment to grow in and even worse to try and effect change in.
bad,Was part of a buy out and all jobs/departments was desolved..  There really no more to say
bad,always enjoyed going to this job. co-workers were fun to be around. the most enjoyable is company functions.
bad,"Depending on what department you are working in.... A typical day for me is very stressful, procedures changes on a daily basis which is fine but training consist of someone reading papers word for word and that's it. Management shows favoritism and if they dont like you, they will show it. A co-worker of mines told our manager that one of the systems was not working and he told her ""Well you can go home then"". Like what was that for? Who says things like that and act like that as a manager? Very disrespectful."
bad,"No work life balance, competitive salary, opportunity to work in different teams and in different verticals, fair people policies,"
bad,"Typical day at work: creating and updating client pitchbooks"
bad,My typical day was extremely stressful filled with overwhelming work loads and long work weeks. 
bad,"A typical day at work was a 10hr shift of multi tasking phone and computer work. Soothing irate customers.Selling accounts,credit cards, financial plans, identity protection.Helping customers with their banking,online banking and troubleshoot their computer programs and compatibility. "
bad,"Responded to al client inquiries, ie quotes, their statements"
bad,"My last boss introduced himself by saying ""Bank of America is my second job."" This was TYPICAL. When I was assigned a team across three channels, 30 of my 30 staff worked remotely. The FT had been there 9 and 14 years but would almost never come onsite. The onshore/offshore also were not online most of the time and few of them were productive. Even the five who were USA based would rarely come onsite. Rather than clean up this mess, my senior managers would not support any open dialog about [abyssmal] performance and my peer even actively worked to help the non-performing employees escape to his team - he'd also been there many years. People regularly dial into conference calls and announce themselves but are nowhere to be found 5-10 minutes later when you ask for them - not even online - and even onshore contractors do this. The place is a mess. That's the tip of the iceberg. A gal who'd been there 9 years in this same department and worked on the same small code base for around a year took 3 months to write a design document for a service layer port - a job she should have been able to do in 3 days. But, again, don't raise issues because you have to pretend its all good."
bad,Micromanaging and uncooperation
bad,The benefits are pretty good. They give you 90 days of paternity leave so that is something that is completely unexpected and is great as the first few months with a newborn are essential.
bad,"This company is trying to squeeze 3 jobs out of one person, it always has been. Too much for one person, either too many overtime hours for not eligible employees or none and the same amount of work expected done in no OT allowed for the hourly personnel. They lay people off every christmas, i just was and there is another huge wave of it in a few weeks. Managers are pathetic puppets just trying to keep their jobs, will step on anyone to accomplish this."
bad,"Bank of America is in a constant state of complete turmoil and is currently laying off thousands due to very low stock prices. Management constantly send mixed messages and the turnover rate at every level is very high. Co-workers are in constant fear of their job and as a result of this, they are typically not willing to share information with others."
bad,"Part-time hours were inconsistent & the constant referrals and selling of bank products made it harassment to the customer. As much as BOA boasts about not harassing its customers, all we did was solicit to customers. Benefits were good, management though were no better than used car salesmen. Alot of inconsistencies in policies."
bad,The bank did not have this position for long because of structural issues relating to their mismanagement of auto signatures on home loans.
bad,"In my last position I supported a region executive, debt products manager and underwriters. Solved office problems with vendors, building management, facility manager and information technology. Performed day-to-day administrative duties including drafting correspondence, kept vacation schedules, arranged travel and training for associates and performed any duties asked of me in various areas."
bad,"Process mortgage applications, answer customers questions"
bad,The hardest part of working at BofA is getting a true sense of career opportunities.
bad,"not impressed with the company it is today. was laid off on maternity leave, they denied a severance package after dimantling my dept. i could however collect unemployment"
bad,I would have to work 12 hour shifts back to back. Management was ok but didnt take the employees issues in to consderation. The hardest was the travel and the long shifts. I did enjoy the customers and working with them everyday.
bad,"Very goal oriented job, with a focus on numbers. i did learn a lot about the finical industry as far as stocks, bonds, mortgage's and other accounts etc. The management had its ups and downs ,never seemed as though everyone was on the same page. At times the hardest part of the job would be to deal with the management."
bad,"Responsible for Operational Risk Management, including Incident Tracking, Risk Mitigation, Response Management, and KPI Management and Reporting."
bad,"Start the day with team huddle. Setting the expectations and goals for the day. Everyone shares their commitment and action plan to exceed their goals. I delegates tasks to supervisors and assistant manager. Team is engaged throughout the day, making sure everyone is on top of their game. The hardest part of the job is when some team members are not meeting their goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is making our customers happy."
bad,Sr. management lacks the ability to develop it's direct reports & does not engaged with the staff in the production area. Management expects you to work over 8hrs a day to achieve their goals with little consideration about how you or your family is affected.
bad,I had to carry a pipeline of 300 files for almost an entire year
bad,"U.S. Trust was bought out by Bank of America in 2007. My assessment would be unfair from the standpoint that Bank of America was hit extremely hard by the downturn in the economy and we were caught up in this. A very unpleasant time for an office that had been bought out twice previously in 5 years. Conutrywide, LaSalle Bank and Merrill Lynch bought in sucession after us. U.S. Trust maintained a very high level of individual service to the wealthy. Bank of America due to size is system oriented. The credit crunch became extremely tight and clients were lost. Their business model was a poor fit for our office (circumstances, not something to blame Bank of America for). I am not familiar with the retail side of Bank of America since no branches were located in MN. Merrill Lynch brokerage platforms were a real plus."
bad,"Too many politics involved. advancement only for those that do special tasks like running errands for management. getting lunch, food etc. Management then records these events as training or some legit excuse. In reality this is fraud upon bofa."
bad,"On a typical day at the bank I would count money,open new accounts and make sure that all customers were happy when they exited the building."
bad,"The job per say I throughly enjoyed. Putting on my ear phones, blocking out all noise and just putting my all into the job. The benefits were good and the company's name alone made you proud to be a part of it. The downsize of it was the enviroment of people, mainly management. They were very partial in everything they did, nothing was based on one's ability only like or dislike. So because of these situations, the department was always in a very unconcerned, unsetteling, very tense atmosphere."
bad,I felt very small working here. My managers did little to advance me. They did pay generous tuition reimbursements. Not a very customer friendly mentality. Not much training.
bad,"The work is simple, its the direction or lack thereof in multiple job tasks that make the work confusing at times. If you are good at connecting the dots and constructing a solid self work plan to execute your tasks more efficiently then you will do very well."
bad,After consistently exceeding expectations and fully conquering the role they would still want you to stay where you are unless you belong to the inner circle of the leadership team.
bad,Was hired on as a contractor and they made sure that the contractors knew that they were only contractors and that they could not participate in the activities with the employers
bad,"They select leaders not based on skill, experience or leadership talent.  They choose leaders based on their ability to do what they're asked to do without questioning it, even if it’s wrong.  They have non-experts come up with strategy and make you do it.  If it doesn’t work it’s the employees fault.  If it does they take credit.  Toxi work environment"
bad,"You are a cog in the machine , hit your numbers you’ll be fine. But understand that with any large company trying to keep share holders happy you are a number. Sometimes felt like you were just a phone drone. People burn out quickly ."
bad,Company made you feel bad for taking sick days or vacation days due to the lack of staff in the centers. 6 day work weeks make for poor work life balance.
bad,"Workplace culture was positive overall until new management came in the past 2 years. Then, responsibilities were taken away without any notice or remorse. The hardest part of the job was working hard and not feeling unappreciated or recognized. Certain people are on the executive track and the rest fall away."
bad,"Worked way too many hours.  Had to ask for weekends off - scheduled work week was M-F - not weekends.  But worked most weekends.  Worked very long hours and very, very stressful.  No work/life balance."
bad,"Bank of America is a very political company with many egos, especially among management. Too many changes, many of which are unneccessary. And they claim to welcome feedback but it's not necessarily the case."
bad,Come here if you want to learn the 10 and great benefits. It was good while it lasted. I have no regrets I wish I never left the way I did. Bank of America pays more than most bank. Have better benefits than most banks.
bad,"Being a CA at Merrill Lynch (BoA) is very fast-paced, stressful, demanding, oftentimes thankless, low-compensated for the amount of work and huge responsibility. I was with a phenomenal team and that made it rewarding."
bad,Very poor and dismissive management. It is not an organization for a person with family; since there is no flexibility for family time off and/or accommodating for unexpected happenings.
bad,There was an undercurrent of ruthlessness in the management.  The IT contract staff was considered dispensable and able to be treated unethically.  Sad
bad,It was a very stressful work environment and chaotic at times where the staffing was kept to a minimum. The organization is top-down structured and hard to make changes even small ones.
bad,"If you are a.top.performer aand draw hefty incentives, the llonger you work there the.hardwr it is to collect. They will.listen to your phone calls and find anything they can to not pay you for some nonsense failure in the way you handles.the call. Worked there almost 10 years.and finally quit because it.became such a drain on my performance and monthly hassle. Cant win."
bad,"they will increase your goals every year by 15% and they work towards minimizing walk-in traffic each year by around 15% so your average goal gap is about 30% increase a year. there is a high turnover of bankers, usually a banker doesn't last more then 1-2 years. its pretty much once you bring in your book of business then after you'll be one foot out the door."
bad,Stressfull with high volume of customers made it hard to balance at the end of the day. Pressure is great if you are able to handle the large customer volume this is great
bad,I loved the culture at Bank of America. They are into career advancement and put a lot of resources in training new hires. I think in order to be a successful company it starts with training.
bad,"The Bank of America Corporation (abbreviated as BofA) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company based in Charlotte, North Carolina, with central hubs in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Minneapolis, and Toronto. Bank of America was formed through NationsBank's acquisition of BankAmerica in 1998. It is the second largest banking institution in the United States, after JPMorgan Chase. As a part of the Big Four, it services approximately 10.73% of all American bank deposits, in direct competition with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase. Its primary financial services revolve around commercial banking, wealth management, and investment banking."
bad,"Culture depends on office."
bad,Had to go to hospital once cause I was near death from poisoning. Manager had the audacity to call my cell and say if I didn't show up to work the next day I would be marked as an unexcused absence and having three of those means you're fired. I LITERALLY just had gotten out of surgery and was still groggy from the anesthetics.
bad,High pressure position with somewhat unrealistic expectations related to job performance. More hands on then initial introduction of position. Help or resolution to work place issues solely based on a position within the immediate hierarchy of the work floor
bad,"When taking a new role you embarks in a new adventure. You learn to navigate on your role and learn your strength and weakness"
bad,This was a contract job and once they assignment was completed the contract was done. Management hired poorly qualified people that during the training they were falling asleep
bad,All calls get listened to. If you are on the bad list it is easy to find a mistake.  Write you up. Get enough and you are gone.  A lot of faux dedication.
bad,Senior management at my organization lacks integrity.  Senior managers do not entirely abide by the culture & mission statement that they try to promote at Bank of America.
bad,"Bank of America gave me the opportunity to interact with customers daily however, the bank which I worked at was run down and under managed. It feels as though manager only care about their numbers as opposed to their employees."
bad,there is nothing that I wish to say about this company.  it is a standard company with politics and the usual goings on of any company of its size.  there.
bad,I worked for Countrywide at the time and BofA acquired us during the credit crisis. Countrywide was a leading single family loan originator in the country. Wasn't too found of the CEO during that time.
bad,It's a get in where you fit in type of company. If you happen to not fit in then they will let you go. Its clicks and all that high high turn over rate. I was top caller almost every month snd still had a hard time. And got let go right at a year. Rude staff... Rude bosses.....not inviting at all..... Will only work with you of you kiss their butt.......the customers talk to you however they want . bosses never have your back your always wondering if you have a job no matter how great you are. Your expendable
bad,"The job itself is ok, but the work structure is flawed. They do not care too much about employees there. They continuously overwork their employees, and the compensation does not match the work being done"
bad,It was great for a start. They sent a verbally abusive manager at our branch and literally after a year I was the only original guy there. Great banking learning experience. I would consider work there again if the money and location combination was acceptable.
bad,"If your great at sales and fast paced, the company is great. The pay was okay, and it is very easy to get promoted. Dealing with customers is not always fun."
bad,"VERY POOR management SKILLS, no form of helo nor assist within the team, and some managers are favor of other employees. the job is very demanding with less pay, there is no form of higher leadership when a claim is filed, and its also not handled well within a fair amount of time."
bad,"It was a tough environment that would not be tolerated as much these days. It was a very prosperous place for males, women had to fight a lot harder to be successful."
bad,"This is a job for single people who's career is the only thing that matter. There is no workplace balance. This depends on your market not the company. Great company , however the management structure is not the best."
bad,Unless you have 5-8 years to spend hanging out here or you meet a  quota don't expect to get promoted here. They like to promote lifers here or like to promote people to meet a quota (HINT: Eves more so than Adams). Have seen plenty of unqualified people get promoted to director without relevant experience.  It is very evident in every area from technology to business side.
bad,"You were told that if you decided to train in the morning shift, that would be your work time schedule once on the floor. That wasn't so. "
bad,"Revolving door of associates. Hard work not rewarded."
bad,This job is very independent on growing own book of business. Must learn and train on your own. It is a very tough industry for those who are young. There is very little support.
bad,"Management was rude, didn’t care about employees unless you were in a click with them. Didn’t give recognition to good and hard workers. Didn’t care.."
bad,"Working as a contractor for Bank of America came with some minor benefits, but the work groups I was associated with had higher than normal stress and few if any rewords for doing a good job."
bad,"The most dysfunctional organization I've seen.  Politics, politic, politics. Meanwhile, critical functions are ignored.  My business unit had (literally!) $100's of million in fines for various infractions, most of them due to negligence.  There is no culture of compliance; no one is rewarded for ensuring legal or ethical practices are followed if it cost $$$.  There are plenty of good individuals at the bank, but they are overwhelmed."
bad,"I was not at this company long enough to rate it fairly. The environment was comfortable, training was not long enough. The trainer did not assist once out on floor."
bad,"Days work was productive for me. "
bad,"Bank of America is a strong company with decent benefits.  However, due to the size of the company it has become less focused on the associates and has increased focus on profit and the bottom line.  There are many different lines of business within the company, and many of them have high turnover between 30-60% due to the lack of focus on associate engagement and development.  By increasing the focus on retention and associate development, the company would see even greater profits."
bad,Start with a really hight expectations about this job but unfortunately did not exceeded my expectations at all. Compleatly disappointed with superiors and upper management.
bad,Great training program however i was terminated after the forced sale to B of A in the financial crisis of 2008. All the trainees were terminated at that point
bad,Company. Expected  employees to meet unrealistic product sales goals so as opposed to actually helping the customer and their financial state would be forced to push products on people where the wad not necessarily helping them
bad,"I have been blessed to work with Bank of America for many years, "
bad,My recent job was challenging in the beginning but due to a production driven environment the quality of the work suffered due to the quantity of work taking presence over the relationship of the customer ...I would also say the people you meet are very nice and have the same common goal to make company great workplace environment
bad,Bank of America does not have as many resources as Wells Fargo. As a teller it was always my pleasure getting to know and assisting clients on a daily basis. Working closely as a team was another part which made the days enjoyable as you would learn something new daily.
bad,"Great experience in closing many complex real estate equity and mezz deals. Immediate colleagues were great and supportive. I cannot say the same about upper management which acts and communicates like they occupy the royal throne of Zeus. I guess that is a common downside of working in a really large organization. Compensation was arbitrary. Company spoke of a meritocracy, but I witnessed the opposite."
bad,"scheduled changed often and not always accommodating to needs "
bad,"Was just promoted, then laid off. Company did a bad job in keeping their promises and their employees up to date with current job status before promoting."
bad,"Department manager plays favorites:"
bad,The job was fine it was mostly stressed out management that left me with a bad taste in my mouth work is work so ill leave outside stuff at home the best i can.
bad,Plan on working a lot of hours if you are in IT.  I worked at BOA 7 years as an FTE and 1.5 years as a contractor and had no work life balance.  Pay and benefits are good.
bad,"Most days were very busy, there's always work that needs to be done, trainings, meetings, preparing for audits, role playing, and of course helping customers.  "
bad,Very stressful environment. Always had to sell something to a customer they didn't need. If you didn't have so many referrals a day you were written up.
bad,I relocated from Florida to Calif for this position.  I had two regions to cover and one territory was taken away from me for no purpose. The management was none all my fellow associates were displeased so it was not an up environment to work in.  I was the point of contact for all banking loans and wealth management needs.    I created and implemented seminars for executive retirees for Amgen and WellPoint.  I was paid a draw against commissions
bad,"broad scope of tasks"
bad,The department I worked in was very cutthroat and did not have a good working environment. They offered little direction and chain of command was very confusing. Management was not approachable.
bad,Senior leadership is not supportive.  The work environment is not pleasant and there is little flexibility.  The company does offer tuition reimbursement to employees.
bad,I’ve been with Bank of America for 10 years now and i’m Now looking for a new opportunity. I’ve met some really good people while employed here and have enjoyed the experiences.
bad,My time at Bank of America was short due to the department being dispersed and the location was going to be to much of a commute time for the pay I was receiving.
bad,"I wasn’t paid that much there. It wasn’t enough for an affordable living wage. It took a lot to save. There only good thing about the was the location, which for others is not."
bad,"When it comes to making a decision on what to you have to choose what is best for the customer, what is best for the company and what is best for you to meet your numbers.  They are often very different things.  The bank would of course want you to choose what is best for the business, you often choose to do what is best for you.  What is best for the customer almost never gets done."
bad,"To be completely honest, I wasn't here long enough to give a thorough review. From what I did witness in less than 3 months and being in customer service for 19+ years with most of it in call center settings. This call center environment showed more overturn than I have ever witnessed, far too laid back for a business casual and hire's huge groups for training with high expectations for all to stay at the same level during training with no set back. This corporation, I feel treats their new employee's as just a number which doesn't care if you come and or go since they are so huge in the industry."
bad,"Bof A culture is click oriented, insecure and lacking good management. The hardest part was dealing with blatant partiality by managers and the good part was lunch time to break up the day. I learned that micro managing is not an asset but a liability to to company culture and its growth for people that work well under company pressure and guidelines."
bad,"A typical day at work was to be on time meaning on time was not your start time at least 10 min early to be sitting at your desk. No bathroom breaks only on your two 10 min breaks or lunch time break. No leaving your seat at all unless its your scheduled break. Everyone was very stressed out there in that environment. Lots of people were on stress leave. The position became a call center and we had to answer a min of 150 calls a day and to have a min of 60 outbound calls. No missed calls were allowed or a write up and three write ups ended in a result of termination. Very strict there and you n ever knew if the day you showed up you or your team was terminated. They cleaned house a lot and especially around the holidays. The most enjoyable part about working for Bank of America was the volunteer functions, because that gave us time to participate with the community and for good causes, also not to mention we were able to have a break away from the stressful environment while being paid to volunteer. I don't highly recommend a position there in the call center environment."
bad,There are not enough options for career advancement. Several other companies offer comparable wages and benefits for much more industry exposure. Two stars
bad,"Poor management, lack of advancement, every week there is a new initiative that was not followed through on, inconsistent efforts by the management team,"
bad,"I worked in Richmond, CA and it was ridiculous. Required to stand 8-10 hours a day with lines out the door but only 2 tellers up front. Maybe 3 on a good day. Customers complained all the time about the line but there was nothing we could do about it because it was the decision of our manager. Ended up suing BofA for not letting us use our chairs because a lot of us ended up with injuries in result of being incapable of standing and running around like ants for 8-10 hours a day. Oh and ATM balancing is dumb. How can we replenish 5 in 1 hour and expect us to still open right on time? Run if you're trying to work for this branch. Oh and my managers loved favoritism. Upper management acts like they care about you, however that's not that case. Definitely a no go for me. Glad to be GONE!"
bad,Depending on the manager and the work ethics of the associates you work will dictate the work environment. It is a good part time job and a career for those who are unsure of what to do.
bad,the managers are usually too stern and fire people very quickly this this very frustrating to the employees because they hold on to the lateness rule like it was a bible which is very impractical
bad,I didn't like working for Bank of America. They make everyone have a goal in sales and if you don't achieve them you can loos our job. I would not work for them again.
bad,"This was an auditor position on contract which was ok for the time being."
bad,Establish rapport with the customer and to work with them on their over drafted checking and ATM accounts; plus educating them on the importance of keeping their accounts inline; and advising them of the ramifications if they fail to do so. This is done by inbound and outbound calls on the Awaya
bad,"bank of america management at least at my branch lacked professionalism, empathy towards customers and team members, all they did was sit around and order stuff online"
bad,Fantastic learning opportunity many different trainings available for each employee. It becomes overwhelming when your were hired for one department and realize they want you to do everything for all the departments.
bad,It was very fun in the beginning and I really enjoyed my job but the management and ridership was very poor.  The hardest part of the job was standing all day without having a permission to seat .
bad,No great growth opportunities. Titles are fancy but there is no recognition for the right talent in the areas i have worked. Work from home was a great option
bad,"Supervisors will go out of their way to demean you. I was told while in training by a supervisor that Bank of America was not the job for me. Super opinionated supervisors. Very judgemental. Poor, short training."
bad,"challenges with inconsistency, workplace was a challenging environment, increased my skills to better service our customers, the joy with job was business relationships established that help have a positive work environment"
bad,"It is a typical corporate environment. Its all about the ""politics"" and ""who you know"" to get ahead. It is a shame, but you have to be willing to kiss a lot of booty. The plus side, you can totally suck at your job and if the right people like you, you're in! The management(at least in my market)  was a joke! No leadership, just a bunch of bullies."
bad,"They say during the interview that they are looking for people that want to work with BofA. After eight months none of us were offered anything, even though some were doing very well on the job.."
bad,At Bank of America you are overworked and underpaid.  The environment was extremely stressful and the company did not take care it's employees.  I was forced to look for employment elsewhere.
bad,"Poor decisions the firm made in the runup to 2008 crash resulted in employees suffering from cost cuts, layoffs, org changes.  But otherwise, ML at least tried and strived to be the best"
bad,Hugh company with lots of opportunities and help to aid you in achieving your career goals. Much help in different areas to help in doing the best you can.
bad,"High stress with unreasonable production demands.  If this is your cup of tea then you'll enjoy the medical, time off and 401K.  It's a good place to learn what the corporate environment is all about."
bad,"Management expected us to oversell to customers in order to envoke monthly maintenance fees and expressed to us not to disclose this to customers, this was an ongoing business practice"
bad,"Started with 4 weeks vacation and bank holidays, which was awesome. But...that doesn't outweight the awful, horrible, biased management that had no position ever managing people. I suffered through two years of the worst managers I've ever had. These people had NO business managing anyone. And it's uneasy to learn that managers have discussed personal employee issues with people outside your department. Very unprofessional."
bad,They make promises they never intend to keep to make you go above and beyond. It's stressful and not worth the pay you get. Raises are stingy and don't support the growing living cost in the area.
bad,prepared mortgage information to get ready to be reviewed by 
bad,"I was hired on to perform the turn up of a new F5 ADC Load balancing Team. I was the F5 SME, specializing in GTM/LTM products. As part of the Rewind Two effort, I was tasked with educating jr. engineers and establishing processes lost in the return of work previously performed by MSPs. There is little opportunity for career advancement. The existing IT staff is mostly made up of long standing employees, and the historical narratives they are accustomed too. It is a very technically dated environment, and lacks sound architectural direction. it can be a very cumbersome and challenging place to work if you like to move fast, and be productive. Leadership is mostly a game of empire building and ladder climbing with little focus on the employee or their career."
bad,everyday was a struggle. There were so many lay-offs that you never knew when you were going to be next. It was literally one of those situations of it wasn't what you know it was who you knew.
bad,I would not recommend anyone working for Bank of America. It was a low paid job with very stressful environment. Management never cared for the employees and pushed people way too hard beyond their capacity.
bad,"no floor support when needed,  management mind or got bother when you raised your hand, and ask for help.  currently looking for a change of career. to stressful of a job."
bad,"Great Culture, however low pay and opportunities of Advancement within. Better to leave company, then come back in order to make more money or Advance."
bad,I worked for Bank of America for 6 years. During my time there about once a year if not more I was always effected by layoffs. I worried on a constant basis if my job would continue to be there so I could financially support my children.
bad,"I worked both full time and as a contractor for Bank of America. They are only concerned with their metrics and they don't care how you achieve them. I worked hard to turn in quality work, often correcting other people's mistakes, and was laid off because I did not meet the metrics. "
bad,typical day is to come in and try to engage and help team with any issues but manager would not say hi or speak to us and did not know our process for our job title
bad,they raised their minimum wage for new employees but left tenured employees the same. so new employees with no experience were getting paid more than employees that have been there for years.
bad,"The company picks favorites on management and advancement. Little regard is given to one's abilities, rather if your lack of integrity matches with the company. Micromanaging."
bad,"i was a part of the 4,000 employee layoff from their Lancaster California site. people were ok the management was a joke, and corporate didn't really give a flying care about anyone but the bottom line"
bad,"- Strong commerical bank; still figuring out investment banking"
bad,"Trying to move on from a culture that is not customer oriented at all.  Really demoralizing, sales pressure is unbearable.  No compassion for customers.  Use and throw away customers."
bad,"I was not a fan of this company once they bought countrywide, just very cold people and management. With no plans for the future of the employees, I would not go back"
bad,Poor Management. Stressful/Fast-Paced Environments. No Opportunity to move up in job positioning unless excellent sales records. Customers were mildly infuriating to deal with.
bad,I worked in a Loan Officer position at BOA and although.  The management was poor at best and getting any support staff to do their part was like pulling teeth.  The company pushed high pressure sales and actually would reprimand employees for taking the time to explain loan process to the customer.
bad,"Work often consists of busy work, fielding nonsensical decisions, and fighting bureaucracy. Departments rarely communicate with each other, and when they do it is largely through the language of politics and power plays, not shared goals. It is an easy place to just do whatever the day's assignments are, but not to innovate, improve processes, or otherwise have a meaningful effect on the business or culture. It is also a place that sheds top talent due to how a spreadsheet looks, and not based on loyalty, performance, or successful results. They will squeeze that talent for an idea or improvement today, allow their manager to take the credit and let go of that talent, therefore preventing any future gains from that source."
bad,"Very fast paced environment.  Handled many loans, plus online training on software changes, policy, procedure & regulations changes.  Mandatory to process loans while training to be a preliminary underwriter.  Too over-whelming.  Do not recommend."
bad,"No one is on the same page and there never is enough time in a day get on the same page. Its pretty much everyone out to help themselves and pass the blame. It's pretty much everyone just going through the motions and telling people what to do, but not showing them what to do because they can't do it themselves."
bad,The assignment at Bank of America was to short to make an accurate judgement as to what the work and life balance was. No benefits were received. Managements was good.
bad,"I support  the Ecommerce channel and this space has exploded with innovation and new technology.  I enjoy the chance to learn something new every day.  The application developers are very smart and motivated to share information.  Some parts of  the development process are very methodical and repeatable which makes for known expectations and the opportunity to automate with scripts.   Other parts are dynamic and unexpected and I need to react and understand  issues ASAP and provide solutions ASAP.  This means if there is an issue with process or with production, you are expected to cover regardless of how long it takes to fix."
bad,"My supervisor was nice, but I felt my manager just didn't like me and had it out for me. She picked and choosed, she had her favorites! I worked very peacefully when she wasn't around. With others she would start conversation or be nice but with me she never did it was just negative feedback. Managers here just try to save their end and take out their stress of the tellers."
bad,Start of my day was early and I worked until lunch.  Short lunch and back to work.  Finishing off the day locking up all information and going home to enjoy life.
bad,"Poor Managers are promoted and always the bad is trying to triump over the good there. Management is tricky, not really trying to do right thing in right way. There are some managers trying to cut the employee's rightful benefits to maximize their bonus. No paid sick days and deferred off days are not honored when the time you needed the most."
bad,"working for this company slowly transforms your personality into that of a robot. Verbatims must be followed to a T, despite that each customer has unique needs and different personalities. The company does not stray from policy and does not care who they upset, or who they have to fire."
bad,"not a manager friendly company.  They create a good old boys group and feed their drinking buddies rather than create an atmosphere of equality and teamwork.  Division managers are awful, incompetent and prefer to ingratiate their friends. Upper management at Calabasas are great number crunchers but only one was ever a loan officer.  They know nothing about the business other than laws, numbers and care nothing about people."
bad,I don't recommend this place for anybody. One of the worse location/company I worked for.  As much as i wanted to be a teller this job made me change my thoughts about it.
bad,"Position applied for was not position after hire.  Four different versions of position responsibilities were in effect after hire.  HR presented one version, training represented a second, work site personnel presented a third and immediate manager presented a fourth."
bad,"Very low pay mandatory overtime good management friendly environment "
bad,this was one of the most demanding jobs that i have ever had. management could be very rude and condescending which made day to day difficult and uninspiring.
bad,"The associates are nice, but they can seem out of touch at times. They seem to change the point of contact for a client and we don't always get the updates until much later."
bad,Production environments are always typically busy especially when staffing is an issue and we are not hiring as quickly as we are losing people unfortunately.
bad,"This company has no respect or value for education and knowlege you have.  Being fake and have a strong skills of office politics will take you anywhere. job security has no meaning for this company, we started as a group of 50 new emplyees and they ended up keeping only 6 of us. office drama alcoholic and rude  manager were the things we had to deal with every day."
bad,"Tight deadlines, perfection is expected, no errors allowed. FICC management is uninspiring and negative .Long Hours. Management need to be better teachers and motivators."
bad,The company is still going through layoffs. Multiple roles are being combined into 1 due to decreased FTE without increasing pay. A lot of uncertainty remains and company moral is low.
bad,"The Sales  was all about commissions and Upselling garbage insurances to the Clients. Poor Loyalty shown to long standing BofA clients who fell into hard times. "
bad,"A very Stressful environment, sales driven   standing all day, no breaks  except for 30 minute lunch. The job was not presented as sales position. Turned it to sales position not customer service."
bad,Merrill lynch was not a good place to work. Overly competitive and management was their only to serve the multi million dollar producers.  Clients came last
bad,This company is not what it used to be.  The do not support working from home at all.  Was a very flexible place to work when I started back in the day.  Not much fun to be part of the team in 2017
bad,"vaguely remember working at b of a, however it was not somewhere i really liked. Never thought about advancing with the company since I did not like their culture. This was over 10 years ago."
bad,"Fast paced, not good with customer service. No culture, pressure and more pressure. The more you give, the more they want. Great benefits though and good salary"
bad,This was a high paced work location for the field services team to care and maintain foreclosed properties that the bank owned. There were many thousands of portfolios.
bad,"While I enjoyed working for my immediate supervisor, I did not enjoy most of my time working here.  Compensation is adequate to start, but getting an increase, even the 2% COL increase, is impossible.  Getting to management level only happens if you know the right people."
bad,"I loved my job as a Operational Risk Specialist and Compliance Specialist, my days would go by quickly because the work was very fulfilling. A great majority of management got their position by seniority, they started off on entry-level positions and worked their way up. Nothing wrong with that, it's great but the majority of managers, including upper management, lacked formal training and did not have degrees. Their management style was what you would find at a call center or a fast food place, very rustic, unstructured, and unprofessional. The work place moral was very low, lots of people wanting to transfer or leave. A group of professionals, which some of us had education and formal training, would be better suited with formally trained managers. Benefits and paid vacation were good, although scheduling a day off could be tedious and was up to management to approve."
bad,"Didn't work there very long, pay was too low. Got a job paying more. At the time, years ago, had to dress up and wear pantyhose, its more casual now, its been many years since I worked there, so I'm sure things have changed a lot since."
bad,"They have had and are still having a lot of layoffs and redeployments. I was displaced into a lower role, and was impacted financially. It took a year to recover from this impact, and I am still in the lower role, without any advancement in site, as most positions that are opened, are opened with someone in mind already."
bad,"I would discuss if needed for employment.  I choose not to discuss."
bad,very stressful place. no team builders. no coaching on good thing only bad. no emotional motivation no time off. no benefits. the only thing that was helpful was the HR.
bad,Just didn't like the people there and not friendly. Not happy working environment that was not pleasant. I just felt not as co-worker but a body doing the work.
bad,"The employees were great. Meet a lot of nice  coworkers who was always willing to help. The department was very unorganized, training was a joke and management sucked."
bad,"Constant change without rationale explained. Limited contact with supervisor gives the feeling of drifting along without clear direction. Work is fast paced and endless. Bright side, good corporate experience/opportunity to network, and gain financial acumen."
bad,"I hated working there, they took my dept ad moved to another state, I got nothing, they ruined my career."
bad,Steady work but no real advancement opportunities mostly based on who you know and who likes you. Also not the best regarding pay or pay raises. Some management was good most of it was not.
bad,Expect cost savings initiatives and forced unpaid furloughs.  Some employees are great others are very protective of their knowledge base and not team players.
bad,"Having near a decade in Operations Management with this company, the overall culture and achieving promotions is mostly based on favoritism and not performance - in many cases but not all."
bad,Management shows favoritism.  Company does not value and retain tenured associates.  Many departments within the bank underpay their associates.  Benefits are getting more expensive every year.
bad,"It was very difficult to get into a permanent position because this job looks at credit.  I feel that jobs should be extended based on one's abilities not whether or not life happened.  People may have bad credit due to them being out of job, a loss of a loved one, etc.  I think that this is a form of discrimination because everyone that has unfavorable or fair credit is not irresponsible, there are just times when things happen that are beyond the scope of our control."
bad,I was promoted within 6 months of working here so the advancement opportunities are awesome. I love that their dress code is relaxed so you're not forced to be uncomfortable while working.
bad,"Only consider accepting a position within Bank of America if you are desperately in need of a job.  If I knew then what I know now, I would have never accepted the position."
bad,"My old company sold our unit to Merrill Lynch.  Merrill Lynch closed our office and transferred our jobs to other states.  It's been almost 20 years ago, so that's all you get."
bad,"Temporary position that provided mundate work, low pay and not enough hours to live on. Strictly a part time position. Not a good place to start a career."
bad,inconsistency of management instructions and expectations on doing the duties required. the environment was negative and stressful which made it challenging.
bad,"Constantly letting go skilled individuals and backfilling with offshore warm bodies. There is no loyalty among co-workers, which lends itself to highly unmotivated workers."
bad,Call center was awful. Didn't learn anything during paid training. Manager didn't know what they were doing either so it made the job difficult. Pay was great though and also had the potential to earn an additional $700 a month.
bad,"Great place to start your financial advising career since they pay for your licenses and pay a salary while you're in training.  Management can be difficult and given this is two firms rolled up under the BofA umbrella, corporate communications and organization are often disconnected."
bad,"stressful if you are in a banking position. forget customer service its all about sales, and if you dont meet them they will get rid of you quick. Stressing over my goals every month was not worth the pay"
bad,"After years of working very hard and long hours, there seems to be little reward to those who work hard for the company. Leadership does not seem to care about their employees personal or professional growth"
bad,Bank of America in NY has many opportunities to advance and grow your career.  The culture in NY is good and there are many good people that work at Bank of America
bad,Bank of America in NY has many opportunities to advance and grow your career.  The culture in NY is good and there are many good people that work at Bank of America
bad,"More work oriented with very less chances of training, employee development."
bad,"The CEO wants no more that 6 levels between him and anyone else in the organization; this sounds nice but in large groups it was severly dysfunctional. There is also a constant culture of reorganization, which most everyone fears they'll be left without a seat -- and eventually most people face this dilemma. The unfortunate ones are the ones left with their work doubled or tripled, all trying to make the newest CFO meet his lofty financial goals. A dearth of top talent exited over the past couple of years, people that I really respected, leaving mostly top managers that would lease their souls for their careers. There are some good pockets with decent managers, but the demands are increasingly unrealistic and challenge employee morale and effective execution."
bad,"I have been working at J.P. Morgan full-time (More than a year)"
bad,Too much sales pressure. pushed employees to do things that were not right for customers. Work life balance was not good. Spent more hours at work then home with family
bad,"Horrible culture, no company strategy or Vision.  Horrible dog eat dog place with a vicious blame culture, good pay, but takes it toll on you mentally..."
bad,"Do a huddle with Banking manager and associates, Greet customers, help them save money, help them with any of there financial needs. Bank associates will introduce customers to me so we can review there mortgage loan"
bad,"They pay only $2000 a year in tution assistance, yes other companies pay much much more, this will not even pay for one semester at a real university, way to promote Associates degrees there BOA.  Thier bonus structure was monthly based where the top 300 performing reps in the center got a bonus based off of where they were in the top 300 list...that is a joke, and people would get fired monthly for manipulating the numbers, and still get paid out the bonus, and it was not adjusted for the rest of us who would have made a bonus if not for those bad apples."
bad,Continually asked to put firm ahead of clients and employees.  Firm did not want anyone to speak up and offer ideas. Firm is full of leadership that just wants to not lose their job
bad,"The Great Recession provided a magnified view of the corrupt institutions. The ability to earn a high commission salary is dictated, and will test many morals."
bad,"A typical night shift at BAML was always busy, lengthy presentations, logos, front covers (normally bankers want 3-6 examples per night), template creation. "
bad,Empresa não valoriza o lado humano é nem a vida pessoal do funcionário. Benefícios e remuneração muito bons porém com uma carga de exigências desumana
bad,"This was 6 years ago, during the recession, micro-managed, uncomfortable environment, then, prior to closing our office; we sat for months with nothing to do; it was a relief to leave."
bad,great benefits great managers everything else is not that great. if yu go out on leave and come back they treat you like they never et you or you are a new hire
bad,"It believe in only en-cashing the brand."
bad,The company itself has really amazing benefits! But when you leave work everyday truly unhappy it doesn't make up for it! Perhaps it's just the area or management in my region!
bad,"Bank of America is doing alot of cut backs and it has truly made the job stressful-- its all about goals instead of the customer. When I orginally started it was a great place to work, but then you noticed the shift in money hunger. It wasn't a great feel at all"
bad,"This place taught me how to value myself. We were often times unable to take breaks, work late hours, training was not good, sales pressure was constant, performance evaluations were never done. I learned a lot through making many mistakes and I was glad to be gone from there. It was a place to learn what I wasn't willing to accept from an employer."
bad,Lack of respect for customer; makes working for such an organization difficult and frustrating.  Especially when one is passionate about helping customer and providing the best service possible.
bad,"Every day the majority of employees go to work wondering if they will be laid off.  That has a huge impact on ones health and ultimately productivity of the group. "
bad,"8/2016- Current "
bad,"For me, Bank of America was as stable a banking environment to work in as any, I suppose, but if you interview with BOFA/ MerrillEDGE, be sure to inquire about: the daily working level of partnership between the bank side, the mortgage side, the business services side and the investment side, of course. Be sure to ask in detail about compensation, how it's tracked, how it's verified and when it's paid. Ask how proactive the banking center manager(s) where you will be assigned are to working with FSA's."
bad,"The training did not properly prepare me for the work involved. Once on the job, management was unsupportive.  The call center environment felt like a pressure cooker.  I have worked in other call centers but never had such a negative experience. Despite this, I did well and received good reviews and awards and I enjoyed the team spirit of my coworkers."
bad,"Mangers change constantly and there is little to no support. They call it ""being on an island"" and that is true. No one is around to help. "
bad,I would not recommend anyone working here. It's very cut throat and there is very little support from management. Everyone is out for themselves.
bad,"Not the best career choice. Culture of the company and industry is changing at a rapid pace and not in a good way. Little career advancement choices, company tends to promote from outside firms."
bad,While working for bank of America Edd I was always being rushed by my supervisor and I did not appreciate it very much the were gonna fire me because I was not quick enough on the typing
bad,"Lack of strategy meant constant churn and reorganization; leaders did not get to know their people and managed talent without knowledge and insight; despite warm, fuzzy brand image, TD is all about cost cutting and reducing head count regardless of the impact upon people; classic case of not living the values"
bad,"No Pros, just Cons, I have nothing positive to say, so I would rather not say anything at all. Hard Company to work for, I have never worked so hard in my life and still feel unappreciated."
bad,"my position is no longer there. The job ended, there is nothing for me to say about this job. I can not get pass this page unless I type stuff."
bad,"Unfortunately, Bank of America held relationship managers to unreachable sales goals. Think of what happened with Wells Fargo; I personally discovered falsehoods and many cheaters of the system if you will. I found the environment extremely negative and felt like a used car salesman rather than a financial advisor. In addition, due to business need, I (everyone) was mandated to work six days a week. On the flipside, the benefits are excellent!"
bad,Overall it's OK to work for in the beginning when you are excited and eager to learn. they are very strict and stern when it comes things such as being a min back late from break.
bad,"Top- performing professional with over 10 years progressive experience in banking and finance, seeking to take next career step in banking as a branch manager. Expertise in managing personal, corporate, and small business accounts, and building long-term relationships with customers. Accomplished in selling banking solutions to drive sales and revenue by delivering unparalleled value and outstanding service."
bad,"The manager wasn't professional with customers, especially if customers had issues concerning their bank account. The culture of the company, they had to many co-workers, who wanted to be the bosses of others, which created problems among the actual manager and others."
bad,This was a temporary job. Training was limited and a lot of OT had to be done. It was a great opportunity but not able to get hired on. Management was very unorganized also.
bad,"No management. The head of the assistants has no understanding of the systems in place. No technical back-up. Only allowed to book travel and process expenses. About the level of the so-called manager, Not worth applying - a job going no where. Company policy - no assistants will be promoted."
bad,"this was a very small company with clinics in several states.  as such the workload was tremendous.  I was the only person processing credentialing for the doctors, billing for the clinics.  it was very stressfull"
bad,No view to share. Try it and decide for yourself.  It is important that we all try things in our lives.  When it comes to working for other people it is important to decide for yourself if you love a job or you don't love a job.  Not every job is for every person.  When looking for a job I would decide for myself if the job is one that will fit me.  I may not be the same type of person that thinks the job is good or bad.
bad,Pay is good. The best part of my job was the co-workers they made it fun to come to work and enjoy being there. You pretty much manage your to an extent.
bad,"•	Establish new relationships with clients and build existing clients relationship "
bad,"worked there before, went back after 5 years, still using the same old technology and philosophies. no progress has been made. The main thing is how unhappy and defeated everyone seemed. They gave up on being happy and decided to work at Bank of America."
bad,"I loved being a teller but would not work for BOFA again. The interaction with customers were great for someone who's extrovert but the pressure to sell products, even when the best interest of the customer was not at play, was too much for me."
bad,"Lowest Paid Teller/ Banker. They tell you, you don't get paid bonuses as a teller because you get paid so much hourly. Complete lie. Compared to other banks id say its the worst to work at."
bad,"Great day at workplace for the projects"
bad,High stress environment.  Direct report manager did not seem to have a good handle on audit processes. Methods seemed archaic.
bad,I think I learned how to not treat my employees. The current management intimate their employees and threaten them with job security.
bad,I have no faith in this company. Family doesn't come first and this is not a company to stay in long. I can see why the associated don't last long here. The associates hardly know anything!
bad,"Organisation is overly bureaucratic and not streamlined.  Many areas of the business operate in silos, little job security, morale low."
bad,A dominant old boy's network culture that does not encourage upward mobility of the competent. Skewed in favor of the young; poorly educated associates including senior managers. Good benefits.
bad,Worked with the Bank for many years and learned about Mortgage servicing and Bankruptcy amongst many other items. Thank you.
bad,The enjoyable part of the job was the technology the company used. Very user friendly and they systems were the same whether in the branch or customer service so there is one cohesive team.
bad,"Merrill Lynch was an alright place to work at first, but then I realized that was because of the people I worked with, not the company. This company and it's management were very ineffective, and were not good, save a couple managers, at progressing your career. I would not recommend working here."
bad,Amazing products and services however lacks the ability to connect with the associates.  So many lay offs make it hard for front line associates to effectively perform their job duties
bad,"Good starting pay ($11.30 per hour)."
bad,"Bank of America doesn't care about the lower employees.  Upper management tries to intimidate you instead of encouraged you.  I even caught the site director laughing at an employee when he was being fired.  Just laughed in his face.  My immediate team manager was great through out it all.  She went to war for me to keep my job and I thank her for that.   The job is all about the numbers and nothing else matters.  Not your leadership ability, not your work ethic, not even how you interact with customers, JUST THE NUMBERS.  You can do every single thing they ask you but if the numbers don't meet the criteria then your gone."
bad,Fast paced work environment. Not enough training to enable to do the job. Below average pay. Minimal work/ life balance.
bad,"It has been a while since I worked there but the most important part of the job was to reach goals such as making and opening a set number of referrals and accounts, respectively. Also, making sure you limit your errors in counting to make sure you balance at the end of the day."
bad,"Retail banking is rapidly changing. Everyday is a different day. Always on the look out for fraudsters and just crooks"
bad,Very stressful. Not everyone was treated fairly. Co-workers were great. Management did not always communicate with associates.
bad,"busy day"
bad,"Wasn't for me.  Never felt comfortable there. Didn't really agree with how the company dealt with customers. Just refund clients fees , give them incorrect info and don't solve their query. They seem happy with this once you flog the customers some Card Protection or another overpriced product."
bad,This company did not exhibit a feeling that they valued their employees..My co-workers were pleasant. the hardest part of my job was trying to relate to the Senior Vice President. I didn't learn very much at this job..my skills were honed and were not appreciated by the managing director.
bad,"I did not learn anything at this company other than I did not want to work for them again. The pay was horrible and the atmosphere was stifling,"
bad,Not a very pleasant place to work.  No room for advancement.  A lot of a favoritism from management for particular associates.  Not a professional environment.
bad,I don't have much to say about bank of America due to its not a concusive environment for learning or organization I really thought it was going to be a place that I could retire from
bad,"Always been told if you do not have anything nice to say, say nothing. There is something nothing good to say. Just seek employment elsewhere and you will thank me later."
bad,"working at Bank of America has been an a rewarding and awful experience at the same time. Although there's room for advancement, it is only reserved for those who are well liked by management but not necessarily because of their hard work and dedication to their work"
bad,very co-operative seniors and peers. Was able to balance work life. Had long work hours but was able to balance work life and personal life.  Got to learn a lot
bad,"I worked here for just about 2 years. I was hired to be part of a new Flagship Mortgage Underwriting location; however, the writing was on the wall since nearly day 1 that this location would be closed. The problem was, when I was hired, it had been determined that we needed centralized underwriting, based on quality, however, shortly thereafter, a series of upper management changes occurred, which resulted in a different ideology being presented every few months. By the time the workforce had adjusted to one ideology, a new one was soon in place (sometimes without ever being informed). As a result, no one idea ever seemed to work as planned, so production/quality always seemed to be suffering site wide, which lead to multiple layoffs, and eventually to the site closure."
bad,"This is a huge company that has grown so large they have no idea what is happening at the ""boots on the ground"" level of the company.  Direction is changed constantly, re-orgs and lay offs are common and the morale is very low."
bad,"For the management or the corporation and what you have to deal with, and the pay you get it isn't worth it. The sales are the only thing that matter - not the customers. Not fun after being pushed so much to make people take what they don't need."
bad,"typical day at work is being on the phones on day long, i have two 15mins break and a hour lunch, sometime the customer are nice sometimes there mean.  Management is okay you ask one person a question and they give you a answer but it seems that nobody every give you the same answer for the same questons.  Love my job when i talk to friendly people and they just want to keep on talking.when changes happen they tell us at the last minute. Out whole department changed and they only had us in class for 1 week."
bad,Great team members work here but they are not up to date with their systems separating NorCal and SoCal when I worked here.  The job training is not close to your actual typical day at work so you need to be a fast-learner and observe and absorb.
bad,Processed mail for 8 to 10 hours a day. Work force made up of 90% black females and hardly NO MEN.  Required to work every weekend and some holidays.  Learned how to process wholesale and retail checks on office machines.
bad,Its ok for entry level positions only - Its up to the individual that is applying for the job. Good luck it can be nice just not a postion to retire from
bad,At Bank of America I was able to fine tune my people skills managing a large number of employees and motivating them to meet daily and monthly goals as well as work with the public.
bad,"•	Receive and count working cash at beginning of shift"
bad,"Want the name on your resume? Go ahead. Other than that, experience was negative. Appreciation is lacking, all financial centers are struggling in terms of numbers of people, and yet upper management continues to push sales and numbers."
bad,"The management and human resources of this company is despicable! Working for 24 years, I've learned that they do not value their employer."
bad,Completing transactions for customers.  Working with new bank products.  Assisting customers with the new product and what would be the best fit for them.
bad,"I loved working for this company because it gave me the chance to move up with the company and always be on top. I loved being able to help my customer on their goals and their everyday need or wants. The only down fall I had with this company was the ethics that they push on you.. They wanted you to push things on to customer even if they didn't need it. I wasn't someone that would do that I was there to help the customer for what they needed and to have then trust me for future wants and needs. "
bad,"I enjoyed working with the company but unfortunately, it was through a temp agency and the term of this contract was very short. We worked with Customers accounts and helping them with fraud impack on the accounts."
bad,"Wasn't very concerned about employee morale or environment. Not a stable company, so you are always unsure of where you stand when layoffs occur"
bad,working with agents in order to short sale property.  working with this company was very relax atmosphere but the job was only temporary through a temp company.
bad,Disorganized management directive. Hard to understand what recourses are and best practice on how to exercise them. It is very hard to advance depending on your department needs and standard which are usually unclear. I did however meet and work with a lot of good hard working people. Teamwork is the key to survival.
bad,"Worked at MBNA for a number of years. Whilst under MBNA it was good and a fairy happy place to work. Then BANK OF AMERICA took over. For the first few years there wasn't too much if a difference however, once their roots bedded in WOW did we feel it.  Unreasonable demands on people,  Too much money thrown at whimsical training programmes (which are mainly aimed at an American audience) which just doesn't sit with uk employees/customers. Every aspect of your role was essentially micro managed so I have no freedom to speak to customers in a genuine and sincere manner. caps on most pay/ progression. Hard to even side step, unless of course your friendly with the recruiting manager. Barely any progression available. on the job training is of a very low standard, they scrapped the useful face to face training sessions with an 'educator' for awful online manuals. These are awful, hard to understand, if u asked your managers for help generally they would tell u they didn't understand most of it either and that they would just wing it until the results checker told them they had achieved the required pass rate.  Targets in customer facing areas are very unrealistic and management take into account that if a couple of people 'achieve' then everyone else can..that would be true if these people were doing their job correctly, however in my experience these people would be sacrificing call quality (as they knew they were only checked on 4 calls a month out of hundreds!) And rushed to get their customers off the phones then myself and my more conscientious colleagues would get the customers"
bad,B of A is changing there structure. It will be a service center aka Financial Center strictly for sales. They do not want anyone in the financial center unless  a client is looking to open a new account.
bad,"Bank of America does not care about its employees and treats you as a group, not an individual.  Managed you by the clock down to the minute."
bad,Fantastic pay but be prepared for high targets and lots of pressure to perform. Good location and good team work ethos. Long hours.
bad,I worked in a call center at Bank of America.. There is no growth and it is very micro-managed. I did learn a lot about different types of checking and savings accounts.
bad,"Without going too far into what happened at MBNA, there was a completely unavoidable situation that caused my contract to be terminated. The thing is- MBNA told me that the reason was because I didn't inform them about the situation as it was occurring- and I absolutely did and have proof of that."
bad,My work was good yet the technology department is very lack in retaining great employees. The hardest part of my job was navigation through multiple LOB's.
bad,I did not enjoy working in a retail environment or weekends.  job is for those in their 20's.  although there are several other to transition to
bad,"Acknowledge and appropriately greet politely and assist every customer in a timely manner."
bad,Use to be a great company.. not anymore. Management is awful on the mortgage side. They are to big and will continue to lay off people.  Not a good work atmosphere.
bad,"Top level management tries to implement something very next day what they see in dreams at night and as a result of that they'd make account mistakes, sell toxic loans and pay fine to DOJ. So, they have to cut cost to balance all that. How?? By taking your bonus. Their pay for performance is a big joke."
bad,"hard to advance, favoritism everywhere, benefits are good. The management is very shady. co workers different based on department,your breaks are watched"
bad,"It was a very dusty and disgusting place to work.  Co-workers were miserable, which lead to me being depressed. Management seems disengaged. A typical day at work was attempting to get the outdated, broken down currency counting machines to even work before I could do anything productive."
bad,"Working as Design Team Lead "
bad,"Bank of America in New York City was a very demanding and competitive work environment. Employees frequently worked more than 40 hours per week and were not compensated for overtime worked. The primary focus of branch employees was to sell as many products as possible without a true focus on their customers' wants or needs. Employees had to take classes on how to ""Sell The Bank of America Way"" and were required to stick to a selling script when interacting with customers. Sales goals were generally unattainable making it very difficult to earn sales incentive bonuses. The job culture here was very cut-throat."
bad,Wouldnt ever work for bank of america again!!!! Didnt like the company or the management or the job or the management!!!!
bad,Don't like this place treat you like a slave.  The requirements are way too extreme... If you need a job then fine but if you have a choice run away quickly
bad,"Bank of America is a company that has great products to offer to the customers and as well as a large base of customers.  Unfortunately, the culture and management forces you to put people in situations that they do not need to be in financially.  Management tells you to push products and as long as you get results, they do not ask any questions.  I have only been there a short time.  I have not been properly trained even after asking for more training.  I have had 5 different managers in the short period of time.  There is no direction and no sufficient form of learning your job before you are put in a situation you do not understand.  On top of that, when results are not achieved you are threaten to lose your job if you do not change it and you could lose your job any day.  "
bad,"After over 30 years, I was terminated for not meeting my sales goals. The sales are more than 50% of the job. So if you are good at sales this would be a good place for you."
bad,Job is very unprofessional and management treats you any kind of way.
bad,"The environment was tensed a lot of the time, the flow of customers and having to condust transition timely and sell products was hard at times however, overall is was okay."
bad,i learned the online bill pay service. I also helped customers concerning there web settings. In order to use the online bill pay service other than that. It was hard  to get promoted too management.
bad,Bank of America is a powerful name but the company is going in the wrong direction. There is only one teller which means all customers must come to your desk and you will have someone process the transaction while you're supposed to sell them.
bad,"It's a great started job for someone just graduating high school...It's very fast pace and you have to be great at multitasking. Managment expect a lot from you for the little money that is made. The calls are never ending and management is hardly around to assist you when needed."
bad,"Advise customers for retirement and other future goals. Recommend mutual funds,bonds and managed money."
bad,"Was initially hired as an indexer, promoted to a trainer and then promoted again to Quality Control.  "
bad,I am a very hard worker and too many people float and do as little as possible
bad,"As a long time employee of LaSalle and for a few years with Bank of America. The culture of the bank changed. I had done just about every job that the bank had to offer from teller to management (without the title or the pay) I enjoyed the day to day workings of the job. From training to leading new market products I was always the first to learn and teach my coworkers as to be prepaired once we emplemented any change."
bad,"unable to advance within reasonable time frame.  There is always something that is changing, and you get updated very quickly along with any training that you may need."
bad,"constant change, no structure"
bad,On a typical day the bank remains busy almost all the time. I learned many things like how to cash the check and deposit cash and check. I learned how to open and close bank and to open and close vault. My management and co-workers were always good with me. The hardest part of the job is that it is demanding too much from one employer. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there are lots of customers who knows me very well and became friends of mine.
bad,"Way too much time is spend reorganizing, focusing on cutting staff.  Company hasn't truly grown other than through acquisitions since the 1980s.  "
bad,This job very repetitive and has an unstable schedule. You can't plan anything because you never know when they going to say you need to work on Saturday. I don't like that this company is racked with lay off every year. You don't know if you're going to have a job from one month to the next.
bad,Expectations changed almost daily. A typical work day would be coming in plugging into a phone and computer to have customers yell at you over policies you could not change for them. You are excepted to help the customer  with out adjusting the fees they are angry about while keeping a small talk time on the phone.
bad,"Great place to learn, grow, tough atmosphere to grow. long hours"
bad,"Okay to work for the company and constant change, learned a lot."
bad,"Too sales oriented, upper management don't really care about the employees and their career advancement."
bad,Not enough structure. everyday was something new. Would not recommend the Noc
bad,Great place to start career in IT services but not one that has any growth. To many associates in same position for over 3 years. No upward movement. Micromanagement by some under qualified managers.
bad,"I had a generally good experience here until the layoffs began.  After that, I went to work every day wondering if I was going to be let go.  The bank is nice when it hires you, but once it's done with you it becomes oh well nice to know you, good luck in your future endeavors.  Also, a lot of the managers seem to be in positions that are beyond their skill level, and they are severely lacking in people skills.  They seem to think that because they are in a position, they must be good at it.  Which they are not."
bad,"answer phones, aquiring customers for different credit card companies. I learned how to basically sell credit cards to people. The hardest part was when people would hand up on me abruptly. The most enjoyable part was when I would make a sale."
bad,"My typical day consisted of inquiries about interests rates and credit card balances. I dealt with customers, who inquired about specific charges on a biil, or interested in transferring balaces from credit card  to checking accounts.The hardest part of the ob was an irate customer. The enjoyable part was the satisfaction a customer received, and the environment."
bad,"I was on a six month independent contract and couldn't wait for it to be over! The lack of respect, unreliable managers, delays in underwriting, unrealistic expectations, and high stress environment were enough to make the whole office feel like a living inferno. Overtime was a must, no personal time boundaries respected. I learned what my personal limitations are and what I don't want while working for a company. This particular office has now closed down, not a surprise!"
bad,"I was a new employee here.  They hired me because of my sale experience, but when I arrive, she would not let me use my skills or talents. During training on the job, I couldn't even hold a conversation with a customer.. if I did.. she would pull me aside and ask ""what are you doing?  Don't do that"".  There were multiple occasions after training that she would come in and watch over me while I was trying to close a sale.  One time she even talked a customer out of consenting to make a decision.  I am sure this company is good but the way this branch is handled is totally disappointing.   All the business is directed to a seasoned banker there and new bankers are left with the scraps.  This is not just my opinion.  They cannot keep new banker there.  I found out that I was the 3rd male banker within less than a year.  None stuck around. "
bad,Management constantly threatened us. Even when we did our best it was never good enough.There is no job security. BOA  laid off entire location with no advance notice right after we were told we were doing a great job. Never think you are going to be with BOA for a long time. Layoffs are always happening.
bad,I never had a problem with stress until I started working here. Most employees do not last a year. They are always hiring
bad,"Come to work and call customers to collect on delinquent accounts."
bad,There is no training. Mortgage is terrible. Micro manage you to death.
bad,Excellent benefits and career opportunities. Campus is well maintained and in good locations around the valley.
bad,I can't wait to graduate and find a real job because this job is just not very good. They pay low and treats employees bad.
bad,"This company is steadfastly working a long-term plan to consolidate all commercial and corporate lending onto LoanIQ as system of record. LoanIQ is primarily supported by non-U.S. teams so many many existing employees are in the process of working themselves out of jobs. This has created an unhappy, insecure and unduly stressful environment. It is my opinion that U.S.-based technology people are better off working for a good consulting firm than directly for Bank of America."
bad,Could be a stressful work environment. Management changes frequently so you must be able to adapt to change.
bad,"management is not familiar with software development process, technology is several generations behind, currently (2014) software is developed using approaches from mid-90s. Agile is abhorred, and most waterfall projects fail."
bad,In this job you almost have to be on your toes all the time. It's never a dull moment. Best part is able to put a client in their new home. The job can be very rewarding and yet stressful at the same time.
bad,There is not structure in the training process. Constantly changes rules several times in a 8hr period. unlpleasant work environment.
bad,"bad management, great co workers. I learned a lot of valuable information"
bad,I enjoy the aspect of working for the Bank - however management seems to be the issues.
bad,"Close short sales nationwide from designated files in individual port"
bad,being able to help people in their time of need. Making sure they are okay
bad,My typical day is to locate recorded assignments through various sites. Once located prepare a report and send those assignments to have them log into the system.  At times we have to call different counties thoughout the country to locate recorded assignment
bad,"long hours, seated for many hours a day, but much interaction with the public and our supervisors, decent pay and hours worked every week"
bad,The company seem as thou they don;t really care about employees.  They switch jbs and are not very open about what is going on.
bad,"I have worked at 2 branches and have helped at another while they were short on tellers. B of A as a company over all tries to act like they care about customers and their employees, in reality it depends on who is your manager and who you work with. Its all politics. Very stressful environment at times and even though they have the ""whistle blowers are protected"" policy, I still dont feel comfortable enough coming to my DM or HR about issues that are really making my work environment just stressful. The pay is decent for when you have bills to pay, having sundays off are nice... Don't expect to get saturdays off unless you're a favorite. Raises are up to if your managers approves them which is not always fair in my opinion since they aren't the ones supervising you during the day. Over all, its a luck of the draw."
bad,"If you're considering becoming a new teller, bofa is a good place to start. It could be very hectic and on the go, but that's a good learning opportunity. Micromanagement is one of the biggest problems for in branch hires and needs to be addressed."
bad,Long hours and not enough pay for the responsibility you have. Lots of deposits and withdrawals from customers and you must balance at the end of each day. If you are off money more than 5 time you will be fired.
bad,"Bank of America is a pretty good place to work. I would say however that the last few years have been very hard to work for them. It is very hard to build and maintain quality relationships, because they keep cutting positions in our region. Just when customers get to know and trust someone they rotate them to a different center, or eliminate the position as a whole. All of the change in the Market has taught me how to adapt to constant change. I beleive that as a leader my job is to keep a positive attitude and continue forward. My favorite thing about my job has to be my employees. I love getting to coach and train my emplyees. The best part of the job is seeing my employees succeed. I am a big team player and believe that you get what you put into your people."
bad,"A great place to work."
bad,I worked at Bank of America during the integration of CountryWide.  The systems were not compatible and BofA could not handle the amount of volume.  We had some customers waiting a year just to refinance their home.
bad,pay does not compensation the demands of the job. there is a lot of red tape and politics. a lot of layoff
bad,You cant sit down for 8 hours! Customers are very rude for the most part. Not my cup of tea.
bad,Management is not very supportive of staff.  Very robotic place to work for.  Co-workers were nice but afraid to open up and speak their mind.  Work was enjoyable but always felt like big brother was watching over you.
bad,balanced before and after shift. processed new banking  information for new customers.
bad,"Adding Milestone Templates for foreclosure Handling correspondence with attorneys compiling chronology reports for foreclosures that went beyond the standard length of time required for the foreclosure process to finish."
bad,Bank of america has many many things that they do well.  But unfortunately they do not know how to manage their empployees.  They hire managers that barely know what is to give great customer service or how to assist their associate correctly.  they worry more about numbers and not about the added stress it cause the associates.  they forget many times that they are human and have lives outside of the work place and many time treat them as slaves.  they need to learn how to intergrate a better training not just reading out of a computer because not everyone learns this way.  the incentives for bankers should not suffer because of another associates attitude.  I am happy i am no longer working there honestly.  I would rather work for a company that values thier associates and respects the work life balance rather than push them out with threats of losing their job with they don't meet all their matrix.
bad,Processing problems. It takes to long to close. B of A cancels loans for little reason and rarely have the customers best interest in mind
bad,"This review is directed more towards my location than at Bank of America overall. I work in Lockbox in the College Park location.  It is highly unprofessional.  Most of the managers have no education beyond a high school diploma.  They are bullies and treat you like children.  The work is not hard it is is a production environment but the working conditions are stressful.  You have leads constantly breathing down your neck because it is too many of them and they have nothing better to do.  The equipment is old.  The building is old.  Laying down some new carpet is not a renovation.  It is hard to take time off.  Most of us work weekends and/or at night so there is no work-life balance.  We are given 2 weeks of sick leave but penalized if you use it.  You have to schedule vacation time off a year in advance.  How do you know what time you will need the year before?  It is insane.  No more than one associate per team can be scheduled off so you are forced to call out and get written up.  We are supposed to be given two personal days but they take it from your vacation or sick days.  The managers play favorites and don't even try to hide it.  The turnover is ridiculous.  I have had five managers since I started a few years ago.  The few who came from outside the bank left quickly once they see how unprofessional the environment is.  You can tell most of the employees are uneducated.  This is probably their first ""real"" job.  They do not dress professionally.  They come to work in pajamas or looking like they just left a nightclub.  Once you get in it is hard to get out.  Managers"
bad,open branch and help customers with banking needs. I leaned not to allow my personal life to affect my work. Management was good but not the best. I learned what to do and what not to from my manager at Bank of America. My coworkers were great and taught me a lot about processing banking transactions. The most enjoyable part of working at Bank of America was meeting some of my closest friends. The hardest part of working at Bank of America was talking mortgage products because it was all new to me.
bad,"You're just a number and can easily be replace"
bad,BOA was an okay company to work for. The management was overall good. We were not micro managed and I liked that about the company.
bad,Overall the management was not good. The work life was typical life in the office but the work was processed and if we are machines with no brains. I didnt learn anything there.
bad,"*I handle customer needs with their deposits, balances, cashing checks, and questions.  I promote the bank's products and encourage customers to use their ATM card as an ID."
bad,Hard to move up in your division. There is a lot of red tape to getting anything done. It's very frustrating trying to advance your career.
bad,"Just okay, no job security, good work life balance, good people to work with, lots of issues with upper level management.  The work can sometimes prove to have no meaning."
bad,"Not a great work environment/culture.  There seems to be a great deal of turnover within management - I've had four different direct managers and three different managing directors of our department in  less than two years of working there.  Also, compensation is low compared to rest of the Street."
bad,"Assisting clients who have been declined for HAMP or a Modifications                                                                                                   •Offer HAFA program to clients, obtain paperwork for approval                                                                                                                      •Assist Negotiators with Listing properties for sale                                                                                                                                •Ownership of 50-75 accounts monthly"
bad,Horrible at job advancement assistance and compensation was bad.
bad,"I handled Wealth Management clients and helped branch associates solve complex issues related to homeowners mortgage loan/loans held at the bank. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people and getting the job done for the associate or homeowner, hearing them say ""Thank you so much for all you did for me!"" made any hard day well worth it. The hardest part of my job was the management and the unequal treatment reflected in the companies leadership. You should not be against your associates you should help build them into the best employees possible."
bad,"typical work place, good for students, ok management team, company is not better than most about recognizing for hard work"
bad,"My manager was terrific however upper management was very vague, not forthcoming with  information and never as the people who new the process for imput."
bad,A typical day I go to work to service my customers.  I pretty much work alone.  I take pride in having my customers close sooner than expected.  Some cases go much longer depending on the situation.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the guidelines.  In the mortgage industry things can change daily so if I'm ready to send a file for a final review its a chance it will come back with additional items needed.   
bad,Bad Company upper management rule.  They Like you... you stay 
bad,"I was hired as a collector on a contract, what I was actually doing was far from collections. This made my job very difficult their priority's  changed daily. I did not want to work there when contract was over and position offered to me "
bad,simple does not car about employees at all. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
bad,Was ok just that I had to pay for parking all the time. So I had to leave for better opportunity
bad,"The Credit Card Cust. Svc. job is o.k. but they are not really concerned with the reason the customers are calling, they are only concerned with you upgrading their credit lines or putting more cards in their wallets."
bad,At BOA I felt discouraged in the beggining because the training for my position was underminded due to lack of organization and staff deficency. The pipelines were filled with loans of 95 or more on a daily basis challenging me to meet company standard and exceed my required metrics. I gained my multitasking skills and communicating effectively to get the job done. I also felt that there was a lack of leadership due to my management not having any experience in mortgage lending. I took that opportunity to fully indulge in as much knowledge as possible so that I would become independent and a help to my other co-workers.
bad,the management really changes from branch to branch. There is no formal training and management seems to do as they please
bad,My first job as a teller in which they sent me to teller training school
bad,Prefers to hire younger people for mimum compensation and who do not understand their rights under labor laws.
bad,"Working at Bank of America was a good experience in the beginning but when they merged with Wells Fargo they forgot that Bank Of America was a job and not your life per say. A typical day at work was like the more work you did nothing was getting done, you never knew when there was going to be a turn over or layoffs. I learned a lot because I was a part of the development team. My co-workers made it fun and easy to work. The hardest part of the job was the management not recognizing the importance of family the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to implement ideas that would help the hands on employees job a little easier"
bad,"A typical day is running around while your manager and assistant sit at their desk. Most of the managers get hired from backgrounds that make them struggle in the banking industry. And if you want to advance within, forget about it. You have to kiss up to everyone to even be considered."
bad,Mostly design work for Bank of America's internal financial clients.
bad,"Management and Senior advisors, barely want to talk to new people and they want you to fail, the program is designed to make 95% of their Financial Advisors in training to fail... They fail, get fired, the senior advisors take their clients and the wheel keeps on rolling..."
bad,"I enjoyed helping my clients, as a Trust Administrator I have to assist them with all of their needs (e.i. Financial, Healthcare and personal)."
bad,Bank of America is your typical large corporation with profits being of the upmost importance. Management is lacking and promotion is possible if you are willing to be sneaky and throw your co-workers under the bus. The stress at this job is not worth it.
bad,-Monitored 15 to 20 calls daily.
bad,"BofAML has had a hard time integrating post merger. Personalities that were conflicting have long since left, thought the technology and systems of the various aquisitions remain in place and hinder productivity."
bad,.....with a changing culture. The mortgage challenges of this company - much of it inherited through the Countrywide acquisition - and subsequent aggressive (and seemingly never ending) cost cutting (including multiple rounds of job reductions) has really impacted the morale of the employees.
bad,Company did not have any soul. Relative disregard for customers.
bad,I learn about Mortgage and how they work. And Foreclosure Mortgage
bad,Company too large and disfunctional
bad,"I worked in the IT areas for about three years. The IT management uses India as a cure-all solution for their lack of management experience and lack of training in software engineering. The average output for one vendor is around one line of code per day and the average for another is around two. The expected average for a software developer is ten. Ironically, the Bank of America India company is one of the better vendors but the internal managers have their favorite other vendors and use them instead."
bad,Very disorganized and the turn over rate is through the roof
bad,I think that being a teller there is good only when you go to school and want to do part time. This job is good for you if you like sales and customer service.
bad,Dont do it. My 17 year career ended in Business Card due to miscommunication from Senior leaders to their Managers. They have no idea what they are doing. MBNA was a great place to work. Bank of America is as screwed up as their stock price.
bad,Somewhat productive and fun environment and a fun place to work at times
bad,"temp assignment, it was a temp assignment... and back of america bought them out and took control and that was that..."
bad,"After being with the bank for 4 years, I left dissatisfied with the company as a whole. Granted, it was the people I worked with more so than anything, but the bank was not a good place for me. Maybe that is the reason why it has such a high turnover because a lot of people think the same thing. There were enjoyable parts but the hard parts outweigh them. Management...sucked. I learned to never try to work with Bank of America ever again."
bad,"i learned a lot from working at bank of America great core values excellent customer service and a ton of problem solving.. i just wish management was Diffrent and fair and the only down fall was that it was only a part time position,"
bad,"mail room, packing, delivery mail to the office and at well at shipping all over the country."
bad,A typical day of work started with you logging in and taking the first call. You could not go over a certain call number over a certain period. Management only really cared for themselves it had to be something really serious in order for you to come to them. The hardest part was the constant breathing down your neck
bad,Benefits were the only good thing about working here other than the team I managed.
bad,Repitutious environment. Learning opportunities are limited. Management is not willing to progress their employees or encourage them to reach their potential.
bad,data mill with a management without an idea of what/where they are going
bad,Overworked and under valued of employees
bad,"Constant re-orgs, constant concern about being laid off, long hours"
bad,Top financial firms in the world. Heavy competitiveness among colleagues. Interesting take on team work. Only the strong survive.
bad,A good place to work until Bank of America took over. Enjoyed working for MBNA. Job security was never an issue with MBNA.
bad,"Branch staffing model was too small.  Often led to employees not getting proper breaks, managers not having a chance to eat lunch, and frustrated customers looking to take their anger out on employees.  Fine company, but resources were just spread entirely too thing"
bad,"Consultants were constantly getting furlough (suspended from work w/o pay) and laid-off."
bad,Lack of diversity the higher the job title and band. The average salary is low and not competitive with other banks. However the bank does give u great healthcare benefits.
bad,I find working for Bank of America to be an adequate job that suits both my financial needs and career goals. Banking operations is a challenging and unique challenge.
bad,"poor management, politics, Hiring of friends and family."
bad,All depend on who's the boss.  Many cases son people are more acceptable regarding  Financial Status.  Very flexible when the Emergency approach.  Very Inconcider if you need to use the bathroom.
bad,"It is what you expect but worse.  Not ethical, management will not support you. Will not put you in position to be successful. Will replace you at drop of a hat."
bad,"Great Company, poor management! I honestly feel like the culture of the bank is caring, however the management is trash they do not care. Although I have great benefits, I’m looking for a better job."
bad,They pay more and have better benefits than competition... The management team is not experienced and over micro manages impact low team performance..
bad,Management was not friendly/ felt as if I couldn’t ask any questions out of training. Did not explain compensation well enough .........................
bad,From the very first day we're told that they care so much about their employees and it's a great place to work for. Well in my experience my manager was extremely unprofessional. My supervisor was extremely unprofessional as well. Would not recommend this job to anyone. You can report things but they don't take anything you say seriously. The job is stressful enough and to have poor management it definitely adds on to it.
bad,"Drafting of Master Agreements,"
bad,"Challenging environment with rapidly changing objectives, aggressive demands, and inconsistent objectives.  Management focused on managing up with often unreasonable demands of the operational team"
bad,They prioritize promoting the employees that come from their college recruitment program at the expense of those who were external hires.  This is the usual big company culture where everyone fends for themselves.
bad,Not a good environment to advance your career. The only people who get promoted are those in power. I had an awesome immediate manager. The rest were just talkers and never followed through.
bad,I moved to a position that was supposed to be an advancement that fit my home life and after accepting and moving to the new role they changed the hours and various other factors in the role which severely and negatively impacted my life. I requested assistance with moving back to my old role or one similar. They put me on leave and have told me every single position available I do not qualify for. I had only 2 months to find a position and only 1 was paid. I lost my job and was put into a bad place financially.  They are not a great company. They do not help you and they dont care about anything but their company even when misleading employees.
bad,"I have to say I was a little disappointed with the management and work culture in the department. As a contract associate, there was a clear discrepancy in treatment. We were hired for contracts for one year and the assignment ended unexpectedly after two and a half months due to lack of work. I'm not sure if the process is the same in other departments but it took about six weeks to even receive our computer log on information. I have never experienced the lack of leadership experienced at this location. Everyone was kept in the dark regarding training schedules as well as details on the actual project we were hired to do. The job itself was very elementary and non stressful. I was able to do my hired job for about two weeks before being moved into the vault to ""straighten shelves"". I literally was expected to straighten files on a shelf for 8 hours a day. I truly expected more from the brand. I would caution all potential contract associates on accepting positions due to lack of contract term and overall lack of knowledge from management."
bad,"I worked at BofA probably 30 years ago and it was a good company then.  Then I had to return to work after a 15 years absence from the work place, and I did not hide that fact on my resume,  My husband had become very ill, required 24/7 care and after trying to hire help with no success, I quit a well paying job to care for him.  At the time I thought it would only be a few months, so I was told, but it turned into over fifteen years.  I was hired based on my work experience of over 15 years ago.  When I started I found out that the banking industry had changed to something that I did could not even remember it being when I had left..  All of my coworkers were 30 plus years younger, just starting their careers, which generally would not be an issue, but I just did not fit in and the bank was not a good fit for me.  I was continually being compared to my coworkers by my manager and I did not think that was fair or correct.   I have about 5-7 years to work before I finally retire or maybe longer if I find a job I really fit into.  I have no set time frame to retire.  Due to a prolonged illness of my husband, who has now passed on, I find myself in this position.  I had taken about 13 years off to care for him but now need to return to the workplace and I know I can do an employer an excellent job in the right position.  Bank of America is a good fit for a young worker, probably male,  just starting out that doesn't mind being in a large organization that expects much from its' employees.  Benefits and pay are probably equal to most financial institutions but the culture is not"
bad,This company sets unrealistic sales goals. Very stressful environment and in the location I worked it had very poor management. Team coaching was more of a disciplinary action rather than an opportunity to coach.
bad,"Very fast paced with limited training, make sure you get in good with your manager and unit manager as favoritism is the only way to advance or keep your present position"
bad,"Horrible management, micro management. Staffing reduced to such a level that has created a hostile work environment with irate customers constantly complaining and some even threatening."
bad,"I worked at a contact center for over 18 months, was enjoying my job, was training to a job coach,  then I was blindsided and terminated.  GOOD  LUCK!"
bad,The company provides a lot of different job opportunities to grow within the company. The only unfortunate event is that it seems every year they will provide a lot of employees with severance packages which doesn't give associates confidence of having job security.
bad,"If you were lucky enough to be with a good manager, you could survive. Mostly extremely stressful. constantly short staffed. Would give us sales goals, though we would get the applications, the goal itself counted when the applications were approved. This was rarely happening considering they had very conservative lending policies and didn't even educate us bankers on what those were. No change to really help the client. All about product pushing."
bad,"Many different department with no cross training Pay is median and the raises are laughable. benefits are sub par and management has little to no training is the area they manage,"
bad,"Management doesn't care about you, lots of favoritism. You wouldn't hear about a position until after management informed their friends first. Nasty rude management."
bad,No room for advancement seniority means nothing. Pay not competitive Management unorganized and efficiency not a priority. Team morale was consistently down.
bad,"They will never be fully staff  a center as they don't want to pay people but they don't seem to understand why costumer get angry when they had to wait in line for 40 min because there was only one teller. For this reason don't even try to call in sick cause there is no one to replace you. they have unrealistic goals for the sales teams (so unrealistic that I saw 4 people have mental breakdowns because of the position) but that's really the only option for job advancement/ job security as they are doing away with many positions. If the managers aren't getting the sales goals they need they will just shuffle them to a different center, so expect to have a new manager every 6 months. If you work downtown they don't pay for parking in the building thus if you don't want to pay 200 a month to park you'll have to walk 6 blocks past some really unsafe areas. They also make you put in for vacation at the start of the year. they also like to pile on new responsibility which has no benefit to you, aka no pay increase, harder to get off sick, increased risk of something going wrong and falling back on you."
bad,"good benefits, No room for advancement. Goals too high to achieve so they dont have to pay bonuses out to employees .Not competitive in the marketplace."
bad,I've been employed by this bank for 10 months now but I was feeling frustrated on the 6th month since if you don't meet your goals you will be micromanaged and pushed to push your clients for sales on a daily basis. I believe that establishing a positive relationship should be the primary target as well as gaining client's trust and earning their business v. trying to pitch them a credit card after they've come in for a temporary debit card. I've had many clients complaining that we were product pushing
bad,Bank of America doesn't allow employees to have a work life balance. It's very hard to juggle a family and working at Bank of America in today's 21st Century world.
bad,"Local management was outstanding."
bad,Decent for if you are starting your profetional career. Wouldn’t stay past a year or two. Growth isn’t as expected only maybe move up a dollar  with a raise. 25-75 cent raise every year if that.
bad,"Poor work culture in technical areas."
bad,The people were great to work with Mgmt at time didn’t know how to manage to just keep it simpl.. the bank has a mentality of don’t worry about knowing the process just know how to manage the people...
bad,Very strict structured environment - Your day will be on the phone from the moment you arrive till the moment you leave - if you take a moment from the phone you have to document what you were doing - no other training or support offered except for what you need to do your specific job- poor morale
bad,"Crazy calls, no support for management, must sale on every call, no time to resolve customers issue within the average call time, pressure is constant, tied to your desk, no career advancement"
bad,Good company for starting out that is my knowlegde of this company. Friends who work there tell me it has improved over time but was hard to be part of a large company.
bad,"Working directly as part of the actual lines of business was great. I was highly regarded, and had many opportunities to hone and increase my skillset. "
bad,contractors are very disposable bank consolidation removes jobs for IT and contractors are not real employees and it is all about a a culture that is big business friendly and labor unfriendly.
bad,"Management really like to micromanage, lot of pressure on meeting sales goals and do cross-selling, some times pushing too hard. That's why other banking institution have gotten in trouble for offering services and opening accounts the customer does not need."
bad,"I worked there several years ago and I was much younger so things might have changed. With that said my experience was not great.  I enjoyed the job per say. I really liked interacting with the clients and handling the money, it was a lot of fun.  I hated having to sell credit cards, I am not a good seller.  I had to leave because the management would not work with my schedule."
bad,"The bank is an extremely stressful place to work. You are treated poorly from customers non stop, the higher ups just care about the bottom line of removing tellers and can care less how much burden it puts on the rest of the employees."
bad,work place culture is set more for college age workers.
bad,bank of America is a great place for a beginner into the work environment however it is not a place to stay long term. Management team needs a lot of work learning how to develop a strong team of workers that do their job effectively and efficiently.
bad,The work culture has had many changes and adjustments within the last few years.  The restructuring of the department has made challenges to achieving work/life balance.
bad,"A typical day begins by logging into the bank system, and taking calls mostly from irate customers. It is a high volume call center in which you must preform sales and log complaints."
bad,"Lack of training, support and work life balance is non-existent. The training is poor, and it feels that often times, you're set up to fail, and if your personality does not fit the BOA profile, then you are going to be ignored, regardless of how well you do. Being fake to get by is really hard to do."
bad,"- Managers got promotions based on who they went fishing with and to college with. Not based on knowledge, expertise, and experience."
bad,Great hours for family oriented people. The culture was not very customer friendly. Sales is a huge part of the job but the compensation for it is not competitive.
bad,"Originally working for Country Wide was awesome.  Great salary, monthly bonuses, Quarterly raises.  I happen to work for one manager my entire time for Country Wide and Bank of America who was an excellent leader and very intelligent and resourceful.  With CW it was 40hrs per week.  Once BoA came in the picture bonuses decreased, lay offs, more difficult guidelines and policies.  Hours increased.  The upside was we were able to work from home.  But the down side was the workload and hours increased."
bad,"Management had their favorites and if they liked you they would put you in lead roles regardless of the lack of experience. The company as a whole is awesome in every way. First and second level management needs to be trained on how to deal with people. I worked in Premier Card Services and there were lots of surveys based on your calls. Even if you did well, there was no help in promoting to another position / department. They lie in the beginning like they will help you promote after your first year but it's not true, they do everything in their power to keep you stuck in that raggedy department with those crazy calls. They want you to be a slave, stuck taking very stressful calls with little pay and little time to yourself in your personal life. Requested the Sabbath day off due to my religion and was told, on more than one occasion, no. You have to work Saturdays and Sundays and they're not flexible on that at all, so I quit. People do have a life outside of Bank of America!"
bad,Should only hire for this position from employees already working for the company. Parking deck should be in empty field next to the building. Base pay too low.
bad,"typical day is helping clients face to face and making contact outside and inside. problem is to many managers all stirring the pot, In other words to many executives causing confusion in direction for employees. There is a manager to manage bank managers, there is a manager to manage bankers, then sales performance managers, and their managers."
bad,"Typical Call Center environment."
bad,Terrible and incompetent managers. Very abusive manergerial style. HR would only pair with the managers to let the real issues unresolved! No retaliation was just a joke!!
bad,The training I received here was excellent for an entry level position. The training prepared me for my career in financial services. Direct management was very poor.
bad,"Upselling customers to take advantage of opportunities to increase bank revenue.  Taking calls , servicing accounts.  Good benefints, no advancement for career minded individuals within this department."
bad,"Fast pace, not a lot of movement, management doesn't share a lot of the ends and outs as to why things are done the way they are. The polices they have in place are not in line with what they practice."
bad,"I started working there when it was MBNA. I loved working for MBNA. There as a sense of pride when I worked for MBNA. You were noticed for your good work and rewarded for it. MBNA was acquired by Bank of America and it went downhill from there. We, as employees felt like a numbers. Bank of America is so massive they didn't care about any one employee. It was a sad place to work."
bad,"Workplace culture required long hours both before and after work, standing on your feet for unlimited hours of the day.  Sales calls throughout the day."
bad,"At first, it's exciting with thoughts of advancement and growth within the company, however, the constant struggle of making a lateral move is nearly impossible. If you are single with no kids and don't mind giving up a full Saturday twice a month, then this job is perfect for that individual. great benefits but that's where it all stops."
bad,This was just a stepping stone to something more. I was here to pass the time and to pad this review. Why do you have to fill this out? Just post my resume.
bad,I worked for BAC for over 20+ years and saw awesome talent either walk out the door or shoved out the door because of poor management on multiple levels.  Disheartening to see a great company discard talent.
bad,Poor management for the most part. When we finally had a good team with great management they switched everything around! Never enough employees because of high turnover rate. Upper management doesn't care. Everything is too stressful. Everyone I was working with quit.
bad,Stressful job environment. Work environment and culture almost non existent. Not encouraged to think outside the box. Opportunity for advancement or movement barely available.
bad,"Typical over-qualified candidates recruited for underpaid positions.  Not forthcoming with ""actual"" details of the position until you have signed on and commit to 1 year in that position.  Young management comprised of those who stuck around, rather than those who are great leaders.  The company is a soul-sucker with great promises and little return."
bad,"I gave BofA all I had, and honestly - they were good to me.  I was let go after the Merrill Lynch merger was completed.  I had not expected that.  (I completed all transition projects successfully.)  Work/Life balance was not good."
bad,The management here is poor... if your not best friends with them they micro management everything you do.. the managers are so unprofessional. . You only get promote if your best friends with your manager too..they don't train on their process your expected to figure it out with no errors ...they no longer gI've bonus and if you get a raise it's up to ALL  manager nothing about the working skills
bad,It wasn't easy to move up or gain recognition if you were not connected to someone that is popular. I left because i gave my all to a company and in return I was getting nowhere.
bad,No advancement opportunities.  It is a place that doesn't value employees work/life balance. I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a regular nine to five.
bad,"Things have changed significantly in banking overall; but, working for a Fortune 500 behemoth like BoA has definitely soured my interest in remaining in the field. The sales quotas, tactics and overall management  on the consumer bank side was very aggressive and lacked professionalism. I felt much like the folks at Wells Fargo did I'm sure with regard to meeting weekly sales numbers."
bad,"The best way to describe working for Bank of America is...... management tries to ""fly the plane with just enough fuel to reach the destination"". If one person has vacation, managers have to call around to other centers to find help to cover that person's role in the center. If someone calls out sick, the branch cant open until an hour later. Also, incentive compensation has so many ways to cut your pay. Advancing within the company is difficult because upper management only promotes people who conform to their way of doing things. If you dare to question anything you'll be blackballed. It's not a place for original thought. 401k is great!"
bad,"Stressful place to work with low hourly wage and you have to pay for your  medical benefits."
bad,"High sales goals coupled with abrasive, people-unfriendly tyrannical management really sucked the life out of this position more than the company's direction to computerize every aspect of banking. The pay was also definitely not on par with the workload, stress, and responsibility."
bad,with their goals it really makes it hard to balance work and life be prepared for the juggling act . their expectations and reality are far from the same.
bad,"a typical day at work involved long, mandatory overtime hours that are added on to your schedule on a day by day basis according the forecast. its hard to schedule your life around your work. especially if you have a family. prepare to take at least 100 calls per day, overtime, and short lunches 30 minutes. Sometimes they would ask you to work through your lunch."
bad,"Was there for 5 years, no advancement. And penny raises. The location shut down i was at and had to commute from Richmond to Norfolk and left because i found a company that had more growth potential."
bad,"easy going, nice people, helpful. good training. holidays off. managers don't help as much as I think they should they show you 1 time and you better learn it"
bad,It is a very cut-throat job. Very little tolerance for any errors when on the floor. You are closely monitored with every incoming call that you answer.
bad,"There are many different positions and departments one could work within. Training is likely the best component of employment, as training is usually thorough."
bad,"Steady hours: 9 to 6 everyday, 9 to 1 on Saturdays"
bad,"I've heard a call center can be much worse, so I like to think of that job as a great stepping stone that afforded me the opportunity to finish my Bachelors Degree in Finance and learn from some very intelligent  people along the way."
bad,"the culture is very sales centric and associated are not as important, very few changes are made to accommodate employees or clients, very huge focus on profit margin"
bad,"I was thankful for the job at Bank Of America.  Although, management isn't so great and the direction the company is moving in is lazy, unprofessional, and not something I wanted to be apart of.  They are making use of other resources such as mobile banking and ATM usage, but losing long term customers in the process."
bad,"I was taught that if you don't have anything constructive to say then don't say anything at all."
bad,I resigned because I tried to post out several times to a non-phone job and was not given the opportunity to do so. I wanted to be off the phones and be an underwriter or Fraud Analyst. I was not given the opportunity for either position.
bad,This was a contract position for me that lasted 18 months. The pay rate was good and the job was not too demanding. Management was not heavily involved with the contract employees and there was little to no opportunity to become a permanent employee.
bad,Compensation fair but prepare to compete for advancement and recognition. Company changing to less family friendly employer and more stressful work environment. Lay offs more common than before. Pay raises and employee benefits are becoming less every year. Used to be such an outstanding company to work for.
bad,"Terrible management , compensation not even with peers  in same job position, unable to retain good associates  horrible benefits , associates  are awful to work with"
bad,"Learn and growth from the first day you enter the financial door , lots of thing to learn and growth , it depend what branch and location of the financial center you work with ."
bad,"This place is just like Wells Fargo, sales pressure is too much and management doesn't know how to handle that. Havent worked here in a very long time though."
bad,If your great with sales then you will do fine here.  You can be praised on moment then fired the next. Great benefits but the job isn't cut out for everyone. Very unstable work environment and there's constant micromanaging.
bad,"boa was a tough place to work...definitely not for the average joe unless you dont mind politics, i enjoyed working there but didnt like the false accusations and backstabbing"
bad,"The benefits are great but the people or co workers are very unprofessional. The high end people are not there, you feel used. To grow within is very hard it is actually best and most likely to hire someone from outside then for you to grow within. The managers make it so hard almost impossible. In the bright side you get four months off for maternity leave which is neat."
bad,"Bank of America ask bankers to sell products without giving bankers pricing, their programs are not consistent and management does not care about employees. "
bad,Incomplete job training provided. Manager lacks skills and tactfulness to deal with staff. Stressful job issues. No time to attend other activities offered on campus.
bad,People close to your job were friendly and nice. There was very important interaction among peers. There was the opportunity of growth within the company. Management was opened to employees. Very goof relationship among all.
bad,"Fake.  Drink the ""cool-aid"" type of culture.  Not for everyone.  Fast-paced environment with revolving door mentality.  Too many changes without proper notification, usually a banking regulatory or internal procedure.  If you ever took a vacation, coming back would be a new learning curve.  Management were robots.  Can't think of anything positive to state."
bad,"New department so things constantly changed, including commission, which was taken away easily. Everyone looks out for themselves only. No ""team"" atmosphere, you'd be lucky if a co-worker said hi to you in the morning. Management doesn't care. Training was long and not helpful. They treat you like a robot and are more worried about how long you go on breaks then the sales you make."
bad,"taking high volume calls to assist clients with everyday questions on their statements, and maintaining a 100% on quality on a monthly basis. Multitask between 6+ systems to provide clients with the best customer service experience possible. Have assistance from floor support TIGERS, team chats where teammates assist each other with everyday questions and managers assists when escalations arise. Work place is great, very diverse. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with, we have become a family."
bad,When economy crashed and countrywide was bought BOA employees were told they were safe from layoffs and and had nithing to worry about. 2 days later about 6000 BOA employees laid off while all of Countrywide employees kept their jobs.
bad,"While many are dedicated to ensuring the quality of work/life balance, there is an opportunity for greater focus to provide a stronger overall balance for the front line associates."
bad,"careful with your money"
bad,"Great company to work for and the compensation is good. However, staffing is a problem as the company is trying to push customers to use mobility and ATM banking instead of the teller line. It's an oxymoron situation. On the one hand, the traffic to the branch is the bread and butter of the center and the profit and revenue that the company rely on, because of the chance to sell products to customers and non-customers alike. On the other hand, due to the  truncation of tellers and elimination of other positions the Bank is pushing customers to alternative banking, thusly depriving the branch of golden sale opportunities. As a result, many managers are at loss and unable to succeed. They receive the brunt of customers' complains due to long lines, and the at the same time the lashing out of their senior managers. It's becoming very stressful to be a leader of a financial center at BOA."
bad,"Although this job was not the right one for me, BOA would be a great place for a natural born salesperson to work. I enjoyed the atmosphere and benefits of the job but sales is not for me."
bad,"The section that I worked at was trying to save our jobs by forcing us to also spend half the day doing customer service. Basically, we got hired for one thing and where then forced to spend half the day doing another all while maintaining our old responsibilities."
bad,"Would not recommend long term. Management does not foster employee relationships, but rather it's who you know and if you are in ""their"" club. It's a niche type of atmosphere where you are singled out in any given moment if you disagree on any topics such as minority hiring. I realized that within the recruiting group, it seemed that they would hire non-minority but demanded that we all focus on hiring candidates for positions to be minority driven. So practice what you all preach. They will hire who they like. It's baffling."
bad,Bank of America is for people who have no children. The demands of this job is extremely difficult for people with small children especially. So great place for people with no children looking for good pay and advancement in a company.
bad,"It is a Hub of various process related to International Banking industry. "
bad,"I had a bad experience working for this company, poor management at the banking center I work at . The training was very poor, I had management that couldn't help me with the new system, policy, and procedures that was under Bank of America."
bad,"The hardest part of the Job is trying to meet unatainable goals."
bad,"work is very unstable.  Can be slammed with work one day and nothing to do the next.  Management is fair.  Good training is offered,  coworkers are very helpful, management is very understanding."
bad,Cutting people right and left.No one is left! If you live in California the I suggest you find another company or find yourself in Texas or Florida.
bad,"At Bank of America they have now changed their policy on how customers are treated, customers are no longer a priority.  They dont care how long customers have to wait as long as they are opening new products.  I have a big problem with that as I am a people person and feel that customers should be treated with respect and be their top priority, which for me is the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,I worked for Bank of America for over 9 years and reflecting back on my career there I wish I left sooner. Starting in an entry level role I found the pay and vacation was above average but the work/life balance was poor. It was very difficult to take the time off desired and have the schedule that fit my life. Once I moved into mid/upper level positions this changed. I was able to take the time I wanted/needed but worked in a state of fear for having my position eliminated. Every fall and spring there was another round of layoffs and it always seemed like the people let go were the ones who worked hard and were assets to the company.
bad,"input fees in a timely manner, learned fee assessment, hardest part was the rush training, had great managers, enjoyable part was the new experience"
bad,"Had to deal with a lot of turnover. I honestly cannot tell you how many bankers I worked with, over 30 easily, and about 8 different Branch Managers at 4 different branches. There was always change, in personnel, in product focus, how they tracked sales, in sales goals."
bad,I really liked the people I worked with and my day was enjoyable with the people I worked with..Some of managers there aren't the best managers to work with due to you feel like you can't trust anyone to talk to if you're having problems
bad,work life is ruff and hard to get days off. I cant stand working there. the only reason i stayed is cause of my manager. Customers are rude and most managers can care less about how you feel
bad,"Some of the best CO-Workers I've ever worked with, always there to help you even when we were at our busiest. Plenty of friendly faces to assist you in your time of need."
bad,"Merrill Lynch is a great place to work for a recent college graduate trying to get licensed in the securities field.  It is not necessary to know anything about the investment field to work there, and in my case, a detriment if you have knowledge and can think for yourself.  All customer inquiries are handled with an exact script, and knowledge and remembering the script is the number one requirement at Merrill.  Those individuals who brought millions of new dollars to the firm were in no way acknowledged or compensated, but those who signed people up to trade online were the champions.  Customer service scores were also not taken into consideration when reviewing performance-ONLY the memorization of an exact script which in many cases did not fit the customers request, was. I would not recommend Merrill Lynch for any experienced Financial Advisor, but a great place to get the help you need to get licensed and then RUN, before they can terminate you for actually answering clients questions."
bad,"The financial center I worked at was open Saturdays. There were no days off other than the day that the bank was closed, yet, no overtime was allowed. The bank was very busy and everyone was exhausted and didn't receive hardly any time off. This was impossible to maintain any work life balance, especially if you are a parent. The market manager was uncaring and very harsh. No coverage was offered if someone was out, even for weeks at a time and if you had to work over, it was expected, no one asked if you could. It was a great place to work when I started, but by the time I left I was completely miserable."
bad,"Endless depending on the state in which you reside.  They had excellent employee benefits.  However, I found it very difficult to advance in the company which left me feeling stagnant.  I did not realize how much I enjoyed customer service until the opportunities that presented themselves while working for BOA.  During that time in which I long to pursue my dreams of caring for others by way of becoming a nurse...."
bad,"As an employee at bank of America, you are only as good as your last sale. There is a lot of redlining that happens at bank of America. If you aren't bringing in big money, your business is not appreciated."
bad,lots of customer service and sales on a daily basis. you take training throughout the year as well. it's a tough job but you learn to deal with people and learn to communicate with different types of people
bad,This workplace has its fair share of positives and negatives and provided an incredible learning environment but lacked a lot of work life balance
bad,"As long as you make this job your number 1 priority, (not your children) you will have a lasting career with them. Management is ok, they aren't there to support you however, they are not familiar with policies and procedures. Some managers refuse to take escalated calls, it becomes a stressful work environment. Even when you are following regulations you can still get a final written because you ""don't provide preferred client treatment"""
bad,My typical day is working from bell to bell and then some. Teaching associates to become better contributors to the company's mission and commitment.
bad,The workplace was a nice one the culture could use improvement. Management was always working on putting out fires. The work colleagues were always helpful.
bad,It was a secure job for almost 2 years. I went right out of college after a few months. It turned into a call center in march of 2014 once the market went down in loans for our company.
bad,"Bank of America is your typical LARGE company that is shifting its business model to accommodate loss in revenue."
bad,"Typical day at work isn't too long, but the company creates a stressful environment. Puts a lot of pressure on it's employees to push products to customer who don't need them. Every customer that seats at your desk, you must sell them something or you won't make your quota."
bad,"no coaching, are told one thing on day and the next you get yelled at for doing that. moneys good though but the company only cares about making money not about its customers"
bad,"It's hard to see where U.S. Trust fits into Bank of America's long term thinking.  They already have an organization, in Merrill Lynch, that does the exact same thing that U.S. Trust does and is growing at a rate far greater than U.S. Trust.  Working inside of an organization as large as Bank of America can also be extremely difficult due to the excessive layers of management and bureaucracy.  On a positive note, you have pretty good job stability and the hours aren't too brutal.  However, this is evident in the compensation and benefits package that they offer to employees which is underwhelming to say the least."
bad,"As a top ranked associate (#1 in the Nation for Credit Card Agents in the call center) management loved me. I was a top performer and excelled in all areas. Management will find one metric of your stats and begin diving into the call record to find reasons to let go of associates. I was fired in between Christmas and New Years. There were a total of 10 calls that were disconnected with in the 1st 10 seconds of the call (over a span of 6 months) and rather than a coaching opportunity, they let me supervise the floor (because they needed me for that) and then walked me out of the building 3 hours later. Horrible reasoning, would rather fire than coach. If I had been spoken too just ONCE, the incident would have never happened again and the company would still have retained a top performer. TURNOVER IS RIDICULOUSLY HIGH IN ALL DEPARTMENTS. Bank of America would rather pursue tax breaks than developing their employees. Very sad to tell the truth. Direct Supervisors were phenomenal, any management over direct supervisor is completely disconnected and doesn't care about the team morale and development"
bad,"I made the mistake of working at an extremely high volume branch as a teller. On my list of worst jobs ever. Customers were mostly terrible, with the ""Dont you know who I am"" mentality. Almost impossible to get through a day without waiting for a supervisors approval for something. We were expected to present banking product referrals with no training on what they were. We were not given breaks except for lunch (even full time tellers like myself). The pay was low and there were no raises. "
bad,"A typical day at work consists of sitting in a cubicle processing, analyzing, and updating both commercial and residential insurance documents according to the banks standards and guidelines. It is a quality and production based position. I have more understanding on how mortgage loans are handled, sustained, and how the company attempts to limit any risk on their assets. "
bad,Company does not care about employees and they're loyalty.
bad,Managed a team of 11 people to meet production goals set for the team on a monthly bases.
bad,some of the protocols were wrong for the mortgage industry and you felt you had no control over how to help anyone.
bad,"Co workers are the best part of the job. "
bad,"Overall the work loads are managalbe and there is always something new to learn for systems and processes. Which is a good thing that the company is always attempting to find ways to assist in improving their associates.  The benefits are good and the hours (depending on your personal management) are somewhat flexible."
bad,"I oversaw a loan portfolio of $18 million which consisted on Consumer, Residential and Commercial loans."
bad,"Legacy Asset Servicing (LAS) is a division of the bank designed to clear out the mess caused by the financial downturn.  While LAS associates are expected to champion the bank's cause, the bank does not provide LAS associates a vision for the future (because their isn't one) and LAS leadership has no idea how to move forward.  "
bad,"I never felt so limited, i was told when i could go to the bathroom, take a break, say on the phone, it was like a become a robot so demoralizing."
bad,Very little management and interest in career development from senior people.
bad,underpaid and poor management. not conducive to a healthy work environment
bad,get to work and conduct teller transactions in a timely manner.
bad,"Be ready to play office politics. Also be ready to be overworked and underpaid. Mundane and redundant, takes no real intelligence to master."
bad,Took deposits and cashed customers checks and whatever else they needed help with.  I learned that I do not want to ever work in a bank.  I enjoyed the people but not to be in charge of their accounts.  I had to balance my cash drawer every day which I balanced every day.
bad,Very good benefits.  Did not care for the micro managing.  I enjoyed the work I did for this Company.  I was a very loyal employee and dedicated to the Company.  I was able to obtain several certifications due to my hard work and dedication to excellence.  My co-workers were very personable and caring but I cannot say the same for my direct manager.
bad,"I like that the company was in Plano, However, I did not like how the company changes something everyday and only gave us a paper power point to read."
bad,"A typical day at my job involves updating the inside sales team on individual clients via email checklists with remaining items needed to fund dental, medical and vet practice acquisition loans. We are required to call the doctor, their attorney, insurance agents, brokers and anyone we have to call in order to help the doctor gather the remaining items needed to fund the loan. I review purchase and sale agreements, office leases, insurance policies, order site inspections,order lien searches, clear lien searches, create escrow agreements, review liquidity and income requirements and many other loan conditions such as conditions verifying judgements and IRS taxes have been paid in full. I enjoy my coworkers but the hardest part of my job is keeping up with the heavy demand of every client who wants to fund their acquisition loan in sometimes less than a week. When you have multiple clients wanting that same thing it makes it difficult to please them all given the amount of documents you have to review before submitting them to clear loan conditions."
bad,"A terrific bank to work for, management very not up to where it needs to be."
bad,You must be friends with management in order to be promoted here.  Perks of the job include benefits.  It's hard to replace these.
bad,"lot of stress at work, management is really bad and it could be my personal experience. people working around are good and i guess they have the similar complaint."
bad,There was a lot of pressure from managers and from clients. There was a lot of tasks to be performed for just one person.
bad,Collecting documents for customers trying to avoid foreclosure on home
bad,I have learned a great deal within the bank. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers.
bad,"Co workers but management is ruthless.  It is sales job, all they care about is numbers."
bad,"Better walk in the door with millions in money committed to your management. Unless you are a relative of someone there you will have no other chance to remotely meet ""goal"" for money under management. "
bad,Worked with the upper management but they had no backbone to support you in any ways. You got to deal with uneducated co-workers with jealousy.
bad,It was fun to work there. But if they did not want you there they would throw you under the bus. the first chance they get.
bad,overall work culture represents diversity and respecting individual differences . great for people aspiring for technology Jobs.
bad,An employee can never really do enough. The goals are always changed so they are just out of reach. Lack of opportunity for advancement.
bad,"I check paperwork from Neogiators at Bank of America who have gathered the paperwork for a short sale. I have to check the contract for accurancy, all of the numerous forms that calcuate our profit and loss for the sale. I must ensure when the contract docments are delivered to the atttorney they are correct and the short sale can move forward. The pace is very fast."
bad,This place as far as management your move up on the ladder is based on who you know not about how well you do your job. It does have great benefits and great pay. But management and environment feels like your back in high school.
bad,The management wasn't bad but not great. Typical day at work involved looking at clock every 10 min to see when I was going to leave.
bad,Excellent benefits and pay package. Company's focus is no longer on service which is unfortunate.
bad,"calling customers to collect on home loans & credit cards... i learned all about the credit card industry as well as learning how to handle non government loans (knowing the difference between a government loan & a conventional loan). Great people to come and work with.. very polite & friendly. The hardest part of the day is telling a customer there are no options to help with an issue. The most enjoyable part of the day, is knowing i help someone with any problem they encountered."
bad,General Office and Administrative worker.
bad,managing disputes and plan each day to maintain compliance
bad,I learned a lot about mortgages and the industry. Typical day was dealing with foreclosed accounts and irate customers. Hardest part of the job was telling customer that there is nothing more for them to do but to move out. Most enjoyable part is when I was able to get a customer out of foreclosure. Management was not sufficient in getting information to us in a timely and accurate manner. There was a constant flux of information at all times.
bad,This was not a good experience for me and I would rather not share.
bad,"Department went through multiple process changes in the course of a year. Procedures are made by peers. No structure aside from the core values which aren't really implemented unless Senior Management is visiting. Lots of favoritism. Certain individuals lost jobs after being with the company over 20 years, while others were able to keep jobs after 4 or 5 years."
bad,Supervise teller work
bad,"Unstable work environment, most people are confused and do not understand the processes. Management is extremely uninformed therefore you have to learn on your own as you go. Most of the management have been forced into the roles due to the high turnover even when they were not qualified to take on the role to begin with."
bad,"I worked there for 5 years and only got a raise three of those years, on my fifth year, I realized that all the three raises didn't even add up to $1. I started working there in 2006 for $12.07, and quit on 2011 getting $12.87. Five years wasted, other people I know that got other jobs around the same time as me, are getting at least $16 by now. People at BofA are nice and friendly, but you have to really have to kiss some behinds if you want to get the supervisor jobs."
bad,Have 2 weeks of computer training before starting in the lanes. then 1 week of on the hand training. Good associates that help each other balance.
bad,"Benefits good, but opportunity for advancement poor. Managers did not always take in to consideration your abilities as much as a well they liked you."
bad,"Management does not care for employees, they only care to hit the sales numbers. They mask it with customer is priority, but all they care of is REVENUE!"
bad,Must be passionate about banking if you want to be successful. The company focuses on monitoring growth with consumer accounts and deposits. Hours are short but 6 days a week seems like you never have time off.
bad,"I did not enjoy working for the bank of America, it was very mundane work, and too much of a relaxed environment"
bad,The change in company culture and employee treatment made it difficult to stay with the company. BofA sold the Corresponding Lending Division to a third part and this vendor treated their employees really bad. Long OT hours and no fair compensation.
bad,Management in my departments gets a total fail.  They don't pass the EXACT same information to everyone.  They show little to no interest in helping people try to advance.  Management needs sensitivity training because some very inappropriate things are said all the time.  The medical benefits are really good.
bad,"Branches are horribly understaffed everywhere and employees are expected to pick up the slack without help from market management. In effect, employees are overworked and mostly unhappy. Sales goals set are also extremely high and unrealistic."
bad,Good company and nice management. Not enough staff and have only 30 min lunches. Work 6 days a week. But very nice environment and able to relocate easily.
bad,There is no fun at bank of america. we used to be able to balance with work but that is in the past. we also use job security but that also is in the past. all managers think about is production/sales and do not care about their employees. It is now a nightmare working there. I do not recommend anyone getting a job there cause all you will be is miserable. its really hard to walk into that place everyday
bad,"The company is alright to work for.  There is plenty of lateral movement between teams, but it's hard to move up in the company.  It's very competitive for director positions.  Not many upper management turnover, so very few director+ vacancies, which makes it difficult to get promotions anywhere."
bad,"All about the sales and the money! No training at all. And you better not fail an audit, even if you have never been trained or your branch has not been audited for years. It will be your fault, no matter what."
bad,Bank of America was not an enjoyable place to work. Management in the department had individuals they catered to and others they would publicly embarrass. The co-workers were amazing.
bad,The company has a lot of job postings but every time I tried to advance was unable to get anywhere. Received no assistance from my manager in career growth. Pay was average but the jobs were always being eliminated in favor of outsourcing to cheaper wages elsewhere.
bad,"My personal experience working here was not good. My center had poor leadership and a severe lack of teamwork. Other centers I was able to provide coverage for demonstrated better leadership but unfortunately I was not able to transfer out of the poorly ran center. Depending on the leadership of the center, one can definitely find a career here but I was not able to. Didn't even know I lost the job until a recently terminated employee called me which made me call another center."
bad,I worked in the call center for their credit card department. I worked the late shift. It was a good company but the position was very repetitive and demanding.
bad,"Working in a branch can be great if you're in a good team. The people I've worked with were friendly and helped foster growth. However, due to the nature of the job and what you're dealing with, a thick skin is recommended. You're also expected to be a salesman as your branch tries to meet monthly quotas."
bad,do as your told...you will get promoted. stick to the plan and do not divert from the plan. stay positive and get involved in promoting others. you will learn a lot.
bad,"The pay was great "
bad,"Bank of America is a descent place to work. Expect workload to be high and very challenging. Can get very very stressful depending on position. Training was loose, a lot of it was learned in performing the job more than the essentials training they provided. Company is some what stingy at least I can say in our Ekman building in Tampa. They do not provide much in way of balancing life while at work. There are little to none comforts provided.  Where other companies provide time for teams to talk and build upon each others successes. There were no company supported off site events planned. There was no recognition banquets. The company is all about business, and not spending pennies literally or giving them back to customers either. You can definitely look back and say you did a lot of work. How you feel about that work and decisions you have to make because of company policies may influence your feelings about how the company operates. It is a massive company however and I can only speak about my experience in 3 departments within our building. The company needs a facelift and substantial remodeling. Equipment was scarce and also old and out dated. The building had water leak problems from rain and carpeting still from likely when it was built. Not what you would expect from Bank of America.  How they treat their employees is how their employees treat each other and also customers."
bad,Manager pawned questions off on top staff which put them behind but were still adhered to meet same goals. Manager wouldnt allow one to post out or move up. There were always obstacles like hire freezes or only hiring from outside.
bad,"I worked with BofA in 2 different environments. Working in a bank was wonderful and fulfilling. I enjoyed the duties, training and role immensely. "
bad,This place was a loco from Day 1! A bunch of people needing to feel self important and tell others what to do but not knowing how to implement changes
bad,My major issue with them was that I was promised a position accepted the new position received congratulations letters from my new manger and old manager and then two days later was told the position was not available. nothing I did or didn't do the position was not funded.
bad,"call center, tied to a tiny desk, paid training and Health insurance the first of work."
bad,Always busy even your lunch time you have to half on to the computer to help your co worker because it’s alam so busy every day. Always short handed customers in and out and 2tellers at the drive thru big transaction every day.
bad,"Merrill Lynch has a long way to go to get back on their feet after the Bank of America buyout.  Many of the programs are run through a banking lens, often skewing the results to favor a banking mindset.  New hires are limited in their ability to learn due to a strenuous amount of mandatory coaching calls that do little to actually promote growth."
bad,I will start by saying the pay and benefits are simply the best! The actual job is very stressful and disorganized! Unrealistic expectations and terrible training. Everyone walks around like zombies from being overworked and there is little appreciation from the management team.
bad,Company not good as per growth perspective. Management is not good at all. They will keep changing your processes as per their on willingness. You won;t be asked about that change and you have to go for it even if not willing to.
bad,"Predictable banking environment with layers of approvals, meetings, false starts which result in work, over-work, cancelled work and opportunities at times too. If you have not been in banking, this will not make much sense to you."
bad,"Due to recent struggles related to a large system conversion, the bank lost a ton of talent at all levels. There was constant turnover in management, resulting in the bank having to hire external candidate with little to no experience in the syndicated loan market. The majority of senior management were inexperienced, uninformed and generally incapable of making basic decisions. While the benefits are good, the overall work experience is not. You will be asked to work longer and harder to make up for the constant mistakes made by management. For this, you will contribute to their bonuses while earning little to no bonus yourself."
bad,Don't feel like providing review for Bank of America.  Don't think it's rightful to ask people to write their opinion if they absolutely don't want to do it.
bad,Not happy with Management. There is way too much change in short amounts of time. Clients rely on knowing staff and feeling comfortable with leaving their funds. However Bank of America is looking unstable.
bad,"Bank of America is defiantly not for the faint of heart. I have worked holiday and weekends, sold products over the phone, dealt with back office case management.  Its always the same story. Goals that are  hard to achieve and sometimes unrealistic.  The joke is the Bank of America way is to make something easy harder and more complicated.   No loyalty. For those who can handle it, the pay is good, and the benefits are top notch. Its best to swap departments every couple of years and  network often."
bad,They were so busy making up new processes every other weekand keeping you busy on the busywork that you can get actual work done. It was just that they didn’t give you time to implement the processes before they were changing the process and you had to start all over again .
bad,No job security. They can kick you out anytime they want. So much politics and favoritism. they don't even move you to another process but you can try if you have that caliber but difficult to take movements as everything is already fixed here. No learning at all in my process. Over hired people and then asked you to leave company.
bad,I worked there as a temp and the assignment ended because they said I was absent more days than I actually took off.  My recruiter researched the information and found that the information BOA was providing was incorrect.  Although they were wrong I was not able to get my job back.
bad,"Unfortunately the upper management leaves a lot to be desired."
bad,"but they didn't  give people a change to learn it, she hired they already knew if people had experience and said it wouldn't be a problem but once training was over ( 3 months ) they let you go due to them feeling like you could be a risk to the bank. although you haven't did anything for them to feel that way."
bad,"While Bank of America paid alright for the area I was in, it was a very very stressful job.  I was a contact center employee during the banking crisis starting in 2007.  Let's put it this way, people don't call into their bank unless they have a problem with their money and who is happy when they have a problem with money? 9 out of 10 callers were verbally abusive in some way."
bad,This entity no longer exists where I was located.  It was a great place to work when I was in grad school.  Hours worked around my school schedule.  Pay was decent for the time.
bad,This company would stab you in the back whenever they could.  They would smile in your face and cut your throat from behind.I loved the clients I worked with but it was always for the sake of someone else wanting the book of business you built.
bad,"The culture at Bank of America has declined significantly.  The cost cutting measures have meant significant layoffs and an exodus of knowledge.  There is very little training, and very difficult to find information."
bad,The difference between management and style was extreme. placement of some managers into jobs they have no experience in due to nepotistic approach. poor compensation.
bad,"This company has moved me more then once due to understaffing and lack of ability to retain employees.  Branches are severely understaffed and over worked making it more difficult then needed to care for the customers and met mandated referral goals.  I was lucky to work with some wonderful individuals, but not all managers and co-workers are like that, which I've also experienced.  Stress level is high due to lack of help and demand for results.  Benefits are average, pay is low."
bad,It was very easy to get lost in the shuffle of so many employees.  Often job objectives did not trickle down so time might be spent working on the wrong task/objective.  The constant looming threat of being laid off was distracting.
bad,Working at a Bank is not for everyone. If you are sales driven then it may be the job for you. It gets very stressful as management only sees numbers and not the customer.
bad,"Company wants you sell mortgage loans, but does not provide good training and guidance to do so..Always wanting more sales but not good about giving resources to help with the sales goals."
bad,Started out with great pay and benefits and then everything was cut. Also the management doesn't back you or stay true to their word. Very disappointing place to work
bad,"Bank of America was a interesting place to work for. There were multiple branch locations that you could work from. Each location had its own twist on the bank's overall culture. No matter what branch you worked out of, you still had to meet company goals. The training program was highly intense and it was monitored carefully. The most enjoyable part to the job was the opportunity to work with the customers whom we served. Although the management was not very supportive, the relationships that are formed between you and your coworkers can be very beneficial."
bad,It's a numbers game and a very difficult venture. Some people crush it and some get crushed by it. I am not a fan of all the politics and the red tape and regulations. It is a great place to make a lot of money long term but it is a stressful career path and I;m not a big fan of a suit and tie everyday.
bad,Constant layoffs which we called walkout Wednesdays. Stressful environment due to management not knowing how to communicate. There was a lack of balance between management and employees not knowing how not to cross certain boundaries
bad,"Bank of America was a great place to work for yes, but the management and leaders weren't the best to be running the teams. "
bad,"It was stressful but i believe it was just my experience and management at my branch. Manager would leave our box with less than 2 500 and would not let us buy more money . Had to process withdrawals of 1000+ dollars and pay then out in $20 bills sometimes even smaller bill. Not the type of environment for me, but thankful for the opportunity"
bad,Worked there for 5 years. Benefits are great but that is the only part of the job that was. You are merely a number. Layoffs happen every month. You go to work every pay period and wait for the email to go into the conference room
bad,"The pay was good. As good as or better than others in the area. However, there were lots of lay-offs across the counrty.  They did not keep you on the same team for long inside the call center for long."
bad,The experience to cold call and turn a prospect to a client is something that I really got exposed to in this part time job. The management was not the best but I got amazing experience from it.
bad,"This bank does not focus on relationships at all but rather focuses on pure sales.  Many of the managers come from large retail companies and have no banking expierience, everything is just a product to them.  Sell as much as you can as fast as you can and move on to the next customer."
bad,Great compensation and benefits which almost off set the terrible management and low job culture. Duties will become boring and management is not good at helping to motivate their employees.
bad,I answered calls on a dialer system.  I was required to collect due dollars per contact.  It was challenging but doable.  The environment was challenging most days but also pressurized on other days.
bad,"The only redeeming benefit of working here is the benefits offered.  They pay for some daycare reimbursement and one hundred percent of your college up to a certain dollar amount each year.  Outside of that there is no possibility of moving around.  Jobs posted internally are either far below what you do skill and pay wise, or are only posted to follow company policy and the candidate has already been chosen."
bad,The company has a lot to learn about real customer service. They cut corners and the customers are the ones that suffer.  A lot of your work is based on what the customers think of you and not the actual job you do. So basically your performance is subjective based on what the customers think of you.
bad,"During my time with BOA the company seemed very unorganized. Their were constant changes to procedures, with very little information on the changes occurring. The turn over rate was extremely high and morale very low due to inconsistency in company procedures and constant workload due to the horrific staffing. Wait times even up to an hour and half were a daily occurrence when customers would call in."
bad,"The culture on the mortgage side of the house did not encourage advancement or employee satisfaction. Everyday coming to work felt like it would be your last because of the constant layoffs. Managers just to tell you its the new culture. You are continuously moved to other areas in the organization that you have little to no experience in. I had 5 managers in one year. How does that support my growth and effective performance management.  I was laid off under a manager I worked for less than 6 months and was an employee who has never been rated less than an exceeds which is the highest performance rating you can receive. No bias there I guess. The employees greet each other by saying, ""Wow, your still here"" instead of ""Hi, how are you doing"". That should sum it up for you. The leadership there needs to change if the employee satisfaction & culture is going to get any better."
bad,A typical day would be me answering back to back phone calls. My manager is fantastic and will do anything to make me better. The most enjoyable part about the job is that I get to help customers resolve their issues.
bad,"I have thoroughly enjoyed working here. I have three friends here that I work with whom I have known since the second grade and to have that is rare. I have met a lot of interesting people along the way and that has taught me how people should be treated. I have also learned that I am just a number to the higher ups. Bank of America needs to change their culture before anything else will happen. It's unfortunate, but it may be the stepping stones to what they need to get where they need to be."
bad,"A typical work day included balancing cash registers, managing and replenishing cash in the automated teller machine (ATM), cashing customer checks and assisting customers with banking service needs."
bad,"I witnessed a lot of discrimination at this company.I worked at the Simi Valley, CA location. One of the worst jobs I ever had.  Not because of the work , but the work environment was not welcoming."
bad,"Look forward to building and maintaining relationships with both the customers and associates."
bad,would be a great career but unfortunately management is a joke and they hire externally too much over employees. Great sick and vacation pay. every client service representative (teller) gets paid the same regardless of how long you've been with the company.
bad,it gets your bills paid. the best part of working there is the customers you meet and create bonds with! very long lines and \very few tellers so theyre often overworked and under appreciated
bad,If you are looking for a job with excellent benefits this a good job. Other than that the scheduling system at the branch I worked at was unfair. Sunday was the only full off day.
bad,No  comment I would rather not talk about my previous employer.  It wasn't A bad place to work however it was time for me to MoveOn. And continue a new chapter in my career
bad,This was a very stressful environment however I will say the supervisor I did have was very helpful in trying to make the job less stressfulland I appreciated that .
bad,"Very much sales oriented. They say that they are balanced, but they really just are concerned with sales. They don't always support their employees. Very short staffed. Employees do the work of multiple people often without monetary compensation."
bad,Career growth potential varies drastically by division and region of the firm.  The current culture in the NYC market of the private bank is sour and talented associates are leaving at a rapid pace.
bad,Been with the company for six years ; no much to say about the company. I am trying to move to another company that will appreciate me .  Its an okay company to start with .
bad,It's a great place to work I think that many people would like to work here however the management can work on their attitudes. You have to work hard and practically strive for your numbers
bad,"BOA call center is tedius and can be overwhelming a lot of the time. Customers are mad, managers are always in meetings, quality is changing the metrics almost weekly....its a lot of pressure."
bad,"Great benefits. Worked with different people, can be stressfully depending on which department you work in. Paid vacatio n was great, holidays too."
bad,"Bank of America is a huge company, but communication between the different channels is a huge challenge for this company.  Training program is lacking."
bad,"NO TRAINNING???? I was sent to the floor with no exp, had been transferred and relocated numerous times in one year, the relation bankers positions was ok at first but during the move arounds i was taking serious so i was basically just a door greater"
bad,Being invisible! It's best for certain people to not have a voice.  Just keep your head down and put up with the politics if you want to keep your job.
bad,"Stressful work environment, always pushed to meet resolutions, and lacked management support and guidance.  Lacked support from management to advance from department.  Even with system training the guidelines/expectations were out of reach for most of the employees.  Management was not always respectful and at times I was bullied.   I did enjoy working with borrowers and providing resolutions to their escalated mortgage concerns."
bad,I loved the job. The clients were calling to know how to manage their business within a bank of america site. I learned a lot about treasury and about check management and wires and ACHs.
bad,"This is the place for you if you have goals, meet deadlines and are ready to achieve success. If all depends on the manager though. Regardless of your work and history there it is very political when it comes to raises, transfers, promotions or anything."
bad,Work life and schedule are nice. Working can be draining and repetitive. Can be easily a dead end career with uncontrollable incentive structure. Sales are pushed.
bad,Room to navigate but not a very employee friendly environment.  Pensions were stripped at short notice and schedules are often changed without regard for obligations.
bad,"Typical ""what's my balance"", ""why is my rate so high"", ""can you forgive my late fee"" call center questions. Extremely fasted paced and long hours but the pay is great!"
bad,Too corporate for my liking. There really is no life balance in the manager role in the financial center. Expect to be doing customer service work day in and out even as a leader. A lot of tedious work with a very heavy hand coming down on you everyday. I did like the networks and benefits were good!
bad,"The typical work day is pretty much having to talk a majority of customers into something they don't want/need, but having to because of the high sales goals. I learned a lot about the financial world for myself. Management has been the worst I have ever had. The FCM's are a particular lazy group, and not particularly good at managing multiple employees, and usually not willing to help out their customers like they are supposed to. It's also strange because of how many 'bosses' you have in such a close area. The co-workers have always been great, but also experience the same stress as you. The hardest part of the job is having to read a script to the customer, even if you know thats not an item they are interested in or would benefit them. Also, the sales goals are usually pretty ridiculous for that same reason. Your 'bonus' is based on those individual goals, but also the banking center goals (if  your coworkers don't make goal when you do, your bonus is still going to get affected.) You can hit 100 percent of your overall goal, but still get disciplined based on underperformance in the subcategories. The most enjoyable part is the bank holidays and hours, mixed in with the benefits. The only problem with vacation is if someone in the same center(smaller ones) has that vacation slot as well, you both cant have that same time, even if your jobs never intervene with each other."
bad,"Call Center environment. no time between calls to ""cool down"" after an upsetting call, Back to Back calls increase stress levels"
bad,This may not apply to all of Bank of America but in the department I worked for the Work although quite simple was complicated by politics and some poor management. There were rules that seemed only apply to certain individuals and there was unfair treatment. The best thing about it are the employees. All were well trained and very hard workers. The hardest part was quality call inspections and trying to make sure to read verbatim all the disclosures with out missing a word.
bad,Hours are long but good teammates to work with. Excel is very imperative to your day to day job. You learn a lot within your group.
bad,8 to 10 hour work day. Learned how to operate VICOR Image Lockbox proprietary package. competent management team. good working core. inconsistencies in amount of work. interaction with co-workers.
bad,"Everyone is out for themselves. No collaboration, no teamwork and not open to communication. Known to put people with no experience in charge of entire business units and processes. This causes many many problems."
bad,"A typical day at work? being shorted on breaks and lunches, being yelled at all the time by people who have been there for over 20 years (because of that fact, they are grandfathered they don't have any idea what they are doing besides waiting on their retirement!!!"" This was just my experience."
bad,"Pushed through a training scheme when you first join that almost feels like a brainwashing. Management are interested purely in your performance and not in you or your development aspirations."
bad,Management changes constantly and performance is all about the numbers. A typical day is very stressful due to a system which changes and crashes often. I enjoyed my colleagues but they became frustrated an are also no longer working there.
bad,Working for this company in the call center is an emotional drag. Surveys and scoring are unfair and job does not make you feel secure at all. You could be there one day and out the next. the benefits and pay are pretty good but you really wave to kiss butt to upper management and work your butt OFF like no other.Management needs better training and if you like CONSTANT change this is the place for you. They like to pile workload on you and then get you in trouble if you don't compete it the right way with no proper training. On the other hand co-worker are great and that makes me look forward to work they are like family.
bad,a typical day at work consist of reconciling customer accounts and balancing General ledger accounts. The best part of the job is building relationships with people across the company.
bad,"I'll preface this with the main issue I had at the bank was my immediate bank manager. I've never come across someone as crass, vulgar, uncaring, and mean-spirited . He curses people out in front of others, ridicules and makes fun of people, does nothing to assist, only to criticize, on and on."
bad,Great team locally but no local management support for my team and lack of positivity from management caused issues. Expected to work long hours.
bad,I liked working at BOA and enjoy everyday going to work. working with co-worker side by side and learning new things everyday.
bad,"I was with Bank of America for many years and had quite a few titles along the way. Bank of America wasn't bad. The pay isn't the best, but the benefits were great. When my child was born I was given 3 months paid paternity leave, which is unheard of in most US companies. The environment wasn't bad, if you could get past the random layoffs. I left the company before the last layoff, and went to Bank of America Merchant Services, which is NOT Bank of America, and was talked into taking a job that I believed was simply a transfer. it was not. Merchant Services, was a different company altogether. My last position there was thankless, difficult and stress inducing, with very high expectations for what you get paid, which makes it difficult to do or enjoy your job. Also, there can be room for advancement, but it's very difficult to achieve even minor success."
bad,"Always felt like we could ALWAYS do better.  If we were at the top of our game in the district in sales and customer service, no matter what we were always doing something wrong.  Tellers didn't get incentive when I worked there. I felt it was very difficult to move up and there was no work life balance.  You went to work stressed and you came home stressed. You slept and you dreamed about how bad the next day was going to be and who was going to yell at you that day."
bad,taking call after call for a variety of banking needs.  multiple metrics to meet on a daily basis.  all about the numbers. no opportunity for movement in this location.
bad,"They don't call it ""sales"" but that is a huge part of your job. I recommend a credit union. This bank is too corporate. So keep in mind how much customer service means to you!"
bad,A typical day consisted of the daily sales goals and what the banking center needed for that day to hit targets. Role playing with bankers for product knowledge. The hardest part of my job was convincing other higher ups that tellers were just as important as anyone else on the team. The best part of my job was working with my amazing colleagues! Most of them have become long time friends.
bad,"Too many Lay offs, great benefits, great bonus. Turning into   a ""VERY HECTIC""!!! call center environment. No one knows what they are doing. Worse call center environment in the history of call center's. Everyone is leaving the company,because they are overworked, stressed out and Management acts cold as stone if anyone complains. It use to be a great company to work for, I do not want to leave. But, I cannot work under such stressful conditions and unempathic Mangement. Worked there for 5-Years and believe in hard work. But, it has gotten way out of control."
bad,"Had to handle business for 25 realtors, some were difficult. Too much stress. Previous receptionist did too much for each realtor, I stayed within the guidelines given for the job, many realtors complained, one even said in my presence when was previous receptionist coming back. Many took advantage of me."
bad,Great teamwork and fun place to work at times. Provide assistance to employees and training is great as it relates to the work.
bad,"Loved working for the Bank and having a great work life balance. Worked from home for many years and built my life around it, they have decided to end the program forcing me to explore other options."
bad,"Repetitive work"
bad,Consistent change in management and pay structure. Different views on rules and regulations through different layers of management
bad,"A typical day at work, was to examine all accounts in accordance with OCC laws, to ensure the best solution for every Borrower. All test had to be performed in a timely manner."
bad,It's a good place for beginners. The culture is diversifed and good. Colleagues are friendly and nice. The compensation is low and the management is not that great.
bad,"Poor management, poor training for employees, numbers matter more customer service.  Co-wokers can be helpful, hardest part of the job was the monotony."
bad,"The health insurance and benefits, including discounts with other companies and 2 weeks of vacation a year, are amazing, even for part-time employees. And the bankers hours are nice. But they make up for it by over-micromanaging, beating you over the head to get sales, short lunches, except on Saturday, where you can still work a full day but you don't get a lunch break at all, and heaven forbid you have to take a sick day or can't make it to work because of bad weather...unless you're one of the lucky few to get a good manager. No compensation for tellers to get sales, just threats of what will happen if you don't get enough. Bottom line, if you're not ""in"" with your manager, don't expect to be treated like a human being, and definitely don't expect to ever have a Saturday off."
bad,Bank of America is very strong structured. They offer excellent training and hire the best management. Management at Bank of America are very knowledgeable however they do very poorly with compensating their employees and making them love their job.
bad,"Process ecalation calls with in regards to homeowners escrow, taxes, insurance, liens, payments and etc...I have learned quite a lot though about the mortgagte and real estate field since being here considering the fact that it is my first job in this field. The management is knowledgeable but lazy and are never around for assistance when you do need them for questions, also too much micro managemet; makes you feel uncomfortable working. While working with the peers around you very beneficial because they actually help you more than the management and are always there for your assistance. The toughest part about the job though is when having to deal with irate customers over the phone call you all sorts of names, which then it balances itself out with the best part of the job; which is have awesome pleasant conversations with customers who enjoy your assistance."
bad,I worked at Bank of America for four years as a post investor claims representative: first as a contractor then converting to a permanent employee for the remaining two years. The working culture was pleasant. the department eventually downsized which lead to many employees being let go.
bad,"Too many processes, too many levels of approvals.  Health benefits are expensive and have high deductibles before anything is paid.  Co-Workers seem to care about quality of work but also have frustrations.  Continual re-org's"
bad,"i have no comment at this  time. in 2007 it was fun, exciting to work there, i was recognized for my hard work. 2014 management change and everything was taken away that made it very difficult, stressful to work there."
bad,"Banks are all changing, they're all going back to their old ways, where sales and hitting goals was a priority. Bank of America has great benefits but the training from the very start is appalling. You are behind a computer for 7 hours straight taking useless training courses that you don't even use at the end of it all. Management are not going in the right direction! Greed, Deception and Numbers is all coming back, not as open like back in the days but it certainly has become a come back!"
bad,"Horrible experience in mortgages."
bad,Management was very unprofessional little chance for advancement.
bad,"BOA offers stability .  However, management behaviors dont merit associate stablility."
bad,"I would like to use my professional, as well as interpersonal, skills for the benefit of the organization. I have completed my post-graduate degree in business administration with specialization in human resource management"
bad,Good for HS grad or college student. Very repetitive work and alot of policies and procedures. Not much opportunity for advancement in the SW market.
bad,Managed and Handled High profile delinquent accounts. Dealt with customer  relations on a day to day basis. The environment was very fast paced and you must always be at your best because you work with a team of people.
bad,"The most challenging aspect was no matter what bank you go to they always seem short handed.  Their system is set to run on a skeleton crew to begin with.  Every branch I worked at was operating without a full crew, often times missing the Branch Manager or an Assistant Manager.  Management at the branch level was the worst, those folks are more concerned with looking out for themselves than doing what's right for the customer or their fellow employees.  The interoffice politics was the worst.  It is mostly run by women and I'm sorry but women love to gossip and talk and often undermine management or anyone they didn't care for.  They have a adopted this new sales technique from a company called ""Green Consulting"", apparently all the banks have signed contracts with this company, to train their sales crew how to sale without sounding like you are selling.  The company had developed such a bad name as having an overly aggressive sales force, that they had to come out with this new approach.  The new approach made a tough job even tougher, now you had to sell your brains out, but not sound like it.  Not the easiest concept to grasp, and nine times out of ten, most bankers would ditch the new method of not getting the results and just go back to what works, good ole fashioned sales talk.  The upper level managers where excellent, but the branch level and below where terrible.  Most had huge egos and were anxious to show management what a hard, ruthless tyrant they could be.  If you were one minute late you would get written up, unless you were managment.  The pay was not that great"
bad,People are great but the management is horrible.  They are not trained but quick to try to write you up without giving feedback.
bad,big company with lost of unhappy customer .management is not always helpful.
bad,"Every day, you wonder if this will be the day.  You see others getting walked out regularly. It's not uncommon to see people carried out on stretchers, from high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. It seems that management works more on finding ways to write you up, than giving much positive feedback."
bad,Working in the mortgage industry during that time was very trying and manipulative.
bad,"A typical work day was handling escalated complaints from the Office of the CEO and President of Bank of America.  Managers were very aggressive in they way they they treated employees in urging them to complete the complaint resolution process.  Customers you dealt with directly on  the phone varied from threatening violence, to verbally abusive.  I learned that I am not cut out for a call center environment and that, while I can handle them I do not appreciate overly aggressive personality types.  My coworkers were great people.  We all tried to team up and help each other get the work out as quickly as possible.  The hardest part of the job was the overwhelming stress factor.  There was no enjoyable part of this job."
bad,"In the begining Boa was a great place to work, but as the years went by and bank mergers happened it became more and more sales driven. I loved going to work because each day was unique, different customers and different problems to takle. Also in the last few years there was frequent employee turn over. The hardest part is always meeting your sales goals despite what is happening in your personal life. My last manager liked to micro manage, which I found difficult to work with. It's like having some one looking over your shoulder constantly."
bad,"As a Post Closer in my position I reviewed mortgage loan documents and this review consisted of all Compliance, Regulatory and any additional information executed by the borrower at closing. We reviewed documents for accuracy, proper completion, monitored shipping dates, and was responsible for maintaining accurate shipping log register while adhering to deadlines."
bad,"The several branch managers I encountered didn't care about their employees *at all*. One of my co-worker's father died while she was at work, management pressured her to stay the rest of her shift, despite being obviously distraught and the branch being fully staffed. Management made a huge fuss about me sitting down during my pregnancy until I spoke to HR, and even then they still didn't want me to sit down but let me anyway because they knew how illegal it was. These are just 2 of the things they did, there were many more."
bad,Managed 120 associates in Area Operations Center (AOC).  The process was fulfillment of Bank of America's mortgage loans for North Carolina.
bad,"A typical day consists of four 10 hour days.  12 noon to 11 pm. Management  is excellent. Co-workers are very professional, and always eager to help a co-worker."
bad,"-Be prepared to be told your 45 hours a week are not enough. Your work will come home with you in your head, even if it doesn't in your paycheck."
bad,THe bank has decided to drastically reduce its mortgage business and I was caught in that reduction.
bad,"It is a good place to work for a start (i.e.) for one or two years then as you continue although there are challenges there is not much encouragement /appreciation and one does not get a chance to explore new areas and new technologies at least in my current work location."
bad,"growth wise it is very slow, they dont have true processes setup, do not follow CMMI5 , and same as above"
bad,Enjoyed the environment in the branch however I was displeased with the ability to excell with regard to salary.
bad,Bank of america has great benefits such as 401k and health insurance. But the toughest part about working there is the constant micro managing. The only thing I did enjoy was attending the fund raising events such as walks.
bad,I left my stable job of 4.5 years for an opportunity to work with B of A as a personal banker only to be terminated 2 months after a new banking center manager who had her own agenda arrived. I thought HR would have my back but to my dismay they didn't. I did win the unemployment battle and now I'm pursuing legal action.
bad,The only good thing about BofA is they do pay well. Raises are hard to come by. They lay off the lower levels while upper management does not get laid off as much. Not much innovation in Banking products.
bad,A high number of tenured people being fired in a short amount of time
bad,"Traditional ""banker hours"" no longer exist 7:30am - 7pm  "
bad,"mostly night shifts."
bad,"Sales and marketing"
bad,"It is an excellent company to work and get a lot training for the role. It offers flexibility, work balance between family and work. I have met some great people and everyone is always willing work as a team. I like working for this company because they drive their team efforts and building relationships. We do a lot of team activities after work. The only problem is career growth is limited."
bad,Fast paced environment with diverse clientele and staff. Brand name is recognized globally.
bad,"Invariably difficult to 'meet or exceed' expectations in order to get any sort of raise above $.25 after working additional shifts, overtime, and taking on additional duties that were not required."
bad,"Work starts at 9am closing  5pm Monday to Friday"
bad,This was the most stressful job I've ever had. I was forced to sale additional credit card to people who m didn't want or need them. My job was constantly threatened so I quit.
bad,OK to work for pre GFC. Its all about who you know. So I don't like the preferential treatment that others get over another equally qualified person.
bad,process equity lines of credit for customers..request documents to complete the loan application. This job was one where you would have to wait on documents and that would hang your loans up and make them become dead files. Which means we closed the loan in a adequate amount of time.
bad,management demands a lot from employees without any bonuses or additional compensation that motivates employees.
bad,"I worked Sunday - Thursday , Mondays are always the busiest and month end as well . I gained alot of knowledge about the mortgage industry and time management was essential to my job title . Managment was all over the place no one knew what going on most of the time , failed to listen to the concerns of the associates . I had a good relationship with my teammates we all had alot in common and our working relationship was great ! The most difficult part of the job was telling someone that will lose their home and listening to there stories of struggle . It felt great when I was able to help ease the mind of a customer that everything would be ok and that I was there to help."
bad,They will move you to a new department if needed. Hard work and dedication isn't what advances you.
bad,really do not want to discuss since I am still employed. I enjoy what I do I do affidavits but overall not to happy with the company they have all these core values but management does not comply
bad,"Highly stressful company, employees expected to work at extreme high pace with overtime to meet company and personal goals. Expectations unrealistic. No room for errors. Expected to perform at 150% plus be perfect. Management kaoctic. Management highly stressesed and takes out on employees. Low morale of employees. Constant changes on guidelines and procedures. You must be strong to survive with this company and not yet confident that jobs outside the company are any different or better."
bad,"Bank of America was a different type of culture and environment to work in. It was much more of a micro-managed culture and not very open to flexibility. A typical day was very redundant and the same tasks performed over and over with just a different bank site. This job for me was not challenging enough and I don't feel I really learned much on a daily basis. Overall, I did learn some things regarding the financial industry and how it works. The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing over & over again. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting some great co-workers and networking with prior clients from my Hewlett-Packard days."
bad,"I worked under Fannie Mae, BOA is very unorganized when it comes"
bad,"Received incoming calls regarding stock options, mutual funds, and bonds; Entered customer’s information into the company’s computer software; Provided accurate information regarding the mail date of 1040’s; Routed calls with issues and problems, solved or passed on accordingly."
bad,"A day at Bank Of America inside the Credit card division is similiar to a day inside a Rwandan refugee camp,"
bad,"I have never had a position in which I felt lied to more often. Products were changing so often (not a problem) and we are asked to try to upsell clients to new products so that they don't have to be ""grandfathered in"". Then once in the new products, the contract allows BOA to switch the terms on the client. The client feels lied to and cheated. I appear to be the guilty party even when the bank had promised me they wouldn't be doing this. This happened on many, many occassions. I finally couldn't handle appearing to be the 'liar' to my clients any longer."
bad,The job was hard working and very demanding. Love customer service
bad,"fast setting, too much work for little pay. Average management, great co-workers."
bad,Bank of America was great until I got laid off 2 months after hire due to having too many employees
bad,Worked in a virtual world with customers across the US. Learned how to deploy to the Cloud and Java re-sizing. Management was basically hands off approach and assisted when requested. Co-workers were helpful. The hardest part was makes sure that everyone did their job and working in different time zones. The freedom of working from home.
bad,"Workdays are rarely slow but when problems arise, that's when the fun and blame game take shape. Co-workers who are not politically oriented are generally the best people to work with. Middle management has an incredible appetite for perception, therefore the informal rule regarding face time is very adhered to. The hardest part of the job was knowing you had no one to turn to, which eventually made the most enjoyable part of the job my last day."
bad,"Manager do the best they can and most are very good. They tend to hire people on a temporary basis and only hire about 1 percentage to permanent. The pay is little more than average. If you can get on permanent, their benefits are good."
bad,Processed detailed information about fraudulent and non-fraudulent dispute and claims issues on checking and savings accounts. While at Bank of America I handled very sensitive private information and became one of the most knowledgeable and highly rated associates within the electronic claims dept. operated a variety of computer programs to perform fraud and data analysis for customers. Consistently achieved the highest scores for customer satisfaction in the department with multiple executive customer compliments.
bad,company has good professionals but bad management.
bad,"its ok i guess, but it depends on what market your in and who your management team is. pay seems in the low end of the retail banking industry but goals are easily attainable. I feel that at the market level they don't effectivly recognize and utilize talent effectivly and desions are based more on ""caddy."" when looking for a job in retail banking a good question to ask is why there are so few male employees for certain companys and in certain areas...."
bad,"typical day at work, face pace, angry customers, the "
bad,Management over works you and they refuse to let you call off so you have to come in sick. The benefits are great but you would be lucky if you would get to use them. They worry more about sales then helping their customers so csr are stuck with the daily abuse from both managers and clients. The pay is great but not great enough for the hostile environment you work in.
bad,The job has unrealistic expectations and doesn’t care whether you agree or not. They go by a it is what it is attitude that everything comes from the executives and managers at branches can’t assist much. The local branch is amazing because the staff is great and helps you push through the day. But company choice wise it’s all about making more money and seeing what they can squeeze out the client. It’s unrealistic and extremely stressful. I always made my numbers and then some but it’s not an easy pill to swallow.
bad,"When i first started i was excited . However i thought the salary was unfair for a relationship banker but i chose to look at the bigger picture (growth within the company) firstly my training experience was horrendous. Even if you have prior banking experience. Their system is so outdated for employees and to top it off they just sit you in front of a computer all day. They don't teach you! They assign you a ""peer mentor"" which is another employee that shares the same title as you. Most of the time the employee doesn't even know they're your peer mentor and most people are new anyway so ultimately you have new people learning from new people. You are told that as an rb you'll be assisting the teller line once in awhile (to cover lunches) so they also train you as a teller. Reality is rbs do everything. Lobby lead, teller; atm; operations, acct openings plus all the rules and regulations you must know. This job severly under pays you and drains you. Its a learn as you go but if you make a mistake its a write up. All branches are different depending on your leader your experience will be much different but one thing i do know is that bank of america just has this ""hybrid"" role because they dont want to hire more people to do all these other jobs. I am a relationship banker aka ""glorified teller"" cause thats all i ever do. On the job for almost 2 months. Only myself and one other person (who is also fairly new) in NYC and i work open to close shifts 46+ hours a week! To top it off tellers will soon make 20 an hour. I make19.34. How does that even make sense ?"
bad,Company didn't place all employees. Was totally unfair. People were unaware of the change and had no offers or incentives. Should have provided a package or definitely a new job
bad,"They don’t want associates to say sales but that they are improving lives yet they want a daily count of what you did. They raise the goals every quarter and cut staff.  The only position I would recommend is CSR, the pay is going up to $20 an hour, just shy of what a manager makes but no stress, anything beyond I would run from.  The upper management has never actually worked in a bank therefore has does not understand how their decisions affect the individuals actually doing the work.  When goals are met there is no recognition, they raise the bar and point out other areas that need improvement.  Also witnessed blatant discrimination, same offense one employee is fired while everyone looks the other way for the other employee."
bad,"excellent benefits, poor management, always caring about goals and not employees. They need to start thinking that we are humans too, do not expect us to be robots and care about us."
bad,"working from home is veey much part of the culture, but the leadership is all about cya and the quality of coding is so poor. everything is a house of cards."
bad,You are a number with bank of America they could do better with how they treat their employees. They should be open to change & constructive criticism.
bad,I worked both in the Sales division and the and as a processing manager. The sales division was wonderful great management and support. The back end division was ran with no support and back stabbing of other managers. I would never work for this company again.
bad,"This was a client with Concentrix (fka Convergys). I at first like the opportunity, but felt sometimes they did not want to be accountable for their actions. I also did not always like having to sell other products, but learned to adapt. I may have come into this account with a bad attitude, as I was trying with no success to try to change careers. But I am happy I made it through to the end of the contract, I was one of the few who did so. That opened things up with USBank when they started."
bad,"Review customer accounts to prevent and detect potential fraud."
bad,"Overall, working at bank of America was very mechanical. It was not a very pleasant work environment because everyone always seems stressed to hit goal that are difficult. Its good to have goals but they work you like your just a number."
bad,Ok job... worked at better banks. It might be a great institution but management in the DC area is not impressive and is not plying fair. No chance of advancement
bad,I have never worked in a place where workplace politics took up so much effort.  Managers were always scheming against each other and their employees with little regard to how their employees were doing.
bad,"Job was ok but having to have every single minute of your day logged, including bathroom breaks and such was overwhelming. Loved my manager but that was not enough to stay. Was happy it was only a temp job."
bad,I was fortunate to always have a great manager so my experience was much more enjoyable than most employees.  The pay was below average and it took years to create a productive system.
bad,"While at BoA we found out that they do not have a complete Q&A process. For example, there was a piece of architecture we were suppose to integrate with that we found out did not exist in the environment."
bad,"Absolutely loved working with my fellow colleagues and long time, strong relationship built clientele. The one thing I disliked was the micromanaging and very heavily weighed sales pressure. . If you didn't make your goal, you didn't have a job, despite excellent customer service scores."
bad,Typical corporation. cubicle environment. As a parent company they seemed difficult and slow to work with.We were glad to be sold to another company later.
bad,"My time at Bank of America was short. I was there from 2003-2005. During this time the job I held, the department I was in, went through much turmoil. It was not a place of peace when I was there. Very fast-paced. The benefits are great though."
bad,"Bank of America was a low stress company to work for.  Once you were trained, you were free to do your job with minimal supervision.  We had a meeting every morning with our department manager.  This was meant to be inspirational & set the tone for the day."
bad,"BofA offers great employee compensation amounsgt industry trends, but you have to work for it. Systems are entirely outdated and are not streamlined to the business objectives. Thus, extremely challenging, more than typical, to achieve goals. Additinally, management is constantly micro managing employees. tedious and repetitive practices are drowned in daily duties to uphold the company culture. Training program and employee services integration is terribly built."
bad,There were management problems at my location and a lack of effort to correct inconsistent training and equipping of work forces. Operational training was done via observation and trial and error. Management seemed unresponsive to resolve training and communications weaknesses after being informed.
bad,"Overall is a good place to work however lately Leader have not been chosen wisely, We as a team understand the quotas but the approach of the leader is exaggerated and at least in our market people are leaving their jobs."
bad,"Almost no job security! Working place is always relocated in short period of time (5 to 6 years). Daily work is a sort of robotic job and workplace culture is good,"
bad,The department that I worked in was very interesting. I enjoyed my team mates. The management style was not one that I have ever experienced and hopefully will never encounter again. All in all I can't complain; it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worse.
bad,"very lazy, bureaucratic and negative culture.  Expectations to get by are very low.  Expectations to succeed are insanely high due to a focus on technology over human beings."
bad,Open and close accounts for patients that come in the bank. Assist with request.Role play and get observed by management. Cross sell staff was diverse and fun to be with. We all learned from each other.
bad,Bank America doesb not honor FMLA. You are not able to be sick as it can cost you your job. My manager made it her bisiness to see that I was gone and didn't get unemployment.
bad,been with the company for over 2 years and they wont let me move up because they don't approve of the place id like to go. They say they don't want to send help to an outside market and would prefer I stay within but there is no good opportunity where I'm at.
bad,Terrible management that contradicts itself. Manager would threaten to fire me and also micro manage. At times you would have to check in to your manager multiple times a day to tell how many products you have sold.
bad,"credit underwriting for mortgage loans, automobile loans and consumer loans. Worked with branch employees to obtain required information to render a decision"
bad,"Poor training environment, upon several request from associates, management failed to provided the employees with what they need to be successful in the legal department.  The work place was very stiff as the associates weren't allowed to talk to one another, poor communication between team leads and managers.  The department as a whole needs a full review and restructure."
bad,I worked very long hours at ML. I didnt have a chance to learn much because when i was hired for my position i was very backed up and had to worry about cleaning you the work the person before me left behind. Management was not the best. My immediate was nice but upper was all about money. Culture was snotty. The hours was the hardest part of the job.
bad,Depending on who you are and who likes you will depend on your success.  There were a lot of great employees that I worked with here. Keep in mind that you have to pay for parking.
bad,"-opening banking centre, pursue customer to sell banking products."
bad,"Good for part time, during school-limited career progression. If you are in a banking center, it takes a physical toll as you are not allowed to stand and therefore have to stand 8+ hours a day."
bad,"Bank of America bought our company and we switched roles several times before eventually our site was closed. "
bad,"The company was great to work for at my office well branch. It was my first real job, for someone to start off a career I would recommend the most important for me is location and the location was great for me."
bad,Technical call center taking inbound phone calls.  I have learned about Remote Deposit technical support and Cashpro navigational support.  Management is very supportive and listens to the voice of the associate.
bad,"The financial industry is EXTREMELY regulated, which anyone going into a job in that industry should know already.  However, the CA job its self is less than ideal.  They are extremely dysfunctional and after only being on the job for a few weeks, expected new employees to be up and running at 100% when training at best can be considered poor.  It is possible to work there and retire out of there if you get in with the right group, I suppose.  However, you have to have someone dedicate time to training you and it seems that their attitude about that it is ""not my job"".  Other firms have effectively a ""one stop shop"" for operating.  This firm has at least six."
bad,Management was in need of major improvements. My supervisors did not show an interest in the employees feedback and concerns. the management did not like to work with their employees and clients. they were rude to employees and clients. stressful environment.
bad,"I did home loans for Bank of America.  Some of the branches were managed by people that didn't care about the employees.  I didn't like how the personal bankers would talk about the customers behind their backs.  Especially the Coeur d' Alene, ID branch.  The manger is clueless.  The personal bankers were very hard to get along with.  I did really like the customers at the bank."
bad,"I enjoy working at Bank of America, as it is fast paced and my day goes by quickly. I deal with different types of clients every day. My favorite part of the job is meeting new people and helping them take advantage of their bank accounts and get enrolled in our preferred rewards programs. The hardest part of the job is making referrals and/or balancing your cash drawer at the end of the day."
bad,they push you hard to make sales.  I left because they didn't care about the customer they just want you to make the sale.  the managers are like puppets to the upper management.  Its crazy there.  they are just like Wells Fargo no better.  I moved to a community bank and they really care about their customers and dont force you to sell if they dont need it.
bad,Bank of America was a great place to cut my teeth but a terrible place to work when trying to generate self sourced business.  Local realtors knew that BOA couldn't close loans on time.
bad,"The hourly is competitive and the bonuses are quarterly, but the bonus structure in overly complicated and many of the transactions you complete don't end up counting for over 3 months so its near impossible to track."
bad,"Bank of America has WONDERFUL benefits and perks to working for the company. However, work life balance is pathetic and don't plan on having children or a life outside of here if you desire this job."
bad,Managers are puppets to their superiors.  They only worry about CYA mentality. The banks acquisition of Merrill Lynch changed the culture of the firms work environment.
bad,"Bank of America had great employee benefits however, the bank overworked it's employees and underpaid them.  They  often hired management with very little to no experience in banking.This was my first banking job and loved every bit of it despite the challenges."
bad,"Bank of America offers very good benefits, however it is very stressful to work because of the continues layoffs since 2012."
bad,the company is great and they truly appreciate their employees  but the managers do not care about them at all. Managers retaliate against their employees if they complain about their job conditions. you do not have the right to express yourself because you will probably get written up or terminated.
bad,"Merrill Lynch was an awesome company to work for.  It was fair, enjoyable, and advancement was attainable.  Bank of America change all of that.  Was no longer an enjoyable place to work,"
bad,"Processing and underwriting were a nightmare while I was employed there.   Loan Officer had little to no control over files while going through these two stages.  Terrible communication on the back end of files and the management of operations was even less desirable.  I had two assigned bank branches, both of which were actiely referring and showing strong profit.  All of the sudden, regional manager shuffled the branch manager assignment and the dynamic changed overnight.  Terrible management at Bank of America is printed in reviews everywhere.  I liked my direct manager on the mortgage side, she was not the issue.  She simply lacked much of the power and authority that is needed to make it a thriving position..."
bad,To many rules and security.  Unable to develop anything new unless I used my own computer.  There are two many stove pipes and not a lot of cross team coordination
bad,"My daily responsibilities consisted of reviewing and receiving possible credit card and wire transfer fraud transactions. What I learned from conducting my position was the importance of speaking sensibly with the customers when their transactions were denied due to the possible fraud.  And the management was very much aware of corresponding with irate customers who were not pleased with the procedure the company implement. The management was shrewd how they complemented both the clients and the employees in the way they construed the implementations of operating the banking business. However, since I started at Bank of America during the midst of 2008 financial crisis, there were many confusion that was percolating both in the company's atmosphere and the clients' confidence in the institutional financial market and this instability forced the management to re-examined the various previously implemented functions that had to be restructured."
bad,Once again a competitive line of work that is not worth the stress the management puts on the individuals. The management would degrade it's employees.
bad,"Solid company as one of the major financial institutions in our region so you would think solid, long term employment....no, BOA always reorganizing and layoffs on small or large scale. Not the most competent peers in place - Supervisors or Mid-Management. Advancement based on who you know or kiss up to. Loved my team, very hard workers."
bad,"Very slow to get anything done, ten levels of approval required for everything, meetings...meetings...meetings...acts like they care about their people but really don't."
bad,no growth good place to retire not much of chllenging work environment may be other groups are good but not in my department
bad,"I did not like working in the call center environment. Just was not for me. I felt they had way to high of expectations for its workers to exceed."
bad,Slim opportunities to grow without re-location and work becomes repetitive.  As a result compensation does not seem to be as good as elsewhere.
bad,"Taking inbound calls from escalated and irate customers and assist Banking Center reps. I've learned there's a lot entail with banking however its so micro-manage.  The hardest part is you being the supervisor you're suppose to be.  Every second and minute they're down your backside,  ""you logged in one min late, you haven't sat down and they watching you and telling you that you're late or you're on a call and its 25 mins and bothering you to see why its taking long when you're correcting an error made by the bank and its time consuming to fix some errors. Plus they're not concern about your health when the location they have you working in has dust and mold, they try to force you out."
bad,"Work/life balance is great, but it feels your career stops. I think it is an excellent place if you want a few quiet years. There is not really any innovation or any will to innovate, but people are trying to do there job. "
bad,"will get cussed out on the daily. a lot of long lines, angry  customers. wouldn't work here. definitely  have to have a lot of patience to work here. full benefits sick pay and vacation apply for all areas of work as long as you're 20+ hours weekly."
bad,"I worked for BofA for 15 years, but every couple years, I found that I needed to start scrambling to find a different job within the company.  This is because the current positions were likely to be shuffled or laid-off.  However on the plus side, I was able to experience a large variety of management styles and technology--largely due to the frequent shifts in who I reported to."
bad,"Though the largest network of banks in the United states, benefits are lack luster which can make home work life experience difficult. Continuing education is needs to be improved so that there are opportunities for vertical movement. The company has a history of laying of staff especially after an acquisition. Compensation is lucrative only in positions that begin in Personal Banking Officer and higher or in key banking areas such as Securities, Merchant Banking, Operations, etc."
bad,Bank of America is a fast paced environment and teaches you to adapt to change quickly.   it's a great place to work for cultural diversity.  My co workers are great people to work with.  I have learned a lot about the financial industry working for Bank of America.
bad,The pay is good--but in a bank with too many personal bankers there is a lot of backbiting that creates animosity between the staff.  Would be better with less bankers or to lower the goals
bad,Liquidating post foreclosure loans proved to be a daunting task during corporate takeover.  High turnover in management caused lack in directives from upper corporate heads.
bad,"A typical day of work will consist of resolving responding to emails,  conference calls, and end user calls in support of major infrastructure or desktop issue impacting the environment.  Participating on major team projects; managing major desktop infrastructure projects as well as smaller projects, by scheduling, testing, executing implementations, status calls.  Providing relevant updates to direct and senor management. Working with release management groups to test and verify new software impacting the environment. Active Directory user account administration. Managing a call and work order queue for end user account, network connection, VPN, desktop software/hardware ,mobile device, and requests respectively.  "
bad,"The benefits and hours are pretty good, but the management and training needs a lot of work. They are so focused on sales that it stresses people out. Most of the people in my department either post out to other jobs at the one year mark (in this department you have to be there for one year to post out) or they quit. The goals the expect us to reach are pretty outrageous, considering the economy and the amount of competition out there in the card industry. Management is not very helpful, never around when you need them, and annoyed when you have questions, but then they give you flack when you perform poorly..."
bad,"Different departments to move into different positions. Minimal training , learn as you go environment."
bad,"manager at the banking center is horrible"
bad,"I have only felt frustration with this company. I really had high hopes when I started. Being a large company I thought Bank of America would be a great place to work. I soon learned that with it being a large company, no has time to fully learn anything before being moved up or left on their own. Being new to the company I don't feel comfortable asking any questions simply because I get multiple wrong answers by people that don't even feel comfortable answering. This ranges from fellow tellers all the way up to my store manager. I do love helping the customers but once you bombarde them with sales pitches they start to resent the company themselves. The benefits are very nice but no one knows how to use half of what they offer. All in all, this company needs to get their act together."
bad,"This is a great company to work for. the last center i was at there was just no room for growth."
bad,They pay is no good. I transfer to higher position any never received a raise they good at poorly paying their employee. I remember a top executive who will remain nameless came and said they were going be more competitive in pay. Meanwhile years later it yet to be seen. Management is far from par. There a few good ones but they are few and far between.
bad,Good company with a good future.  Management is often not on the same page.
bad,"Merrill is a large reputable company. I feel to run a successful business  you want your employees to feel valued, appreciated and proud of the company they work for. They will have loyalty and dedication more than scared employees will."
bad,the work we are required to do sometimes go unrecognized. sometimes it seems to be very unorganized.
bad,"great benefits but in the collections department in order to keep your job, you are compared and ranked against the top collector which could cause you to lose your job if the top collector collects at a much higher pace than you. very strict on tardiness, u cannot even be 1 minute late or you will be written up, and you must get to work early to set up your workstation without being compensated for the time. i would not suggest a collections job there, but customer service may be a better work experience."
bad,"good opportunity for advancement, lacks stability, reasonable opportunities for advancement, pay is low compared to other banks"
bad,"Pulling reports , monitoring employees and understanding policies."
bad,"they do not embrace diversity, too much politics. Management do not care about your career development, you will have a very hard time if you are international"
bad,There is a huge disconnect between the workers and the upper management. Directions change on daily basis and they are coming all the way from the top. It's frustrating.
bad,Overall not good. . Lots of favoritism shown.  Ineffective management but excellent working conditions.  Coworkers good but general attitude was to get out
bad,Daily our job duties were to stand as the liaison between clients and other departments within the bank and modification process. Within our role we were the direct point of contact however had no power to make any changes or to speed the process of modifying loans. I thoroughly enjoyed the networking and contacts that I have made while employed with Bank of America and am certain that I will remain in communication with them. I believe the hardest part about the job was the internal battle of wanting to do more than I was able to do. We worked within an industry that was catered to helping clients stay in their homes which made our jobs very important however again powerless as we could not specifically do anything and stood on the front line when clients called in expressing their frustrations and life situations. I learned valuable about working in a corporate environment. I also learned many aspects about mortgaging that I never knew which I also believe I will use for life. The most enjoyable and gratifying thing about the job was having the conversation with a client upon their modification being approved and to be able to share in rejoicing with them being given another opportunity at life again.
bad,"Bank of America sits somewhat in the middle in terms of compensation, but perhaps somewhat low in terms of benefits, which seem to diminish with each passing year."
bad,"Handling PPI Claims for the bank, using CRM systems to gather data and handling own case loads. Working to target each day. Friendly co-workers."
bad,I have money coming in.  I receive a check every two weeks. Life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you will get.
bad,I did the same thing though out my career with Bank of America.
bad,Have to quick to decrease the time of customer wait. Managing especially with merchant requests. Management was good. Tallying the money to the penny. 
bad,"I was a billingual teller, I really like this job."
bad,Need I explain??? I feel bad for the Customer Relationship Managers. Dirty deeds done dirt cheap. Post out while you can. Divestiture will be a familiar word to you sooner than later.
bad,I worked with a great group of people! everyday I was glad to go into work and feel very comortable around my co-workers. They were always willing to help and educate me and vice versa.
bad,"A typical day at Bank of America involves employees wondering what benefits, compensation, bonus, or incentive to work for Bank of America that will be taken away."
bad,"In general I would say working at Bank of America makes you feel like a cog in a giant corporate machine. It's not very innovative or fast moving, very political and just not an exciting place to build a career. You can easily end up in a role where you're paid well to do work that is, well, boring. Also, with all the government regulation nowadays, it almost feels like the bank is doing the will of the government."
bad,horrible company to worrk for if u dont know how to kiss butt. horrbile horrible there is nothing i can say good about a word day at the bank with the maanement the districrt manager everything was just bad the [best part of my job i would have to say is making connections with the customers
bad,West Corp is a good starting place to start your career. I learned more about the mortgage industry and have a good idea now of where I want to go.
bad,"They don't pay very well, but the hours were good for me since I was in school. They are open from midnight until 6:00 am."
bad,"Bank of America was a great place to work out while I was in college, they were very flexible and understanding with my hours. I just think that they micromanage way too much and would chew people out for the smallest reason. I really loved my team but the people I worked with were constantly changing. There was a lot of hiring and firing of people."
bad,"Supervise tellers. Cashing and depositing personal and commercial checks. Open and close the banking center. Administer the new tellers with daily transactions. Maintain the correct cash flow in the bank, ordering and shipping out cash. Responsible for and maintain ATM. Balance the bank vault daily. Processing of cash transaction reports and monetary instrument reports; Process cash advances for customers. Perform customer service / lobby management, assist the branch manager daily banking tasks. The ordering and exchange foreign currency and processing of traveler’s checks and gift checks transactions. Assist with new accounts and sell products. Perform weekly audits on tellers."
bad,"The management was not helpful nor were they caring. They only care about sales, sales, sales, and SALES!"
bad,"Hard to get anything done without going through several different departments. Excessive turnover, particularly among management. Management turnover, coupled with policy and compensatory overhaul on a regular basis lead to an overall lack of continuity."
bad,I had to deal with working in the drive thru by myself with no manager to help. The drive thru was literally 7 blocks from the main building. Then to have our security taken away. Not safe!!!
bad,Lazy and incompetent Managers
bad,One of the top financial conglomerates of the world. The babnking center where I worked included card services and premier accounts.
bad,Took a lot of customer calls from the queue. Helped it one with each of their questions. Gave great customer service
bad,"Spent behind teller line as backup, lead customer service representative for the whole center. Learned much about financial services and the industry."
bad,it is a slow pace to work for
bad,"Since Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch, morale and culture have gone thru the tubes. Management can be good, depending on who you get, and how willing they are to help you advance. For my role, advancement is non existant. Trying to move from a sales function to ANYTHING else proves fruitless. Bank of America is further changing the comp structure, so the heavy money makers are or will me moving for the exit. I am one of those looking to exit. ""What have you done for me lately"" attitude."
bad,"People and coworkers were great and helpful, benefits and compensation stayed the same since i started no raises."
bad,"I feel that everything is robotic by being computerized from time management to your job performance.  It's not personalized by actual people.  It's not friendly, down to earth."
bad,It could be better. I work four ten hour shifts. My days are long. I take back to back calls. Its not a bad company as a whole. It could be better. Working remote at least two days a week would be nice.
bad,The benefits are great.  Production is the main focus and you must be able to produce as fast as possible.  Very stressful moments during peak season. Very few team building events.
bad,"I recently witnessed someone get promoted to their new job without having to take any of the steps I’ve seen others take to get to be a support lead, but I digress. Working for BofA has been interesting so far, even though they have the tools to show you how to advance in your career, there aren’t many opportunities to LEARN how to use those systems. The focus on the client is great, but it almost comes to a point where that’s all they care about, and the satisfaction of their employees is on the back burner. When it comes to front line associates, we’re subjected to swift policy changes (at times without warning) and are expected to know them AND not fight any holds from compliance because we “should have known”. There is serious lack of communication between Quality, Leadership, and Associates. BofA could benefit more by listening to their associates, who are the individuals that interact with the clients every day."
bad,Corporate feel and very much dictatorship. Management does not care about employees. Manager was actually trying to refuse time off to go to my own wedding. Sales Goals very unrealistic and Training almost Non Existent. Very Stressful.
bad,The pay is well and the bonuses can be pretty good at Bank of America as well. However for myself it could be quite stressful in regards to their sales goals.
bad,work is ok to work with fellow teammates. The leadership pick and chose who they want to help promote. It's an ok place to work. Not really much to say
bad,"B of A has been very typical of a corporate job so far. It appears they try to retain talent where they can, but it is a job where people describe as it is what it is."
bad,"n/a no comment."
bad,Pay and benefits are the only things that kept me from leaving. Management is terrible when it comes to communication. Continues layoffs. No room for growth even when you out work your competition
bad,Culture is amazing pay sucks across the board of BofA. They have some of the best benefits but that’s all that’s great about that company. Not a fan!!
bad,You cannot claim to be a 'great place to work' when you reorg and lay people off every 6 months. Volunteer activities are encouraged but not rewarded in compensation / promotion reviews
bad,"It is a very high stress job and very demanding. Unfortunately, the management was very judgment and very unprofessional. Working with customers was great, even helping the upset and frustrated ones were also great."
bad,"Responsible for day to day branch operations, cashiers, vault, budget, supply ordering and other banking operations. Also did loan applications, customer calls, and any other management duties."
bad,"Was a part of insurance division that was being shut down after the Countrywide and Merrill mergers, led to corporate inefficiency in that there were so many layers of management and risk that it was possible to do nothing and hide within the company."
bad,"The people that I work with are awesome. It’s the most diverse workplace I’ve ever worked at. The phone calls are very stressful sometimes as people want to take their whole life out on you and then when they give you a bad survey because you really don’t care about their cat named Cletus, you don’t get bonus."
bad,I don't really think Bank of America cares about Interns too much. I had nothing to do a good part of the time when i was there and when I did have something to do it wasn't meaningful.
bad,company would rather layoff employees and send work to third-party vendors than ensure responsibility to their customers  and keep work in the states to follow rules and regulations of federal govt.
bad,Very busy days at work.  I've excelled in customer service and learned how to use new technology. 
bad,"Bank of America is no longer a place where you can have a career. There are management level mandates to reduce Full time Equivalency, i.e. headcount.  CEO specifically even calls out employees as expenses and highlights reductions every quarter. Hardest part of the job is training contractors who leave every 18 months and have to take a mandatory 3 month off, even if they can rejoin.Sadly, this is not a place where you can expect a career."
bad,A Mega Bank where you can't see or touch the walls.  Where most people to their work and go home.  Very little mentoring or discussion about what is needed to get to the next level.  Dozens of duplicate applications.  Quite bureaucratic.
bad,"The benefits were very good and I met some great people. My manager was awesome and understanding but his manager was not. My schedule changed every month without advanced notice. My husband suddenly received military orders and had to leave, and my 4 year old's preK/childcare closed at 7PM. They suddenly gave me an 11AM-8PM schedule that started on a Monday literally the Friday before. When I advised them at my son couldn't stay longer than 7, I was called into someone in upper management's office. She was very condescending and basically asked me why I applied for the job if I knew my husband would get orders. She also made sure to point out she was a mother as well and this did not interfere with her job. This put a very bad taste in my mouth. Just because I'm a mother and my husband is military doesn't mean I can't work. I was only asking if they'd consider revising my schedule or give me time to work out other arrangements for my son."
bad,It will be good if it is a fun workplace. It is productive to work in Bank of America. Depending on manager you get a lot of support. Lots of benefits and resources at the corporate level.
bad,A great deal to learn & nothing is repetitive. The pay & bounces are great. Bank of America has a history of laying people off every year when they get into a financial bind.
bad,"As above, "
bad,BOA was a great place to work until they broke up my branch and took our manager.  Then  Mgmt made up push customers out the door to ATM's and Online and now mobile banking  there is no foot traffic to sell to.
bad,BOA is a very stressful place to work and they don't care about thier workers outside business hous. The managers are aweful and just set down and listen to calls to see what they can complain about.
bad,"I've been at the company for over 5 years. I have moved up every couple years with promotions."
bad,Working here was fun at first but became a nightmare. At one point I had a teller supervisor standing in my small teller window with me talking over me to the customer about his account information. The TS was trying to show me how to get additional referrals because the 6 a week I was getting was not good enough. I was put on probation every other month because of referral goals until I finally had enough.
bad,"10 week training focuses ENTIRELY on role playing for sales experience. once training was over, we all felt unprepared in knowing the different computer systems and the other aspects of our job... way too much pressure in referring clients to other associates and to make sales revenue. Also, BofA will relocate you to a new branch whenever they see fit, without regard for your commute or convenience."
bad,"The majority of leadership/management are glorified babysitters who got where they are because of who, not what they know as most couldn't help you when you need it to save their lives.  Favoritism is everywhere and all the actual people who would be the best leaders are being held back so they could be delegated everything and do their managers job.  The year end review process is a joke and not based on the metrics tracked but rather who the manager favors.  When you raise these concerns they get rid of you."
bad,The organization was sole interested in the bottomline. Staff was often encouraged to make unnecessary sales that were detrimental to customers.  Staff changes were far to frequent.
bad,"I worked for this company for 14 years, in the beginning they cared, as the years passed, management changed, and with that so did the atmosphere. They are cutting staff, closing drive thrus and expecting one or two tellers to do the job of four or five. Regional management is uncaring, non truthful and very underhanded. Use caution when applying or accepting a job with them."
bad,"Environment is good "
bad,"Multiple training for learning, average management, off course the grade compensation.Fun workplace, Fun Friday. "
bad,Great people in the retail banks however very low paying for type of work. Enjoyed the atmosphere just wished they promoted from within more often than not.
bad,"Bank of America is obviously a great company to work for with competitive benefit packages, compensation, etc. Corporate Audit at Bank of America is fundamentally flawed with many senior auditors packing their bags and leaving to go to other banks who offer more room for growth and a more challenging environment. B of A audit pigeon holes you so if you want to more laterally into another Line of Business your prospects will be dim."
bad,"In this department is very time constrict.  On an average you will key for at least 60 to 80 companies.  Typically you key in invoice numbers, dollar amounts, dates and credit card information.  It is a self motivated environment so you work at your own pace to meet your goals."
bad,"When I first started working at Bank of America, it was quite enjoyable. Eventually, a typical day went from enjoyable to being expected to slave over a computer whilst doing the same repetitive work for what felt like an eternity. The two thirty minute breaks that I had received throughout the whole day were the most enjoyable part of the job, because they were the only times I wasn't pouring tears into my keyboard. I began to feel more as though the role was deserving of a robot instead of an actual person. Some of the employees were immature, but most seemed nice...until I decided to quit. I decided to quit without putting in my two week notice simply because the stress of the job had gotten to my head, so much so that I felt completely drained of determination and energy after a few hours into the day. After I came to collect my belongings, most of the people I assumed were nice were giving off a pretty cold vibe.  That day I learned that Bank of America may not have been the best place for me."
bad,"- A typical day a work will have you seeing 500 faces a day blare passed you."
bad,"It was my first part time job, so low pay, bad hour were the words to describe. Benefit wise was good for college student due to the tuition reimbursement."
bad,Great place to work if you are management. Those under management level are undervalued and not included in bonus consideration.
bad,"The hardest part of this job, is motivating employees whom have no desire to excel.  There is to much group think, one sizes fits all approach."
bad,"If you don't have previous experience as a used car sellsman don't bother applying. Upper management and team managers put an immense amount of pressure on you to sell cash and products. Floor walkers will stand over you and literally feed you words verbatim to say to the customer. If you want to work in HIGH STRESS sales, this is the job for you."
bad,The company is going through a change and unfortunately the customers and the team members are feeling the pains of the transition. The benefits are great and the pay is above the industry standard but you work for every nickel earned and then some. Work life balance there is none. Best part of the job is the customers and the worst part of the job is no respect from upper management and the short of staff on a regular basis.
bad,"Very very busy work environment 8 hours of the day meeting and then after office catch up on management work and improvements. Kept me busy and occupied along with monthly internal study course and exams. "
bad,"I processed checks, I would sort envelops to big accounts. I would do it manually after I would mail out the checks to there companies."
bad,"Lots of work to do at this company, but you better walk in the door as an expert...if you require any training you will fail."
bad,"headline says it all. quality of life is fine as it does not necessary demand long hours, but the business model is moving closer and closer to model portfolio investing, and away from individualized portfolios. compensation is geared towards bringing in new assets, not successfully managing portfolios against your benchmarks."
bad,"A typical day at Bank of America was fun.  The customers were the best part of my day.  I love people and enjoy helping them reach their financial goals.  My day was always filled with working the teller line, maintaining the operations of the banking center and referring products and services that will benefit the customer.  I have learned so much over the 31 years IE: time management, prioritizing and managing operations are a few.  "
bad,"Its fun for a par time job or local job placement . staff is ok and the pay is low. its not the best to work but its easy to find a call center job. Becareful! also working there because you deal with accounts and don't want to leave your computer open. It deals with credit cards , checking and savings accounts.,"
bad,"Over my almost 3 years of employment at Bank of America it has gotten worse and worse. Don't be a Personal Banker unless you love to sell and are extremely outgoing. Market managers set unrealistic goals and never seem to be happy with your performance. I exceeded my overall goal every quarter, but if you didn't do well in one area of your goal you wouldn't get your bonus or have it drastically reduced."
bad,I was working 1st shift and with little to no notice I was put on a 3pm to 12 midnight shift and I wasn't able to dispute the time difference. Management act like they care so much when you first start then when you ask for their help they act like your speaking another language.
bad,"A typical day at work involved being on a phone with customers going over their bank accounts. I would help with transferring money from accounts to accounts, helping the customer located their money, open/close accounts and other banking related jobs. Management wasn't much help in the learning process as I learned from computer modules. I learned one important thing; how to handle upset customers. The hardest part of the job was having customers yell at me for losing their money when it truly wasn't my fault. They were either over-drafting their accounts or transferring money to wrong accounts or lost their debit cards. I'm not really sure what the enjoyable part of this job was other than when you were able solve the issue or had a customer that was just happy with the service they received."
bad,"-I enjoyed working with my peers"
bad,I was a teller for 10  years. I watched Bank of America change. As all business did BOA cut staff and expected more for less. They expected high customer service with less staff. The name of the game was to sell!  Goals were unrealistic!
bad,"A day at work in the banking center is very hectic. Management's expectations are pretty high and goals are sometimes unachievable."
bad,"very stressful, micro management, but I enjoyed my co workers"
bad,Good work place. Everyone is friendly and also great chancing of growing in the company.
bad,"Benefits are great.  People are very nice. Work life balance is excellent with it being a rare occurrence to stay past 6pm, add to that the ability to work from home makes this a great place for work/life balance."
bad,"There are smart hardworking people here. Unfortunately, they are saddled with dragging the other employees kicking and screaming across the finish line. Once you have a job here, you have a job for life. No matter how little you care, how little work you do or how incompetent you are, you will not be held accountable. It's almost like the post office."
bad,"It all depends on who your manager is. My location is great for meeting new people but if you have a bad manager(like managers in training), it's an awful experience."
bad,"BAC is the leader in banking services. It was easy to get lost in that, as an employee. "
bad,"there seems to be a lack of care for employees, so at times you can feel disposable. saw a very high turn over rate at my branch. teller system was very outdated"
bad,Bank of America seems like a great company to work for but be careful. First of all they don't pay half as good as the surrounding banks. They look for associates that they can hire at a minimal rate and keep them at this rate for as long as possible. They don't provide bonuses to anyone except management or executives. The benefits are great but that is about it. Management is power hungry and don't help associates or even do work. They use lower level managers to pile work on and hand off their duties. There is no advancement unless your in a branch level position. Recruiters never respond to emails to internal candidates or even take the time to discuss what options are out there. Very poor company to work for.
bad,Let's start off by saying management should be changed and also they have a poor reputation for hiring. My typical first day there my boss stayed to help . The second day he did the same thing. Then my boss stayed home. There were no other employees on my team. I learned so basically I felt like I was digging myself out of hole to learn the working software they had. This took weeks to learn on my own but managed to do it.
bad,Lots of reports and meetings. Pay is good but don't care for the culture.
bad,"running back and forth behind teller line and platform sales, short staffed with no help for over the past 6 months. learned new techniques to sell and even up sell new products."
bad,Those two items were the best aspects of my time spent at BOA.
bad,"The Operations Center located in College Park is a JOKE! The managers do NOT care about the associates, the only concern is to get the work out. There is new management in the Operations area and he is cleaning house and hiring his people from the Tucker location. They smile in your face, and plot behind your back. I would even venture going to loop road as opposed to this location. BEWARE!!"
bad,I worked there for a few years but never really loved the job. Its not horrible but banking is not a job I would want to do again.
bad,if your looking for good benefits then BOA is the place for you.
bad,"This job could be one of the best jobs I ever had. However, due to managers striving to meet their nearly unattainable goals, associates feel a lot of pressure to perform. If you have a good manager who properly takes the time to train you and keeps you motivated with positive energy throughout the day, you'll do well. But if you have a manager who doesn't care about you and only their goals, you'll end up with a lot of anxiety due to the excessive criticism and pressure to meet the goals that might not be reasonably attainable for your location. "
bad,"You are one cog in a giant machine. Don't forget it. Your manager is not your friend. They will give you a song and dance about how you should put the customer first and resolve the call without transferring, and do everything you can for the customer, but in reality all the managers care about is numbers. This is a call center. Your stats are all that matters. You will be answering back to back calls most of the time. Your department will be understaffed most of the time. The rules will update constantly. Most of the customers will be upset and verbally abuse you. They promise that you can work your way up to a better position, but that's only for the cream of the crop and they usually have to wait a year or two. About the only decent thing Bank of America does for its call center employees is pay well. If you can't handle all of the rest, I'd try elsewhere."
bad,the work atmosphere was not fun. it was boring and drab. the work made you want to tear your hear out and lose your mind. just very repetitive simple tasks over and over again.
bad,This job can be stressful and demands quick thinking which I seem to thrive on coming .Co workers help each other out and there's always something new to learn everyday. You definitely have to be a people person and know how to get a positive ending with difficult people.
bad,"When working in the Bank of America call centers, you must be open to change frequently and in short notice regarding job duties and sometimes schedule. You have to be willing to work weekends and be able to work in a fast paced environment and love phone positions."
bad,Very friendly staff loved the work hours and the pay was amazing also the environment was very cordial and quite and easy pace call volume not bad at all
bad,It is big bank but it is not easy to move up for some people it is depends on your manager if you will get promotion or not but it is very busy Bank a lots of business deposit every day
bad,Bank of America offers a great benefit package. However they are always short staffed. Market and regional management give little support. They expect you to multi task at levels that make it so you can’t do your job properly.  They also do not seem to want to retain long time employees they would rather hire from the outside. Sales and revenue are number one and come second to what is best for the clients.
bad,"Ok pay HOWEVER working here is like high school, cliques, gossiping, lies and all. Reps on the phones have more knowledge then some managers. One manager here is VERY 'flamboyant'' and unprofessional in discussing personal and very private details on what is done on his ""off the clock'' time which makes a lot of the employees here very uncomfortable. You have to be VERY careful to always cross your T's and dot your I's because incompetent managers will tell lies to try get you wrote up or fired because will get wrong answers to questions and YOU will get coached and disciplined for it. Half of the management have little to no knowledge about what they are suppose to be coaching the reps on not to mention most of the managers attendance is horrible because of the stressful and high call volume and they aren't even the ones taking the calls. Managers don't know answers to questions and will not follow up with the right answer. Some managers wont take sup calls when the call is escalated or when client request to speak to a manager. You will be hired for one position then they will gradually add duties that other departments are supposed to be doing without adding on the extra pay. Very high call in rate because of the stressful, rude and very disrespectful calls from clients. Again the reps on the phones are more educated and more knowledgeable then the people supervising/managing them. Bottom line Some not all of the managers here are unhelpful and unknowledgeable and are only at the position they are in because of the length of time that they been here and because of WHO they"
bad,This place is stressful and the call center set up sucks. The training is horrible via webcam. If call volume is high lunches are mandated ans sometimes you can't take your breaks as scheduled . Managers barely want to assist with calls. I was relieved when I no longer worked there
bad,"If you live in Charlotte, go for it.  If not, forget it.  At least that is the case for the Procurement Department.  Things may be different for other departments but I hear similar feedback from Finance and some other areas as well."
bad,It is a great place to get your feet wet and understand the the inter workings of being a financial planner in a successful environment and established company.
bad,"My message to the CEO - break up the company! You have no idea what all 32 LOB do on a monthly basis nor does anyone. It is run like a small country, inefficient and corrupt. No flexibility in day-to-day work, no trust from managers, far too many people sitting around browsing ESPN or Amazon. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE"
bad,I worked for a great manager. Always helpful. Were team meetings weekly to keep you updated on changes. Had new training when needed when you had a system change.
bad,"It was a high volume pace production environment. If you met the production requirements, management would increase the number. In the annual employee reviews, management were not allowed to give the highest rating, even if the associate deserved it."
bad,Bank of America did nothing to promote caring or respect for employees in their call center. It was a high pressure situation and stress was out the window.
bad,"Good place to work if you are looking to a career in the banking industry. Pay is decent start off was 16.20 when I was there, it could be 17.20 by now. If you are good in the 10 key, this is the place for you to be and make a career out of it."
bad,Management was over the top with sales meetings and reviews of performance.  I prefer independence when working for a Broker /Dealer.  They did come with a Brand which helped somewhat.
bad,A company who really invests in their employees but the amount of red tape and compliance issues make it very difficult to get tasks completed.  This is very frustrating for clients and makes it difficult to retain them.
bad,"Although I enjoyed the co workers my manager was very strict and un forgiving Whenever I entered the office, my first impression was contact my  co workers but stay away from my branch manager."
bad,i was a date entry op and it was ok just wanted you to sit down all day and not take a break like come on we have to take a break and lunch.some days it was cool and other i wanted to walk right out lol
bad,"Continued and timely education is not consistant but should be in the banking industry. Instead of educating on things that don't pertain to our line of business, there needs to be education ""rolled out"" before consequences are given."
bad,The whole department was laid off. Management was the worst. Over worked under paid. No room for advancement. Loved the over time. No perks. No bonus.
bad,"Started out fun, full of energy and became stressful shortly after. I worked in the call center. I enjoyed my first few months there but shortly after everyone was looking to leave. They ended up closing it down completely and laying everyone off, I left before this happened."
bad,"Stressful environment due to poor management. My peers were great and I enjoyed the work, however, the company does not seem to care for the employees at the  bottom of the totem pole."
bad,"Pretty good company. Really depends on who your manager is...if you have someone who is vested in you, then the sky is the limit. There are a lot of opportunities...especially if you are willing to travel. If your manager hordes her/his talent, you are not going to go anywhere...."
bad,This was a new position that I was hired for.  They weren't prepared for appropriate training and job description. The job I interviewed for was different than what I was hired for. I sat around a lot for the first 2 months.  My talents were under utilized.  Once I received my book of business it was difficult to service my clients due to the massive layers you had to go thru to try to get anything accomplished. We were more like a call center for loans and there were 60 people in a room trying to talk over each other. It was too large of a corporation for me.
bad,"no summary of the job post for me to talk about since im required to write ill just talk about the weather, Its nice outside :) im happy to be alove yes"
bad,"As an intern, they don't do a good job in mentoring and developing you. It is obvious that they are just using you for the ""free"" labor, as you are assigned office manager responsibilities."
bad,very stringent requirements and policies and lots of training classes and meetings.  Many desks- it was a temporary job that I was laid off from and had not benefits
bad,Not a great place. Not a great culture. Did not learn much. Was hired with the knowledge from upper management that the location was being closed within a year.
bad,"Great software infrastructure to promote learning. If you are willing to work with a large team, this is the place for you. Great for college grads as well."
bad,"overall bank of america is a good company, but its salary is very much below average in the market. If you would like to gain experience in a large company, this is the place. But if you would like to make a living, this is not an ideal place."
bad,"Bank of America was a decent company to work for.  They are very fair, However, I did not like the fact that they made me cash out before balancing my drawer."
bad,"Great hours to work."
bad,I have nothing  I can officially say about Bank of America since I left  my position there was more than 15 years ago.   Left position due to RIF in 2000.
bad,My biggest gripes with bank of America is the pay and lack of a social environment for the employees. I truly felt like a robot that could be replaced at anytime. Other banks pay 2 to 3 times more for the same jobs. The training was good and they made sure you knew how to do your job. Also the benefits are amazing.
bad,I am neutral on my opinion of Bank of America.  While my experience was not negative... there wasn't a lot of positive either; which was probably more of a result of my direct manager.
bad,This company does not provide adequate training to their representatives as well as adequate assistance to their employees while taking interactions on the phones. Most of the management are pleasant but it does not make up for the lack of support.
bad,"Wasn't pleased with the objectives.  "
bad,"Management care for their people.Work location is accessible from many point of transportation. Management has a hand free attitude. Dress code is comfortable all week long, very nice."
bad,"I liked working for Bank of America because there were lots of skills I learned, and leaders I will always remember. However, the pay was not nearly enough for the amount of stress and work load that was expected from me. "
bad,The benefits were great they were pretty much what kept me working at Bank of America. The pay was okay but raises were determined by how much you sell. Sales goals are always rising and there is pressure from all of your coworkers to sell. Your only purpose at this job is to push credit cards and line of credits. Breaks are often forgotten and lunches are cut short. Managers are always stressed and under pressure from higher management.
bad,"A lot of people, a lot of opportunity, but you need to leave and come back to make major advances in money. "
bad,"Worked with bank employees to locate clients that would be a good fit for investments rather than banking financial instruments.  Referred business to mortgage dept, small business banker, as well as personal bankers to try to keep client within the bank for all their needs."
bad,"Bank of America is a great place to work, they do care about their employees, and willing to go the extra mile for them.  Their training is not so great."
bad,Working for Bank of America offered a lot of room for growth in the company.  If you have the desire you are able to transfer to other departments of your choosing.
bad,Anything is constant is change at this place... if you like being complacent this is not the job for you. most of the people work there are co dependent.
bad,"I worked in the Call center to sell people balance transfers, direct deposits, and new credit cards to people calling in for general servicing requests."
bad,"If you are in sales as a Financial Solutions Advisor, this company does everything they can to avoid paying you fully what you are due. Metrics such as overall client satisfaction that's an inaccurate berometer of how you personally assist clients, as it is tied to your entire team will cut your pay on average by 10%. Fail a call on Line 6 more than 3 times in a 6 month period? That'll be another 10%. Depressing daily huddles for a work-force straight off Craigslist; the bankers are zombies, and don't care about you."
bad,"Constantly asked to ""recommend"" products to customers even if the product may not benefit the consumer. Fairly easy to advance as long as you're meeting the sales goal each week."
bad,Was supplied with good staff but not enough of them and culture was not as supportive as other institutions.  Many client issues had to be called in by staff rather than staff being able to handle them at the branch.
bad,Could only ever receive contract work at the most minimal of wage work. Hours were basic for a bank but it isn't actually a bank as it is a trading floor.
bad,"Zero direction, lack of of prioritization. Boring projects and messy legacy systems. Expected to work overtime without pay and not much upward mobility"
bad,The work environment was fast paced. High turn around with employees and management. This company did teach me the values of details and understanding the job.
bad,"Discover client priorities, account opening and maintenance, outbound calling, lobby leading, relationship building, referrals to small business and mortgage."
bad,"How to listen to customers needs."
bad,"If you join as a solo practioner, just expect to not rely on anyone for guidance. The company brags about a training program that is all on your desktop computer."
bad,"I to learned a lot in auditing, customer service, doing loans, and interacting with customers.  I had good managers for the most part, and enjoyed the co-workers I worked with."
bad,The company was constantly in transition and turmoil.  Employees were continuously shifted from one team to another with no organization.
bad,"The only good thing about working at BOA is the tuition reimbursement. Unfortunately, there is little to none consideration for employees."
bad,Assisted with teller line to proactively offer products and services to benefit the customers. Opened Personal accounts and educated customer about banking products. Made appointments to increase my solution goals and coached tellers on how to send referrals to me so we would help the store meet solutions goal.
bad,"Although I had no issue doing the work, the pay at verizon was subpar for my living conditions at the moment. The staff however was very supportive and always willing to teach."
bad,"I enjoyed the professional aspect of this job. Computer work is one of my strong points and it was a vital part of this job. At the end of the day, this company is  business, and they need to generate revenue. This was everyone's job as a whole to meet company goals and be very aggressive with sales. Although the skill of persuasion is something that can most definitely be learned, it was not an enjoyable part of my job."
bad,"Was not a good environment to work in. Constant challenges and instability. Left before the financial crisis. Thank goodness, because everyone got laid off."
bad,"A typical day at work was like a feeding frenzy at the shark tank."
bad,Fun working environment with supportive management. Difficult advance you career. Met a lot of great individuals who I still interact with after leaving the company 3 years ago.
bad,The company as a whole lacked the technology to advance to the level it was capable of as well as lacked the leadership to drive it there.
bad,"The way this system ran was unbelievable. The job in itself was great! The hours on the other hand weren't so good. There were many times where they will send you off to multiple banks just to get the hours. Although that wasn't just all bad, it could be a bit frustrating at times."
bad,"working for bank of america gave me great customer service skills. It is not an easy job, the job environment is very positive."
bad,"Bank of America was good company at first,but after to many operational and managers and reduction of associates was very hard to keep a good way to work there...I love work with customers giving them a good service daily and cover them their needs or solving there problems related with there bank relation...I did learned many service and procedures to provide a good customer services..Also bank Regulations.In addition,all teller duties and money management transactions,duo control as security purpose of our co-workers.I always keep an excellent relationship with the team work and supervisors, respect and good way of communication is the key to maintain a healthy job environment. orThe hardest part is been in a few dangers situation as robbery and other bad situation,etc. The most enjoyable part is to see a happy customer when you cover all there financial needs."
bad,Did transactions on a daily basis. Very Hectic. Would not come back to this company very corporate. It always about what can be sold to the customer instead of focusing on customer service.
bad,I did like working for bank of America but they do not provide the same compensation as other banks and the customers dislike the brand very much.
bad,"At the beginning, B of A was a great place to work. Management changed and that brought about a lot of different personalities and a lot of good people were let go."
bad,"Hardest part of the job is the sales pressure"
bad,"Boss was an ex car salesman who would roll his eyes at you if you had a question."
bad,good company to work for and start a career. Easy to move up in company lots of overtime for people who want to make extra money
bad,"I didn't like this position solely because of it being a contract position and can end at any time. The job was very stressful, minimal training"
bad,"I worked SO hard, and never had a chance to advance within the company. I was there for almost 4 years, and had 0 chances to move up."
bad,Great team to work with. This job requires you to concentrate and put attention to detail and multitask. I learn how to prioritized and meet deadlines in a timely matter.
bad,Bank of America is not a good company to work. The goals are too high to achieve and always short staff. No proper communication from leadership.
bad,Being told customers were the top priority this was not the case.  Working with people with mortgages was especially difficult. Goals reached by some centers questionable.
bad,"Job satisfaction here depends on management and team. It can be fast paced or slow, there can be a fair live/work balance or a poor one. Really just depends on which team you have."
bad,"The working environment in Bank of America was fast paced, energetic and changeable. I learned great skills from working there that I can adapt to any career going forward and to life in general. IT skills, time management, negoitation skills, customer service and management skills.The Management team were always very helpful and patient, the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the changes in company policies. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working as a team"
bad,"If you have a family BOA has wonderful benefits that can be put to use for your family. Such as backup childcare, childcare reimburshment."
bad,country wide was not a good company to work for. Long hours from 6am - 9pm at night to complete all your daily work assigned with bosses who were incapable of doing the job themselves.
bad,"BOA was my very first employer where I learned and developed as a professional. My management at the time was amazing. It was just a stepping stone, not a career move position"
bad,Based in Canada not as much focus on Canadian employees.  Great co-workers who work hard and always provide assistance and help you learn.
bad,Co-workers are great. Benefits are very good. But pay raises average .30 an hour and are only given once a year. Unacceptable.
bad,You have to make sale goals consistently. They have very strict guidelines. Opportunities to grow but you have to know the right people.
bad,"This job is not my scope of work.. I am an outgoing people oriented person. the position requires manual labor projects such as lifting heavy files as well as boxes filled with files..  It is a dead end position.. I am seeking something more satisfying where I can assist people, rather than concentrate on not making errors on a daily basis."
bad,"Managing PM, QA, BA teams"
bad,This company is very political.  If you have a good manager then you will be ok.  If not then your career will suffer.
bad,Hated it.  Didn't have all the computer accesses to achieve what was needed of you to successfully do your job.  Trying to convince customers to submit required documents was hard. Had hour meetings daily to keep associates up to date on changes per the government.  Could never keep up.
bad,Would be when I met with a SEG rep and I get time at a company meeting to come in and talk about the CU.  I enjoy doing meeting with existing groups with the CU aus well as new on board Co's.
bad,Very Corporate. They want you to work long hours. Most people are older and have been working there for a while so you sometimes feel like an outsider.
bad,Extremely full of knowledge yet little growth opportunity . Job Security can be shaky based on what new plan has been implemented at the time.
bad,Contract job and first job in London. It was good for the CV. Nothing more to disclose.
bad,"A typical day would start around 7:30 and the telephones would start ringing appx. 8:00 o'clock. This was a fast-paced environment with deadlines for closings. "
bad,"A typical work day at bank of America was never predictable it was constant change I learned how to train others on new projects, we were a team so we all worked well together, the hardest part of the job was not being able to interact with each and every customer due to large pipeline volume, the most enjoyable part of the job was calling our customers to inform them that their loan has been approved."
bad,BOA has great benefits.  Depending on which branch you work at it can be an enjoyable environment
bad,"The industry is flooded with so many people who do the same thing so you're not valued as a person, just another body in the seat. Sr. managers have no idea what's going on with their lower level managers. Lower level managers are threatened by employees who are eager to learn and make beneficial changes. "
bad,keeping track of the money going in and out and also the products that as sold on a daily bases.

bad,"A competitive working environment, surrounded by talented individuals who want to grow their careers/"
bad,"Cold call all day long. There were suppose to be daily sales training while in the 3 year PMD training program, there was not. Co workers were ok to work with. Most of the experienced were not that helpful."
bad,Educated new employees on my job functions that were being moved to another state.
bad,I enjoyed working in this department. The only reason I left was because of layoffs. I believe this is a great place to work.
bad,"Good Corporation to work with , competitive salary , good team work environment . You may advance as much as you want."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of this job, was the ability to hire new employees with mortgage experience."
bad,"Lots of incoming calls, not a lot of workers.  Everything outsourced."
bad,Demanding schedule and high degree of turn over which my area.
bad,"Needs to work on management. Started out fun, but turned into micro management."
bad,"management was awful."
bad,Stress from upper management trickles down to associates. Pressure to sell sell sell. Not really focused on customer service as they say.
bad,The dept I worked in was for military members who were behind in their mortgage payments. I was not part of the team to assit with a modification but the front line when the homeowner called for assit. The teams were trained but not in an enviorment of confindence in what they were teaching. the best way I can expain the two three years I was there was flying an airplane while trying to build it. The dept heads did the very best that they could with the information and tasks we were given but they were at an disadvantage as well. I miss the people and as a whole Bank of America is a great company to work for.
bad,"•	Developed a comprehensive knowledge of the techniques and processes of providing retirement services to Client Analysts (CA) and Financial Advisors (FA)"
bad,"the most enjoyable part of my job was to get the call from the borrower letting us know that they closed on time and that they love their new home, the hardest part was getting all the documents on time to meet the time line to have a happy ending,  co works were great to work with we all had  a very difficult job, but we worked together on a day to day and did not take anything said personal , like family sometimes we wanted to not talk with each other but we over come all for the borrowers and or our relationship.  what learned was to never give up to think out side of the box we can always find a way to make thing right, my typical day was to go into my inbox, priorities  my day, looking at what was due that day and looking ahead, for the next 48 hrs.  helping my teammates if they needed a hand so our team could meet our goal for the month to have happy borrower"
bad,This is a good company to work for. Working in the relocation dept. we never had any fun. It was always quiet and boring. They provide you with training for any new products that they plan on using. They keep changing things up and adding more for us to do with no more pay.
bad,"Some very good people there. The public, and the Government, hate banks. On top of that BAC is too big, with too many processes and review boards, to get out of its own way."
bad,"Reviewed, monitored, and processed customers financial requests     "
bad,Great place to not only strengthen culinary skill but also retail experience. both good skills to have in the Food industry.

bad,"Process expense reports and invoices"
bad,Working with my co-workers was  great it was a team effort everyday no one had a problem helping each other.
bad,I enjoyed working and mentoring to my managers. I learned a lot about Bank of America.
bad,"Good pay, horrible management. Co workers are mostly tolerable but the environment is like a high school and the management is a joke. The only way to move up is to get in with the ""cool crowd"" , promotions are not based on performance or capability to perform job at hand"
bad,Company had extremely high turnover rate in their mortgage division.  I was a Unit Lead for North Carolina and managed 70 individuals at one point.  Due to mortgage volume and associate turnover the work hours required for my remaining associates were excessive.  And they carried 3 to 4 times typical capacity.

bad,at bank of America if you are not from Arcadia you have no chance
bad,I am on contract that will end in July. There is no permanent job offers being made.
bad,"Bank of America is rudderless since the financial collapse, sr management views the government is the primary customer, not the end customer, and they do not seem to have a clue about how to change the culture to promote a positive customer expereince. When you work at Bank of America you feel like you get caught up bureacracy and even though you might have very effective skills to get positive outcomes, often the outcome has already been decided 5 levels up."
bad,"I spent a lot of time cold-calling in a closed off room, and had little interaction with other employees as well as did a lot of tedious data entry."
bad,"A place to learn the banking industry with a great team of co-workers to make the day go quick, unfortunately unexperienced management that ride you from the time you come in to the time you leave."
bad,"The best part of the job was working within the Escrow Team. I acquired a plethora of skills that will be beneficial for both my career and personal life. My co-workers made coming to work worthwhile and they will truly be missed. A typical day at work would be best described as challenging, a bit stressful but the nevertheless, exciting and never a dull moment. I learned how escrow is calculated into a monthly mortgage payment and the factors associated with escrow are tax and insurance amounts based on the city, state, location of the home. I also learned about flood zone determinations and how this factor may or may not negatively impact a homeowner, price-wise and payment-wise."
bad,Work here only if you need a job. Nobody's on the same page and management is a joke.
bad,It got very difficult when the call volumen increased because bathroom breaks were limited to 5 min in a full 8 hour day but the incentive of working with great people and having fun while still being productive was always great experience.
bad,"processed loan approved by an Underwriter/or an automated decision system. verify conditions of approval for income and assets documentation such as vesting issues, child support liens, judgement liens."
bad,Everybody is friendly and very helpful.
bad,worked here for 5 years and where i learned to process a mortgage.
bad,A typical day at work was busy with phone calls. I learned a lot about all kinds of loans. I got along very well with management as well as co-workers. The hardest part of my job was having to ask customers for payment when they had lost their job. The most enjoyable part of my job was pleasing my customers.
bad,"Great people that work there but not a lot of career growth opportunity. Promotions did not come with raises, just more responsibility."
bad,"Bank of America was not a good fit for me, training was great."
bad,Being a senior teller was a tough but humble experience. I was able to gain leadership experience during stressful times. Management was mediocre who gave false promises. One thing that I did enjoy was my co-workers. Having them made work enjoyable.
bad,- prepared the report for management
bad,Responsible for meeting sales quota monthly to offer client products.
bad,"Check MS Outlook emails. Check phone voicemails, sort mail. Assemble tax returns as needed through out the year. File tax returns file folders into the file room. Enter IRS notices into MS Access Notice log. Update client data in our Liersoft client tracking system. Quarterly I create spreadsheets & run federal & state macros to receive checks and pay IRS via EFTPS. I've learned more about taxes and was able to adapt having no tax background. Example Form 709 is for filing gift tax return something I didn't know."
bad,"Bank of America would be a great job if the managers had any management skills, very unprofessional, the pay is decent but the benefit are great. 8-5 Monday threw Friday is great for families. Overtime is only once in a blue moon, not constant. I guess it all depends what department our in."
bad,Great Place to work. Decent Pay. No where to advance.
bad,"When I get to work I have to log on the computer and get my systems set up in 5 minutes and have to start taking calls. My department was close so they forced me in an other department I didn't like. I have to keep people on the phone for 10 minutes when all they want to do is activate their card. They get mean and nasty, and then I have to try and sell them something. We get ""coaching"" every week, so they can tell us everything we do wrong. Then if we log off to go to the bathroom, they want to know why we logged of and why we are not at our computers. I feel like I am going to get in trouble every day for something, and I am a hard worker but nothing is good enough for them. You get written up for calling out sick, even if you have sick time available. It doesn't make any sense to me. They treat you like a number, you are only there to make them money, if you don't make them enough they will find a reason to fire you."
bad,Not a long term employer. Look for other employment opportunities and consider this employer only as a last resort.
bad,Did not have the systems in place so you could determine employee results
bad,The bank did not believe in properly training the managers to be able to relate to their employees. The only thing that matter was the numbers of how well or poorly the branch did. If a manager was good at having high numbers than they would be promoted. Employees could be fired over every transaction.
bad,"The last 2 years at bank of america was very difficult for me due to unforeseen circumstances, but I loved my job, my peers and the customers that I had the pleasure of assisting."
bad,Lots of politics here. It is all about who you know. Got to know a lot of nice people but its all about politics. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
bad,"Great atmosphere would recommend. Family focused , flexible hours"
bad,"The job itself was not at all challenging and the employees I worked with were awesome. And this was across all shifts. Management, except for on my level was just as awesome. My managers however delayed promotions and advancements until they were able to advance themselves. This left a bad taste in my mouth, but didn't take away from what I thought of all the other employees and co workers I came across. They all made the job worth returning to each day."
bad,"Clemson manager was unprofessional, sneeky and manipulative only really looking out for herself.  I loved my customers, but hated my co-workers.  Very stressful work place."
bad,"Was once top 4% in sales performance as a Personal Banker in all of New England and they would not promote me because I didn't have a good enough ""sales efficiency rating"".. Once had an unfavorable performance in an interview and was blacklisted to the point where I couldn't even transfer laterally."
bad,I felt locked into the same day to day job with no way to move forward. W worked long hours for small pay. Commission was a joke . We were threatened daily if we didn't reach our daily numbers.
bad,"Was separated from the main office by a hallway and a corner, often forgotten by the other staff to even be present, had to self start a lot of my own projects. The monotonous intern work wasn't the issue it was the lack of feeling involved with the rest of the office that left such a negative impression on me."
bad,"The project aims transfer of money from one bank account to another, either within a single financial institution or other institutions through transaction devices."
bad,"Nice place to work and everything well organized."
bad,I worked at BofA when it was still countrywide.  This slightly colors my review. It was going downhill and the writing was on the wall.  Some of the leaders were under high stress.
bad,"The bank is making record profits, but IT budgets seem to be decreasing every year which results in numerous layoffs and the fear that you're going to be next.  I've now been on that list twice, and then hired back as a contractor. This is not conducive to a great work environment no matter how much you love the job."
bad,The company has taken all bonuses and additional compensation away from us. No longer offering commissions. I love my manager but he's in the same boat. A lot of employees are leaving the company.
bad,"I learned how to be a better Team Player.  I learned how to process health forms, payments, all types of foundation/charity payments.  The workplace culture was conducive to what I was doing.  Eating and shopping locations were limited.  BOA tried to enforce mandatory  overtime yearly, but someone always managed to remind them of the law.  Still they tried each year which demonstrated limited company ethics. I hated using lockers and made to feel like a thief."
bad,"Bank of America is a fairly good place to work however the balance of family was pretty much non existent.  Mandatory overtime was ridiculous and management was not very understanding."
bad,"Responsible for communicating with existing and non existing customers that applied for banking services"
bad,"Management is awful, horrible place to work, a lot like high school just everyone is older and not as bright. Bullying atmosphere, with cheating encouraged by managers despite the fact being caught can get you fired."
bad,A lot of conference calls when I was there and I also went through four different managers for the year and half I was there.  I think it's more stable now.
bad,I loved working for this job until Bank of America took over. When they took over they put more pressure to draw in more accounts and starting laying off employees for not meeting their goal. especially people that had been with the company for over twenty-years
bad,"I was invited to stay after a temp position had ended only to be fired 2 weeks later for ""not learning fast enough."" I had been consistently asking for feedback and tips and was continually told I was doing well. I suspect that I was the scapegoat when a file for a client was mishandled--one of those situations where they wanted to be able to say to the client, ""Sorry about that, we fired the person responsible."" Perhaps this will never happen to anyone else, but I will never work there again, as the trust is completely broken."
bad,"Its a great place to work if you can stay focus"
bad,"wonderful company ,,,,, They laid off lot and you will not retire from Bank of America..... I was laid off twice"
bad,It was a job & I really enjoyed assisting the customers. It was also nice to have great co-workers.
bad,"A typical day is helping customers cash checks, resolve account issues, withdrawals and deposits. "
bad,"my work day was always fast pace, high volume of work, meet deadlines, I learned to sit at your machine everyday n get that work out with no errors at all, management very easy to talk to n communicate with very understanding with your concern, n sit at that machine n work with us. coworker I work with for 20 years became workers that will not leave to go home until you was finish your work we all work together to get out there at the same time they where truly team players. the hardest part is sitting all day not knowing what time you going to off to go home, everybody working together to go home the same time n you got paid very well from keying a very fast pace on ten key machine so what you key is how we got paid n it was excellent."
bad,"Former co-workers were wonderful to work with, all got along great. The expectations of the job became a little demanding especially when the manager would be out of the office since there were no other managers on staff.  Typical day consisited of coaching all branch employees  throughout the day as well as daily operations of the banking center.  Job security is non existent since there was constant ""restructuring"" of employees at branches. Expectations to meet goals and customer service goals were extremely high and caused extreme stress amongst employees. Learned how the corporate world really operates. Hardest part of job was having to do the job of the branch manager often and not getting paid the same.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the employees I worked with, definitely a team environment."
bad,"Make calls to borrowers, request documents, submit files for review, meetings, and trainings. Learned about all Investor Segments. Co-workers are team players. The hardest part of the job is telling borrowers they are declined for mitigation options."
bad,The work flow varies a lot and there are a lot of constant changes to adjust to.
bad,"I enjoyed working at my branch, people were all great and none of the backbiting I hear about in other areas. The branch manager tried to help me as much as he had time to help. The corporate level didin't care an iota about helping bring in accounts. If they didn't want it, you were screwed."
bad,The company is at a tipping point in which it will be crucial to re-brand themselves and regain customer confidence. The main issue is they are still cleaning up legacy issues which has proven to be a bigger problem then what was initially thought.
bad,"Its fun to work with but management is very unfair, never appreciate the good you do, when one thing wrong done is the worse thing ever till fired"
bad,I work with incoming phone calls from the banking center community providing policy and procedure.
bad,One of the best things is the pay and benefits package.  But that is about it. The various ethnic groups sticks together and will not offer help or advice to any others.  Management looks the other way. Overall though not a terrible comparison.  I had worked at chase too previously.  Bank of America is way better that chase was.
bad,"I was a commission salesman at Merrill Lynch.  This was a no-fun, 52-weeks-a-year job because I had to keep up with all of the developments in the marketplace."
bad,"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsu"
bad,"Good workday structure. Laid back environment. "
bad,Management cares none thing about the workers or lives outside of BOA. Everything is strictly about the bank and meeting it's goals. There is to much training and they will not accommodate for last minute time off if someone dies or if you are dying with the flu.
bad,"Bank of America is a good company to be a part of. However, the training process is not helpful, management puts a lot of pressure to upsell products leading to an unhappy work environment."
bad,Its a stressful environment but the pay may be worth it to some and i really have nothing more to say about it. Typical bank processes and procedures.
bad,"This job is fast pace and gives a vibe that agents aren't trusted due to the no paper policy no paper objects or pens are allowed at work station. Agents are expected to be knowledgeable of banking and the only support system is the resources provided at the time. They were not flexible with my work hours even though I was pregnant with twins. It was pretty much you leave the job or stay in the shift you have now, which isn't the shift I applied for."
bad,"worked hard, but never was given the agreed upon opportunity to advance. the overall agreed upon mobilization upward never took place. I worked for a manager that knew I did not personally like her - and she made it her mission to held me back and keep me from being able to advance."
bad,"Bank of America Practice Solutions is a great company in the sense of culture, co-workers and ability to advance. If you are successful and take the time to learn and put in the hard hours you will have opportunity to advance with no problem. Management are behind each of their co-workers and they will help in every way to see you advance. There is very little micro-managing."
bad,"You always come in sign in to your computer be ready for calls to help customers with their accounts. I did learn a lot on my job with BANK OF AMERICA I was in mortgage for ten years did do back office work such as payment research, answer emails, correspondence, was trained in Business Partners, also did property claims when customer had insurance checks for damaged property. Then business changed then I was trained for credit card customer service. The team members we worked as a team helped one another. I learned a lot about mortgage and the different kinds of mortgage. The hardest part of the job was when you got a challenged customer we always have to keep a level of customer service that doesn't make the customer feel he/she was in the wrong.  When the calls come in slower that have time to talk to our cubies talk about family and fun stuff."
bad,"Fast Pace "
bad,This job was okay at the time. The work environment was quiet. Employees are helpful when you need them. It is a fast pace work environment.
bad,"Bank of America closed down the UTSH Mortgage Banking Processing Site. In 4 months Bank of America closed down 16 sites leaving close to 62,000 Americans with out a job. All of this done right before Christmas and the holidays. It has been extremely hard to find another job in the same field that I can make a good living at and love what I do."
bad,"Good job as far as pay, although treated like a number instead of a person timed bathroom breaks, hard place to work when you have a family."
bad,"Great benefits but couldn't care less  about employees and there we'll being. I was laid off 4 weeks before my closing closing date. We were told on a Wednesday that today will be your last day, here is your severance good life. After working for a company for 6 years, having to deal with all the inconsistencies and unorganized environment and sticking feel like  sticking with this company was a huge mistake. I wish I would had left year one."
bad,A typical day at work would be servicing customer providing them with world class service. The most difficult part of the job was meeting referral goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the wonderful people I met along the way.
bad,Way to stressful. You learn the sad truth that large banks don't care about customers. As a teller you try your best to make it an easy and quick transaction but the bank want you to refer people. They even have goals that if you don't meet would make you look really bad and possibly fired.
bad,Falsely accused of something that someone did from the back office team . Always short staffed had to work at times by myself to keep business rolling while trying to identify sales opportunities
bad,Very fun and outgoing place to work great people great customers only give raises annually constantly changing bank names take a long time to become full time employee tuition reimbursement
bad,"Good Place to work but take forever for advancement. I love working for my manager. Commission structure is horrible. You work hard every day and the upon receiving bonus, you will loose the motivation"
bad,Helped Customer over the phone or through email. Given a huge Pipeline before I even knew how to perform the job well.  The benefits were good but the training was not any good for me.  The management was terrible as well they never tried to help a very cut throat position. Co-workers were not very helpful because they had their own work to get done with not enough time to do it.
bad,"Very clear work guidelines with plenty of room for advancement, good training program. However, not the greatest in the ethics department."
bad,"overall a good place to work if you enjoy the call center environment. Compensation is good. Managers are very knowledgeable. Not a bad entry level job, just not for me."
bad,"Aggressive sales goals, lack of team environment, pay was adequate and benefits were standard"
bad,Was not a great company for work/life balance. Long hours especially during month end. Normal day be at my desk by 8 am with my head set on making collection phone calls. Days were long pay was short.
bad,"Helping customers with questions about banking and/or leading them to someone who could give them more information."
bad,"Would return home owners calls to answer their questions. Complete daily tasks of spreadsheets and projects given by managers. "
bad,"Great environment, great experience learned a lot of regulations and very knowledgeable of the computer. Management is great willing to teach and lead. The Co-workers are great willing to help and work together as a team. The Hardest part of the job was the incoming calls a lot of the time you had great customers and some were just flat out mean. Very flexible if you have children and willing to work with you so you don't miss out on family life."
bad,The present environment is very unsecured. The company is getting bad press but the bank is working to keep its bottom line as strong as it can. People are great and committed to their job.
bad,"Hats-off to BAC for re-assigning employees even temporarily & not laying us off during the down mortgage era. Our pay remained the same, even though new job function was easier."
bad,I enjoyed my job but was not happy with the amount of help. Not enough tellers for a very busy bank. I always balanced at the end of the day. I was very good at warm transfers one time in top in the district 6months running.
bad,"Ive been with the bank for going on 10yrs, stability is my #1 goal and Mortgage has always been a passion of mine. The people in the company are great and supportive, management does with they can for to succeed."
bad,"Over all a tough work place to get assimilated with, hard to adapt to the verbal abuse placed by customers. Phone makes its easier to say things that wouldnt other wise be said."
bad,"A typical day at work would be processing large cash and check deposits in a timely matter in order to meet or exceed our goals. I also was in charge of giving the tellers overrides, audits, and helping with any out of balances. I learned that we were a team even though we had individual goals. I also learned how to be an effective leader by coaching the associates that were not doing so well in meeting the goals. I got along with my co-workers because I learned to not judge, but get to know people so that you can understand their attitudes. The hardest part of the job was trying to get everyone on the same page because of the different personalities. The most enjoyable part of the job was when everyone came together as a team and exceeded in the departmental goals."
bad,"This role can be very overwhelming. Service to sale on every call. Monitored calls and surveys can hurt your bonus. Sales goal are set for you every month witch are insane. The company is great, but this department is not fun at all. This is not a customer service job only."
good,"Too many politics involved in advancement. If you were not related to management, you didn't advance. Not a company that cared about your education level or work ethic."
good,".No career progression"
good,"I just think that my role as a loan officer is or was the least they care about, getting an approval with BOA is almost impossible, we worked 24/7 pay is horrible"
good,"The company to me treated you as a number and not as a person.  I did not like the culture there.  There were many people that had been there for years, but I believe it was because they didn't know what else was out there."
good,My strenght was to be a team player and work very hard. This company is a good place to work.
good,job environment is mediocre with no competitive pay. i've learned the mortage industry
good,"The top of the days begins with team meetings, then a quick breakfast break and afterword, it's work all day until lunch time. It's a job that's underpaid and overworked"
good,I dealt directly with banking centers that where customer facing. Call types are from as simple as my Ipad will not connect to the internet all the way to a whole banking center being down. collaborating with many different vendors and suppliers. The management at Bank of America is focused on meeting numbers and not fulfilling a good work culture. Hardest part of my job was thinking outside the box.
good,"Managerment are not inclusive, nor do they assist with any career development or growth.  They would prefer to put a butt in a seat and never acknowledge the person's abilities or goals.  High turnover rate in Mortgage, Consumer Leading and Risk due to lack of support and job security."
good,The only reason i liked working for the bank was my coworkers were great and we had a great team to work. Manager was OK and her management style was not so good. She did not remember any conversations and yelled at all of us as if we were in a school.  My work benefit was great
good,When I worked at Verizon they only kept 1 black manager on the management team at a time. I worked around a lot of extremely talented and very qualified African americans during my time there. There were white employees who had neither the skill or ability to be a manage and were hired over the black employees.
good,Management looks out for bottom line and employees are only a number. I saw people who worked there for 20 years lose their job because the Walnut Creek manager was trigger happy and make bad decisions based on bottom line.
good,Not what you think from the outside. It is just to keep body and soul and pay bills. Not all that glitters is gold. You need to get sales at all cost with no excuse.
good,typical corporate company that cares nothing about anything but stockholders and the CEO's salary.  Local upper management was horrible - the reason most people left.  BOA finally closed the local office.
good,"As a recent college grad wealth management is no easy feat. I thought getting a job with Merrill Lynch would provide me with the training and tools to become an excellent financial advisor. I would recommend using a ML financial advisor, but I would not recommend working here right out the gate. The success rate of the PMD program is insanely low. I personally believe their business model is to hire as many people as possible, set insane benchmarks 80% of people cant meet and after 6 months your gone but they have a few new clients."
good,"My first good job after high school, so the pay was good, but I didn't take the job as serious but there was opportunity to grow in the company but I didn't use my full potential"
good,Not for those that think out of the box. In the IT field at this institution there was balance of work and family life as I was always coordinating patch management on the systems I supported. The company worked you very hard with little compensation in return.
good,Not a stable based due to the climate of the mortgage industry at the time and the recent purchase of Countrywide by Bank of America
good,This was a Temp job so it was just good experience. Was the only job i have had where I was finger printed. That was cool just wish it could have turned into something more.
good,"Bank of America, previously MBNA is a great place to work  I preferred working for MBNA since the precepts between MBNA and Bank of America are as different as night and day."
good,"very busy"
good,"Deposit checks and process invoices received by mail "
good,The typical work day was stressful because I worked with a group of unprofessional employees that were just rude.
good,"as a Banking Center Manager you are responsible for the overall performance of your center and its associates.  The training did not apply to your day to day responsibilities when I was placed in my banking center.  "
good,"HR with Bank of America are always on the managers side, the manager can acused you of anything and even though you have the prove, the it is not true, HR does not care to hear the side of your story. I was fired after 25yrs an outstanding performered, but when this new manager come from Smith Barney from the investment side, she fired me because I called the mortgage department to asked them a question regarding a computer open book training. And my entired career with Bank Of America, she is the worse evil person and racist. Even though she is Russian and claims that she is LATINA."
good,Was a temp job that had the illusion of becoming permanent but you always got let go about a week before the contract ended. The job was easy data entry and review.
good,"BofA can be a good experience or a bad experience depending on which group you work with. I didn't have a great experience. My manager was young, without children so she did not understand or care about a work life balance. They need to train their managers to have people skills."
good,"The review marks were based from a new Financial Advisor position (less than 5 years)"
good,"This was at one time a great place to work, however they no longer care about their employees. They have implemented policies that prevent employees from getting raises or increasing their pay by moving up."
good,"They make you work 6 days a week, it doesn’t matter if you work 20, 30 or 40 hours a week. Your only day off is Sunday because the branch is closed. "
good,"Just don’t  not really sales more like customer service but if you don’t sell cash or a credit card or business referral, and the referral has to be warm transfer if they don’t answer you lose the sale and have to set a call back which 10% chance theyll answer the client. And now your in a negative balance which dose not look good and reflexes bad on your mid year and yearly review for a raise."
good,it depends what dept you work in but you need to be prepared to work independently and stress free. good benefits and time off. good learning experience
good,"Bank of America puts more emphasis on earning business than on their employees...they don't realize that happy employees will result in overall success of the company."
good,"the hard part of this job was to work at night."
good,Salary vs job requirements is not very good. Time off instead of working 6 days per week. Don't promise better pay and then not deliver.
good,terrible place to work. management does not care about employees. equipment is old. systems that the customer service rep have are always one system behind what the sales force has so we are expected to help with something we have no access to. the blind leading the blind.
good,laid off in 2009 - still laying off and firing people. good place to work if job had stability. bring in a lot of temporary employment. people are nice to work with
good,I suggest applying to BOA as a permanent employee only. The work is okay. Job security as a contractor is very week. I would only work as permanent employee through BOA.
good,"Worked there for 13 years.  The first ten were fine, if you don't mind lay-offs every year and performance plans that take hours to complete every few months.  A good manager helps keep morale up and the work environment positive.  A bad manager made the last few years the single worst work experience of my life."
good,Worked here as a temp.  Not really much to say about them.  I didn't work here long.  The training I received here could help me in future opportunities.
good,Bank of America is very much a pro-family company. You are given 12 weeks paid parental leave. Wide range of job opportunities and ability to grow within the company. The company also offers great benefits to it's employees.
good,this is a good job for a student or a person that wants just a part time job but need to be a very productive person because everything needs to be done at certain amount of time
good,The turnover rate for managers and employees is very high. Location was very busy. Only one fuctional teller. Pay wasn't enough to compensate the work load.
good,Good customers with the ability to get customers to application but after the application service levels fall short. The current management style falls short and can't get enough volume to support a good income.
good,"My manager at BOA was very unpridictable.  She did alot of blaming or passing the buck.. I use to do all operations and she never helped me.  I never had an opportunity to coach my staff or my teller line. '"
good,"OK job for part timers -but no room to grow here. Forgiving schedule  flexibility."
good,"No job security or room to grow. Benefits were ok, management was always changing."
good,"Employees are goal oriented, Fast paced, good opportunity about Card Systems in the USA. Hard part is we are being gauged based on Customer Experience but it is rewarding because there you will find out how are you working as Customer Service Representative."
good,I'm thankful for the opportunity to work at Asset Acceptance. Responsibilities included communicating with customers to recover outstanding customer receivables; negotiating payment terms; maintaining client account information; adhering to federal and state legal regulations.
good,"We worked tirelessly everyday, with little breaks. some of the management team really cared for their employees and others not so much."
good,Cost cutting intiatives are are more important than employees at this time
good,"BofA was a good place to start my career, but advancement opportunity was limited and job security was more about what you have done for me lately and no weight of what have you done long term.  With that said everything was monitored and micromanaged."
good,"Bank of America has provided me the opportunity to work in a field that I would have never imagined working in. "
good,"My current responsibilities are servicing highly affluent branch offices as well as other internal Merrill Lynch Bank of America Lynch groups to process timely requests.  I’ve also been responsible for the screening, hiring, and development of new hires, projects, and processes.  I work closely with VISA and check professionals in order to proactively approach fraud and preserve integrity of client accounts through phone calls, emails, and personal interaction."
good,"I did not enjoy working for Bank Of America, a typical day included reviewing mortgage moans for default workout programs.  I learned all I need to know about mortgage loans in default & programs offered to homeowners in default. The co-workers were always upset because of the company moral level, & lack of management training.  The hardest part in working for this company was the managers & their lack of knowledge."
good,It lost it's heart in the merger. Once a bank that worked with the community and it's people. It became a heartless sales machine. It also targeted all the LaSalle employees for termination. It also when as far as treating the senior employees as untouchables.
good,I was severenced from the bank in Nov 2012. I did advance very well in the company.
good,A teller is a teller.
good,I liked working there but found that managers were much better at networking than they were with basic knowledge of their jobs. Going to a manager with a question was not welcomed. Lay offs happen all the time. No job security.
good,Exposure to people you would not other wise meet was great. Management was under so much stress that they placed a huge amount of pressure on workers.
good,"They barely offered a salary, their ""comprehensive insurance"" package was lacking and only giving 30 minutes for lunch, basically forcing you to utilize their over-priced in-house cafe, isn't what I call a great place to work."
good,"Loan Modfications and DIL, Forberance Plans orhter workout options"
good,"Bad market management and will not recommend BofA to anybody. Bank of America is another Wells Fargo, pushing  sales to clients all the time and if you don’t meet your sales goals daily the manager have to be in call after bank close"
good,"Bilingual speakers should be compensated more, training and development should be more competitive and focused around finance, help shoukd be offered for employees who want to get licensed."
good,I worked for this company for about 5-6 and I would have to say that this company went from caring for their customers and their needs to sending them away to do it over the phone or online. The work ethic of the particular branch I worked for was outrageous. There was not really room for advancement and with the introduction of new technology within the branch I felt as though the jobs were becoming less secure.
good,"A lot of things could be better, if the company is willing to change those things.The only thing I agree with working for this company is the maternity benefits I have received."
good,"We have an excellent team work. We start our day with our morning huddle, talk about our daily goals, how we are doing individually  and as a team on our quarter goals. We are also in the top 3 centers for customer service in our market. We all comunícate and get along very well."
good,"The benefits are great, leadership is low. Managers typically manage processes vs actually leading toward success. The staffing model supports driving clients to manage their finances through digital sources, however when we are short staff there is no help. I work 9+ hour days, asked to pitch in extra, goals are set to a perfect world so it's almost impossible to reach 100% when we are operating on extremely short staff. Often times I don't take a lunch until close to 3pm. I leave feeling drained because I sat at my desk with limited ability to stand up. Also exptected to complete an unrealistic 40 calls per week when I've had a client in my chair 99% of the hours that I've sat in my chair. The overall environment is negative, feeling of never being quite good enough to meet goal or be compensated for actually going above and beyond."
good,The sales goal are insane but achievable if they approved more stuff . Most of my clients credit cards got declined . BOA cares nothing about clients financial lives rather they only want to put those poor clients in more debt. For every credit card refused by clients we had to email our manager the reasons why.  No matter what your numbers look like even above  goal it’s never enough. Can’t wait to find something better oh and beware you’re expect to make 35 calls and emails weekly like you work in call center . This job will make your blood pressure go through the roof
good,"The management team was lacking in managing the vault. I had suffered from a stroke and the manager fired me because I had to leave to go to the hospital. When I returned to work to show the doctor's orders for me, I was then told that I no longer was employed there. It was very upsetting to me, unprofessional, and cold of that manager."
good,Standard financial company that cost cuts every year and under regulatory scrutiny.  Company works under tight deadlines and is not conducive to work/life balance
good,"Layoffs all the time, no work life balance. Well below average pay and yearly raises are a joke.  Some managers have no ide what they are doing but kiss butt well sonthey are promoted and taken care of. If u do things right u will not advance."
good,When I first began working at Bank Of America there were plenty of opportunities to advance and grow.  Very quickly a lot of the privileges and perks of the company were taken away from the employees.  The supervisors and mangers manly benefited from bonuses and perks.
good,"I worked in the Home Loans office until 2011. I had 3 managers and needed zero for my job. Management was brutal all the way up the ladder. I had 7 pay cuts, one every six months."
good,"A typical day would be receiving many batches of IRS payments that included vouchers with checks. Payments would have to be checked to meet requirements and procedures to be processed by machine. Checks would have to be stamped over payee with ""payable to US Treasury"". Followed procedures would include accuracy and speed."
good,"Prior to the acquisition of the M&A of Bank America and Merrill Lynch, the culture at ML was cold and disheartening.  They completely stepped away from their mission statement.  High pressure job to say the least.  The most enjoyable part of the job was attending the monthly sales meetings at a resort.  ML went all out to accommodate the Financial consultants with breakfast, lunch and dinners including sales training seminars with wholesalers."
good,"This was a very stressful place to work. Customer service was not priority. Staff to client ratio was horrible. Customers waited more than 30 minutes in line sometimes. We were standing all day, not allowed to sit. Very micro-managed. Scripted conversations were required. Sales environment created competition, not team work."
good,"It was quite a different experience working with the firm. Learnt how to become flexible, working during odd hours, how to manage own work life balance as per the work culture"
good,"Lots of data entry. Weekend hours. A lot of keying of checks, data entry. Production is high. Everything is locked up, no bags, everything has to be in lockers"
good,Bank of America is a highly micromanaged culture with a heavy emphasis on sales results. Moral is low and management is ineffective. Sales incentives often have different jobs families competing against each other rather than working together to help customers.
good,"The sales pressure is way to high, with unrealistic goals, your expected to be a teller and a platform associate at the same time. Management will rather you not meet you goals then to let you off the box!"
good,"I worked for Standard Federal Bank and LaSalle Bank prior to Bank of America buying both banks. I loved working for Standard Federal and LaSalle. However, I was unable to adjust to the Bank of America culture and chose to resign."
good,The unfortunate truth about the training that I recived for the position at Bank of America was inadequate and unfrofessional. The trainer often ramarked that we were way ahead and suggested that we should take time to get to know each other and take longer breaks than usual as well as listen to him tell his life story
good,Top performer multiple jobs each day decent company to work for not enough pay the environment that I work for could have been better I worked with a lot of different managers at that site
good,"You'll be expected to work multiple roles for a low pay. they created this job so they don't have to hire assistant managers, and expect them to do all the assistant manager work, but without the pay."
good,review any calls from previous day that have been graded by quality or management along with emails that may have been send out before logging into the systems to start taking calls then you have 2 15 min breaks with 60 min lunch if not taking away due too mandatory overtime
good,"Just from a teller's perspective, this company was not great to their lowest employees.  They are expected to sell products at a computer's whim and deal with the customers about changes usually without much warning.  "
good,Did not like my Merrill Lynch internship experience; manager was not very communicative and I was not paid for this position. I would not recommend working here.
good,Department I worked in was a back office support area and there was a lot of favoritism going on. Only the unit manager's friends were paid well and received special treatment. They were even allowed to leave work while on the clock to run errands for the unit Manager.
good,"The training was good until we received new management and she changed the training process. "
good,"It can be stressful most times as its a sales based company. Constant micro management. Its a culture that allows younger associates to age bias older associates. I learned early on you must roll with change to not age out. The work environment is not ideal, old buildings, plumbing, no bottled water offered. No bonuses no appreciation."
good,"fraud analyst job is to mitigate fraud, support and assist customers with loss reporting, and replacing consumer credit card. Development  in the company is all about who is liked."
good,"I got hired through a temp agency for the fraud analyst position. Company does not do drug test, however, they did do background checks as expected. Management excludes contractors from everything, they act like you're untrustworthy because you came in as a contractor"
good,I really wish I didn't have to do these reviews every time I changed my resume this is getting nerve racking!  This place was cool for a while however if you work in the city of Detroit they makes things very hard.
good,There is no work/life balance.  Long hours created longer hours.  The culture created stressful work environment.  All number crunching.
good,"Typical day at work is nothing but stress."
good,"As top producer it is difficult to move higher as one is needed to cover for those that are unable to produce."
good,The time I spent at Bank of America I found that employees were kept in the dark about upcoming changes and I was promoted four times with a raise only once. The name was a company at one time raised eyebrows when spoken at one time.
good,Assisting team mates and customers with mortgage issues.  Servicing all aspects of mortgage loans.  Working with wealth management clients for solutions of issues.
good,They provide great training and great benefits.  Advancement is unheard of and my experience has been that the manager actively works to keep me in my current role because I'm doing a good job.  One would think a good job would result in a promotion but not with Bank of America.
good,"The Bank and Management need more help with client services. I am glad that it has been around for such a long time. They must have done a lot of credit changing over the years, so I would still have a lot of respect for this bank."
good,They mainly hire contract employees only. Training program is poor for the complex roles that everyone plays. Management mainly communicates with contractors job agencies instead of directly with the employee. Good experience working in a fast paced internal advertising company for a prestigious institution.
good,"typical day at work was not too happy, need to focus for what you are doing since what we are doing was to key the confidential information."
good,Management was to spread out and systems antiquated in that we could not serve all clients accounts. Not a good experiance for me.
good,"Worked very hard and brought over with paid signing bonus."
good,If I had not worked for the company I definitely would not have banked with them. I found that higher ups wanted associates to push products on customers which was not always right for the customer.
good,BOA is not longer doing Correspondant UW.   I cannot rate the company other than to say the six months I worked there was not pleasant.
good,Be prepared to work understaffed  and disciplined for your lack of performance. You will not be expected to do the job of at least two people. Be prepared for goals to increase every time the bank gets sued. This bank does not appreciate the little man they only want the big fish as their customer.
good,Company too busy trying to obtain new clients however treating them like  a number vs actual caring for their needs.
good,When working here it was not great. they only offer part time to anyone and you really cant get ahead
good,"I was only a contractor assigned a project at Bank of America - Plano, TX."
good,"The department that I work in with is the Treasury department requires managing commercial business accounts. Handling commercial loans, debit cards, ACH, Account reconciliation and online banking. Requires research for complex request and helping clients manage their accounts."
good,"Busy from the moment you walk in the door until time to leave. Breaks are monitored and most cases you have to request permission for a bathroom break, which can't be longer than 5 minutes, otherwise you have to wait until your regularly schedule breaks or lunch. Overall if you can work under constant watch and micro-management this would be a great place to work."
good,"• Provided general administrative support to Regional Sales Executive, VP, over Sales in Arizona"
good,Upper level management was ruthless and only wanted results without supporting you.
good,Bank of America is a decent company to work for but I would not recommend the Lockbox department. There is no growth in this department and the skills and experience learned will only be helpful in lockbox.
good,In the beginning Bank of America was great! I worked for a couple of good managers for my time there last one was awful! He would literally bully the people wrong thing to do. Upper management supported this guy He didn't seem to care.
good,"Interview did not contain the real expectations of the job, didn't realize I was responsible for so much revenue with limited ability to contact customers."
good,"The manager I had was cool and the employees were nice, but the culture was work and it the problem completed as soon as possible. In the department I was in there was no room for excitement."
good,"If you are open to the no-walls concept of an office, this would be a great opportunity.  Teams and groups are the focus. However, there is litte/no privacy and the open layout of the office can hinder individuals."
good,"Good company and benefits, Lower level management lacks leadership training."
good,Advancement opportunities are not given to current employees. Lack inclusion within the company. Also sales practices were questionable. No work life balance at any position at this company.
good,Always short staffed and they will ask other employees to always move to other branches for help and put the load in the branch on one or two employees only.
good,Bank of America as a contractor so I'm not sure how the difference would feel in the perks of being a permanent employee but I always felt the contractors was singled out under compensated even when the permanent employees receive the Rays we did the same work even better because the numbers increased once I Contracting training team came on the floor their numbers increased in a positive way and we still were paid the same as when we came in the door but all the permanent employees receive raises on top of we were never eligible for bonuses
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Great customers and CEO  "
good,"very regulated, very stressful, no opportunity for advancement, no opportunity for interaction with team members, no opportunity to make decisions on behalf of customers, very outdated technology.."
good,"customer solutions by providing seamless delivery of service, and/or fulfillment requests by answering calls, text messages or emails in a contact center environment. Requires knowledge of multiple products and ability to deepen or retain relationships through service. Involves referring customers to the appropriate line of business for products not supported. May be required to solve problems and investigate/resolve a wide variety of issues and requests that include"
good,"Experience while employed at Bank of America in the beginning was wonderful, cheerful, beneficial & glam during this time the company was Fleet Bank once Fleet became Bank of America the feel and experience aforementioned no longer was great."
good,"Great benefits, health wise. Poor training and development.  No job security.  Can not purchase a home or car, do not know if you will have a job if quota is not met . A lot of write ups. Action plans. Most companies that's a big deal. Another day at BOA."
good,"The PMD program sets the advisor for failure. In addition there are 3 different sides of the Bank that compete against each other. In addition, there is not true partnership between the bank and the wealth management side."
good,This is a challenging job. It's not meant for everyone. It can change you for the best. You will learn alot and you can somehow utilize everything you learn.
good,Spent 12 years with the company to be laid off without warning and no attempt to reassign me to another department. No assistanxe in being rehired for another position. Last manager was heII on wheels and all complaints made against her were swept under the rug.
good,"look elsewhere, they are all moving to the east. west is too expensive. They dont help with career advancement, pay is low, merit increases are coins unless your in a profit center."
good,"Call Center area has an extreme amount of restrictions.  No off phone time.  Must read regulations, and other required script exactly.  Some areas of the bank do not promote from within.  Other areas may"
good,"My job was cold calling prospective clients and bring in their assets to manage.  I was constantly on the phone, smiling and dialing.  This was a fruitless endeavor as it simply did not work."
good,Would not recommend Bank of America....too much STRESS and have questions on management ...have medical abnormalities brought out by the STRESS of this job
good,Management needs big time help. They shouldn't talk if they can't do the job themselves. They need to hire the right people and also the right amount of people.
good,Financial services industry is extremely tough and this is the top of the pile in terms of the business. you must know a good amount of people who make and can invest over $250K to succeed.
good,"Cut-throat culture and poor management.  The company was a blend of cultures from different businesses that had been acquired over time, without proper integration.  Management was unwilling to integrate and suffered cultural clashes as a result."
good,"The IT department in division needed strong management -"
good,The pay was very low and could have incorporated more training. There was no room for growth. Management got fired for allowing unarmed officers to work armed posted.
good,very stressful job  no work life balance whatsoever  the benefits are very good but there is very little room for advancement unless you are one of the management favorites.. high turnover...
good,extremely demanding workloads; don't know anyone who would like to stay long term. Most people only last 2-3 years since management does not value the employees.
good,"Over 22 years BoA went from being a great place to work with great benefits, flexible schedules, great work and life balance.  However in the last 5-6 years, staff has been cut to bare minimum, managers have too many employees reporting to them so there is not much time with role/career development, very little direction, everyone is constantly worried about being laid off (full time employees)."
good,"Responsible for taking deposits and restocking the ATM machines"
good,"Opportunity for quick growth which also leads to a great turn around rate. Management is not always reliable considering such a large corporation, you can easily get lost in the mix"
good,"Company was a great place to work, management was great, leadership was great, workers was friendly and job was in a great location to get to, and good benefits."
good,"It was good with some nice colleagues, good projects and good learning opportunities. IT systems were challenging and good to work with. Parking was also included."
good,still digging out of the recession.  musical chairs on mgt to keep shifting accountability.  reorg to reorg.  good benefits only because of high number of employees.  no opportunities.  only care about getting smaller in workforce.
good,Bank of America really strives for high numbers.  They want to ensure their customers have the right products for their lifestyle.  This is a very mainstream financial institution.
good,Great management team. Great training programs. Good benefits. Outdated building and desks. No room for advancement into management teams. Awesome tuition reimbursement.
good,"There is not a clean indication of the direction for the company from Tech Prospective. Each App team are running in Silos. Their is no Comp time, despite having a 24-7-365 Schedule. There is an unnecessary amount of politics. Some Changes are being made, and their is hints of heading in the right direction, however long that may take."
good,Every since bank of America bought out countrywide it's gone down hill from there.  They dont invest in there management staff and hire management that doesnt know the job but get there jobs from being friends with higher up. Theres little to no training most rhibgs are just thrown on you. They pretty much set you up for failure by placing job requirements on you that are nearly impossible to meet. Write ups have become the b of a way. This used to a great company to work for that cared for and invested in there staff. Not anymore. Its all about numbers and constantly letting u know that your a replacement if your unable to attain the unattainable...
good,"Unfortunately in the location I was placed was not the most favorable to foster job growth. The operations manager operates on a ""like"" strategy opposed to expirianse or skill base."
good,"Growth over the past 9 years has been driven by cost cutting.  Wages have been stagnant, mobility stifled and head count reductions have pummeled morale for those on the front lines."
good,"Great place to work but the Third Party Group is frought with inexperienced leaders, managers and employees. There is alot of nepotism, cronyism, racism and favoritism. Leadership in place ten plus years and just has shuffled the deck with no results to show for it. Senior management needs to take a real hard look and make changes!!"
good,"A typical work day at BOA was always a long work day"
good,"everyone appears to be on an island and people are not always willing to help. the Branch manager was never around and when he was on the office, he stayed in his office"
good,Bank America was enjoyable to work for except for the selling of their products. Your merit increases were tied in to your sale goals. If you didn't make your sale goal you got no increases year after year. Its retail banking not a car or clothing sales where you have to sale products.
good,"They hire and layoff easily, but training is second to non. They will teach you the proper things and give you all the resources required to carry out your job."
good,There are a lot of great things to say about the Bank however they are easily forgotten about when considering their lack of associate development opportunities as well as career advancement opportunities. The environment tends to dwell more on who you know rather than what you do.
good,"Bank of America has great reach, as it's a global company that's deeply integrated into local communities and the global economy. "
good,"Your just a number no matter how long you've been there after  12 years of service I cannot be accommodated,  we are understaffed and continue to be there for time to find a new job after all my years of faithful service"
good,"Sad, benefits/money is great, until they layoff your entire department. BEWARE, management doesn't really want to see anyone advance. They think that all your time including your lunch breaks is for them to fly their executives in and have mini parties where all they do is talk about themselves. They love forcing you have spreads which ultimately make YOU spread. They constantly try to make you feel like nothing exists beyond them. I got sick so often just from the stress alone of working for this corporation. I'm actually GLAD they laid my department off. They also try to force other agendas down your throats that should literally have NOTHING to do with the workplace."
good,"The training could not be more painful, distracting, always going off topic. Management needs to be trained on how to actually manage."
good,"Unfortunately, this company didn't present the Work Life Balance they stated they had. My mother was having extreme medical issues, scariest time of my life, this employer wasn't willing to assist in presenting solutions."
good,"Very friendly staff, nice office good working environment supervisors are very knowledgeable sometimes communication regarding new projects could be better organized"
good,"Bank of America's call center is a place where sit and take inbound calls all day.  I learned that what they stand for is not accurate when your hired.  The pitch they provide at the beginning is wonderful the follow through and expectation are a little unrealistic."
good,BAC is very sales and customer satisfaction company.  We have daily sales goals and metric to achieve for the quarterly sales metrics.
good,"Upper management/leaders need to CAREFULLY review the managers they employ.  I started off with an excellent manager, and because I exceeded my numbers I was moved to a larger branch with a terrible new manager.  My employment was during the time of sever financial distress and many ""bank bailouts"", so perhaps the corporation's management structure has improved. I did enjoy helping people on a daily basis."
good,I worked for only 2 years but it was a good people friendly place. Management didn't have much knowledge to help their employees.
good,"During my 6+ years at Bank of America, I developed an appreciation of research from the client's perspective, something I did not really understand after working solely on the supplier side.  "
good,The day was very fast paced. There were strict demands on the caliber of service we offer but  never enough  time to truly feel best equipped to give that  level of service to our customers.
good,"The organization offers great benefits, however, the budget for ordering office supplies are very limited. The office supplies run out all the time and we have to borrow from other departments."
good,This company would not give me a raise until customer service was actually measured in the company's metric. I was a very dependable employee and because I identified someone that was stealing from the company (he was my supervisor) I ended up losing my job because he framed me. They found out he was stealing shortly after I was fired. Thanks BOA.
good,"Too many changes that were not effective"
good,"Working for BofA just seemed like work. Not enough culture and advancement for your career. However, management was very good in communication."
good,This has been the most stressful and tiresome place of employment.  I have began taking medication for anxiety and depression caused by work stress.  I have coworkers who experience similar situations.
good,Sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell. Customer problems and complaints are what your entire day will consist of as the bank moves farther and farther away from having any concern for customers
good,"The most frustrating part of working at BofA is the lack of leadership.  For the past few years the internal employee reviews have made a point to try and tell management that the employees are not happy with the leadership.  It has gotten so bad that you can literally ask in a meeting for some leadership on a question with both your manager, his senior manager and other managers on the call and none will respond to your question.  Crickets are all you will get."
good,"A 9-6 job. It consisted of administration, supervision and training."
good,The Bank has been in a decline for the last 3.5 years and completes monthly layoffs. No growth opportunities for employees or Managers. They operate top down and do nothing to place long term very knowledgable employees. They have hundreds of openeings yet very little is done to place folks. They advertise how many they re-allociate yet this is a small fraction on how many loose their jobs each and every month.
good,"Zero jobs security working for this BOA, too many drastic change in the compensation plan. The onboard process in this department is horrible."
good,"2000 to 2009 awesome LOU  T  Great Top Boss "
good,"Hardest part of the job was taking 100+ calls, and it is also hard to advance. There is a lot of favoritism. There is diversity throughout the company."
good,"Review and prioritise emails and other messages received after hours and over night."
good,"Management made decision to move much of the process out of NY and into less expensive sites.  Understand cost cutting initiatives; however, the process went into effect prior to all training being in place.  Communication of these changes to our internal and external relationships was poor.  Unfortunately, clients did not know where to call and to whom they should be calling, as most clients went from one point of contact to several."
good,"The Bank is a good place to gather experience, but the pay is not commesurate with experience. The company is working on closing the door to work-at-home opportunities, which negatively impacts associate satisfaction."
good,"This company had a great training program, when ever anything was new or updated we were required to learn it."
good,I didn't want to work part-time.  I had no choice and only 30 minutes for lunch because I was part-time...even when I worked from 7:45 am to 6:00 pm.  Pay was not good and insurance was very expensive.
good,It was to far for me to drive and after the shift change the time of commute tripled.
good,"I love Bank of America as a company itself. The culture and work ethic at the specific call center that I worked at for several years, was extremely poor. The management does not care for employees, they try to compensate you with one hour off the phones for a barbeque treat, instead of giving a raise. I worked at Bank of America again for seven years and received two raises, and my performance always met standards.  I have even had roles as a on the job trainer, but never actually promoted."
good,personal banker - they pay too little for the sales goals and behavrios you are expected to demonstrate. Pay more and maybe you will get more sales...simple
good,collection atmosphere  day to day  calling  customer for mortgage payments on  dialer system
good,Great place Compensation wise.. They just moved the building from Wilmington to Newark Delaware So made my trip a lot longer than it should have
good,"have to give 9 hours of production login"
good,"Love this company, great supervisors, great departments... however due to market i was laid off, wished i could of stayed longer"
good,"working for Bank of America has been adventurous, lay offs have started and the atmosphere is unpleasant"
good,Compensation is good but they have slashed benefits to a point that they are laughable.  They constantly speak of career advancement but rarely display any desire to allow associates to move to higher positions or even lateral positions if they are valuable in their current roles.  It seems they also took advantage of the bad job market knowing they could take their employees for granted because they couldn't leave.  This has lead to very poor morale across every line of business and can be seen by the mass defections now that the job market has improved.
good,It was a great place to work. I'm just more about customer service vs sales.
good,"It's ok. Overworked, no work/life balance."
good,Bank of America is what is considered a stepping stone job. It's a place to learn the ropes of being an employee and eventually move on.
good,The environment is not secure and the people are overworked.
good,A small organization that faces many challenges from larger competitors.  The people are hard working.
good,"ok pay , but stressful! It can be difficult to juggle the schedule with family life."
good,"Typical day at work was on the phone most of the time trying to get customers to open accounts."
good,Call center environment. Customer service based. Required to answer between 50-100 calls.
good,"A typical day is underwriting conventional mortgage loans. My manager was understanding and knowledgeable and my coworkers were all great people to work with. The hardest part of the job was not enough hours in a day to complete the task at hand, but I definitely tried my best."
good,"I worked as a contractor there for two in a half years, and in the time I was there I learned how to lead and help people with their problems. along with good communication skills."
good,Always grasping for the best market and finding properties.
good,This is a place to get a paycheck. Not to many chances to really grow. Management seems very unorganized and they do not offer support to the associates.
good,reviewed file and documents for underwriting and pulled credit report investors delegation stacked file to be sent to underwriting had 300 plus files in my pipeline declined loan if didn't meet requirements
good,Just to have income. the environment was different. being a contractor felt like an outcast..   Could have meeting and activities with the permanent employees stated due to contract.
good,"B of A was a wonderful place to work until the ""merger"" with Nation's Bank. The culture changed from ""value the customer"" to ""give them not anymore than is required, because there is a cost for exceptional customer service""."
good,Fast changing environment with significant opportunity to be challenged.
good,"very good about job advancement, but every branch you walk into to work in the manager's were always harsh."
good,Overall I learned a lot at BOA. They have a lot of great employees.
good,"Not a good place to work. At DART, not all are equal. Salaries of some employees never increase by much. Little advancement for minorities."
good,"Very corporate workplace environment, but management usually doesn't live up to the lofty expectations they impose on employees.  Company is really downsizing and cutting costs.  A young / entry-level person might have a good chance of getting hired."
good,"My team members, my manager all are good and co-operative. This co is a good to work with. Night shift is a pain. Else, everything is average."
good,This place is awful and would recommend anyone and everyone to stay away. They cheat the cutomers especially those who are unable to understand english. Very intense enviroment in the banking centers.
good,"I spent 13 years at Bank of America. I was in the same role because any positions that are posted already have people in mind or the positions are not posted at all and individuals are just moved into those slots. Management turnover is excessive, in 13 years, I reported to approximately 15 managers. Did not feel comfortable expressing my opinion, fear of consequences."
good,"Process files, ability to meet deadlines, adjust to work flow due to changes in volume"
good,Limited opportunity to grow within the company. Not much more to say.
good,Current restructuring program not transparent and all levels of employees have limited job security.
good,can improve with consistency of policies and better treatment and pay
good,"love my coworkers, job is harder since we have moved to the mortgage industry....."
good,Your store is your home take care of it...
good,At first it was great than after a few months I notice how unhappy and stressed out everyone was. Scheduling was non existent and there was a lack of leadership.
good,"Worked on a contractual basis and was treated like dirt! Weekly meetings consisted of team review followed by a pep talk from management. Pep talk consisted of manager stating ""work harder and we MIGHT hire you."" Literally, these clowns would hire people and fire them with TOTAL disregard to work ethic; it was more about brown nosing and fitting into the buddy system. Also, the company as a whole is not financially sound and that definitely trickled down through the top-down management style system. I would not recommend this company to any one on a contractual basis, and you should consider other options with regard to full-time work."
good,"Prepared loan closing documents, analyzed all documentation for accuracy and potential problems. Established database files for loan management, completed mortgage quality control re-verifications, reviewed closed loan data, prepared verification letters and reviewed responses."
good,"you will be stressed out :-), and you will be constantly upset! they do not treat you like adults. might as well as for a pass to the restroom"
good,"Servicing delinquencies, foreclosures and Investor accounting on government and military loans"
good,the managers there does not care about their employees at all. This bank is all about the money and firing employees constantly. The pay is not that great for the horrible treatment
good,"Management needs to be more proactive with their team so that everyone is on the same page working together. Company could be less Cold to employees and more flexible, family oriented."
good,I worked for bank of america for 3 yrs 10 yrs ago.. horrible call center and very low pay I wouldn't recommend working there. Everyone I working with has also moved to other companies
good,"Great compensation in exchange for your soul. No work/life balance, super micro managed, not worth the time. No stability. Customers and banking centers both treat you horribly, along with management no matter how great you perform."
good,"Unpleasant reporting line and work life balance."
good,"Bank of America is a solid company, but they tend to treat their employees like assets instead of people. Diminishing benefits every year despite record revenue."
good,"Although I worked there for many years, I would not return or recommend working there. I was there before, during and after the 2008 economic/sub prime mortgage crisis, it was pretty bad and the company moral never returned to normal."
good,"The data entry was great for a person who loves data entry - me. The turnover was daily. The job was on the Temp Service job board constantly for years.  Once, I took the leap and applied, I realized why it's always on the job board.  Most people do not last for two weeks. Although the training is great because it's done by one person so everyone is taught the same thing,  instead of being done by individual permanent employees who train according to how they feel or how they feel about the trainee.  The schedule was goof for me because I have no children.  Those with children found it difficult because each day's schedule was different. The environment was harsh, critical and mentally abusive.  The permanent employees disliked all temps because apparently temps were paid more than the permanent employees.  The permanent employees were encourage to and enjoyed harsh treatment and purposely targeting each temp to run each temp off the job.  The permanent employees usually won.  They naively wondered why that particular office always had the worse weekly and monthly scores of all the BOA data entry offices.  I refused to be bullied out of there and lasted 9 months, which was a feat in itself. When I began to lose my hair over mistreatment, I left. I was proud of myself for lasting 9 months, but it wasn't worth losing my hair over the stress of not giving in sooner."
good,"High producers get promoted to management which means they do not have any management training. They care about making their goals and not much for their direct reports. Training for support staff is all online and little one on one help for new trainees. "
good,"Bank of America is a set up, They are quickly closing centers and eliminating job opportunities. Alot of employees dont know where they will place these workers until last sec to closing."
good,The Merrill Lynch program is disappointing to say the least. They confine you to cold-calling and management oversight by salesforce. When you don't hit your asset hurdles they push you out. It is hard to move to other divisions of the company.
good,Being an asset to the company is only base on how much money you earn the company.Which is the only time you're recognized. They could not care less about working single parents.
good,"My experience was in retail banking over 20 years.  Around 2010 associate satisfaction was in steep decline.  Economy was already bad then our pensions were frozen and health premiums significantly increased for those making between 50k-150k. Commission compensation was reduced by half annually for 4 years while sales goals increased.  However,  in the past 3 years they have made an effort to offer a reasonable living wage ($20min) as well as ensure they retain top talent via higher base compensation coupled with the menial commission compensation. Technology is a big issue.  While their customer tools like the APP and OLB are amazing, the internal infrastructure is a maze of old and new systems for an employee to navigate.  There is a lack of systemic cohesiveness throughout the bank.  You can call the same dept twice, ask the same question of 2 associates and get 2 entirely different answers to the same question. Frustrating.  One of the best parts of Bank of America though, is their way of giving back to the community and also the associates in time of need.  They take volunteering very seriously and have countless hours recorded in every single community across the US.  They also offer employee financial relief in times of duress such as house fires or hurricanes.   Among other things."
good,I believe you can thrive in any environment as long as you're focused. Staying committed to the task at hand was always my focus and making necessary adjustments where needed.
good,no room for advancement unless you are their favorite not based on who actually can do the job more efficiently. It's based on friendships and this is a business.
good,"The  Mortgage and Home Loan division at the location in San Jose were completely laid off. No one was given an opportunity to stay onboard and move somewhere else within the company. We were constantly praised for our great service and being one of the best platinum home loan divisions that the company had and we were all let go due to the fact that Bank of America would rather have campuses that small office buildings... That is what was explained to us when we were laid off right before thanksgiving and permitted to work through christmas so we could make ends meet. "
good,"I worked for Bank of America when it was MBNA.  Generally speaking the company has ethics and values however it fell down because of some of the terrible managers and bullying in the workplace."
good,it was ok. if management helped out . Busy during holiday time. Great employer. If your friends with manager you get out of a lot of work. No training.
good,"Assist with website inquiries, provided customer support in all aspects of on-line banking, and limited account assistance. Achieved incentive bonuses based on high quality performance."
good,Who you knew got you where you wanted to go.  It provided a paycheck when i needed it.  I wish I had more opportunities but I wasn't on the 'in' crowd.
good,"the overall company is ok to work for, the claims manager that I worked for was another question. the guidelines were fluid depending on the weather it seemed.  and actual assistance for the customer was not provided consistently as job knowledge was not a focus."
good,"Witnessed first hand how management was helping their own family members and friends by promoting them to permanent or higher positions, allowing them to put down more hours of work on their time sheets in order to receive a bigger paycheck."
good,"Temps in the Merrill Edge distribution department are brought on, then being hired on depends on which manager you're assigned, seemingly not based on metrics."
good,This was a great company always trying to help advance.  Many people were new and many were laid off due to a change in the future.  Had various company perks
good,"If you are going into a sales role, watch out. Sales pressure is insane and the bonuses you get from reaching those goals are very minimal. You need to be a top 5% performer to make any real money out of it."
good,"micro management ,fast culture, decent pay, no overtime, everything os controlled no freedom, was able to kearn many of the financial behind the scenes on how credit is checked how the increase the credit card is processed, I enjoyed hearing my calls payed back with awesome ratings."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Your ethics will be tested when it comes to their practices for attaining business and attached targets. working with the right manager is essential, employees don't leave bad jobs, they leave bad bosses."
good,"Work with federal staff to identify, prioritize, and resource new development and maintenance projects and oversee the complete  Software Development Life Cycle and project management activities."
good,"Being the only teller is very stressful at times. However, you learn a lot about home loans, balance transfers, and other day to day financial services that banks have to offer."
good,FA's routinely can say and do as they please. If you are in operations you are looked at as the lowest of the low. CA's get some respect but are overworked and underappreciated. Benefits are decent. Free parking.
good,"Center went from having 6 employees capable of performing transactions including 1 manager, 1 relationship manager, 2 part time tellers, and 2 full time tellers, to having only 1 staffed teller, utilizing the manager only as lobby leader (other than for lunch break), and not training the new relationship manager in teller transactions in a matter of a year and a half. Explaining to management that it's difficult to keep up and have no mistakes because we were in the middle of a busy downtown area, the response was ""These are the new changes. It is what it is. Direct people to the convenient banking options"""
good,"The company has ""versions"" of itself in many areas of the country which function as if in compartments, implementing practices and areas of focus in a non uniform manner.  When actions don't always reflect company communication it is confusing to associates.  "
good,"All in all, BofA is a good company to work for.  "
good,I loved my job but alot of things went on that I did not want to be associated with so I moved on.  I advanced as  a lead for them but management was not very helpful in a lot of areas for the employees and had no empathy in business or personal affairs.
good,Not very good management and too much preferences on to whom they should help on their career. Very unfair on the sales side all referred customers always are headed to the banker with higher sales goal.
good,"The enjoyable part of my career at many Mortgage companies was  being able to advise people to make a good decision for one of the most expensive purchases of their life."
good,"The people were great. The benefits were good. Nice employee rates on accounts. Lots of training provided upfront and throughout. The job is soul sucking. Dealing with angry people who yell and swear at you all day, selling things to those who are in financial hardship/ old/ sick/ unfortunate is not my idea of rewarding work. Went to work for a nonprofit instead."
good,"Bank of America is a who you know kind of job. The management depends on every branch but the branch I worked for had poor management. The employees were over worked and consistently told they were replaceable if they did meet bank quotas. Very stressful, very competitive job with great benefits."
good,I was at Bank of America for two years. I worked my way up from a part-time teller to personal banker. It was not a good time to be a banker and had a lot of angry clients.
good,"Great benefits, honestly some of the most competitive around. Unfortunately, the claim to support change and ""honest feedback"" does not exist. Asking questions is highly frowned upon, but they don't tell you this, until they ""let you go"". Process improvement is not a priority at all. Equal treatment and scoring of metrics is also non-existent, this is based on your friends and who you are lucky enough to have as a manager. There are really wonderful departments in this company, however document execution is not one of them."
good,"Definitely it was an experience with a lot of stories, but overall I enjoyed been there and I'm appreciative of being part of this call center. Also it important to mention that the great thing is that when they are busy you can work as much as you can the bad thing is that when they are slow they will send you home."
good,Process and control account collections and receivable in a timely manner.
good,"Not a bad company to work for. A lot oros and a lot of cons, very indifferent to Bank of America. However, I am ready to move on to a new company. I am thankful for the experience."
good,Few opportunities provided to minorties in Wealth Information Management.  Mgmt. is very selective regarding employees that will be placed in branches
good,Job was typical call center but if you couldn't save them money each month and not file claims it affected your stats and could not be adjusted. Stats were at times hard to achieve.
good,"Or whatever they refer to themselves as. Very few have any interest in their employees, only looking to exceed whatever metric or widget is in fashion for that week. Sales pressure is as passive aggressive as their ""action plans"". Middle and upper management are, seemingly oblivious to the changes in the industry, even though the data is readily available. Its a shame, they pay their bankers and tellers pretty well."
good,The cultural gap between Merrill Lynch and Bank of America will only be repaired with the company decides what brand they want to be.  The Merrill Lynch advisors forgot who bought whom in 2008
good,"They keep changing rules all the time with, management team made the goal is not realistic and they won't back you up. All they want the the number is good , looks beautiful. Once you hit the goal, they will make you another higher goal."
good,Unfortunately I did not have a good manager and they basically ran me out because I wanted to leave that particular banking center. All the other banking centers and departments were great.
good,Merrill Lynch has been around for a long time. They have been able to adapt to changing times and remain standing. They are doing something right. It is a highly competitive environment that seeks a particular kind of person.
good,During my 8 years with the company i saw a lot of changes and also learned a lot of new skills in the many areas that were available to me. It was because of this that myself and my team were able to achieve a World Customer Experience award for our skills.
good,"good place to work, good work culture, only thing to worry is the management and also the growth is very minimal along with hike. Food is free have rs 1300 sodexo coupon per month and free transport."
good,"Large company with good benefits and many career opportunities, but they tend to set very high production standards and over-manage everyone. It can be a good place to work, but it can be stressful and it's not for everyone."
good,"Being in a selling position at Bank of America is difficult. They are a very goal driven company which is great. However, they have become so cautious and reserved in the sales practices that it is impossible to reach goals. They wan't you to hit these high sales numbers while not being able to make an actual sales call to a client. The branch environment is constantly understaffed. The biggest complaint we get from clients is about wait time. Bank of America's solution to this is to drive an appointment culture. Which can be great unless your debit card gets stolen and you need a temporary.  Well if you want it today (most branches don't allow same day appointments) be prepared to wait for an hour or more at many locations."
good,"There was not enough training given. "
good,It works for people that are corporate minded and stay to themselves.  Don't expect to make friends here as they do not give you enough time to talk to a co worker let alone befriend them.
good,"The lock box was a complete collaboration of all employees working together to get the job done. Regardless of your shift, everyone was ready to do the job at hand."
good,"Salary was low for the scope of work that was required. Benefits and 401k were pretty good and have no complaints. They do offer competitive benefits. The next person experience may be totally different. Many people have done well there and people have left. As I stated, you know if you belong."
good,If you’ve never suffered from anxiety and depression and anger problems working here will definitely will introduce you to some new experiences! They dont take mental health into consideration at all! And dont even get me started with their condescending & know it all managers!
good,"Very fast pace environment... Great team, but stressful. Typical days are of about 10 hours, sometimes you need to work on weekends and evening too. No work-life balance."
good,Management was helpful with training. Lots of incentives for employees. Great benefits with medical and dental insurance. Very employee oriented and managed.
good,"The departments I worked in managed by intimidation.  Career advancement was difficult, with most jobs being filled before they were ever posted on the job portal.  I did enjoy the opportunity to learn new technologies and how to apply those technologies to new situations."
good,"It was a Data Center. "
good,The hours were sporadic at times.  Very demanding as I was the only one that worked my process. People are nice but the job demands can become strenuous.
good,company is top heavy with average managers. Differcult to break out of entry level jobs to enter management program. They talk a good game but In the end it is all about the stockholders. They are the driving force of the company.
good,"BOA has great benefits. They advertise work/life balance, but is not always so.  Depends on the department you work within. Job Seeker beware:  BOA is big on laying off your position and re-posting your job and hiring someone else to do your job and you will have to train that person.  Pay is comparable to other banks.  There is a good cultural balance."
good,"Typical to the investment banking world in 2005-2009 and not just BoA, the job had no work/life balance, making the culture somewhat toxic. The Great Recession was the best thing that happen to me professionally."
good,Divisions of the company are inefficient and poorly structured. The company limits and only provides illusion of work life balance and support. The company is focused on increased diversity but limits training capabilities to provide an adequate opportunity to be truly successful.
good,"The managers are always watching their back and angry with very political fiefdoms. The company as a whole is good, but local management is horrible, ruining the company's reputation."
good,I worked here as a temp. I am not sure that my review is going to make any difference as a result. My experiences as a temp cannot be compared to a permanent employee.
good,"I spent as much time tracking and reporting the status of multiple procedures as I did developing them."
good,Ive been here for 12 years  and I love the company but the lay off scares and the mandatory transfers to keep a job due to jobs moving or downsizing is an issue.
good,"ok place to work. High sales pressure job, I enjoyed my colleagues the most. Bonus was discretionary tied to sales results. many metrics and tremendous compliance related items that were required to keep up with the role."
good,Working schedules vary frequently. Daily working hours extended to 16 hours.Extremely sedentary work. Positive aspect learned on how to assist customers with a financial hardship.
good,"This was a highly competitive work environment which challenged my skills in a positive way.  I learned the art of diplomacy, tact and negotiation during my tenure there."
good,The bank is a great place to work and it is difficult to understand the methods of reaching the goals laid out by the manager. Hiring a new manager to take over tasks led to unprecedented delays thus endangering the IT infrastructure practices to streamline operations.
good,Growth opportunity is extremely limited. There is a very high turnover in the department. The management is not interested in keeping and developing a permanent employee talent. Employees are not valued.
good,"As it was my first organisation, it has give me my bread and butter, so as much as I am thank ful for it. It is a place which will help freshers to learn about corporate culuter, helps in multitasking, taking ownership etc. I have learnt a lot of things. The management  was ok. The most important thing for me was my job, taking chats, assisting customers. Which I had loved to core."
good,I was only interning there for 6 months and I did not like my internship. I was supporting a Private Banker and there was a mismatch in characters which did not help me to enjoy my internship. The tasks were also quite boring and I had a very low salary.
good,"*Enjoyed my trainer. Enjoyed learning data entry. Staff was ok. "
good,"Most people that have worked for BofA will tell you that it's good until they move your department to another state - which they do a LOT. Although, it can be a great place to work if you don't get laid off. (I've known people to be laid off and re-hired 3-4 times)"
good,There  is no work balance and the company only cares about the bottom line. You are a number and that how you are going to feel
good,"Advancement requires to ""mentorship"" of a  current manager and if you are not accepted as a ""future leader"" there is no possibilty of any advancement within the company"
good,More team building training is needed. My experience with job was long but beneficial.  I received great training which brought me to where I am now.
good,"The compensation and benefits package was at par with industry standards, and the training program was stellar. However, when actually going into the role, the job was more of that of a salesperson than an actual relationship manager. In addition, the management style was very aggressive and cut-throat. It was definitely an unsavory experience."
good,There have been layoffs every quarter for approximately 16 quarters in a row. B of A has very little appreciation for experienced employees and drive this point home with both constant layoffs and mediocre (at best) compensation.
good,Work to life balance is incredibly tilted to the work side. Incredible benefits and sub par training program. The training program is completely through computers. The retail locations are staffing less and less employees making it hard to have any balance to your life.
good,"Internship was okay, decent money, but there was no direction from management. The people were great, just not a developed internship program."
good,An average Data analyst position. I appreciate the employee networks. The company should engage associates a lot better. Compensation could be higher but the benefits are like no other.
good,"The job itself is wonderful, but management states that you have your own business and that you are autonomous. Then every decision you make gets put under a microscope."
good,This place has the potential to really payout a great salary but management isnt very approachable. The morale is pretty low because of the lack of leadership
good,"Management at branch offices are unprofessional, job duties are vague, expectations of jobs are vague. Everyone has a save myself attitude. Training via video and virtual web sessions is sub-standard and does not adequately prepare employees for their jobs. Management will not help new hires with in's and out's of their jobs.Job expectations and specific job duties are vague and/or not revealed. Witnessed management falsifying information given to upper management, also is a culture where management is inconsistent regarding company policy among different individuals (favoritism runs rampant)."
good,A typical day at work is productive and I spend a lot of time with processes on how to handle documentation . Migrating third party vendors to the HVD seat and managing the different clients and becoming the SME on how to communicate information to the vendors
good,"BOA's lockbox department isn't what it used to be. With the constant shuffling around of new hire managers that have no clue with actual operations are, its like a sinking ship."
good,"Working at Bank of America really varies from department to department and will mostly depend on how good your manager is - with that said, little is done to weed out bad managers so if you happen to get one that is generally terrible the only solution will be to post to another department. Good news: posting is easy and encouraged so you can broaden your understanding of the Bank - Bad new: you can't post until you've been in a position for a year."
good,"Work hard and continue to push numbers at my current position. Bank of America is the toughest company that I have ever worked for. The way they structure the goals makes it difficult to achieve success for most sales people. However if you work hard like I do and remain focus, you can exceed your goals consistently."
good,"Difficult place to work, it seems like managers have a culture of favoritism. Also, there is lack of proper training for employees."
good,"Typical work day consisted of answering 60-80 per day. I learned about the many levels and procedures of banking, and money management. Management was great for the exception of very few, but some manager are really great to work with, and will assist you in  the best way they can. My co-workers where great, I built long lasting friendships with them, considering you are spending eight hours a day with them. The hardest part of the job perhaps was not having a flexibility in the schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job, was working for a company that would increase the chances of a highly compatible resume."
good,"Please Google ""the red bead experiment."" It is a great metaphor for the work culture you will experience working for Bank of America. The work culture discourages offering new ideas, solutions, or challenging existing processes and procedures due to how challenging it is to make  a small change. There are several levels of review and approval that must be met before a change can take place."
good,"The job experience was fine. The job is very cliquish and the compensation is inadequate. The culture is relaxed, but simmering beneath is an atmosphere where there is a lack of communication."
good,"wonderful place to work. great benefits, productive workplace and full of opportunities. advancement in career opportunities. family oriented culture and dirverse"
good,Good company to build work ethic. Definitely a place that requires attention to details and quality customer service. They trained me to do tasks the hard way by learning through mistakes. Which helped me to use my logic and creativity to make better solutions and enhance efficiency. If you do work for the company be ready to relocate and work really hard to impress your manager. A con would be how short staffed we were and how I would take on 3 different tasks at a time. Which only made me stronger.
good,"All they care about is your numbers, they push to sell sell sell even if the customer does not need or want what the company is currently offering. I am happy I left before it got worse."
good,"I worked there for 10 years and I have nothing to show for it."
good,This job was a temporary job. I was hired through a temp agency and worked there for 11 months and my contract ended right before my 1 year mark.
good,Management is what makes the work environment be good or bad. Cannot listen to music even if you're in a back office position. Would be a better environment if micro-managing wasn't encouraged. Bad politics and red tape. Barely any advancement opportunity. 1 in a Million chance to get to advance within the company. The best part of coming to work are the close friends that you make and form relationships with.
good,This was only a part time job after graduating college and helped me with customer service skills.  Very hard to promote and lots of red tape since such a large company.
good,"Productive work place. Good place to start for work experience, and perhaps to start a career.Its very busy if you are in a branch."
good,"BOA in the most basic of positions, a teller, puts you in a position of having to drive sales for the banking center while not reaping any benefits of doing so. In order to reap any benefits, you have to be in a Personal Banker position, and unless you already have that experience, it's difficult to advance from a teller upwards in BOA. Things with BOA are changing constantly in terms of roles, sales drivers, and compliance. The pay in comparison to other banks is on the low end of the scale. This is another negative I didn't realize until I was hired on and watched other tellers leave for higher paying positions elsewhere. They left due to the yearly and quarterly reviews being based on sales, and unless you met that, you got the minimum raise of 1.99%."
good,Not a great place for advancement. I think that starting you should go somewhere for growth and advancement. find somewhere else to go.
good,"Bank of america has great benefits, however you have to sell your soul for them. Management has so much pressured passed down from executive levels."
good,"A typical day at Bank of America consisted of building relationships with my customers, understanding their financial needs and recommending products to make their financial lives easier.  I learned plenty from Bank of America that not only could help others but things I could use for my personal life.  In addition, I learned about the mortgage industry, small business industry, budgeting and saving, debt consolidation and ways to make your money grow for you.  The information learned and obtained from Bank of America can easily be used in my future career paths.  The hardest part of my job was the pressures of sales, however it provided me a sense of satisfaction knowing I was providing my customers with products that could save them a substantial amount of money while meeting all of their financial needs.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interactions with my customers, getting to know a lot of them on a personal level and getting them to trust me as their personal banker."
good,"Lunch should be free, but it is not at BoA. Also the facilities are nice but the work is demanding and underpaid especially if you are a contractor."
good,Things change frequently. Hard to move to a different department. Manager young and inexperienced. most enjoyable part of the job is going home at the end of your shift.
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,Very busy environment and high customer traffic. Very hard to concentrate with lack off staff. Very hard to have a personal life. Management does best to help out.
good,I had various experiences with this employer and how good or bad they were mostly depended on the quality of my manager.  I had some very good managers who made it pleasant to work there and some horrible managers who did the opposite.
good,"Good job for someone coming out of college, a good stepping stone.    However, there is no growth, poor pay, micro-managed.  Seem to lack in technology verse competitors and do not listen to clients requests for better improvements."
good,"Didn't Matter where you moved in the company you were always learning something new. always working long hours, but was happy to do whatever it took to get the job done!"
good,"We were promoted but the pay remained the same due to a freeze and they were not able to hire more people for collections, so they promoted within. Without the difference in pay, they also took bonuses away."
good,A lot of time on the phone with FAs. Enjoyed the team and coworkers.
good,"Responsible for performing due diligence on small business loans. Processing daily workflow to include ordering third party reports, reviewing title insurance commitments and preparing closing packages along with many other tasks. Provide loan status updates to Business Development Officer (BDO) and quality service to both internal and external customers."
good,My work experience with prior employer were pros and cons; provided insight into overall challenges to a changing job culture.  The hardest part of a job is not affording the opportunity to demonstrate or utilize skills obtained.  I enjoyed working with co-workers and worked as a team player.
good,"Good organisation"
good,"a great place to work , the people are amazing caring people. the best time is when you enjoy each moment."
good,Must be able to work with little to no direction. Have a large pipeline of over 30-60 loans. Company has a very high expection of loans closing so be prepared to work lots of overtime Monday through Sunday.
good,I learned some valuable tools while working for BOA.  Management could have been better schooled on being a Manager.
good,If you are not liked by the management and don't know how to suck up this can be a really challenging place for you. The pay is alright and the benefits are great but sadly the management is very demanding and cut throat. They care nothing about you as an individual and everyone to them is expendable. The people who come in are varied some very nice to some very mean. If you can bite the bullet and try to move out of the branch to the corporate division it sounds like a much better job but it takes a long time. Hours are always different and sometimes you won't get the hours you want or need. There is a serious lack of training to prepare you for anything and everything on the job.
good,"I was part of the leadership team and witnessed corruption, inappropriate behavior, and a lack of leadership from some Sr. Managers (CMM and OPS manager) and the branch manager I worked for.  CMM was a poor leader and communicator, even though she used to be a branch manager.  Operations manager talked down to staff like they were stupid and beneath her.  Sr. Management really needs to spend more time in the branches and speak with the staff to understand what the real issues are and put an action plan in place to correct these issues, instead of primarily focusing on sales, sales, sales.  Specifically, the branch manager I worked for spent too much time gossiping and contributing to the negativity and lack of professionalism in the workplace.  There is an obvious disconnect between Sr. Managers and branch managers.  Too much time spent on meetings trying to get more sales, when there should be more time spent on working on developing staff on their soft skills and creating a more positive work environment.  Finally, Sr. Management should reassess the management staff they have in place, because there are many branch managers that should NOT be in management, because they do not have the knowledge or the necessary leadership skills to run a banking center or manage staff."
good,"In general, bank of america is a good place to work. Being in collections, there is no growth and unstable future."
good,"Good place to learn about the Financial industry. Making goals, and numbers is the best way to move forward."
good,"Very disorganized management in being honest about our job security. We are not giving any more opportunity at work. A Vice President of the company tells you one thing and then when you discuss it further denies and  says I don't remember it later, he never forgets anything else in discussions. The trust factor with your coworkers is excellent but when Senior Vice Presidents tell people your job is safe and 4 months later they are laid off it is frustrating. We are  at 150 employees out of 1500, 2 years ago. That is hardest part of job, distrust of senior management. The most enjoyable part is my coworkers, we are a Team and make everything work."
good,"I stayed with BOA because of the wages and daycare reimbursement, but other than that the management was the worst group of people ever hired.  They have favorites and harassed everyone else.  They had people in charge that didn't know how to do their position and couldn't help out their team when needed.  They were arrogant and didn't teach you much.  The only way to stay above water with that position is to find someone that knew what they were doing and have them show you the way if they had time or you would make enough mistakes to figure it our yourself."
good,The culture of the call center was quite friendly and inviting. The people were very friendly and helpful.
good,"I worked in the foreclosure department and my responsibilities centered around the protection and maintenance of properties that were foreclosed on.  If citations were issued against the property then it was my job to order work to clear the citation.  If the property was unsecured it was my job to order the work to get it secured and so on.  My job description changed many times and I moved to different departments and different desks many times in the almost 3 years.  I did grass cuts, conventional loans and FHA loans and then property management and then moved up to checking other employee's work orders and other departments work."
good,Very fast pace work environment. Great co-workers. It was a  seasonal position.
good,"opportunity of move up, tea benefits, a lot of different types of positions"
good,Bank of America is a great entry level position to help boost your resume. No room for job growth or advancement opportunities. Work can be redundant.
good,"Interesting learning experience"
good,"I'm a hard worker, it's my nature. I grew within the culture of this company and when I was really ready to further myself and move up and take on new challenges I was held back and..taken advantage of, Given tasks that were completely outside my role and the tasks and work they had me doing just kept piling up. It's a two way road, you need more from me? I need more from you. I'm grateful for there teachings but the turnover and my personal experience has twisted my view."
good,"no free work env,"
good,No matter how hard you may work they always want more. The pay is not commensurate with the job duties.
good,Bank of America taught me alot about banking. There is plenty of room for growth and great benefits.
good,"Frequent Reorganization and Job Displacement"
good,Company was great when first started and really focused on personal advancement. As management changed more focus began on increasing numbers while decreasing employee satisfaction. Very unmoral and bias company.
good,"Typical Day"
good,Funding and preparation of loans for closing/post closing on average of 3-5 loans daily. Worked in a team setting which is optimal in today's corporate culture. The management team which i work work seldom showed the leadership which i look for in a management team. The high turnover of unit & site leaders created a sense of unrest amongst .The most enjoyable part of this job for me was calling a borrower to advise them that their loan has been funded and reviewing their terms so they could understand what they would be saving over the course of loan with new payment & rate.
good,I was there for 10 years 5 months. Co-workers were great.  There was advancement available before site closed.
good,Co-workers are great. As long as you work hard you should be fine.
good,"•	Accountable for initiating, pursing, and ensuring prompt recovery of all monies owed to the organization, by correspondence and direct telephone contact with customer/member, by using professional knowledge of collections, procedural and/or legal guidelines."
good,"Bank of America is unorganized , working for BOA reminds me of working for a staffing company with benefits no more no less."
good,"A typical day is to focus on sales. Every encounter with a client must produce a product - to feed into various goals. Sales are crucial to attaining your job. Have been with the company for 16 years, in this current position for 7 years."
good,I have worked with many amazing individuals who have formed a great group atmosphere. It has been my pleasure to work and grow with this company. 
good,I learned a lot about banking and great customer service and leadership skills but I've been employed here for almost seven years and have nothing to show for it as I have done everything to show I can handle the next role and I'm still a teller. Do yourself a favor and run...far away!
good,Call center environment and the hours are long. Most members of management cared about employees.
good,I was let go after many years of working for them.  They make their money by how many calls the call center reps can take.  They don't care about the customer only the money they make.  After you are there for awhile they let you go because they can hire younger people to take your place for less money.  Don't go up the corporate ladder to fast because they will replace you.  Don't kid yourself...the banks are all about how much money they can make.  If a customer takes too much time on the phone the rep will either disconnect the call they say by accident or they will transfer the customer to another area of the bank.  It is all about making incentive and getting the customer off the phone in 3-5 minutes or less.
good,"Saying an organization is to big does not begin to explain the difficulty in working projects here. There are many first class PMs, but LEAN functionality is a challenge."
good,"Collections is always a difficult place, However the inside culture made the experience a terrible one. With little room for advancement and a less than helpful management makes even the shortest shifts feel like a soul draining experience"
good,"I get on the phones at 6 am and stay on until 3 pm, provided an hour lunch in the middle of my shift."
good,Bank of America is an evil bank who doesn't care about the little people. They offered a decent job but all the employees felt like their souls were being stolen because they screw their customers over.
good,I enjoyed working here. The environment is nice and so are the people.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is that there is a lot of fun,working environment is very nice"
good,"Overall I enjoyed working there due to the experience that I did receive, but speaking to the homeowners about payments before the grace period is very stressful due to the payments are not due yet and we are constantly calling them the hardest part of the job was when we had to contact customers but they made their payments and they were misapplied. Things were just so unorganized and once we heard about layoffs we asked would we be affected and they reaasurred that we would be okay but in the end I and a few other employees were laid off."
good," Responsible for the workout, collection, restructuring of 200 bank funded loans monthly."
good,Very corporate enviornment. Extreme micro management. Oveetime available. Friendly coworkers.
good,DISYS was one of the better temporary agencies I have worked for. Bank of America was a laid back office environment. I enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was major amounts of data entry each day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met and learned from while I was employed there.
good,"Good environment, and very good group made a lots of difference."
good,"Good environment, and very good group mad a lots of difference."
good,"The only thing I'll say is this, without any real soldified policies and procedures in place leaves room and allows for grave risk and the potential to have your department outsourced is always an issue to deal with daily."
good,The is like any other fast paced company. Peers are for the most part eager to assist and friendly. Management could be a little more approachable. There could be more emphasis to take care of current employees than new hires. More or less there is a need for more consistentcy
good,My postion at Bac was very challenging and exciting. The hardest part of the job was trying to assist fraud and foclosure victims dailly.
good,A typical day at work consists of a morning of logging into multiple systems to get my day started. Opening up my database to what items need to be addressed first and creating a plan to tackle and clear said items. My coworkers are definitely a major part of making my work day fun. We are all extremely close. I think a major part of that is due management not knowing how to manage so it kind of forces the employees to stick together. The hardest part of my job would have to be the fact that I have to depend other business partners to be on top of their game so that I can be on top of mine. It gets frustrating when they aren't holding up their end of the bargain. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I can work at my own pace. I'm independent to get my work done without a lot of interruptions.
good,The work requirement was straight forward and required that you stay current with the changes which happened every week. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and the few contest that were well organized. The co-workers are a well of support and encouragement but management was unsupportive and often did not support the emotional situations for associates if they arouse.
good,"My experience with Bank of America was a good one for the most part. I had a lot of fun and learned a lot about work and myself. The bank loves self motivated people, and people who love to be friendly and honest. My experience got tainted a bit by the fact that I had approximately 8 managers within a one years time frame inside the banking center. It didn't lead to a cohesive unit and left me feeling discombobulated. I continued to do my job, but with all the changes that kept happening, it became a bit difficult to do your job."
good,They mean well but they are looking for cogs in a wheel. Feels very much like i work in an assembly line.
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful, everyday we never have enough tellers scheduled to service the customers. I'm being a teller, a teller supervisor and do I have to do some of the assistant manager's work that is delegated to me while I'm trying to get my job done in a timely manner. Management delegates more and more of their work to me making the work load for me unrealistic and extremely overwhelming."
good,"Overall I enjoyed the people I worked with. My team was able to get things done and be very successful. The management and corporate management, however, were very micromanaging and made it hard to get things done when they showed up from corporate."
good,"When I started with BOA, I enjoyed it. I worked for 11 yrs and in three different areas of the bank: telephone banking, online banking, and e-mail services. In each area I assisted customers with stop payment, address changes, copies of statements or checks, account information such as fees."
good,"brutal job, but its all about what you make it. really helps if you have a good manager."
good,This company have good benefits but when it come to take of for vacation or sick days its hard to get them. They have to approve the time even though you have the hours in the system.
good,"Customer service/sales/team leader representative. Take calls, provide service for the customer with any issues, and provide a sale from the service. Work with team of 18 individuals in absence of manager. Report log of team performance goals achieved to goals expected. Average sales per day 6-12 products. Average cash amounts per day $50k-$120k"
good,"I currently work for b of a. I was initially acquired thru a job merger. Now Im in lockbox which has no room for growth. I inquired about returning to the retail side and was told that although I have many years of working in a branch as a senior teller but because it was not with b of a, it wld be very hard for me to return as a banker and there are no full time teller positions only part time. The bank that I was initially w/before the merger had an actual training class that you had to attend to become a banker and b of a does not. Instead I feel that my past experience means nothing and Im left in a department that has no room for growth only room for displacement."
good,"Low pay, long hours and just not a great place to work. They demand 12 hours a day and do not compensate enough for it."
good,It’s a very stressful environment.. everyone seems sad and is always ready to leave...no wants to be there...majority of the conversation is about looking for other work. Filling out application...
good,"I had prior banking experience, and this Greatly helped me in advancing my knowledge and my position. I was crossed trained, and worked doing other positions within the store."
good,"Not a place to see career growth. Polarized middle management."
good,Nice environment..nice peers to work with but no help as far as studying for your exams ..no shadowing or seeing the job done live ...and the study program was completely disconnected from what you needed to actually pass the test
good,Benefits are great but the compensation is not up to par.  Only management makes good money but the employees who actually do the job aren't compensated for the work they do.
good,Tough place to work if you don’t play the game. Loyalty to managers and staff is non existent if you don’t play the game. High rate of performance documentation and turnover when sr level executives don’t hit their bonuses -definitely trickles down the reaction. Long days and not enough staffing with little support from leadership and zero OT
good,Very difficult to work at that business. Lots of turnover and lots of drama around the entire food program. Very difficult population to feed and very slow with lots of competition in the area of the unit.
good,"Employees are dedicated to the success of the company, but don't always feel they are receiving ""the whole story"" from upper management on the ""ifs"" and ""whys"" of inner workings."
good,The goals are ridiculous. They do not pay you enough if you do achieve them. It a little over your regular check and you have to wait a full extra month to get it after the quarter ends. Its a lot of reporting and explaining why you aren't meeting sales goals. A lot of sales pressure.
good,The people are great.  Upper Management is profit driven and do not really care about the workers.  The needs of the business are not as important as the profit line.
good,"I took this job after being off of work for over fifteen years.  The bank knew this when they hired me yet offered me no opportunity to train or get assistance in their systems.  Because the position, as in most bank's was heavily dependent on knowing the systems they use, I started out in the ""hole"", so to say, from the start.  There was no attempt on anyone's part to train me or have me sit with someone who knew the systems.  Obviously, I could not be as productive as I could have been with just a bit of training and after a year I just gave up.  The only positive thing the Bank did was show my leaving as a layoff and not a firing."
good,Bank of America is ok to work there is hard work involved put you do get some tihngs to learn in that environment. hardest part of job some uncontrollable elements affecting your job
good,"In this place, you're truly overworked and underpaid. Work and life balance was terrible and expectations from senior management was always increasing beyond reach."
good,Reveiw summary says it all. Unrealistic expectations from upper management made it difficult to effectively manage team. Employees should be compensated  if you are to increase their workload.
good,"I like the work, enjoyed the people but it was stressful. People are known to be in the office for 10+ hours. Management does not lend itself to give much guidance and they only speak to you when you've done something wrong"
good,"The job itself wasn't hard, but management in the department I worked for was not that great. Overtime was almost always required and you had to literally take your work home."
good,"Good healthcare and benefits.  Usually have 1 day off/ week.  Sales is big here.  Many opportunities, even in small towns.  Lots of work activities to attend."
good,Excellent benefits. Recruiting and Relocation assistance needs to improve. Limited opportunity for advancement due to posting positions and recruiting outside the company at the same time as posting positions within the company.
good,"Worked there in collections for over 6 years for credit card and mortgages. Mostly all the coworkers were nice, clicky, but nice. Management was hit or miss. Most played favorites and they were never consistent. Rules changed and you were written up without warning. Some management really cared others were garbage. Pay and benefits are nice. They also had many volunteer opportunities you were paid to attend."
good,The work environment is very fast paced and your responsibilities keep increasing over time but that does not mean increase in pay or promotion. Management is good but the policies are a bit complicated and unclear. Bad part is that you do not get paid for holidays or any vacation/personal time.
good,"Because of the mortgage bubble incident, a lot of banks put pressure on all sales. This lead to employees leaving the company or trying to switch departments so they did not have to deal with sales."
good,"Bank of America as a company is amazing. However, management was not the best. Recently completely changed all upper management members therefore it was hard to really adjust. One of the newest managers (whom I will not name) is not very personable at all. When she walks by she makes sure to look away as though she does not want to be bothered or talked to at all. It’s extremely stressful keeping up with stats in all categories. Seems as though you are never good enough. Our performance is mostly measured by client surveys which when I arrived the goal was 83%. By the time I left, after a year of working there, they have raised that goal to 90%. I was told that would be changing to 94% very soon, making it very very difficult to bonus. And again, you’re just never got enough for them."
good,"Merrill Lynch was an okay experience because I discovered how a workplace feels like for the first time, but I didn't really expect it to be fairly boring. It's a very quiet atmosphere and the entire team was off-site, so it was fairly slow in terms of ramping up for work."
good,"I was employed by Merrill Lynch long before management screwed up and had to sell.  It was an OK place to work, but as with most big companies, local management had a big influence on employee satisfaction."
good,Lake of options for advancement.  People in management only look out for themselves.   Good place to stop on your way to a real career to get some decent tech experience.
good,Typical day was stressful. This was a fast-paced company at the time I worked there. Most of the tasks were manual and the technology did not exist to help with the workload.
good,Bank of America is an ok place to work at. The benefits are really good. The hours are full time. They compensate you pretty well salary wise. Almost everyone is a pleasure to work with.
good,This was a temporary contract position so I was not there for a long time. This position was only for a couple of months during tax filing season. During this short time I was promoted to a Workflow assistant which was a good experience especially since I was able to use my skills as indicated on my resume.
good,"My work schedule was changed 4 times in the first 90 days, and asked to work through lunch with no prior warning. Overall a relaxing job but schedule is not stable."
good,Good job and company. Just not for me. The goals just keep getting higher and higher. Youre expected to make 50+ calls a week along with seeing at least 10 clients a day. Really hard to manage.
good,"It’s a really good company as far as working inside company and getting along with others , but I feel like the job won’t ever let you grow as a person and I’m looking for me than to be just standing still"
good,"The company offers good insurance and 401K benefits; however, if the job / position is under the servicing operation, there is a constant changes in processes and teams.  There are constantly laid offs."
good,"Very conservative company, unrealistic sales hurdles, long hours, lots of cold calling, decent pay, excellent benefits. Great technology and tools but little insight on how to do anything. Very much left to your own devices."
good,Treasury Services typical day is receiving request which are unclear and trying to get them re scope with clients. Hardest part of the Job is the quality of Resources hired since the training is not sufficiently strong to make them SME on their job like they are expected and they suffer consequences.
good,"BofA at the time I worked there was full of old Countrywide employees.  Pitiful ownership of loans in processing, underwriting and closing.  Way too long to close in a market that has slowed since the refi boom."
good,Was a great experience but metrics unreachable. Always changing. No overtime allowed if not meeting in performance. Which does not allow to make ends meet.
good,"Witnessed too many talented people get laid off while other ""rocks"" kept their jobs, cushy yearly increases and were usually given even less responsibilities."
good,Fast  paced working environment. Never enough employees to take care of Customers.Low pay and very small raises yearly.Long hours and lots of audits performed
good,"BAnk of America has a lot of benefits that incentivize you to continue your career, the bank has changed agressively with mixed messages on areas of focus and strategy.  There are a lot of leadership turnover and realignments which greatly affect the bottom line.  The bank has invested a lot on training material that is easy to understand and learn."
good,If you want to be treated like you should be thankful to have a job this is the place for you. Compensation and benefits are not good. Upper management does not care about the little people anymore. Culture change is very poor since reorganization
good,"Managers did not execute well their strategies. Very hard to get promoted from with in even if you are over achieving. They promise career growth if you show your numbers, but when you do they keep you on a loop."
good,"process documentation and analysis"
good,"I was hired to be a compliance officer for the life insurance division.  Unfortunately, this put me in the position of having to approve sales that my supervisor was compensated on (but I was not).  This person (who no longer works there) made it clear in various ways that he did not like the fact that I did the job I was hired for."
good,I gained a great deal of IT experience and knowledge from BofA that has assisted me in adding value to my career opportunities within the past 10 years.
good,"Company provides good benefits but there is not much room for growth in different  roles to excel or grow. Salaries are average  Excessive training mandates, employee comrade virtually nonexistent - constantly changing operational policies and procedures. Very few planned company events and managers extremely busy and avoidant. Not a welcoming work environment or positive atmosphere."
good,"The customer is always right, even when they're wrong. It's a very uptight environment. Not laid back at all. You cannot be yourself. You have to where a mask. If you're good at wearing a mask then this will be a great job for you."
good,The benefits are great but the job itself is only a stepping stone job.  I worked there for a few years and had some really bad managers that said I took too long and did not sell credit cards to someone who came in on information on a death certificate.
good,Bank of America had trouble with the direction of the segment which resulted in my resignation.  It was new and the organization was feeling through the process.
good,"Not enough staff/work 6 days a week with no overtime. Benefits are great, but other then that it really isn't what it should be. One teller has to handle all customers with no help."
good,"As a relationship manager within the Houston Market the job is aimed more towards entry-level, just getting started in banking.  You do learn a lot, but with the help of your co-workers.  Managers do know a lot, but they are not willing to assist directly.  There are too many 'unspoken' market rules that WE MUST obey or 'else'.  Even if our  company policy states we can do something - WE CANNOT, and you find out after you end up on a report.  There is not a happy balance between work/home in the position.  If you want a day off, place your request in 3 months in advance but be prepared because even your own wedding date request will be rejected and even funerals.  Do not expect to have Saturdays off, even if you are 20% above goal and it is a family holiday or milestone event.  No one can take ownership of task, managers pass their task onto employees who have enough to deal with already.  If the task doesn't get completed, it will be your fault and not management.  If the pay compensated the task, there would  be no complaints.  You don't have the ability to assist clients the way you want, the client is just another account for the bank.  If they experienced a tragic life event - it does not matter.  To assist clients you have to always contact the back office, which always has a hold time for their calls which ends up affecting your productivity.  We have surveys that the clients take, if you do not get a 10 - it is bad news.  Even if you get an '8', you have failed the survey which is punishable up to termination.  There are no Merrill Edge goals per policy, but talk with"
good,I really enjoyed the customers that I worked with on a daily basis. Many of the employees I worked with were very knowledgeable and cared for the customers and their jobs. Bank of America is very charitable and had lots of employee sponsored events to help raise money for local charities.
good,"8 hour work day with 3-5 hours of conference calls.  Enjoyed the people I worked with, but hard to get anything done.  Funding required to get anything done."
good,Bank of America has great core values.  There should be programs offered to coach individuals on the understanding and application of those values in order to truly echo what the company’s culture is meant to portray.
good,Very advanced company. Benefits were great. On the job training. Lots of help lines to call. A little pressure for selling loans and accounts and overall customer service can be overwhelming at times. No job security. If management does not like you they will somehow find a way to get rid of you. This particular location had some bad apples but the overall company was prestigious.
good,"The company has great benefits , the management is the immense issue. All they care about is profit, the client experience has gone to the back burner of what they are interested in."
good,I've never had a good manager for any length of time.  5 managers over the past 2 years. Management would rather recruit from external sources than promote within.
good,"Working 6 days a week, Monday to Saturday. Good training for financial services and client interaction career. Cannot bring your kids in the financial center during bring your kids to office workday."
good,The pay rate is great. They experience you with several work issues to learn from. They normally hire within the company. It was hard to receive training for other job opportunities.
good,"Stressful....!! Must of the manager's that I had over the years working at Bank of America were good, but the last few years working there I had a very aggressive mean manager. That contributed to me making my decision to leave this company."
good,trainings and BOFAguidelines take you off the floor a ton. branch manager wants o put their own in input mortgage sales person duties. Basically having two managers to deal with.
good,"the job took all of your day, you come in at 7 am and leave at 9 pm. management was bad. they weren't able to teach us well or give us enough time to train on the phones. the best part about work was lunch time because the job is mentally stressful"
good,"During my time with BofA, I moved up quickly, was very successful and did enjoy my job.  The mortgage melt down happened and life became very stressful."
good,wasn't there long enough to fully rate company.  reason i left is part time employees were not offered fringe benefits at that time. they did offer assistance in paying for my child's daycare expense.
good,"Never got the chance for advancement. Low level managers were helpful but higher up were bureaucratic"
good,".Very productive, Busy"
good,"Unfortunately, the company, like many others are becoming more numbers driven than customer satisfaction (from an internal standpoint).  In desktop support, it use to be about doing what it takes to keep the associates working and happy.  15 years later, it was all about ""close the ticket, they can open another"".   Tickets doubled if not tripled and reporting looked great, but the internal associates were more and more frustrated and neglected.  If you tried standing up for them, you'd get a slap on the wrist."
good,"Corporate and investment banking division of Bank of America. It provides services in mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt capital markets, lending, trading, risk management, research, and liquidity and payments management."
good,A good place to start right out of high school but not to make a career out of. The hardest part of the job was being up on your feet throughout the shift. The most enjoyable part was most of us got along well but there was some animosity at times between co-workers and the manager.
good,"great place to work, great people.  enjoyed working there and wouldn't mind going back.  plenty of opportunity for advancement. great managers while i worked there"
good,"There was not much support management wise, the company itself as a whole seemed managed well, however not my immediate manager. There was no immediate support"
good,"If hired as a contractor rethink about applying, you get 0 benefits, horrific schedule,   0 holiday pay even if working on a holiday, 0 paid time off."
good,"Advancement is given to friends of managers. No need for a college degree or any experience to become a manager and no training is provided to managers. The organization is run like a high school popularity contest, you can work hard, be the best, inform management of your advancement intentions and jobs are passed to friends without even a job posting. Special projects are secretly handed out to favorites. There is not clear path to grow your career with this bank, not that it matters, they don't increase your pay by much with advancements."
good,I was a Genesis 10 consultant assigned to the Bank of America account. Bank of America accepted me for 3 different contracts. 
good,the financial services industry is a difficult industry to work in due to all the regulations. many times what the company has to do is out of it hands. which doesn't always make for the most efficient processes.
good,A typical day at work is all work no play when you clock in the morning to start your role. There are times when we set aside time to celebrate milestones but it wasn't so often so it was hard to build relationships in other departments and network within the company. the most enjoyable part of my job was the different opportunities that you are allowed to explore i didn't like that there no growth to move around that much to make more money in the fast growing economy.
good,"During my 5 years with Bank of America, I repaired and verified international and domestic Swift Telex Payments. I verified customer accounts prior to releasing Swift Telex Payments. I also verified customer accounts utilizing BOSS FAST, COINS, GTS, HOGAN, NATS, BOA Global  Directory and Thompson’s Directory. Processed, verified and transferred CRM claims cases. Daily investigated and determined method of payments for high risk countries. I processed OFAC and foreign exchange payments, Drawdowns, return items and advised customers of routing instructions from Hotline calls. When on the day shift, I contacted customers and correspondents to seek clarification of documents. I often trained prospective employees of money transfer payments processing. I learned to prioritize my duties and functions. The workplace culture is fast paced. The hardest part of the job was when the Federal Reserve Bank would extend past 6:30pm, which meant overtime, sometimes past 8:30pm but we were provided with car service home and take out dinner.  The most difficult part of the job was not knowing on 09/11/2001, if all of my coworkers who start their day between 6am - 9am, were going to make it out the building which was 1 WORLD TRADE CENTER, safely.  Thereafter, we were transferred to Secaucus NJ.  The most enjoyable part of the job were some of the people and holiday parties."
good,No loyalty. I was a exceeds employee on all of my mid and year-end reports yet and still I got laid off. All my upper management was in another state.
good,"Far too number driven. Does not show great adherence to their motto of ""bettering the lives of our financial customers through the power of every connection,"" seems closer to ""Get every connection possible and tell us exactly who said no and why."""
good,"Flexible work hours, generous benefits, but low morale and low pay. Great benefits, but difficult to move around to different departments. I had great managers, but not sure if that was for the entire bank, or I was just lucky"
good,High stress filled environment management is not flexible if you do not meet sales goals. There is no job security and you are treated as if you are replaceable.
good,"I worked in fort worth office. my typical day was 8:00 to 5:00p, but manager was flexible as far as the timing goes (could start anytime between 7:00 and 9:00a. Management provide scorecards on a monthly basis which can tell you where you need improvement and what you have achieved for the month"
good,very competitive and stressful work place. good benefits poor compensation.typical work day started understaffed. Management was not trained to handle employees needs. the hardest part of the job was no recognition. when workers excelled there were always excuses to ignore the extra effort they put into their job.
good,"BofA is a great company to work for in terms of Employee Benefits and Brand Recognition during sales calls, however there are limited opportunities in the Inland Empire for career advancement."
good,Company needs to focus on employees not just higher ups.  Ton of poor managers are in charge .  Good benefits so that's a pro.  Cutting cost everywhere .
good,"I would work at BofA again but I would have to mentally prepare for the lack of consistency with managers and staff. Every time I had established myself with a manager or my team, a major shift occured in the organizational structure."
good,"Because I worked through several bank mergers, I was able to work and learn about many bank applications. My immediate manager was very supportive of his staff. The hardest part of the job was not feeling secure given the layoffs that occurred after each merger. The best part of the job was knowing I had support"
good,The bank is a fast paced environment with a lot of workplace stress.  There is little to no job security and you are always in fear of staff reductions.
good,"working for bank of america was a good experience and great for acquiring skill and experience"
good,"Management does not care about retaining good talent. Very stressful work environment. Senior managers always focus on making profit and does not care about employee. There is no job security. As company makes profit, bonus for executive increases, but bonus for other employees goes down. Layoff happens every month. It is not a fun place to work."
good,"The position I had has been phased out, either automated or farmed out to India or somewhere else outside the US. "
good,"*Management was not well-versed"
good,"Great place to work.  Only if you a full time employee.  If you are a contract the treatment is total different,  you will need to learn the process on your own."
good,"* slow paced, repetitive work."
good,"Limited learning opportunities, Less job security, Reluctance of adaptability for new joiners, Less to learn as finance and accounting professional....."
good,"Personally, I thrive under stress and deadlines, but it made for a challenging environment when those around you didn't share your passion. "
good,"Scheduled breaks, no bathroom breaks, constant breathing over your shoulder. constantly monitoring. Management changed almost once a month. Hard for advancement opportunities."
good,Stressful environment. Never knew going in if I was working 8 hours or less or up to 11 per day. Environment was a little too relaxed for me. Good benefits.
good,Networking and cold calling.  Financial research. Managing investment portfolios. Management only cares about numbers and performance margin. The workplace culture is competitive. Hardest part of the job was convincing high net worth clients to work with B of A within the first appointment. The best part of the job was learning about the market.
good,My manager was great and my co-workers were too.  However I can't recommend the retail mortgage division.  The culture was really wasn't a fit for me.  Lots of pressure and managing to reports.  We spent a lot of time doing things that took time away from production.  The process wasn't very good either.
good,This was a tough position and was tied to the phone which was not the role for me.  Trying to push products to clients that may not need them was not a great fit.
good,"I enjoyed helping people set up their financial needs, and budget that helped accomplish those financial needs! My customers were mostly pleasant but I do believe Bank of America could focus a little more on customer service instead of numbers."
good,Take incoming calls for Mortgage. The job itself is fine. The pressure of subjective customer surveys is the issue. The Client will be happy with my service but not happy with the Company's policy or rate and I could lose my job over it.
good,Too many work hours and much personal life. A lot of office politics. Many regulatory deadlines and your hard work are not appreciated.  Your work is always named as your managers and you are not even visible. They want to let you feel lucky to keep your job. Low pay and with no the career future. Not recommended.
good,The way you feel about the place is depending on the department in which your working.  There are some great departments with the bank but the ones that are bad are really bad.
good,"Long days"
good,"I had a good experience with Bank of America.  However, there is no management guidance as to how to move to the next level.  If you are pegged in a role, even though you have additional experience and can do many other tasks, you are not given an opportunity.  They really only care about people located in Charlotte."
good,"My first good job after college so the pay was okay, but not ideal for growth. It however was an eye opener on how things are done in the corporate world."
good,"Challenging, fast moving work environment, with no room for error."
good,"great benefits, horrible work life balance, tons of micro management, poor accountability for management, always in flux, unrealistic expectations on multiple levels"
good,"Similar to many trading positions, expectations from the job are very high while staffing is kept extraordinarily lean while covering multiple technologies."
good,"Overall is a good company to work with. If you love competition and fast environment, this is the place to be.  Make sure you have a LEADER as your MSM, if NOT you will not grow at all.  Just another employee in the banking industry..."
good,"New to the IT field, it was a great experience; learned a lot.  Poor management, stressful environment.  Traning was insufficient, leadership was not approachable or understanding.  Evaluation poorly assessed, quantifiable evidence inconclusive to match yearly assessments."
good,"Fast pace, busy work environment. constant learning of new procedures. management very different depend on the location, workplace culture depend on the location manager. the hardest part of the job not having management support. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping people with variety daily financial needs that impact their better financial future."
good,Morale has declined over the years since I started lock box in 1999. It used to be an fun place to work and they were really flexible with schedules. Lots of favoritism and pettiness. Do your job and you'll be fine.
good,"BoA is a decent place to work that provides various levels of career challenges. And one can gain a significant level experience. The firm falls short in the leadership area. Majority of management are managers not leaders, which leads to an environment that is very task oriented and not people oriented."
good,It was great learning experience but any kind of advancement was not very easy. The stress was pretty high specially when it became to getting accounts.
good,"Work hard and get acknowledge. Many training programs, community service events and other benefits. Work environment bright and lively. Technology changes and growth."
good,"The cost of health benefits to the employee is great.  There needs to be a focus on work/life balance.  Also, on growth opportunities.  PTO benefits are great as well."
good,Bank of America can be a good place to work depending on your manager and the line of business you are working for. Also the benefits offered are very good.
good,"Everyday is different and a learning experience."
good,"Company keeps making constant changes that don't ever let you get used to things, they keep adding more responsibilities but don't add more benefits! Also they rather hire from the outside and keep the employees that been there for years at a lower salary. The company has been going down every quarter, they don't really care about their employees anymore"
good,Good place to join if you have an existing book of clients.  Very difficult atmosphere to be in.  Not a very good reputation for prospective clients on a trust basis.
good,"Very stingy on hiring staff, many people are way overworked. Good to have on the resume but I wouldn't stay there forever. Managers have all been there for a long time, which is great because they are knowledgeable but I think they could use more people with outside perspectives, it would probably help them from making some mistakes that they have made in the past, and being able to relate more effectively with the customers."
good,"Need to be extremely entrepreneurial to make it in the TFA program. Not much structure, just bring in money and you make it. If you don't, you won't make it."
good,The only way to reach your goals is by being in a metropolitan location. If you have a great personality and full of energy pick a place where your not sitting in a cubicle.
good,"Opportunities to advance were few, Job security was always in question due to the company's goals to reduce staff. The work environment was difficult due to constant changes in upper management."
good,Bank of America offers good compensation but is not a welcoming place for contract workers. The culture is an unfavorable mix of employees who have been there for 15+ years and a constant influx of contract workers.
good,Technology focus is challenging for most associates. Work life balance was challenging for branch managers. Extreme focus on operations versus sales. The branch teams were the most enjoyable part.
good,Reducing personnel and forcing customer to use a machine is not a way to do banking. Employees are super stressful because they have to work like 4 different roles and on top of that dealing with complaints from customer and unable to provide quality service if you are always in the hurry to take the next customer. Also management is not properly hire.
good,"A very demanding workplace with no regard to employee's satisfaction. Very high expectations with minimal support and benefits. Employees voices were not heard, company did not foster employee satisfaction, growth or retention."
good,"My typical day was being a teller and servicing customer's or business's accounts. We would help customer fit a better saving account or even getting a way of customizing their needs around services or special account that they would qualify for. I learned a lot about banking and how the banking structure worked from the inside it was interesting and inviting. Management could have been better, the manager seemed to be going through a lot of personal problems at the time and would transfer that energy back on to the team which I or a lot of the employees did not appreciate. Unfortunately there was no workplace culture but the my co-workers made it fun and we tried to make the best of the situation. The most enjoyable part was helping customer and my co-workers."
good,i worked for two different branches. One was awful and one was really great. It completely depends on locations of the branch that you work with. The branch with less businesses around will be less busy but at the same time it's hard to make sales.
good,"There really isn't much culture here.  It's work hard, get the job done and come back tomorrow for more.  If you do an exceptional job there is no gratitude however, they will point out a tiny mistake or irrelevant information just to keep you in your place."
good,the work culture was okay. the management team was okay.  the hardest part of the job is the workload. the most enjoyable was working with the applicants.
good,"If you are looking for a job in the Banking business, then go for it.  However, I experienced some of the best and worst leadership while working there.  I worked their for 5 years and I had a great time, however, knowing what I know now, and always trying to be a great leader, I look back and see many of the failures in leadership there that I encountered at many different banks inside that brand.  I always looked at it and released I do not want to lead that way."
good,Working in the call center there is high volume of calls and with all different issues and customer constantly complaining and being transferred to the wrong dept. Not much you can do to help customers either.
good,"The company was very good to me regarding upward mobility, and person concern.  Stress related to industry challenges in the mortgage industry and huge number of layoffs."
good,The best thing about working for BoA is the benefits. Management needs work and the company does little to diversify when promoting.
good,Typical day at the bank was  such as : helping customers with opening accounts and maintenance.  Employees weren't happy with each other; many sad and angry faces. Management wasn't professional.
good,If you are down in the food chain. Expect to be over be severely overworked and unpaid. Retail banking is a dying segment of the business. Simply use it as a stepping stone to something better..especially IB.
good,"Bank of America was a difficult company to work for. There is no job/work balance. I worked with great people who made the experience good, however, overall I did not have good experience at Bank of America."
good,"Bank of America (BOA) was your typical call center.   There were ""cliques"" of workers that stayed together and did not speak to anyone.  The managers there were more concerned with being friends as opposed to providing training to new employees"
good,"Management pays lip service to advancement via performance. It is all about relationship and fit. Middle management only concern with benefiting themselves, not the company nor the employees. It does have great benefits - health, 401k, vacation, sick days etc. A good place for a beginner."
good,My co workers were nice.  The best part of the job was the 4/10 schedule and having all bank holidays off.  The management was ok but teams were switched to different departments a lot.
good,"A typical day would find me in tears during my lunch hour nearly every day. "
good,"This was a high pressure sales culture.  Like all banks at the time, management put pressure on the employees to reach an ever increasing sales quota."
good,"Great company to work for, great with LGBT rights. Management needs fixing. Make sure to focus on goals on attendance was all management cares about."
good,Although I literally screamed when I got the call that I was hired by heart beat so fast. I was happy bc i knew the if I can stay focused and work hard in the in and outs I would be ok. But it was not so easy. The time I worked is when the market crashed and government tried to bail out everyone.
good,"I was hired through Manpower to work in Bank of America's tax prep center.  This is a temporary job, lasting from March to July, if you're lucky.  The pay is great for that short amount of time, and for the work you'll be doing.  I was a tax return prep clerk, which simply means that I ensured each tax return, that was to be processed, was in the correct order, that nothing was missing and that everything was legible.  Management does not really bother you if you come in on time and you do what you are supposed to do within the desired time."
good,"Process Over 300 transactions per day. "
good,It just time to look for other opportunities when you feel things will not change where you are at. This place may not be for everyone
good,"A typical work day ? There isn't one. Our motto is to be an agent of change here at Bank Of America. No one day is the same, which keeps you on your toes and keeps the job exciting . Almost daily I learn something new. We rely heavy on one another's knowledge . Team work makes the dream work!"
good,Bank started as Fourth National Bank which was an excellent place to work with hard-working loyal employees.  Unfortunately it was bought out by four other banks in a relatively short period of time putting extreme stress on both the employees and customers.
good,"Job and opportunity is good itself, but the company's culture is very pro-management and does not have the ability to be impartial especially during issues/cases brought up to HR. Management has the ability to intimidate employees using freeze out techniques, creating toxic environment, make false performance reviews, spread damaging rumors, discrediting reputation, and unjustified demotions knowing that there will be no consequences or any internal investigations. "
good,"Directed and delegated daily working objectives to meet financial responsibilities."
good,Bank of America has been very good to me. I'm just ready for a change and ready to offer my skillsets and talents to new partners.
good,"Good culture to work in, provided a lot of training for the multiple credit card and banking products that were offered."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the pay, the work itself was tiring and certain management didn't take responsibility for sup calls. You have to have a certain type of mentality to be on the phones for 8 hours a day."
good,"I can say that over the years I grew to love  the people I worked with. It made the workplace a joy to come to everyday. The work was reviewing calls and cases, which was a great position. And one of the best part about the job was tuition reimbursement."
good,Bank of America is going through some radical changes and may not be the best environment at this point in time. It is a highly politicized organization and you'll spend a lot of time watching your back.
good,"Training is above average You will stay very busy many projects to do Corporate office in CA"
good,The job has great benefits such as backup care for emergency baby or adult sitter. Medical benefits were good and great discounts for employees on merchandise. The pay should have matched the responsibilities a lot better. We were pressured to keep customers on the phone who were calling to activate a credit card which affected the ability to get payout.
good,"1. Good Company"
good,"Merrill is under a lot of stress since the crash of 2008. People still talk about Merrill vs. BofA which should no longer need to occur. Management is highly stressed which leads to micromanagement and stress passed down to employees. "
good,"I was an Investment Specialist Trainee, I was to study to get my Series 7 Licence, they basically put you in a room with a pile of books and tell you to get to it. There is virtually no support and you are lucky to see your manager maybe once a week. The new hire leadership really has no vested interest in weather you pass or fail."
good,"Greet customers, run transactions, answer multi phone lines, service accounts, file paper work, work with branch manager on regulations to progress in role. Balance cash at end of day."
good,"Good Company to work However got internal politics and mostly Westerners support Westerners to boost career ."
good,"For technical persons who are the top technologists in the US, this is not the place to enhance those skills. Senior Leadership states the mission is innovate, advance, be the leading edge, but due to poor mid level management, stuck in old project management processes, and limited by their lack of accountability and objectivity. Managing vendors have the ability to influence the decision makers, projects are always late, never complete and full of issues after launch. CEO, CIO and the Executive Leadership needs to right size their mid level management team including asking those people who have not accomplished an innovation in less than a year at a cost of less than a million dollars should be shown the door. Innovation arises within not obtaining prices and implementation costs from managing vendors who are just watching out for the account executive sales team or playing golf negotiating their finances."
good,"Settling general ledger for payments that did not post to customers credit card accounts. Locating payment to post them to the accounts. Working with other departments in finding payments put through ATM machines-wire transfer, and branches."
good,"A lot of politics and paperwork and management changes.  No job security every day you wonder if that will be your last day at work regardless of how hard you work or for how long was there for more than 16 years and got laid off when they decided to cut 30,000 jobs."
good,rate of pay is way to low...need to be more.  the co workers are awesome.. the job is enjoyable...need to work on consistancy
good,You need to work on  your brand in order to move vertically in this company. That includes participating in affinity groups and lending yourself to multiple volunteer organizations.
good,My work experience at bank of america was very fruitful it was a great opportunity to learn but management was disappoointing
good,"A mix of both here - both the ggod, bad and ugly."
good,"the company is very focused on giving to the community, serving military veterans and providing a diverse candidate pool."
good,"Fast paced environment, where we service large corporations through various banking systems.  I have been in this role almost a year and have gained vast knowledge in what large corporations need to maintain their business through servicing and implementation.  I work with a very knowledgeable group we all bring in different areas of banking, when we collaborate we are able to get with the client needs in a efficient way.  The hardest part of this role is the time allotted to resolve the clients needs, we have 2 hours to do so.  I enjoy the satisfaction of resolving issues and research."
good,"•Analyze financial information obtained from clients to determine strategies for meeting clients' short- and long-term financial objectives."
good,A typical day would be coming to work prepared to assist our business clients with their accounts and researching information when needed. My co workers are great because we work hand and hand to accomplish and to seek to be client advocates. So far what I've learned is how to be a liason and work for the need of the client whether through research or the banking centers. The hardest part of my job is loosing a customer when you've tried your best to accommodate them the best way possible.
good,"I enjoyed the job.  I liked the atmosphere."
good,"I started with Barnett Bank and loved it and enjoyed going to work but then it was bought out by NationsBank and then shortly after that Bank of America, so lots of change in a very short amount of time"
good,I wouldn't recommend it. As a teller you're stuck for 6 months at best without seeing any promotions. The incentives are weak and the work is not adequately compensated.
good,BofA offers great PTO benefits however the management and the culture are horrible.  Communcation does not exist and leadership is lacking.  Its incredibly hard to move up in the company.
good,I was not adequately compensated for the production that my team and myself preformed.  Our management structure was non existant and that hurt the overall reputation of the position and company.
good,"Disappointed in the hiring process and expectations I had expressed when coming on board, that haven't come close to being met!"
good,"Working at Bank of America is not what I expected.  I thought there would be room for branching out into different areas of the bank and in my town the only really opportunity is branch banking.  I finally got full time position after 7 years of employment and they were hiring new people in at 40 hrs.  Long hours on Fridays, and they're being strict on how and when we can take our vacations. They are short on help and customers are complaining."
good,"I currently audit associates work and I listen to calls for call quality and training purposes. I have worked in 2 different departments in 5 years here. To get ahead you have to be close friends with management. Education and experience at this company almost mean nothing if you don't grab drinks and hang out with your  boss or mangers outside of work. This company continues to decrease benefits and cut things like bonuses and incentives regardless of how well the perform financially or how well the business does. You are lucky to get a 2% raise each year regardless of how hard you work.  The systems don't work well because the company decided to convert to a different system, which caused everything to go haywire.  At any moment you could go from doing a one job to being in a call center the next. There is no security that the role you are currently in will still be your role next week, or shipped to India. The process and procedures are a mess and too much time and money is spent on the wrong thing at this company.  What I enjoyed most about this company was the flexible schedule and childcare reimbursement benefit until they did away with the child care center. The next thing was the actual job until they decided to turn the whole department into a on call call center."
good,"Call center position responsible for fielding 40+ phone calls a day and initiating claims for electronic transactions. Performance based on handle time, customer survey results, and quality monitors. Repetitive position with limited growth and development."
good,Overall my time at Merrill was great. I learned much about back end trade settlement as well as general understanding on how future and option markets operated.
good,This company is overworking their associates and not listening to the needs of the associates or the clients. Good Company but associates don't understand the vision and neither do the clients.
good,"Don't even think about working for Bank of America. I don't even know where to begin. Wayyyy too much stress for the pay. Company is going through changes and company doesn't know what it wants or where it wants to be. Company only wants to deal with clients with lots of money. If you don't have much money, they don't want you as a client!"
good,Culture very similar to other major financial institutions. Spend much time trying to fix what is broken with no real results.
good,"▪  Act as the liaison between the Underwriter and all other parties."
good,"diverse group of co workers. i enjoyed the group of people i went to work with daily."
good,"This company is probably not bad all the way around, but seems only the good die young.  I have worked in different departments and different states and had very different experiences.  Generally the factor that drives the good or bad lies with the upper management.  It is face paced and micro managed to every degree, which is not a bad thing with the right management.  My last experience the management were tyrants that used bullying and threats to scare associates into getting the job done.  The general concensus of the associates was tantamount to hebrew slaves waiting for Moses to save them."
good,"I work the first shift at the bank, so I handle the most of the work. Which there are two other shift but first shift has to set the pase with our accounts and deposit so there are no hold over that would impact our customer. The hardest part of my job would be when there's no communication upon the mangers and they are trying to not miss there deadlines, and began to panic. I enjoy the most are my co-workers because even though we sometimes feel pressure we are able to get our job done successfully."
good,too many politics. managers fight and did not get any work done....
good,"the hours were pretty horrible. i would work from 5pm until midnight or later.  every monday and friday was mandatory as well. there was also no room to advance. i knew people who were working there for years and never moved up. the employees that worked there were all friendly but everyone was separated in groups in different rooms. for the most part, people mainly kept to themselves"
good,Manage team of associates daily on various critical projects.  Maintain a sense of urgency at all time as have always held a position in a production environment.  Push myself and  motivate team to reach daily goals and ensure a complete understanding of each task at hand.
good,Bank of America was an experience for me. I learned much about the banking industry while employed there. A typical day of work was mostly routine in which i contacted customer's investor's. different internal teams to provide our customer's with updates to the process at hand. During my tenture at bank of America i mostly learned what not to do. The management that i was under was not poor and not very well coordinated. Many of the challenges i faced was a result of poor management. The hardest thing about my job is to have an appointment to update a customer with absolutely nothing to advised them. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling on behalf of the bank to NACA events designed to help customer's in their time of need.
good,"Bank of America is a decent place to work and they offer legitimate benefits that cater to the work and family life balance depending on the department you are in (generous paternity leave, remote/virtual workplace, discounted child care, etc).  "
good,Immediate manager was not qualified for job.  Bank back up systems not operable.  Could not get loans closed.  Reputation of bank so bad could not get customers..
good,"Focus daily on sales, service and operational goals for the banking center. Train associates and hold associates accountable for results."
good,"Pros"
good,"A typical day at work is setting daily personal goals. Cross training. Analyzing / Improvement processes. Coordinate work among associates. Meet deadlines. Answer e-mails and requests from other departments. Reconcile checks. Preparing daily deposits. Reports and audits."
good,"I did like the fast pace enviroment, loved my co-workers, I was there for 8 years, due to site closing and changes I felt the need to seek other employment as I want to continue to work"
good,"BoFA is a big company with many opportunities to diversify and learn different areas within the banking industry.  I have worked for a few great managers, however more frequently I have found managers and Sr Leaders that were not as integral, people centered or fair.  The hardest part of most of the jobs was handling transitions that did not create a win win for associates.  It only created a win for metrics on paper."
good,Bank of America is a good starting point for young people coming out of college or first time employees.
good,"As a personal banker for BOA, the rate of pay isn't worth the stress and pressure applied. The company has become EXTREMELY sales oriented and is forgetting about a persons best interest. The ideals are correct, ""Needs based Selling"" the practices however do not match. The best thing that has come from this are the teammates I've grown to know and the clients I've developed relations with. The hardest part was the ever changing strategy of the Banking center. Nothing was consistent and it became overwhelmingly stressful."
good,"fast paced environment hard job not for everyone"
good,"The benefits of working for Bank of America include paid vacation/time off and great health insurance. These benefits, however, are quickly overshadowed by a lack of advancement opportunities and a stressful work environment."
good,"Human resources was not onsite -hard to get ahold of them"
good,"Not very hard work functions, however tense environment with customers due to stern goals for quarterly reviews."
good,No real work life balance in my case.  Schedule can change daily with or without notice.
good,the only way to survive here is to bring in a huge book of business with you or find a senior partner who will allow you to be their junior partner
good,"No opportunity for advancement. Once you are in a role, it is very difficult to get out."
good,"The company is in a continual change. The organization, managers, tools change so frequently that you hardly have enough time to learn a process or get to know your managers or coworkers. Expectations and workload are arbitrary, you often don't know if you met the expectations until the performance review."
good,"The department is an ever changing department.  A typical day would include; managing a team of 10+, answering emails, conference calls, onsite meetings, and building relationships with other LOB's."
good,"This place gets really busy specially every first and third of the month. Managers expect so much from employees without compensation or recognition. Coworkers for the most part are fun and easy to get along. Hardest part of the job is sales. Sometimes sales are demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others and making the customers happy, counting money and closing up."
good,"●	Involved in all the phases of the SDLC including Requirements Collection, Design and Analysisof the Customer Specifications, Development and Customization of the Application"
good,Bank of America is great if your not worried about being a part of the next big layoff spree. They Hire a good handful and then let them go. I will say they have a great atmosphere while you are there.
good,"I start my work day taking phone calls, trades, processing, escalations, client requests, funding requests, etc. I have very little interaction with any leadership within the company. I spend 90% of my day working directly with the three financial advisors that I support. Two advisors are senior and one is junior.  They are very set in the operations of their team and are not generally open to new and constructive ideas. They are incredible particular about the process and contact with their clients.  They are very successful and enjoy their work. They struggle, daily, with the impact of Bank of America on their business and tend to dwell on the negative aspects.  There is a very distinct line between the management teams and the team of financial advisors.  There is a constant tension between driving revenue and applying compliance and controlling risk.  This has been an incredibly difficult environment for me to excel.  Therefore, I’m looking to move on outside of the Client Associate role and back into a productive, positive work environment."
good,I found this job through a temp agency in the Tri Valley. I knew it was not going to last forever as it was just open for the overflow of loans B of A was receiving at that time.
good,Not a good place to work at all. Management is disconnected and not helpful. No work life balance whatsoever. It is more like modern day slavery
good,many good and many bad things about working here. too bad they never fire any bad managers. they just dont get promoted and as such you are stuck with them forever!
good,"So Workers are great "
good,Very hands off. Too many automated processes. Too many processes all together.
good,"A typical day is very busy and a little stressful, I learned how to work effectively and efficently"
good,"Good company, however is experiencing unusual amounts of change which takes its toll on everyone."
good,Limited growth and direction; no training or investment in associates
good,This environment was faced paced and overall a great learning experience. Was introduced to two lines of businesses  credit card and mortgage.
good,"I learned a lot  while there,office enviorment is open cubicle layout,not there long enough"
good,had to leave due to moving out of the area. hd some free lunches and some spreads.
good,"Bank of America has seen better years financially, and is prone to annual layoffs. However, they remain a solid part of the American financial system and will be around for some time."
good,"I love BOA as a company.  I enjoyed working with my team and managers.  My temperament does not acquiesce to repetitive job functions and activities.  The most enjoyable part of my job, was the people I work with.  The hardest part of my job was remaining interested in the job function."
good,Day to day we service many customers who have had financial struggle with there credit card debt. I would assist with debt management programs as well as risk customers credit evaluation to save them from financial hardship.
good,"Bank of America has given me the opportunity to have a stable workplace wi benefits. I open my accounts when I first arrive for work, look at the task that need to be done to keep accounts in compliance with regulations, I look at what needs to be done to move accounts to underwriters for a decision to be made on accounts, I call customers/authorized third parties to inform what is needed on accounts to move toward completion."
good,"Is the job culture. The culture at Bank of America encourages mediocrity and a lack of support from management. Management does not care about further developing skills or promoting employees.  Any performance review or feedback other than ""meets expectations"" - whether it's above or below expectations - requires management to justify their scoring with specific details and examples. In my experience, managers were prone to writing ""meet expectations"" rather than go through the effort of justifying their scoring. When asked to provide feedback and ways to improve, no criticisms or useful feedback was provided. At my performance review, I received comments such as ""continue to improve,"" ""keep doing what you're doing,"" ""continue to adapt and get settled in"" but nothing specific on areas where I seem to struggle, examples of projects that could have been better, times that I merely met rather than exceeded expectations and more. Even employees that separate themselves from their peers receive this treatment because, as I was told by multiple managers, ""it's very, very hard for us to justify anything other than 'meets expectations.'"" All merit raises are tied to these review results, by the way. Depending on the department, job security may be a concern as well."
good,The benefits/compensation are great.  The management team and corporate culture are morale killers.
good,Unless your can sell ice water to Eskimos this is not the place to be a teller. You are required to sell an average of 4 bank services a day. That's all well and good if you can sell ice water to an Eskimo. But if you don't see that many people in a day or the people you see are the same ones you saw yesterday and the day before and the day before that(merchant teller).
good,Daily tasks consisted of helping clients with repayment of their credit card balance while providing great customer service. Co-workers made the environment fun while management lacked on the changing needs of the company. Great health benefits and a good feeling knowing you were able to help a customer.
good,"management at my banking center is not focused on team performance, or advancement opportunities"
good,Assistant teller manager. Opening and closing branch. Daily balancing of all employee draws. Balancing safe. Schedule of employees. Sales of products.
good,"Enjoyed the company, but left for advancement. Company was hit by the market and was downsizing departments."
good,"The position I held was very Challenging. There were daily fire drills to attend the work day didn't end at 5pm. There were late night conference calls with Japan which were very interesting. It was a global position I worked with Mexico, Japan and London. It"
good,"Although the company offers very competitive pay and benefits, the scheduling isn't flexible for a family life and they offer very little room to grow. The bank recently closed many sites around the country and there were a lot of layoffs. Job security is a concern here."
good,The job has entry level positions have no career advancement.
good,My day at work consist of researching various case types for both Adjustments and returns.
good,Customer service was horrible policy and procedures never make the customer happy
good,"all in all, not a bad place to work.  Just not a good one.  I know several people who have worked for Merrill Lynch for many years (before the BOA take over) and I can say with absolute confidence that the changes that Bank Of America have made are most certainly not for the best.  It is a big company and I only worked in one area, but it was not a great, or even good experience."
good,i have worked for this company for several years being placed in several different positions and departments throughout the bank
good,"Firstly, the people I've met at Bank of America can be great. Some of the co-workers I've had there were fantastic, and definitely the most enjoyable part of the job. "
good,"I was able to learn a lot from my employment with Bank of America and was offer chosen for special projects because of my capacity to learn new things quickly. "
good,"Bank of America's Brand and corporate culture is slowly taking over Merrill Lynch. "
good,"Bank of America as a whole is a great company.  The merge with Countrywide was a huge undertaking, much more then was expected.  As the Countrywide associate work their way out Bank of America mission will start to move across each site."
good,Extremely faced-paced environment. I learned how to manage my work-load and complete projects in a short timelines while maintaining accuracy and creativity.
good,"Merrill Lynch is a good investment company to work for with many departments and opportunities. In customer service, depending on your schedule, it can be very demanding and stressful. I have learned in depth knowledge of the banking/finance industry and many computer systems used for daily maintenance. Management in customer service can be helpful, but lack true leadership skills needed to aid in the development of the associates. The co-workers are for the most part just happy to be employed and most are not concerned about development. The hardest part of the job is having to maintain a high level of customer service, even in times when workforce has not properly staffed the center to meet customer demands. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity to use it as a stepping stone into a more challenging career within the company."
good,"Busy, fast paced experience helping customers receive the best products and services to suite them in their everyday banking needs."
good,A typical day as a Support Service Specialist has given the opportunity to assist and learn from the Processors and Management.  It has afforded me the knowledge of the Loan Processing Experience.  I feel the working in this aspect of the Bank has taught me how to set up one's workday to be successful as a Processor.
good,The company mislead customers in the loan modification program.  BOA rep promised to call with benefits update & did not.  Co-workers were friendly & hard-working. 
good,"Overload work, monumental work for limited time frame."
good,Very hectic schedule. Extremely difficult to maintain good work life balance.
good,Nice company to work for if you are interested in a call center atmosphere. Management was very helpful and the employees were friendly.
good,"Appraisal management, when first mandated, was a hostile environment.  Men and women that made very good salaries with great anonymity all of the sudden were forced to answer to people with very little understanding of their profession.  I had the wonderful opportunity to help them in this transition.  I believe I did this with respect and grace."
good,"A typical day is very hectic because we had to make sure that we had to have all files reviewed and work in 30 days, I learned a lot while at Bank of America i learned how to read and understand Surveys and appraisals, learned how to contact the invester for approvals for the partial release request. the co-workers were very knowledge and helpful make some great friends while i was at BOFA, the most enjoyable part of the job was to being able to help someone. "
good,"Working with large amounts of currency, being customer friendly in a face-to-face environment, processing banking transactions, and opening accounts.  I learned to be very careful with entering numbers in a database system and the very basics to accounting.  Management was very detailed oriented and strived for the betterment of the banking branch.  The co-associates were not very customer friendly and was very demanding and sometimes rude.  The worst part to this position was the fear and worry of a robbery as it was a known branch to be a participate in previous cases.  Overall the best moments was being able to purchase company logo items as souvenirs. "
good,I would assist customers with loan modification from start to finish. Was also apart of special projects where there was a designated area of concern that we would help management resolve.  I did not have a great experience there as we were laid off prior to really getting into the position. Great company but during my time here things started going for the worse and they ended up laying off Employees
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is my interactions with my customers.
good,It is a very easy job as a teller you repeat the same routine all day everyday you learn how to deal with all kind of people
good,"Working in the escalation area is hard in this economy,  with more support from management a day would run smoothly. "
good,"Lot of competition for growth. Promotions are given on Favoritism not performance. "
good,Contacting customer to make sure loan process goes as smoothly as possible.
good,I loved my job but the coworkers that held higher positions were rude and obnoxious. They take advantage of authority in this company.
good,"as my day started i finished the work from the day before and started the work that was assigned to me. what ive learned about the job is diffrent systems that we were trained in excel,power point etc. My co-worker were very nice and helpful. the hardest part of the job was being able to learn the system in a timily manner."
good,"From the time I walk in to my office I am constantly working, coaching and providing feedback, answer emails and incoming calls, attending meeting and pulling reports and stats through out the day. I am gradually learning how to delegate and trusting the work will completed accurately and promptly. I have also learn how to apply Meyer Briggs techniques to help better understand different personality through my team and with peers. The hardest part of my job is convince my manager I do not work 24 hours a day and convince adults to do there job. See my team succeed over others."
good,"the co-workers are great, have given me great compliments and are striving to let my managers know how well I do from day to day. Analize fraudulent debit ATM claims, index them properly into system"
good,"I have been with the company for 2 years, a typical day at work is, if you're opening the banking center you listen to the huddle, normally its about your sales goals if you're PB, or 5% customer engagement rate ( your referrals have to be 5% of all customers you helped for example: if you helped 150 customers you have to make 8 referrals, my manager calculates this by the number of transactions), and information on products, you open the banking center and you help customers with their financial needs like in all businesses they're good customers and they're extremely rude ones as well."
good,One of the worse companies for advancement. There isn't usually time for breaks. Even when you are on lunch don't be surprised if you get called back to help customers. Branches are always short staffed and turn over is a constant.
good,"I've learned about the problems people are having paying their mortgages. Trying to understand about escrow and how the money is distributed. I've learned about property taxes and insurance. The people are wonderful they are very helpful. The hardest part about the job is angry people that are not getting the answers they want, and being transferred from department to department. The most enjoyable part is being able to help someone with the right answers and maybe just a kind word."
good,Bank Of America could close more loans if they improved the systems that underwrite and process loans
good,"The Department of Justice has been actively involved with the work I'm a part of within the bank. We received word that the government will be pulling out Dec. 31st and that operations are unclear as to what direction our department will take. The process has been extremely unorganized and now leaving employees guessing after many layoffs within our department, where we stand in the process."
good,To many corporate politics it's not about the job you do. It's who you know that gets you ahead.
good,"16,000 jobs are being let go before the end of 2012 (or so they say) My job is one being affected. I had job security until they needed to stabilize the company and are closing entire sites."
good,"The company has great benefits, just poor on advancement. The salary isnt that much."
good,Company changing departments and assignments every other month and changing requirements and guidelines during a month. Learned that large corporate companies don't look at the individuals just the bottom line.
good,Bank of America cares nothing for its employees. They are numbers on a spreadsheet
good,Not lot to say here since I was not there for very long.
good,"The compnay as a whole is decent. the work is easy once you learn it, but can be difficult to learn due to the minimal training that is provided."
good,This was a good job. Steady work flow and never a boring moment. Always learned something new.
good,"not good management, if you get the right management the job would very GOOD! My manager harass me all the time!"
good,Work independently on reports and review current changes on regulations or policies.
good,Merrill provides excellent products and services for the affluent investor.
good,"Like every company it has its ups and downs. The department was clickish and seemed to form into smaller groups, the ones closer to the manager are the ones who could get away with anything. Otherwise it was a job I enjoyed even though I performed mundane task every day. There was no chance at career development in the particular department."
good,"Typical day at work was being on the phones accepting inbound calls and placing outbound calls via autodialer and manually. When speaking with cusotmer, had to provide debt counseling, interview customer for loan modification or other workout options. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to help customers in distress as well as co-workers. The hardest part of my job was advising homeowners that there were not any options available and that their home will be going to sale(foreclosure)."
good,"I enjoyed working for BofA, however being in the Mortgage Business your always going to have ups and downs and unfortunately, we were in the down stage so my position was dissolved."
good,"I generally have my next day work activities written down before I leave work. I have a list of clients and prospects that I will need to talk to about banking, leverage, portfolio, financial plan performance, commercial lending needs. My goals are to make 25 contacts, 12 commitments and 3 referrals a day on the prospecting side. I have a goal of how many accounts I want to open each month and how much revenue I want to generate. The management team is marginal at best, co-workers are pretty solid and helpful. The lack of support is the harderst part of the job. The ability to meet individuals and business owners and to make a positive impact on their lives is the most enjoyable."
good,My typical day at work was usually fast paced and very informative.
good,"Lead, Manage and Coach a team of 14 members at the Banking Center"
good,I enjoyed working at the bank. It can move very smoothly daily as long as you are willing to learn.
good,When I started management was wonderful as there was concern and teaching constantly. There were always positive greetings from all co-workers as well. I learned to make sure you ask questions if you felt their was a mistake amiss. The hardest was making sure you all that was required correctly and efficiently (number stats) The enjoyable part was when there was a meeting there were games focused on positive feedback from mangement. When I left management seem to turn to the dark side of negativity as it changes hands. Since there was a long hall to walk you had to make sure you stayed close or ran when your time was up from breaks or lunch.
good,"Management did not care much about their associates or well being. They treated associates as tools, instead of human beings. Even when associates tried to shine in their roles, management would find some way to lower morale."
good,Senior bankers have no patience or tolerance for misunderstanding.  Most junior bankers are only there for 1-2 years and then leave to join a PE fund.
good,"CONS: Very high stress environment and favoritism, not enough proper training. Not a pleasant working environment."
good,The banks culture is terrible. Upper management is negative and they micro manage. The turnover for employees in the small business space is ridiculous. Dont know how that process is sustainable for any business.
good,This company is all about micro-management. Was there for a long time but there was no room to move up in the company. Barely made any money and the base pay was low.
good,"Great benefits, cutthroat culture. "
good,"Bank of America is cutting staffing in their branches. This leaves you to deal with the angry customers. You work like a car salesman, where your manager must approve of you and your customers interaction before the customer is allowed to leave. Your branches are held to a standard that they cannot meet because they do not have the staffing to do so. They have wonderful benefits for families, but the pay is very low  and long times employees make the same as new coming ones. It’s a slap in the face for people who have worked hard to get where they are."
good,"people are nice, there are lots of systems/software issues, tons of different systems that seem confusing and overwhelming - could be streamlined to make things more user friendly for its employees."
good,Limited job opportunity advancement into positions of higher responsibility.  Bonus structure changes continually making it frustrating to place the client needs first.
good,Employees that can dedicate 110% on an everyday basis will do well here. Pace is very fast and you will be left behind if you have a couple of bad days
good,Customer service oriented role with many opportunities to boost incentive income and help clients make sound financial decisions regarding inherited assets. High productivity culture that management tries to balance with adding new responsibilities almost on a weekly basis.
good,Good experience and competitive environment. You can get exposure to new technologies. Dressing business casual environment. It is fun to work in that corporate environment.
good,pay and benefits were good just to didnt make up for bank morale. very corporate environment. asset to have on my resume because its s prestigious company but wouldn't go back.
good,Keep your head down and stay low key. Do not try a buck the system. Get into the culture and follow it if you desire to stay long term. If you don't you will be sorted and eventually cut out.
good,Things could have been better under the right manager and showing that they are there to ensure you that you are in good hands with them. Great team to work with.
good,"Overall, my experience at BOA was ok. Management didn’t seem to know what they were doing at times. The morale for employees was rather low. It did seem like things were turning around at one point, but things ended up going downhill."
good,"BOA could be an excellent place to work with if you were lucky enough to have a good boss. The benefits are outstanding. The working environment was great. The leadership team really cares for the company, but they have some bad apples in the mid-level management. "
good,"Horrible management, no HR department, no way to advance in most roles, mediocre salary and hope you get on a team or work for an advisor who actually values your work and rewards you"
good,"Great befits,pay o.k,training is excellent as far as coaching and compliance.The bank will will give you all the coaching and resources you need.Unrealistic goals but overall a decent company too work for."
good,"Boa as a whole is great but this department sucks...the whole department is stressed out, management doesn’t care about your concerns...overworked and underpaid"
good,very hit or miss with good places to work. You could be in a great group or a terrible one. With 150k employees you could get anything. Managers come and go often.
good,"Bank of America provided me and my family a tremendous amount of great things in my time there. I had great pay, benefits, loved my co-workers, etc. I built a reputable career within the company. I worked daily very close to my associates and clients to make sure they were always taken care of. I made sure I was that person people came back to for whatever they needed."
good,"Repetitive, not a lot of room for growth. Must stay for years to move up. Company is constantly doing the same things. Good work hours if you have kids"
good,"Not a reliable employer, always creating issues, with no evidence or proper documentation "
good,"Bank America has a great curriculum and they are very organized! You are always aware of any changes going on. The down fall is management, especially when your a single parent. It is hard to be approved for a flex schedule and any late is an occurrence."
good,"Fast paced work place, can be stressful at times due to customers and management pushing.  The hours of operation are consistent everyday, the center hours are 9am- 4pm Monday-Thursday, 9am-6pm Fridays, and 9am-12pm Fridays.  You are expected to come in earlier than opening to perform certain financial duties and stay until customers have left the center.  Pay is excellent, benefits as well."
good,"You can never do enough at BOA to satisfy them. Once you meet an expectation they move the bar including the compensation structure. They will tell you that you have unlimited earning potential in the sales roles, but it is not true. They adjust the pay scale monthly so that your average income remains the same. From the time I started working there to the time I left I was having to do three times the work to make the same pay. Their idea of rewarding you is not in comp but in snack carts and jean days. If you are a child that needs someone looking over your shoulder at all times then they are a great place to work. I will end on a positive note by saying their benefits are amazing."
good,"Bank of America has great benefits and good pay. Bank of America is a well rounded company and has many job functions, that you can get experience with, only downside is they lay off ""downsize"" alot."
good,You will find management structure to be discriminating.  Most minorities will be at the lower lever as a diverse place to work. Will nitpick to discharge or layoff associates
good,"Work overload. Learned leadership skills development. Market manager had favorites, unethical. Workplace pace was stable or fast paced. Audits will make or break you and the auditor also has favorites. Enjoyed all non- management employees."
good,"Great benefits. I committed 12 years to BOA but when I needed them the most, during a personal medical issue, they had no loyalty to me as a long term , hard working, employee. I was just a number to them."
good,"Good employees are lost to constant layoffs, senior management, especially in technology does not value its employees.  Resources are spread thin, not enough resources, transition is high, experienced staff is moved to roles they are not familiar with"
good,Really not a bad thing to say but the area manager was less than ethical I guess that's why he is no longer there. The work was plenty overtime was there and regular management was not bad.
good,"Exciting, not knowing what the day has to offer. Enter a fun filled work environment with friendly customers who makes the day that much better. No matter if I'm at the window, or on the floor, it was exciting."
good,"Every Friday there was a spread but only certain people were invited to participate. The Manager did not promote equality. The work was actually good and so were the processes; however, the Team Lead was not helpful and if you made a mistake, she and the Manager would talk about you to other people and used company IM to gossip."
good,"During the four years there, I have seen many positions disappear. I believe in creating an appointment based and digital adoption as much as the company does. That said, taking hours away so that customers have to wait is not the way to conduct business. The associates are also being worked that much harder 6 days a week for the same pay."
good,"One of the biggest things upper management encourages at Bank of America is exploring internal job opportunities that may arise in other areas of the firm and are of interest to you.  However, doing so is much easier said than done, and approaching your manager about an internal opportunity is not always met with the open-minded enthusiasm promised by upper management."
good,Unless you are a top performer don’t expect to move up. They are extremely strict. Any metric you don’t meet could lead to termination. Management could improve there communication. Customers give you bad surveys due to wait time or for not refunding fees and you can’t remove those surveys from your metrics. Very stressful.
good,"No one takes a break. No one encourages someone to take a break.  Federal law says you get breaks.  Taboo at the branch I was employed. "
good,Managers never pushed for goal expectations that were extremely unrealistic and associates were greatly pressured to meet these goals. Compensation was very low and there was a large turnover rate.
good,"Bank of America could be a good place to work but the higher management is prejudice. If you're not one of the ""favorite"" then you are looked over and/or obsolete. Also, quantity instead of quality is the main focus....numbers driven. I was employed there for almost 19 years and was displaced abruptly. Sad to say but there where others with more tenor than I that this happen to.  In conclusion, it's who you know and how well you ""suck up"" that determines how far you get in this company!"
good,"Lack of communication, entitled workers, other employees disrespectful to management. employees taking 2 hour lunches, sleeping during work hours, Customer Service on platform side was mismanaged and always short handed,"
good,The benefits were good. Management had difficulty deciding on a path and constantly moved associates between locations after they had developed customer bases. This ultimately led to lost income from bonuses and longer commutes with consulting the associate.
good,"When I first started, I was proud who I worked for. As time went by, the sales goals began to change every two years. It was very challenging, at times. I loved what I did, but the stress of achieving sales goals became too overwhelming. Every couple of years, you would get a new manager. Nothing was consistent."
good,"there are too cooks in the kitchen so to say.  Very top heavy management culture, everyone wants to be a decision maker, minimal doers. it's a great place to learn but expect minimal work life balance."
good,It was an fantastic place to work a few years back - but that is no longer the case.  Very poor treatment of employees.  No management loyalty.  Harsh and frequent layoffs
good,"This is a good entry level job, pay is decent and benefits are nice. On the job training is lacking for certain teams and subjects. Busy environment so not a lot of one on one time."
good,"I worked for Bank of America for 13 years. When I first started, it was NationsBank, and it was a much better company to work or. Once it converted to Bank of America, it went downhill. I have been gone since 2008, so I have no idea what it is like to work there now."
good,"Most decisions were made from the perspective of what was best for the bank, even when the bank's needs conflicted with what was best for the client.  Everything was done to promote management of client assets in the most efficient way possible for the bank.  The bank took the position that it was a privilege for the client to hold their assets at the bank !"
good,"Too many meetings, and unreasonable expectations of individual, team workload.  Executive leadership out of touch; operate sweat shop environment.  Good employee base, strong team work and motivated to get the job done no matter what."
good,Was promised a temp to perm opportunity but found out that it was converted to or was actually a contract assignment that ended without warning. Very displeased with the deception of management and staffing agency even after the team was told that we were to become a new department handling all asset transfers and mutual fund setups.
good,I worked from home 100% of the time.  You do not bond with your co-workers in this type of work environment.  It made things a little more difficult to get done.
good,"fast pace, information overload, not a good place for a family oriented person/persons.   "
good,"so much stress put on the associates, it makes working as a team difficult. They company has gotten too big. Takes  a long time to move laterally within the company."
good,"I've been at Bank of America nearly 9 years and I am routinely a top performer. Yet they took away bonuses for all mid and low level employees, and the raises are almost never above 2% annually. The benefits (insurance, PTO, 401K matching 100% up to 5% contribution, etc.) are amazing! But, I make way less than I could somewhere else and management doesn't care. Bank of America treats employees like cattle. There are layoffs at least twice a month, every month and we're told to simply be thankful we have a job when we bring up the low pay."
good,"The position I work in is a sales position, bottom line. The management never cared about me or my advancement but only the bottom line. Don't for one second believe that Bank of America cares about you or your well-being over their production goals and revenue."
good,Out of the decade that I have been employed at Bank of America.  I am not happy with the pay and the opportunity for career advancement.  My raises does not match the cost of living and I am stuck in my job position with no opportunity to advance.
good,"The hours were fine, but the pay was not commensurate with the responsibility (being responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash), stress or workload."
good,"stale culture, management is selfish and does not care about individual advancement and development for younger associates. Doesn't competitively pay relative to other banks."
good,call center phone and off phone job positions dealing with different type finacial accounts depending on line of business. assisting customers seeking some form of resolution related to there account with bank of america. Is constantly changing so would need to be a fast learner and adjust with constant changes.
good,I enjoyed my position the tellers were great the customers were also great. Most of the branch managers were good after a few years working there things started to change & not for the better the higher up corporate staff was not so pleasant to work under they had you stressed out all the time. Not a good environment at the end.
good,"Political , competitive and favoritism by management.  "
good,"Flexible schedules, great working hours, benefits, discounts and free premium checking account. The pay is too low for cost of living. Other than that it’s an ok company."
good,"It was my first banking  job in USA.  Learned a lot.  However, one's success and failure depends upon quality of supervisor and management at branch level."
good,"I worked at the bank of over 13 years. The benefits are great . However management needs a lot of work. Leaders are often not transparent. However I had 2 kid while employed and the medical benefits, childcare reimbursement and vacation and time off is great. The areas I worked in had no clue of work life balance. Traveling and working 16 hour days."
good,Bank of America is a great place to work when thee morale in the office is up. I have worked in both types. The hardest part of the job is having to worry your job is safe from layoffs/cuts. The most enjoyable  part of the job is loving coming to work when you have an awesome group of teammates to work alongside.
good,It was ok while it lasted. Work-life balance depended on where you set your limits. there is no regular training for betterment of employees. pay was ok.
good,"Train tellers, balance out tellers. Load up ATMs.  Held meetings with tellers before the day started.  Overlook deposits and withdrawals.  Cash count teller.  Prepare for auditors. etc"
good,The temporary work with Bank of America was available depending on the amount of NY State tax returns came in during the tax season. It was there only for a few(3) months and was contractual lasted a few yrs.
good,High paying and all focused on operations. Previous sales practices prior to and during 2008 caused many internal controls that were not necessary and the roles focus was entirely operations driven.
good,Working for  Bank of  America was a great opportunity to test out my customer service skills. They are  very customer based always putting them first.
good,Not available because I haven’t worked there in so long to give an accurate review based on the way things are now. I know they should do more for their employees in regards to pay and compensation.
good,"Company is good for new graduates who want to gain experience, but overall the pay could be better.  Would only recommend staying for about 1 to two years and then find another company to work for."
good,Very process oriented to the point where this is flexibility is hampered. Many activities are performed just because they are always done a certain way. Data distribution is performed just to satisfy a requirement that is rarely re-evaluated. There are entire teams devoted to single stream activities like maintaining and updating technical recovery plans. While there no effort in reviewing the actual content in the plan only the date on the plan title sheet is updated to satisfy the update requirement.
good,"BofA is great pay but the work environment is stressful. Things are always changing, whether is be with policies or within the center itself. There is favoritism amongst manager with teammates and that can bring anyone working there down. They pick and choose who they want to be successful based on how well you bow down. I stayed as long as i did due to the pay and the benefits. Other than that i dreaded walking through that door everyday."
good,"the hardest part of the job trying your best to just keep doing your best at your job but in the end you feel very unmotivated due tot the lack of advancement in the company,"
good,Flexibility and management who cared about your career and connected you with other contacts if one had a desire to seek other opportunities within the company.
good,"Every process in the the firm in monitored and measured."
good,This company is great and I learned a lot working there. All of the managers work together to make the team strong and dedicated when working on projects.
good,"When you join Merrill Lynch, you'll tap into wealth management experience that has been formally training and coaching new advisors through our PMD program since 1946. The PMD program is designed to develop the critical skills and knowledge necessary for building a successful wealth management practice — acquiring clients, enhancing relationships, providing tailored strategies and more."
good,There is not much to say about them. In sales there is not much room to grow.I would not recommend them employment. Unless you have a huge customer base.
good,I gained knowledge on the financial industry we did have sales quotas to meet and sometimes I felt we were all being repititous not allowing us to give customer service the way we would like to we kinda sounded  like a broken record
good,Bank of America was a tough place to work.  It required you to work weekends and long days.  The amount of work for one person was equivalent to two people job.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is developing relationships with client and coworkers.  High stress environment among Financial Advisors, more collaborative among service professionals who are face to face with clients."
good,"Very busy and no place for errors"
good,"IT was fun in beginning and challenging later to deal with multiple teams it was little difficult because of their incapable skills."
good,"BofA is a good place to start a career, presenting opportunities to learn from experienced professionals at a well known bank."
good,"Management seems more focused on expense reduction than innovation and improvement. Abundance of middle management has led to a bureaucratic environment where things are done to ""tick the box"". "
good,I was a contract employee... was only there for a year... the management was young and inexperienced. It is a large company so your voice is not heard. Overall it was not a bad place to be.
good,Working at Banking of America was my first professional job. I helped clients with banking transactions. I referred clients to the banker when an opportunity arose.
good,"typical day is 8 hours in a low rise cubicle. tribal knowledge is essential. management offers opportunities. benefits are good. culture is strange, non-social."
good,"Typical work day,  includes answering questions and speaking with Financial Advisors and Client Advisors about Bank of America mortgages and Home Equity Lines of Credit for clients who are Merrill Lynch clients."
good,A typical day at work was to see multiple deal proposals that needed analysis quick turnaround. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with a wide range of business representatives.
good,"In my 14 plus years with Bank of America, I can safely say that nearly all of my experiences are 'as expected'.  You'll find the same tiered management system as you would in almost any corporate workplace and management positions typically going to those that know someone in management personally."
good,"Okay-ish company"
good,Good salary however always run on bare bone structure with minimal headcount. Three or four restructuring in three years. Exposure is good though. However RMs do not own credit underwriting process which is a bit disjointed.
good,It's not a bad company to work for if you don't mind lots of politics and not commitment of decisions from management. Typical financial industry where the main concern is getting a bonus.
good,"I was extremely happy and loyal when working for Bank Of America. 2 years ago I was transferred to marketing without my input. The new manager did not like me. The Bank packaged 3 other people before me that worked from home and was not a MBNA employee originally. I was set up for failure and even though I am being paid until January 2019, I wanted to retire with the bank."
good,High volume call center that was very customer service oriented even in the fraud department.  I learned a  lot about credit card servicing from collections process and  the companies' logic behind fraud detection and servicing. Hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers who were sometimes abusive and constant turnover in my department which created a tense atmosphere. I think the most enjoyable part of working at BofA was my team members and the relationships I cultivated there.
good,"Everything has specific procedures, most very detailed.  There is actually a script that pops up for cross selling, at you are expected to use their exact wording."
good,"My goal is not to return to financial/banking field"
good,"If you fit in, great. If not, you are never promoted or given a raise regardless of top performance each quarter. The regional manager is rude and the manager doesn't care about the company. He just wants to get out of there as quick as possible."
good,"Too large a company for them to recognize individual talent. Once you are in the company, average annual raises are 3-4 percent no matter how well you perform."
good,8 hour shift that was highly demanding from the beginning to the end of the shift. I believe I did help my customers effectively. Extremely high rate of turn over of staff.
good,"Ok place to work  but very unorganized, hard to work together because every team is in competition with one another instead of working together it’s a battle of the many managers ."
good,"No other jobs were readily available once the contract was up.  Management not prepared for further employment for contractor. "
good,"As a Relationship Manager, you can expect daily stress, high sales goals and a lot of demands put on you like outbound calls, staying late for call nights, and weekly sales meetings so they can tell you what you are not doing well enough. Constant coaching on how to make more sales."
good,"I  have  had  better  jobs  in  the  past.  If  the  job  paid  more  for what  you  have  to  deal  with  on  a  daily  basis  it  would  be  a  lot "
good,"Bank of America was a very fast and sales oriented company."
good,"The culture is not conducive to young people. They stick you at the bottom of the totem pole and give you a phone and say ""good luck."" Would never recommend this career path to anyone."
good,"The management overall is good.  The work/life balance is good.  Occasional overtime is is required, but not necessarily on a routine basis.  Flexible work schedule is often available.  Ability to purchase additional vacation is a big benefit"
good,i was a top performer in the preferred sale division and the y underpaid my bonus by $1200.00 and it took 5 months for them to fix their mistake. you cant treat top performers that way.
good,"Manager was a jerk, BoFA didn't care whenever he got reported. Didn't matter they shut down the branch anyway. All CSR's were forced to make sales when it should be a bankers job."
good,"Overall OK"
good,Great company but stressful management. In SAP it’s all from one foreign community. No diversity.  I have been here for 5 years but no hope in growth and security
good,"There are Bank of America branches everywhere. In fact, there is one a block away from where I live. I worked 26 miles away and my branch manager refused to approve my request to transfer to a closer location."
good,"The position has since ended, but it was a great experience while I was working there. Great people, sufficient managers and work was challenging, yet fulfilling."
good,learned a lot about the financial industry. poor management. good vacation time. flexible hours. a lot of volunteer opportunity fro community involvement
good,"Okay job, some management is good"
good,The experience in working at Bank of America was learning something new and being and agent of change. Helping co-workers adjust to change. The manager were helpful.
good,"I would recommend the bank to others that are actively searching for employment .They offer great benefits the pay is not the best but they try and make up for it in other ways,"
good,"Bofa has great pay and a few awesome Mangers. The consistency on what is expected and what is reviewed towards preformance is unbalanced.  An employee can be rewarded but, coached on under preformance."
good,"good work environment, fast paced work load, there is not anything further that I am willing to discuss in regards to this job with Bank of America. Thank you,"
good,"Bank of America is a relatively okay company to work for. The management was not very helpful, the scheduling was the worst part having to work six days a week. The job felt like a really bad routine."
good,"Very cut-throat and a ""boys club"".  In other words, if you have friends who work there, then it's probably a great place to work - but if you don't then they'll get rid of you to bring their friends in.  Little to no notice that my contract was ending WAY early - like 10 months early on a guaranteed 18 month contract."
good,"technology has changed this company to remove employees from their locations. Causing many people to get promoted, demoted or even let go from the company. This is one of the main reasons I have been looking for a new job. The security of a persons job is dimensioning."
good,"When I first started it was wonderful. The sales plan was well thought out and fair. However, with the changing times things changed drastically. Even though they were aware of the changing environment they continued to make it difficult."
good,"The company is solely focused on Sales; however, pushes an image of customer service and relationship building. As with every other retail bank, BofA isn't much different."
good,"All about Sales.  The sales aspect is not that hard, however all the logs, systems, etc, having to be done takes away from you actually focusing on the client/sale."
good,"The work at the bank was not difficult but the politics was. During my time at the bank, 2014 was the one year where the work being performed brought satisfaction and a sense of purpose and I wasn't being hassled."
good,My time spent at Bank of America taught me how I want to be perceived as a professional in the financial services industry. My level of management to report to was vast. So when I comment that the layers of internal management is overwhelming that's a true statement.  To be successful you must work within a successful enviroment.
good,good management but never job security. unable to move up in the company. wish there would of been more opportunities but unfortunately in my area there was not any.
good,"A good place to get experience and move on, but it's difficult to move up or get a raise once your in.  They are currently going through a digital/technological make over, which is the reason for less openings on the retail side, as hours and positions are being cut daily.  If you are lucky enough to get in, treat your job like gold and try to move up as quickly as possible.  Things will be getting tighter soon as the tech improves, the work force required eventually decreases."
good,"Has great benefits, but will let you go for a buck. Do not get attached to your job. They will move you to a job you did not apply for or want with no choice."
good,Although this position was seasonal I did learn quite a bit from the floor manager who was very patient and helpful. I felt like a part of the team...
good,"When I joined as MBNA (97 - 01) as permanent staff it was very much who you knew - and very cliquey . "
good,"- Exposure to multiple lines of business creating an opportunity to network with a variety of teams/functions."
good,"sales driven account manager position. No help for customer abuse, very stressful. Forced to cross sale products and services to  customers that don't want them."
good,"Great Benefits, but high stress level! Upper Management and above does not care about your work/life balance and you are seen as indispensable and made aware of it."
good,BAC is a fast paced and competitive work environment. I have worked there for 15 years now and have held various roles within the company.  I am currently in Community Relations.
good,"Scheduling is horrible. however the money is pretty descent. You pretty much dont have a life and are slaves to the job. The review for an employee performance is completely unfair and bias,.overall not too bad place to work if you trying to make some money not s long term company I would want to work in."
good,"This bank just line big companies really doesn't care about its employees, all they want to do is profit off of people no mater how. Management varies from center to center but all care about pleasing upper management."
good,"being a teller is tough, dealing with frustrated customers and management who's under pressure to produce sales.  the actual work is not hard, entering info and banking rules."
good,"The best part of the job is interacting with our customer's and helping them with their accounts.  Being able to provide the customer the information necessary to protect not only their Bank of America accounts but other accounts and information from their credit bureau reports if they had become victims of fraudulent activity.  "
good,"Virtually any role in Global Treasury requires 12-14 hour daily commitment and a fair amount of travel.  The position offers a lot of learning potential as you will learn the Global treasury landscape and the changing winds of the global business world.  "
good,"This company has some of the best trained retail banking employees in the industry, making them sought-after by other competitors. However, your personal experience in the company will be largely at the mercy of your coworkers and direct management. College educated employees might try elsewhere, as their education is often a detriment when having an expanded vocabulary can actually hold you down in an employment review if your manager feels threatened by it."
good,BofA was trying to brand itself as an investment bank during the 2000s but weren't willing to hand the reins to the investment bankers it hired.  It also misread the mortgage market at the end.
good,"Everything is in matrix organization with no one responsible for anything.  Does not value leadership for management skills."
good,It is a good starter job if you are looking for something to break out of nights in a retail job. I enjoyed meeting customers. A lot of pressure to make a sale.
good,"*Please note I did not work at a branch, I was employed with Mortgage loan servicing. "
good,"Inbound calls with adherence to quality, government regulations, privacy,accuracy, exceeding customer needs.  Lots of responsibilities and working in 18-24 software systems to assist customers"
good,"Bank of America was not willing to promote current employees, but rather brought unskilled workers to fill open positions.  My work was always challenging which kept the job interesting."
good,"The company as a whole is very disappointing in how it lets management treat employees.  Not to say all are bad, but for the most part, it was horrible.  They did a poor job with treating people fairly. I'd work for them again, but I'd be choosy as to which department I worked for."
good,"good money, but I just couldn't get with the excessive micromanaging. The hours were also long, but I atleast only had to work 4 days a week. Also the managers were not always on top of their game."
good,"unrealistic expectations from employees. Flexible with hours, so it is a great job for someone who is still in college. Little room for advancement in the financial center."
good,This company sees its employees as a number and that is all. Management was terrible and very unprofessional. The stress and pus for sales is simply not worth your sanity for the pay you receive
good,"There was no typical day.  Some days you worked from home, others you went to your office. Lots of travel."
good,Spent almost 18 years working for the bank. Learned a lot and had lots of training.  Constant change in corporate culture often preventing advancement due to constant confusion and churn.
good,"work life balance will be impacted, most of the work is in shifts and no shift charges. Not that employee friendly as compared to previous employers, overall average work environment"
good,"Enjoyed the teaming environment"
good,Offered no job security poor company overall to work for would not recommend to family or friends. Bank treats employees like numbers not associates.......
good,"As a teller, it was nice to be able to keep busy between working the drive-up window & the window within the banking center. There was always something to work on even when the banking center was slow; which made the day go by quickly."
good,"Good benefits but poor salary."
good,"Bank of America was a good job, but there was not much room to grow. There was only one career ladder, and if you did not want to climb that ladder the only other option to grow was to leave"
good,"Working for bank of america was a decent job for when I was 19 years old. They paid well at the time and I enjoyed my experience there for the most part. I worked there during the economy crisis and being so it became almost cut throat. The pressures of making sales goals became a large amount of stress in my life. They threatened to take away bonuses and even fire employees for not making sales of bank accounts. I have never been a sales person so maybe the banking industry just isn't my setting. Maybe for someone else that is a good work environment. Until then I enjoyed my job there, but quickly after things changed I resigned."
good,Enjoyed my time with BOA however the company was in transition and the office I worked in was closed. I could not commute to the new office therefore I had no choice but to leave the company.
good,"I have worked for Bank of America for almost 5 years. The company is very structured and you have to know corporate politics in order to advance. I would say it's an overall good company to work for if you are happy with 35k to 65k a year at most. You have to really put in work to advance, be creative, innovative, etc. I overall think Bank of America has changed but not for the employees benefits. Annual bonuses have been eliminated and commission structure has changed with higher to reach goals and less pay."
good,"I began my IT career as a paid intern with Merrill Lynch which became a full time job after two months.  Great experience gained working in their hardware lab, all hands on! Terrific working relationship with my immediate supervisor, was willing to work extra hours to meet large goals.  Rarely had an issue with going about daily tasks.  Good communication with team members."
good,Good benefits but management is not good. Company direction was not what I was expecting moving toward technology and less stuff regardless of traffic
good,"Cures title impairments by obtaining lien release and negotiates with the title provider to determine resolution of judgments, senior liens and other title issues.  Contacts various sources to research, verify and resolve title matters. Filing and follow-up on title claims, communication of title issues to management.  "
good,"Daily routine was to image on the first system all types of legal documents. Handled customer inquiries on a daily basis. Answered phone, filed all legal documents. Made spreadsheets for metric reports and destruction of documents. was a team player. Was always willing to go far and beyond to help clients with work situations even if it was something that I did not do, I would try to lead them to the right person. I enjoyed working with people. I am a hard working person who has a great personality and gets along with people very well."
good,Working in the banquet department doesn't allow a steady work schedule. With the decline of bookings . It's hard to pick up hours. On call shifts is not good.
good,"BOA is great in a sense that it provides you with the opportunity to learn, however, a lot of your happiness and work/life balance is dependant on your Manager."
good,"They try to sell to many products to people that don't need it. I would not go back. Not enough hours. as a teller you goin count your draw then start your day. if you don't have enough sales ( ex:credit card, savings account, checking account, ect.) you get a mark :(  I didn't like that"
good,"Very difficult to get going in Wealth Management world, especially right out of school. With account minimums set on $250k in investable assets; Days turn into cold calling 60-80 calls a day, and essentially feeing like you are under water. To make it in the industry, must bring in $10 million in fee based assets in first 12/mo's. Do not let anyone tell you differently. Helps if you can leverage senior advisor/partner that wants to help. OLD company culture. Average age in office ~50 yrs old."
good,I worked with and built a great team of people.  However I found it very difficult to get real improvements made as middle management made it very difficult to get some things done.  I heard all of the right things from Sr Management but real change was hard to do.  I was not surprised given the companies size.  I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,"Not willing to wait around, worked for myself for 15 + years in a totally different industry, have been more than successful in my current role but no understanding and or expectation for promotion/advancement in site. Totally disappointed."
good,"hard work"
good,not great work/life balance. hard to advance and even harder political game within the division. overall a very stressful career with little to no appreciation
good,"As a single parent, I have had to miss work to care for my children when they became sick. This was frowned upon by the bank (or at least my manager). I was even threatened with termination when I had to leave work after my son broke his leg. "
good,"The culture developing at Bank of America is structured towards inclusion and diversity, which on the surface sounds great, but in the end just segments the employees into groups and creates animosity and fear."
good,its very busy and fast paced environment. lots of stress and pressure but you will learn a lot to process mortgage applications. learning how to deal with complicated files
good,"pay was decent, but everyone in management had separate rules and expectations for each employee. Very little consistency when trying to find answers or assistance."
good,"Fast paced, timed phone customer service, many  unhappy  customers calls makes for a stressful job environment. Graded monthly on performance.  Enjoy speaking to many people around the country and some outside U.S.A."
good,"My experience was just that the co workers gossip a lot and do not tend to help others out and only focus on their potential gain. as far as management, they don't teach you what you need to learn. they just hope that you learn from online training courses"
good,Lacking in adequate training.  Pay not commensurate with education and experience requirements. Salaried employees are expected to take work home and/or complete work regardless of the amount of time required without additional monetary compensation or time off compensation/consideration.
good,"Enjoyed my Team and my immediate reports. Environment is very challenging as the bank continues to reduce teller line and staffing, can fee overwhelming."
good,"Just a huge organization where decision are made so high up the ladder that they don't know the full impact on the everyday life's of their clients or employees."
good,"Resolves Small Business/ Commercial claims within the bank's policies and  Received files from clients to process payments to million dollars "
good,"Overall the company is good to work for when it comes to benefits such as 401(k), health insurance and if Leave is needed. What I mean by ""if you're lucky"" is that if you end up with a great manager, they will look out for you and help you excel in your career. At the beginning of my career I had the best management team I could ask for which helped me be at where I am now. The company has changed so much and prefer to promote externally versus internally. Its sad to see as I have seen many great talent leave to other companies as they were not given the opportunity to grow."
good,"Bank of America was a fun to place to work, now they only care about sales and it doesn't matter how they get them. If you want to build a rapport with someone do it on your own time. Management wants to scrutinize you for everything and they talk down to you. 360 coaching is something that sounds good at meetings but good luck doing it on a one on one. I wouldn't recommend working here to no one."
good,"I must appreciate this place for giving me the opportunity to start my banking career, but other than that, it is a place that pushes you to brinks and I feel like a number instead of an employee."
good,OVerall: BOA is a pretty good co although downsizing happens frequently. Customer Service leaves a lot to be desired. Company downsizes positions only to bring them back years later at lower pay
good,"Management seems most interested in worker productivity (not that that is a problem - as they should be), so one should keep that in mind if applying there.  Not a bad employer by any stretch, and a great place if you are starting out.  There are many BofA Alums across many different employers."
good,"Night shift, learning treasury was good management was not bad,  work environment is good along with friends, enjoyed the work."
good,"I enjoyed working at BofA."
good,"Okay company,except when you are impacted by a headcount reduction, and your job is terminated for no reason."
good,I was a work from home associate which helped me balance my work life and family life and that was wonderful.  I enjoyed my job but there was not a lot of room for advancement due to lay offs and re-organization.
good,"On a day to day basis, work is productive.  Job security and management differs on a location to location level. Job culture could improve as the CA position is highly undervalued for the work they perform.  Benefits are decent but could be better."
good,Great people to work with.  Management is hit and miss with decisions.  Great benefits.  least competitive pay in market.  Very difficult to move up within company.  Flexible work schedules.
good,"I started off as a chat representative, but now I am on phones at least 3 days a week (which I did not apply for). This has happened to previous employees who were switched to phones permanently. Management will tell you that you ""may"" be placed on phones, and you will. Chat representatives speak with up to three customers at once. If questions are asked you will never receive a straight answer, or you will get the run around. There is a lack of communication between management."
good,"choose not to provide information about my company I work for. I value that this is wanted, but I rather not give information about the company they tend to frown on that."
good,Its a challenging environment. It gives complete work satisfaction with an individual being always challenged to innovate and improvise in the overall process. Very positive.
good,great compensation and structure. Did lack consistency and stability but overall I enjoyed being part of something special.
good,"Overall, it was good working at Bank Of America for the past 11 years. I had some great co-workers, i miss working with them."
good,This job do not accommodate employees to help them with life situations. Do not offer any job protection for new comers FMLA or anything in case of family emergency
good,Management was lacking in training. Expected too much of employees. Atmosphere was tense as expectations were too high. Did not allow enough time to get Authorities needed to move forward in position hired for. This was working for BOA/ contracted through Digital Risk. Review is in relation to Digital Risk Mortgage Services
good,"It's a wonderful place to work for if you need benefits and compensation.Everyone works together for better results. Coworkers were excellent at working hard and treating each other with respect, but Management is greedy. They require sales that are mathematically impossible. They require 10 sales per every 100 customers for each teller. There are 8 tellers and  4 personal bankers on a good day.The place i only open 9am to 4pm. Each teller helps at 150 customers on a regular day.That means the tellers should have 120 sales but each sale takes 30 - 45 minutes depending.  So each personal banker can handle at most 14 customers in one day. Management was inundating the personal bankers with too many sales that they were suggesting scheduling customers for appointments but when they are scheduled, the teller doesn't get credit for the sale. None of the tellers were making their goals, even the highest sellers."
good,"Typical day at work is incoming calls providing customer service as well as selling, you have to sale credit cards, checking, saving accounts, basically convince people of opening accounts they sometimes don't need, its all business, the pressure to sale is ridiculous that it stresses you, managers put the pressure on you because they want to bonus off your sales even if you don't bonus, they still will. Its great for people who like to sell. But if you don't like to sell then this job is not for you. They promise you ""great incentives which they make so hard to reach because of all the metrics. basically you are selling and not getting your incentive, only very few get it but those are the top performers. they do give you a lot of chances to miss work due to sickness fam issues etc.. very micromanaged. Overall BOFA  is a great company to work for great benefits as far as vacation and sick time etc..."
good,In my current position I research loan activity and provide customers with status of their applications.  We process customers applications in a timely manner. Customer satisfaction with the overall process is very important. I have learned that behind every application there is a story. Customers are very open to share the reason they are looking to obtain funds. Sometimes it is hard to bring the customer back to the conversation regarding the status of their loan versus continue to tell their story in a short amount of time. Teamwork is very important. I enjoy working with others and talking to our customers.
good,"the job position requires you to be very pushy.  every time a customer comes inside or in the drive thru,  we have to sell them something.  they do not want to hear about that. When people say they aren't interested you get penalized for it.  That manager at this specific branch would talk down to you and makes you feel dumb."
good,"job environment was OK, just long driving distance, i would like the job more if it was closer, the job setting was very calm and laid back"
good,"There aren't really any typical days at work with this company, at least not in the location that I worked. I did learn a lot about management of personal finances by seeing how customers would manage or mismanage their own finances. The management at this location was okay, but could have been much better. It seemed that the managerial duties always fell on the assistant manager, while the assistant manager still had to fulfill her own duties simultaneously. There was a lot of lack coming from the managerial position which would often cause an air of dissonance in the workplace. Every co-worker that I had the pleasure to work with, they were exceedingly awesome. We always got along with each other, and never did I have an issue with any of them on a personal or professional level. We always worked great together, and we all were very kind to each other. The hardest part of this job was telling a customer that there's nothing you can do in regard to their situation, usually one that was due to financial hardship. The most enjoyable part was being able to build relationships with regular customers and being able to work with such a great group of people."
good,I left Bank Of America in 2008 and the management was going through some changes. I did not feel I could do my job because of management dictating every move you made. Hopefully it has changed to the better since then.
good,Like most of corporate america you are just another number. Its very hard to advance because every 6 months or so the fire all the manager so there is really no where to go.
good,Tools aren't given to employees to be successful.  Very limited training and no accountability by anyone to get things done.  Benefits are decent.
good,I worked for BAC for 3 years and the growth opportunities were very limited.  I initially worked in Greensboro and the atmosphere and some of the management was completely terrible. Some management was not willing to allow younger college students the ability to grow unless you became best friends with them. I really enjoyed the atmosphere when I moved to charlotte and it gave me a different opinion and took my career to the next level.
good,"You can move up quick, and pays are better than other banks, but the pay isn't enough to survive if you have family. It is ok to work there if you don't have any experience."
good,"I am definitely not afraid of change; in fact, I'm usually the first one to throw my hand in to test new things, offer suggestions for better ways to do things, etc. At Bank of America, though, your job is a constantly moving target. In just two years, my role here has changed, completely, three times. It has gone from a high-level implementation and architecture role, to a mid-to-high-level troubleshooting role, and now is basically 80% server remediation. Management changes constantly, and no one has the same idea of how things should be done. They constantly go back-and-forth on their willingness to support working from home, and it's extremely frustrating. I am more than willing to do whatever is needed to get the job done, but it's difficult to hit a target, and fall into a great stride, when the target is moving so constantly."
good,"cool place to work, but you have opportunity to apply within the bank that was a good option. something you can get bored. there is a great deal of teamwork and 360 coaching"
good,"I began at Bank of America as a teller and was quickly promoted to Sales and Service Representative. I was able to learn a wide variety of tasks including processing depositing, opening checking and savings accounts,opeing IRAs, opening safe deposit boxes. Guiding clients to more comprehensive financial products such as Merill Lynch Services. The hardest part of the job was being overly concerned about meeting a quota and not being concerned as much about the guests,. I enjoyed the people I worked with and building relationships with long-term clients."
good,"Very Monday is typical day at work. I learn very much new things from my professional life."
good,"Various roles available in case you have the relevant skill set & competency."
good,Large company with competitive benefits but lags behind other companies slightly in pay. Regular shake-ups in the LAS division leads to constant changes and unfortunately the Bank of America brand statement gets muddled in the middle management area and appears to be a conflict between legacy Countrywide management style and Bank of America management style.
good,"Extremely, ""widget"" focused.  Very transactional sales position.  Training for the position was well taught and focused.  Co-workers are available to bounce ideas back and forth."
good,Low level management not trained enough in management skills and unsupportive.  Team environment has seemed to diminish over recent years.
good,"Act in a multilateral capacity as a banker and operations specialist"
good,Busy everyday which I think is good for the company. Some of my  co-workers are okay. Management style of my manager is not so good. I learned to deal with customers about buying and selling of different currencies globally.
good,"BOFA is a sell, sell, sell envornment.  Often micromanged with a long chain of management.  Stratagies are changed regularly.  Compensation on bonus plan was good"
good,"I love working at Merrill Lynch and work with wonderful people. I am only working part time (as I was hired for) as a Client Associate but am wanting to be more challenged in what I do. I am a Financial Advisor's assistant. The part time position has no further responsibilities or advancement and I would have to look around the company to stay there. I am looking for more opportunities besides what they have to offer and am open to exploring new ideas with different companies and industries. My typical day consists mainly of setting up appointments with clients on a regular basis, printing financial reports for clients, answering phones, working on spreadsheets in Excel, maintaining my boss's calendar within MS Outlook. I also contact new clients to verify information and put together new client information booklets. The hardest part of my job is there is not enough to do especially when there are no new clients. It can be monotonous, which I do not like. My manager is great and is very knowledgeable in the Finance industry which helps me understand it that much more. Overall, good job, just want more than a part time job and need a more challenging position!"
good,"Once boa was unter investigation, it was almost impossible to close any loan, subscquently almost 1 mllion dollars in my submitted files were denied"
good,"benefits are decent, pay is low, growth & development are minimal. Time off is good, layoffs are frequent - regardless of your performance. typical management - join the circle or you're more at risk."
good,"My peers are a friendly group t work with, management team does their best but is consistently changing directions but always supportive and appreciative of what we do and how we provide excellent customer service to our customers!"
good,Although I love the people I work with I have had 3 positions in 2 1/2 years which leaves you uncertain and felling unstable.
good,Was a go between call center for status of a short sale dealing with status on short sales during the market crash. Was very difficult handling the process with constant changes
good,Merrill work is an very challenging and rewarding place to work if you have an entrepreneurial spirit. If you don't have that drive the job will not work out.
good,"Great pay, long hours, the management in my area had severe communication problems with each other and many of the staff members.  I kept my head down and worked hard."
good,"You end up doing the same thing everyday - go in, get beat in the head about meeting sales goals, and having a long day ahead of you. If you're looking for advancement in a company this job just may not be for you. Their training process sucks and the management is shady!!!"
good,Downsizing - increased work load - Senior management still working to address bad acquisitions from the the past - stock price still under valued - experimenting with manufacturing technology for main financial platform
good,"I was happy to be part of Bank of America for nearly 7 years, however, there was plenty of room for improvement with regards to culture and opportunities for personal growth and career advancement. Despite the challenges I'm appreciative for the time I spent with the bank and I value the experience and knowledge I gained by spending the first part of my career at one of the largest and most influential financial institutions in the world."
good,Managers were more concerned with stirring up drama with the employees than actually being managers. I will never go back here.
good,I connected with potential clients and secured them as business partners by performing needs identification and establishing a relationship.  I also performed market research that kept me up to date with commodities markets and the general state of the economy.  I created reports and analyzed current financial documents daily.
good,working with clients to meet their needs on products. Work with co-workers to meet the clients expectations and provide quality service.
good,The Associates at  Bank of America are one of the best parts of this job.  They all have integrity and give their very best at all times.
good,There is lack of job security but the pay and benefits are great.  Employees are hard working and very friendly. There is a disconnect in communication between upper Management and Employees.
good,A typical day of consisted of carrying out my assigned duties. The company placed emphasis on following established processes. The best part about the job was their focus on work life balance. They have many benefits to assist you. The worst part was the lack of diversity. This included ethnic as well as diversity of ideals. The job itself was relatively easy because you are provided with the tools you need to perform.
good,"The current climate of the banking industries, in particular mortgage banking and servicing, lends to an unstable work environment and reduced management and leadership transparency."
good,Merrill was not the typical Broker Dealer.  Decent work environment and co-worker were always helpful.  Typical day included meeting with clients.
good,"Level of stress is very high, and posting to a new position is nearly impossible unless you have connections. I love the people i work with and the benefits are great! Overall its not bad but im looking to get it out"
good,"In wasa senior residential appraiser at BOA for appx 5 years.  In was asked to do illegal and questionable pratices in order for the bank to make more loans and therefore more money.  When I refused I was asked o resign, which I did.  I worked from my home and traveled around to look at residential properties in order to determine the market values for mortgage transactions."
good,"Some team managements are good and some team managements are not so good..."
good,"Believe it or not, this was a great place to work at. Everyone is very professional and friendly. The major problem is always at the top. Management makes poor decisions and then people suffer for them."
good,"Management always changing, retention of both employees and customers the biggest issue. The typical day starts with meeting with the team"
good,"Years ago the company was an excellent company to work for, but with new management has created a negative culture within its employees."
good,Great training but difficult to break barriers between division to move up.  Commercial banking focuses only in sales.
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"interact with some sharp individuals that drive the business with lack of automation. great co-workers minimal interaction with senior management. hardest part of day is dealing with some of the support teams [over seas], but for the most part great team interaction."
good,"Bank of America overall is a decent company. If you find yourself in  a sales position, do it well and get out. Ever changing guidelines. Overall decent company."
good,"Demands were / quotas were high.  Live and die by the territory you are assigned.  Some micro management but really no support.  Upper management made some moves, wasn't to impressed."
good,"Review mortgage pipeline, return phone calls and prioritize work load for the day."
good,Helping customers with different situations from account balances to on line banking trouble shooting.
good,"Manage strategic projects and program guidance/compliance for Collections, Bankruptcy, Foreclosure, Short Sale and Deed-in Lieu operational partners. Provide remediation of functional defects and improves operational effectiveness. Support Program Management to ensure compliance of GSE and CFPB guidelines and successfully perform against investor scorecard expectations."
good,A large company that grew too fast for a while and is trying to catch up with that growth
good,there isnt much to say about it. It was a job there were no benefits but the pay was good.
good,"none"
good,"Tough environment to navigate and grow in"
good,"excellent benefits, friendly co-workers, they are quick to lay people off and close offices if it saves the company a buck."
good,"Being a financial advisor is a cutthroat job where all that matters is the sales numbers, nothing else.  Sometimes that means even at the expense of the client; this part I did not agree with and did not feel I was a fit to their culture."
good,"Good career beginning job. Good benefits with tuition and medical benefits. Stock options were nice also. I felt great working for a large company, however the people in management had very little people skills."
good,They have a base training environment that teaches you the basics to do your job efficiently and accurately. They teach you how to look for fraudulent items with their on going training. The management team was always there. They do seem to push products on the customers when it is not always in their best interest.
good,"Working at Bank of America was a great experience. I’ve learned a lot about customer service and I gained a lot of confidence. The benefits very good and that included a health insurance, vacation, etc."
good,"Through the years, I have held many positions at the bank, and the people I have worked with have been great.  As a teller analyst, I enjoyed the process that checks and balances entail.  It was interesting to make sure that the tellers balances were correct, or if not, to be able to rectify the situation."
good,"BoA employees over a  million people; some of the nicest folks i have ever met work at BoA!  When in the call center, there are always challenges and games and lots of food and recognition too! oh and Balloons! lots of Balloons!"
good,"There are lots of lay offs, so there really isn't job security but I was impressed by the diverse culture and the number of women they hire.  People are busy but very friendly.  They also provide training, which is mostly done online, but it's still nice to learn something."
good,Bank of America is a great place to work. There's room for advancement and they are flexible while I'm finishing up school. I'm just looking for a job that relates to my career in nursing.
good,"Offers great benefits, flexible scheduling.  I learned banking systems and improved my cash handling skills.  My co-workers are great!  I love working with them.  The hardest part of the job is the customer service aspect, but that is also the most enjoyable."
good,I returned to work after an absence of 5 years.  Randstad provided me with an opportunity to regain my confidence and sharpen my Recruitment skills.  Built lasting networking connections.
good,"Some great and some not so great managers. I learned a lot, but I will not miss it. Great benefits."
good,"I learnt how important it is to have an equilibrium in relations, with customers as well as with co-workers."
good,A lot of turn over in upper management. Little to no direction from direct manager.
good,"This seems like a great place to work, and all the higher managers will tell you it's an amazing place to work. They make it seem like a prestigious job but once you get hired, it's a completely different story. You will soon realize they will hire just about anyone off the street. "
good,"I left ML after 4 years of employment, voluntarily, due to workplace bullying that - when addressed with direct superiors - was ignored, and worse yet, I was the one made to feel that  ""not everyone is going to want to be my friend"".  Since nothing was going to be done to protect me and my psyche at this already very stressful job, I saw no other way around it but to quit.  Bank of America as a whole is a good company with excellent benefits and I am not blanketing my experience with the whole company.  But I was an employee, notwithstanding, who was ignored when I attempted to reach out for help, repeatedly.  Your experience may, of course, vary.  I wouldn't say not to apply to them - just make sure you have a clear dialogue prior to taking the position.  Good luck."
good,Lots of promises about promotions and commission.  Great benifits and vacation.
good,Huge company but would not refer anywone here. The department i worked for was not professional enough.
good,"You'll receive about 2 months worth of training before you are placed on the floor for sales."
good,"~ a typical day at work would data reporting, audits on files, submitting escalation files to Underwriting, manager conference calls to discuss production numbers, coaching & developing."
good,"good workplace"
good,Great job with flexibility Traveling was very pleasant. Processors and Underwriters working side by side was very helpful. Friendly work environment. Branch manager showed appreciation to employees on daily basis. Also manager was helpful and understanding. Upper management extremely difficult causing extreme stress to employees. Several employees left the company. Continuous changes with-in.  Over all the branch I worked in was a joy to go to work on a daily basis.
good,"Management was required to push for production, however, the work load would not allow employees to make production for the most part. Lack of communication between departments often led to inaccurate data which led to daily changes and updates. Good communication within the department, however, no security."
good,"Large organization with several lines of business and layers of management located across the nation.  Provide me the skills and tools to learn the intricacies of communication across several chains of management to facilitate buy in on large scale initiatives aimed at creating efficiencies within the Bank."
good,"Good company for some--not for others.  Big Corporate.  Great training, generous start up pay.  Training classes and compliance heavy company--too much in my opinion.  Company had some strength and money behind it.  The processing was too slow."
good,"Management is great at keeping us informed at what needes to get done for the day, week and the month."
good,"Working long hours, being at work from open to close, while being forced to learn a lot of new things way too fast. Co-workers were mostly young, very rude and disrespectful towards management, while upper management were very unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was not wanting to quit and walkout due to all the chaos between employees."
good,some manager help you some don't underpaid hours change every 3 months with no regard to personal life stressful you break when workforce tells you to break based on call volume
good,"My experience with the bank was okay in the beginning when AI was learning about the business, then it became obvious to me that i was just another number in a huge corporation that doesn't acknowledge my existence. Management at the bank was a complete joke. They switch up managers so much it confuses new employees. Not to mention, half the managers there don't know anything about products and services. It was a complete waste of time asking them for help. Last but not least they set outrageous sales goals that are very difficult to meet and if you fall short, you can expect to be 'coached ' about it."
good,Very competitive work environment but adequate training and resources are available for use if needed.
good,nice people very helpful need to have upper management be on same accord commincation of things where not explained to the team clear
good,"Communication skills, patience and problem-solving abilities are required each day in a branch. When a person comes in, they are stuck in a problem and want to know what to do, We're problem solvers and teachers and are trying to help people."
good,"I worked with Bank of America for 18 months, and had over 5 different managers, 4 different jobs. I moved cross-country to be closer to corporate office, took a week off - managed a team of 12 employees before the move. A week later when I arrived I had lost 8 resources, had a new job, new team and was told about it when I showed up for work Monday morning."
good,Nice place and pretty good atmosphere. Great location and my team lead was very knowledgeable.
good,"My manager is about the only thing this company has going for it.  He's great, supportive and engaging.  Little can be said for others in leadership roles, advancement opportunities, training, benefits, enjoyment or sense of accomplishment."
good,"Management is horrible; no one knows the same thing. If you ask 5 managers they will all probably tell you 5 different things. The mgmt will team up on you; turn other managers against you if one doesn't like you. The Employee Advice and Counsel (they don't have an HR dept really) will just agree with the managers when they're supposed to be there to help you etc. The pay was nice, the benefits were okay. Not really a good schedule for people that have kids, especially if you're a single parent. I was married when working there so, I had help.  Now that I'm divorced it would be hard since the schedules end when kids are already out of school etc. Not so much of a good place to do business with as well.  They lose homeowners paperwork for loan modifications; they're risking losing their homes etc etc.. All kinds of irresponsible things of that sort; they're not really compassionate; I am so it was very hard to deal with working there."
good,A typical day at work is checking if any funding packages have come in to prepare for funding same day or next. I learned that being in constant contact with clients eliminates many client incoming phone calls and complaints. I work close with co-workers and help if they feel overloaded or behind and vise versa.  The hardest part of the job is telling the client that their loan is not ready to close. The most enjoyable part of my job is letting my client know that their loan has closed.
good,Simply put if you want to work somewhere and continue your education then Bank of America is great. If you want good health benefits and lots of vacation it is great also. If you want a career you might be better off looking elsewhere till the market is more stable for banks.
good,"The opportunity to learn more was the best part of this job, My team mates made this a fun and exciting place to work.  We all shared our experience with each other.  The extensive pipeline allowed me to learn about processes in many states."
good,"Good working at Bank of America."
good,I learned very much about many things that I never knew before. It was a very different type of job than I had before. Had monthly testing on rules and regulations. A lot of memorizing and must be very accurate with a lot of patience.
good,"The opportunity to be able to work from home is a plus!"
good,"Within the three years I worked for this company, I completed a total of four different positions in order to accommodate the market and business needs at that time:"
good,Management was not very good! Co workers where great! The hardest part of the job was not to let you express with the customers in their language.
good,"Worked independently, making sales calls. Tough business to get started in right now with economy so uncertain. Co-workers were were not team players, ""every man for himself"". Hardest part of job was cold calls, most enjoyable part of job was contact meetings"
good,"Bank of America keeps you on your toes. As a young professional you are required to understand all the kinks of a very large bank that is made up of different acquisitions that all seem to have their own unique issues. It can be very challenging to balance knowledge across all systems, products, lines of business, and subsidiaries. Delivering for clients is a very unique experience that takes strategy and skill that is learned over time mainly through practice. Along with knowledge of the industry and different financial aspects you really have to be a well rounded knowledgeable person to prevail in most departments. There is a lot of politics and bureaucracy involved at every level making upward mobility very difficult and sometimes impossible for others."
good,I did not like the fact that we as tellers would have to get customers to open accounts or other services.. we had to do sales and i do not like that.
good,"No management support"
good,"I managed to work for BOA for three years at different position and liked all of them. I started in the Mailroom opening and extracting mail. Preparing mail to be scanned, re-entered personal and account information that wasn't readable by the scanner. Then I was CSR assisting customer with there account information, making payments, explaining escrow information and routing customer to the right department. I also worked in the mortgage servicing department. Answered phones made contact with customer that were trying to re-fiancé or modify their mortgages. I enjoyed working at all position worked."
good,"loved the position, the customers, and co-workers, poor branch management  .Bank of America as a whole is great, the HR was tremendously helpful, during a family crisis, and was able to assist me and my family with the leave time needed. I will always be grateful to them."
good,"A typical work day consists of processing and revieing loan documentation. I've learned how to maintain a professional demeanor as well as how to apply acquired skills to different sitautions in order to resolve issues. The atmoshpere is hectic but laid back, managers and coworkers are hepful and easy to get along with. I enjoy the entire day."
good,Management would never give out our schedules on time. I loved being a teller but needed a full time job
good,"No advancement opportunities, employees opinions don't matter in this financial institution."
good,"Merrill Lynch is a top notch organization for wealth management, but you better know rich people.  You make your living making investments from everyone in your PERSONAL network or spend hundreds and hundreds of hours cold calling."
good,"Right hand does the same as the left and very frustrating place to work. Good benefits, cheap on pay."
good,"I learned how to handle customer concerns, also how to assist customers with financial concerns. I did meet some really good people working there. I really learned about team work"
good,huge work load and a lot of training and classes on top of all the daily demands
good,Lost in the shuffle.  Merrill got just too big to fast.  Management lost control.
good,The only issue I have with this Bank of America in particular is that management is really bad at scheduling and at delegating things to the appropriate people.
good,They laid my husband off first and then me when they took over MBNA and Fleet Credit Card Services. Both bread winnrs out of work! Not fond of Bank of America at all.
good,"I had great peers willing to help and train each other.  I learned a lot about investor guidelines, modification terms, mortgage legalities, etc.  However, the work volume diminished prior to my layoff.  "
good,My work day would start with a review of company provided priorities and comparison to my notes made from the previous day. The next step would be mapping my time-management throughout the day with the priorities which are most urgent in nature. A quick check with my manager for any special considerations and then I would jump into completing the tasks at hand. The most difficult part of my job was evaulating my progress and the best part is showing a customer how important they are by my level of service and attention to detail.
good,"Inbound calls verifying account balances,ordering new checks, replacing ATM cards, updating accounts."
good,"Banking of America allows my team and I the flexibility of working from home, which is outstanding.  Our day to day work is completed virtually using WebEx, screen sharing, SharePoint, conference calls, email and communicator as the primary means of communicating.  My team works great together and is all very passionate about our business.  Daily, my goal is to think creatively on how I can improve our processes and ways of doing things.  "
good,"I would review emails"
good,"no comment. I rather not say. good job, good people, but not so good pay."
good,At first my employment was not that bad. It was a production based environment and I have no issues with that. It was the treatment of management that was not so great. Being a contractor several managers had no problem telling you that you were a 'temp' employee as if it mattered to continuously bring it up. My co-workers were great!!!
good,"Typical day at work consist of cross selling products, uncovering and deeping relationships with new and existing customers. Meeting and exceeding sales goals. I have an array of knowledge in Mortgage loans, investment products, Auto Loans etc. Hardest part of job is exceeding sales goals, enjoyable part is meeting new people everyday. And making people's financial lives easier."
good,"Not too bad of a place to work. The jobs can be challenging, but the benefits are good."
good,it was ok but a little deferent that other companies I worked for
good,The hours are long and the pay is low. The Managers were very helpful.
good,This job could be amazing if they provided the proper training.
good,"I started out my career at Bank of America and continued to work with them for a number of years.  Received numerous awards for performance and the work that I had done.  Without warning and unrelated to performance, I was laid off.  This company has no loyalty and is only concerned about their bottom line."
good,Bank of America is a Great Company that is all about customer service and excellence.
good,"Sold financial products such as Credit Cards, CDs and loans"
good,"Day would start with a line of clients waiting outside the door. In banking you continue to learn daily because you will always get something that you have never seen or done before. Management was ok, it could have been much better. The hardest part about the job was time management. It was hard to manage time when you are constantly helping clients. The most enjoyable part was being able to please and help the customers so they leave happy and with a smile on their face."
good,typical work day 9-6pm. learned customer service and banking industry. Management depends on the person involved. Co-worker. Great for students to gain experience. 
good,"Get to work turn on your computer, you are on your own to get training done. A lot of cheerleading from the management, no real support. Stressful at times when management make you feel as if you are going to loose your job every day. "
good,"repetitive work, unrealistic expectations, no room for movement"
good,"Kept busy:"
good,"I love the job, its the management, we as employees have to fend for ourself, we have more knowledge, everyone has a different answer on the job, compensation has decreased, and raises are a bare minimum"
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with customer engagement whether it has to do with personal accounts, business accounts, or new potential clients, at Bank of America it is a duty to make sure customer needs have been met before he or she leaves the banking center."
good,"Assisting consumer and small business with financial needs. Bringing in new business and consistent follow up for existing customers to help meet and exceed financial opportunities. Daily sales goals and check outs to make sure all goal are met. Assisting customers by delivering excellent customer service in a timely manner. Accomplishments were being top in the market, delivering exceptional customer service connecting with customers to meet and exceed financial goals. Even if goals were met and compensation was promised, there's still a means for them to not give what was earned. Lack of connection between market management and teammates. No way to have a family life due to the constant pressure and stress of going over and beyond sales goals. Being at 100% is not enough. "
good,My typical day of work is handing the customer questions and concerns. Handling Risk based transaction. IThe hardest part of my job is dealing with angry clients.  Making sure my fellow associates following policy and procedure is my goal.  
good,"Great place to learn the industry basics and gain marketable experience, but consistently pays below industry standard.  Great place for employees with little or  no college to advance into upper management.  "
good,"Working in Malibu, be ready to encounter with a celebrity, and that was the case with me, that many of top Hollywood people will call me on first name basis. "
good,"A typical day at my job starts at 8:45, retrieve my money from the vault and prepare my stations. I learn about different transactions and financial situations and how to handle them.  "
good,"This is a good company to get your feet planted in Corp. America. You're given the tools to become successful, you just have to know the right people and apply the tools you are given."
good,I have gained a great deal of knowledge while working with the company and through various forms of communication with other departments and branch offices across US. Vast majority of co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The disadvantages were high benefits deductions and lack of growth and other opportunities within the department.
good,in newark we would get bum rushed in the morning for social security and unemploymeny days and the customers arethe rudest in newark w. market. but i learned alot and quick. the only thing i hate about this job were the auditors and the fact that if u get a question wrong the manager would chew you out for it. pay was ok but felt it wasnt enough for what we dealt with and getting refferals were hard due to the geogrphic urban location. noone had money or good credit to open account or credit cards which made it harder for us but the manager didnt see that nor care and only cared about how good she looked to regional and district managers to get her promotion
good,"Very large company, hard to get a sense of need within the business model."
good,Not paid what we were worth and treated as disposable rather than a team. No huge complaints because it was a job in a place where there weren't many jobs to be had.
good,the management at BOA really cares about their employees and are willing to help whenever someone has a problem
good,"A typical day at work would consist of 40-60% of my time being spent overcoming corporate and regulatory compliance or policy issues, or doing jobs that weren't in my job description i.e. playing receptionist or answering phones for other FAs that are non-productive. Getting started in this industry requires a large amount of work and a bit of luck. You have to build a business very quickly. One of the pros of Merrill is that they spend large amounts of money on their private client business providing you and the client plenty of resources to tap."
good,Most days I found myself making excuses to clients for the bank's lack of efficiency and customer service skills of operations people processing the loans. Too much focus on metrics. Not caring about employees or customers. Most of management tries to cover each other backs. Specially if they started with Countywide and know each other since then.
good,I learned alot on a typical day at BoA. I loved my team and my manager. I was able to work from home and my hours were flexible. My manager appreciated me as an employee and my work was always superb. Hardest part of the day was when upper management was stressed out. Most enjoyable part was working in a environment that was close and we all worked together.
good,Good place to work. Co workers are friendly. Good for career advancement. A lot of work.
good,"self starter, how to be a team player, friendly co-workers easy to get alone. working and communicating with my team member."
good,I tried my best and my best was great but that still does not advance your career with Bank of America
good,"I didn't enjoy coming to work daily with bank of america. I felt we were being treated as children and not adults when it came to getting work done. Management at the time was horrible because she allowed her personal life affect her work and her attitude at work was horrible, not good for a manager to do when having 20 plus people working under you."
good,It wasn't bad. Great experience overall and great team members.
good,"Extremely Intense, but very rewarding. The mortgage platform is not very good, which creates challenges."
good,Company's values in making customer first clouded the treatment on the associates.
good,process and review loans. Co-workers were wonderful very helpful
good,"I was Teller at BOA, the management at my branch was extremely unprofessional and rude. Employees were constantly being fired or quitting (that says enough.) Yes, BOA has plenty of room for growth but trust me it will take you many years before you move up. The pay is HORRIBLE! They start you off at about 11 bucks not worth all the stress. There are so many rules and regulations, they always find a way to write you up and try to get you fired. I hated working at BOA; however, I am sure each branch is different. The company does provide you with great benefits such as: Health insurance, 401K, two weeks paid vacation and 10 sick days (per calendar year.) They also reimburse you if you study something closely related to banking such as anything within business (you pay out of pocket, get good grades, have no write ups and they pay you back.) Good luck!"
good,"A typical day help customers with their issues and open accounts and sell the banks products. What I learned not to trust people. Management only looks out for themselves and they just give you all their work and make themselves look good.The hardest part of the job low pay for too much work and having customers disrespect you and managers say the customer are right no matter what.If you are a woman you will get paid less even if you teach the men how to do their job. The most enjoyable part I like some of the co-workers and I love helping new people everyday. Helping a young person start with his first home their bank accounts. Also, you have some holidays off so I can see my children."
good,"I've been with bank of america for 8 years, 7 of those years in the banking center until a recent lateral move to Global Technology and Ops. My first 4 years in the banking center were great, I was motivated and made all my sale goals as a PB. At first I was exceeding goal but as time went on they continued to increase without a pay raise while payouts decreased, the goals because unattainable. I managed to maintain at lease %80 of goal or higher in all categories but never over %100 as before. I was transferred to different locations sometimes without notice which was a huge inconvenience for me. I'm much happier in my new position but the culture is still the same, very difficult to move up in the company unless you know someone, advancement is not based off of experience or education and performance which is sad."
good,I was able to acquire several skills that will be very valuable in today's job market.
good,"I worked at this job for a few years and did not receive good raises or bonuses. I worked hard and was told to work harder. They had no regard for your personal life,wanted you to come in on holidays with no warning and threatened to fire you if you did have any outside issues. This is why I am currently not working for this company."
good,I enjoyed my time with Bank of America. My time there taught me another skill set which I have increased. I enjoyed my position and the chance it offered to make a difference in someones life.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company,however continued mergers made for uneasy days."
good,I hated this job but it would work with my school schedule and had benefits which is why I stayed there for 6 years.
good,Long working hours verifying commercial deposits
good,"Corporate culture changed with new business direction for the worse, whereas environment became much more stressful. Problems created when situations out of employees' control, weren't addressed sufficiently."
good,"I really liked working there i always stayed busy which is the best type of job you can have. Managers were smart and on top of things, our AVP would make our job a lot harder than it should be."
good,"In a day you could take anywhere from 60 to 180 calls. Each call could range from a simple question to a complex issue. Each manager follows there own managing style and geting promotion or achievments is at there decretion. The most challanging would not having control of your postion. At any time you could be moved or demoted to another position with in the bank for ""business need."" The bank helps you learn communication skills and how to deal with different types of people."
good,"Prior to 2000,it was a great company that offered world class service to customers and employees with opportunities to advance."
good,there was not opportunity for advancement. It was not secure enough due to the market.
good,"Sales sales sales!! Learned many skills to help with sales, customer service, banking industry, and operations."
good,"Typical day at work is busy and fast. I was educated about how to handle accounts and money. Management was poor, but it never stopped me from doing better. Hardest part of the job was when you ran out of ideas on how you can help the customer. Most enjoyable was helping our customers."
good,"All offices have there drama, my branch happens to thrive off of it. Several co workers openly admit to drug use including part of management. Customers sometimes have there own annoying moments, but for the most part they're a joy to help. Approach any prospective job within a banking center with caution!"
good,Call center environment. high volume calls. on site cafeteria. Goal oriented.
good,"My son, who was only 7 years old when he died October 14, 2006 of a brain aneurysm. I was on bereavement leave throughout the year up until October 2007 when management fired me, denied me unemployment said I was not meeting performance levels. I felt management was insensitive in displaying a lack of leadership to my needs during the very recent loss of my only child. After two months management finally decided to agree to my appealed via phone which included my case officer, my supervisor, and me. My appeal case worker stated my supervisor didn't give her valid proof why I was fired and approved me stating I was wrongfully terminated."
good,ZZThis company is always firing and hiring people. HIGH HIGH turnover.
good,"stressful and you have to pay a lot of attention dealing with Money everyday, all day."
good,fast paced working environment with knowledgeable team members.
good,"Typical day is 10 hours, many hours spent on the road going from banking center to banking center. I have been exposed to many different types of mangement, which has been of value, as I have taken both good and bad from each of them. I've learned that one has to be agressive and yet patient, as things do not always move as quickly as one would like. The hardest part of the job is the enormous amount of resources and information sources available and how best to utilize them. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people and coaching them to success."
good,"Bank of America has great benefits and opportunity. I have learned a lot about organization and structure. I have become great with multi-tasking, meeting deadlines and problem solving."
good,A typical day at work would be having a heavy volume of work that would keep me busy. I learned the importance of being at work and in doing so being on time and also to be productive at what you do. Management was not always fair but I guess one had to do what one had to do in order to keep their job. Loved my co-workers with whom I got along with very well. The hardest part of the job was when we were short staff and work volume was very heavy for I always tried to get things done accurately and on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was when after getting the morning work done we had a hour to ourselves to do what we called a huddle where we learned a lot about each other and had some time to participate in game playing.
good,Change in management and processes is constant. I have gained alot of experience in the mortgage industry while working here. I really enjoy the variety of people that I work with.
good,"work days are high stress if you work in mortgage, credit, or business lending."
good,I really enjoyed the culture and the values that Bank of America had. I met a lot of good people and developed a lot of good relationships that i still keep in touch with.
good,"just ok, did a lot with alll sides of the bank they want 60 hrs worth of work in 49hrs time treated like a number!"
good,"Come into work, and handed work. Required to be completed by end if day."
good,This was a great learning experience and a look into the epitome of American Wall Street firm. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Financial Advisors and Asset Managers who toyed with their clients' millions in the open market and advised on the spending habits. I also got to work on a few portfolios and optimize them for the greatest return on investment.
good,"The worst part of this job is that I like it on paper. Seriously, Merrill Edge offers a great opportunity to help people who typically wouldn’t have the chance to benefit from working with a financial planner. The people that work there are among the best I’ve met in the finance industry so far. That being said, I really don’t know if I can continue with the job. The problem, I suspect, is that the concept is fairly new to the company, and it seems that birthing pains are sabotaging the group. Between a very poor onboarding experience, issues with transferring licenses over, and a lack of communication from the untenured management, the problems have added up to a point where I have to consider looking for a new job. My issues ranged from being promised thousands more in base salary, only to realize that the recruiters made mistakes, to a change in the compensation structure that has left me working without any variable compensation for at least a year. The training is excellent, and many people have moved forward at this company in quick fashion, but a large group of people find themselves soured to the role after experiencing similar setbacks that I had faced. This has led to a fairly high level of turnover. It’s really a shame, as I consider the concept behind Merrill Edge a great one. I’m hoping once the department matures the issues I mention will be resolved and this group will move to the front of the financial planning industry. I just hope that I can afford to hold on and see that day."
good,There is whole lot to learn in this company but comes with a price: No work life balance.
good,"We take care of customers and there transactions threw out the day. We always try to learn a little bit of every bodies positions, from personal banker, sales and service specialist, and more. My manager and co- workers are great , its a great atmosphere to work in. The hardest thing about my job is that you have to be careful and follow policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping out the customers and by doing so in an every day basis"
good,Highly numbers driven work pace. Very bottom line orientated. Lots of pressure. Great co-workers. Great benefits with competitve salary.
good,I was a teller for Bank of America. I enjoyed getting to know the public.
good,The management is great and my co workers are awesome. I loved being able to help out homeowners to stay in their homes.
good,"A typical day at work is getting accounts done in certain queues to eliminate fraud for the company. The type of accounts I work are ACH (automatic clearing house), Balance Transfers, priority credit card delivery, and prepaid debit card. I locate fraud by using numerous tools and systems by the company. I also train new hire associates and I am the go to person due to my tenure with the company. The hardest part of my job is letting a customer know that they will not receive their funds from their ACH or BT as expected due to suspicion of fraud when it is valid. Customers can be very irate and having to calm them down and convincing them to still do business with us can be challenging through out my day. Growth with the company seems to be very difficult and management seems to be scattered. The most enjoyable part of my job is my schedule."
good,For the most part the people were the nicest at this company however the supv was not so easy to get along with but in my time working for this company i manage to get along with everyone and was comfortable in this environment this position was also a temp assignment.
good,"Bank of America's is a healthy organization with a lot of talented people and there's a wealth of information. Since the company has acquired numerous financial firms over the years, the knowledge base has expanded."
good,"Organized and prepared promotions, increases, transfers, and coordinated and distributed weekly time sheets and payroll for 60 service representatives."
good,I learned the Foreclosure side of the Mortgage industry which has equiped me to work in the Foreclosure arena.
good,"My job tasks changed over the years from cash handling, customer new accounts/loans, schedule management, banking center audit, loan servicing, and premier client relations."
good,"Low volumes and continous housing problems, layoffs are frequent."
good,I was able to see what a job of a financial adviser consists of and was able to participate in research of clients.
good,Aug 2005 to Feb 2010
good,"Location is centralized for Dallas residents, Part time positon with with less then ok compensation but benfits were offered at day one. Management staff was very informative and considerate. The schedule was a evening schedule so personally I think the positon is best fit for college students and singles."
good,In Lancaster the site for customer service is not a fair place to work. If you have a favorite they get all the breaks. If your not friendly with management then your job will be impossible.
good,"Company focus is production based. Training is web-based providing an individual pace; however, lacks specifics. Advancements are available provided work is performed according to end production, not necessarily, customer need. Meaning, quantity is more important than quality. Pay is average for banking industry, slightly less in mortgage industry. Benefits are typical. Management tends to be corporate viewed, yet reactionary. Expectations are not always clearly identified; those that are, not exactly obtainable. The work environment is professional. Office is clean and computer system is adequate. Amenities are sufficient. Security is appropriate."
good,"Production environment, user friendly technology, and team oriented."
good,"no advancement, not even close to average salary for positions, sites closing everywhere."
good,"Banking is a heavily regulated industry, you have to be familiar with regulations since the FED audit each quarter. And you have to meet sales goals even though it's just a teller position"
good,"BOA has a lot of natural business but they do not seem to have a common focus among management. After working there for many years, they started re-structuring virtually every year, bringing in a new department head, who had a different vision. There was no continuity of staff."
good,"My job ended at this location because they closed the office. The job was high paced, high stress but could be very rewarding helping to put borrowers in the homes of their dreams."
good,"Good company to work, you get very good exposure and contact within the company.Stable job and good work environment. Compensation depends on the group you work."
good,"After 8 years I finally had the opportunity to move up in the company. The pay was mediocre for the work load. This included sales goals, balancing the atm and teller work. Working for BOA, it was clear that everyone was replaceable."
good,Company expects way to much from one person. They add more and more responsibility on. You do the job of 3 people. No support. And a lot of criticism.
good,"Confusing communication amongst management with assisting clients when help was needed.  Training was long, learned more when we went ""live"" on the floor from employees that had been there less than a year.  Every dept is different though, my referral has been there 15 years, but he was in banking, not both banking and brokerage."
good,The hours were 1-10 and very bad and hard QA they would let you go and they had us working on Christmas Eve and Christmas day doing credit card collections.
good,"This job was more or less a typical collections / call center job. The work can definitely get draining after a long time and you should expect to speak to A LOT of unsatisfied or uncooperative customers. If you get hired on as a temporary contractor, you should also expect not to be included in a lot of the day-to-day perks offered to the permanent office staff. Otherwise, the culture of the office is ok and the people are mostly friendly."
good,"Items I have developed during my current position Leadership, diversity, multitask, HR, trading, sales skills, desire to win, ability to coach; corporate politics"
good,"salary hike is ok, need more support from team leader and manager. lots of politics, partiality, if we start working in night shifts we need to end up in health issues."
good,"Great place to work, there is always change happening either in the organizational structure, systems and data. I learned a lot at the Bank with  systems and data analysis."
good,"BOFA was a decent company, required a lot when pleasing customers and meeting quotas but overall decent. I think a different department is what I needed."
good,I have been with Bankk of America for 21 years and the culture has changed drastically. Management has gotten worse and they no longer care about the employees. They only see to care about the bottom line. This is why I am looking to find something outside of Bank of America.
good,Sales goals are unrealistic for First-time Advisors. The development program is a mess. You will end up figuring everything out for yourself. Be prepared to cold call and attend pointless meetings. People are very friendly until you end up competing with them to get on teams. Be ready to sell your soul.
good,This is a grear company to wrk for with good benefits however never go to the fraud department it's very stressful & if your scores are good they will never allow you to move up from that dept. Also that depts boss is dosent care about the employees at all it's all about numbers to him
good,Great place to network.  Opportunity to learn new things are obtainable. Can be fast paced at times and stressful.  Teamwork environment.  Pay match job duties.
good,"Those at the top are only concerned with their only stability. Fostering a cohesive environment is not a priority at all."
good,BU in the process of agile transformation. Making some progress but upper management not fully committed to making the changes needed to support value-based planning.
good,"Customer Service and sale driven environment. A typical day at work includes basic teller transactions with great customer service while also minimizing transactions & maximizing referrals/sales to bankers."
good,"Highly micro-managed production environment in the residential lending departments (1st mortgage and Home Equity). Rated on output numbers that assume all associates work the same, which is far from the truth. So for that, I feel that the compensation is not customized based on an individual's strengths, rather, you are rated based on metrics that the bank establishes as minimum requirements to succeed in the role."
good,Great place to work if you are in One Bryant Park Tower. The 1OBP is green building with modern Scandinavian furniture and an outside terrace for lounging. There are ping pong tables as well.
good,"Company cares too much about things that are less relevant to the day to day job and put focus on those items. Always a ""flavor of the week"" for the company to harp on, so that you're never where you need to be when it's time to be evaluated."
good,Branch banking is very sales driven and be prepared to listen to sales pitches from management everyday which they classify as making clients financial lives better. Such be the case then staff shouldn't fear losing their jobs if numbers are not met. Overall the min pay rate is $17/hr and the benefits are good.
good,As a CSR your expected to up sell products to customers even if they don’t need them. Sell sell sell. With no incentive Balance cash drawer and precess transactions accurately. Very micro managed. You are told what time to go to lunch or break no exceptions. I saw people transferred out of nowhere with a couple days notice with employees having no say on whether they wanted to transfer or not. Work load can be stressful with very few tellers. No encouragement for advancement. All training is computerized almost no hands on training. Self taught myself almost everything. Time off must be requested month in advance with exception of vacation is picked by seniority almost a year in advance. Strict no overtime. Flexible hours only if part time but not always. May work full time hours with only part time benefits if short staffed. Left due to poor management and too much favoritism. Decent pay not worth hostile work environment
good,"Pros:"
good,"The overall job was fine, but the job offers little to no career advancement. I've been on the help desk for three years training new recruits via job shadowing, but to no avail to be considered for a management position."
good,Typical day is leadership allowing you the autonomy to make decisions within policy for the success of the department and company.  Workplace  culture continues to evolve especially in a larger organization.  Input and positive feedback continues to be a focus.
good,Co-workers were great. Just had issues with innovation.  Management was very condescending and lots of politics.  Didn't enjoy going to work everyday there.
good,"Excellent benefits from medical, dental, vision to amazing discounts from a wide array of retailers, mortar locations and e-commerce. I have an extreme problem with management from Day 1 with them, problem is 50% resolved but goes back to Stage 1 again 2-3 months later"
good,"Bank of America, for the Small Business Banker Role went through an upheaval in 2019 with a total ""Change"" to the structure."
good,I enjoyed most of my tenor at Bank of America. The benefits were very good. When I initially started my career with Bank of America the culture was extremely pleasant and moral was up.
good,"I have no review of Bank of America. Much has changed since I left in 2006.  My time with them was with First Marine Bank & Trust of the Palm Beaches, Barnett Bank, Nations Bank and finally Bank of America."
good,Great place for learning and lot of growth opportunities.  Latest technologies are used and technology adoption is really nice. Lot of layers and less coordination is sometimes a hassle.
good,"Overall good institution, fair experience working here, there are opportunities to grow and learn and also make lateral moves into better different positions"
good,"I worked for this company way before they were bought by Bank of America. I loved it there, but found another role with an employer that offered a better work/life balance"
good,"Poor culture and inconsistent customer treatment policies led to a very difficult day to day experience. Pay and benefits are fantastic for this area, but there is only so much one person can take before the benefits and pay aren't worth it any more."
good,"A typical day included training, research, and client acquisition. I learned about wealth management and financial planning. The management provided ineffective leadership. The area market was consistently in the bottom of the roughly 105 area markets throughout the country. While employed I had two different full-time market executives and two different interim executives. The workplace culture was not healthy due to constant change. The hardest part of the job was finding the right adaptations to the constant change. The most enjoyable part of the job is people. Helping people with the wide array of financial services provided was fulfilling."
good,if you enjoy taking over 100 call a day and have them recorded and if miss saying a word on disclosure and possibly having your bonus taken away from you plus sitting in a cubicle and sometimes getting yelled at on the phone by customers then this job is for you
good,It's been a while but the one thing I do remember about this job is very tedious too many meetings no progress to be  Done The manages above you weren't trained properly
good,"Work hard, they compensate you with bonuses if you hit payment goals and customer satisfaction marks. But at times depending on what's happening in the world that may be difficult."
good,This job hired people to contract them out to review mortgages and guarenteed a year contract...  They closed there doors after I had been there for less than 60 days..
good,"A typical day at work was at the branch level and had to deal with the public, got yelled at on a daily basis, people didn't like waiting in line. Only limited tellers working. People came in drunk and on drugs. I feared for my personal safety. Management hid behind the teller lines. Workplace culture was awful! The hardest part of the job was working at the branch. Nothing was enjoyable at the job."
good,Not much of a good culture. Do not agree with direction of the company or decisions they are making. Hard to carry out ideas or have an entrepreneurial spirit.
good,Nice place to work very diverse lots of employee networks casual dress permitted. 401K pension and other investment opportunites for building and managing your financial profolio
good,"The three year contract has been good, however being forced to take three months off makes no sense whatever. I always have to find work for that three months since I cannot afford be three months without income. Looking for more permanent work. The bank would offer me a position if I would relocate, which I cannot do."
good,My last positon was in the Vault. I enjoyed the fast pace and tight group I worked with.
good,Bank of america is goal driven which puts tremendous stress on the employees. Requiring you to work after banking hours to achieve your daily sales goals
good,"Working in the Financial Centers (Branches) is a very stressful job. You have goals that are mostly non-attainable, but senior management expects you to meet them no matter what the cost. You meet one or more goals, and they want to know why you didn’t meet all of them. Nothing is ever good enough."
good,management was nice but they had no real control. the most enjoyable part are the employees and the food. i learned mortgage indexing. the work was pretty simple the hardest part was figuring out what to wear everyday.
good,"Some of the Bank of America managers are not good with decision making. They do not appreciate criticism, or suggestions to improve processes. They are good in promoting from within."
good,This company was a good stepping stone for me in my career as a financial professional. I have since used these skills to progress to other opportunities
good,Typically I worked the teller line where I accepted deposits and cashed checks for customer and assisted them with any other banking need.  I also worked on the sales side where I opened accounts and sold products that helped customers with their financial needs.  The hardest part was that this was a very sale driven company and employees where required to produce sales.
good,"monitor and resolve user generated trouble tickets"
good,Ver stressful. They try  and Say its all about the customer but real its all sales. Management tends to act very unprofessional. Benefits and pay are not bad
good,"The type of day depends on the position you have"
good,High pace environment. Regular banking hours. Job work/ Life balance. Compensation/ Benefits. Job Security/Advancement. Management. Job/ Work place culture.
good,I must say this company has the lowest salary structure for its employee. They started recruiting good people when they start operations in India but later on they were hiring anyone who would work of less money. If u throw peanuts you would always get monkeys.
good,"Long work days"
good,"Talent planning is poor. Limited opportunity for real growth beyond the mid-level for highly educated and highly productive employees."
good,"It was a nice place to work, a lot of FA's are super cool, but there were a few who would not treat you very well. the autonomy is a blessing and a curse. You need to make sure you actually work, and if you enjoy the work, you'll be fine. I just didn't see myself wanting to work this job anymore"
good,"I worked for BofA for about 8 years. my time there was bittersweet. I loved my role there. The only thing was the culture managers create in the banking center. Managers can make the best come out of their employees and as a result better sales. But, a lot managers at BofA lack interpersonal skills., which is the reason why there is such a high turnover and lack of sales. I understand that they themselves are in a lot of pressure from their Market Managers (CMM) but that doesn't mean that they have to take out their frustrations on the team. They think that by instilling fear that they will get the job done. Every sentence ends with you will get a write-up or fire if you don't do this. Even if you meet or exceed your goals and you are doing great overall,  they always give you a but. Its never good enough. But hey that's what happens when you are in the rat race."
good,Bank of America is a good company to work for. Excellent benefits for employees and also has a good bonus structure. Only problem is there can be better management.
good,"Coming from ZERO banking experience, I was not set up to succeed at Bank of America. The lack of proper training and too much procedural compliance made for a dangerous combination, which led to stressful days."
good,"Projects were good, but found culture very stressful "
good,"call center environment, management was not always on the same page. most enjoyable part was the people you work with. It was difficult to be a parent and work this position."
good,"I worked in the banking centers and moved in to the mortgage side. Working in the banking center was fun, but we had a lot of unattainable goals. The loan center was rewarding helping people get into a new home or keeping their current home."
good,It’s a good company with good employees but if you want to move up you have to deal with all the politics and management. They take care of their favorites and not the ones that actually do all the work
good,Company is good. Salary was low but benefits were good.   Given opportunities to advance and was promoted.  Some of the best mid level managers I have worked with.
good,Hard to advance in company if your not trained in certain skill sets. It was so busy for over a year that they couldnt take me off the phones to train me to advance
good,"If you are okay with making a decent living for feeling like you are in a jail cell everyday then this job is for you, I was there OVER 10 years. I knew my job very well and alot of times more than my direct supervisors. They only promote you if your a Brown noser Which I am not. So thus I stayed in same position for over 10 years. Once Bank Of America took over, they also took the pay away, they took everything that was good about Merrill Lynch, away. I would still be there if Bank Of America would not have joined. However it was the best Choice I have made in a long time. Leaving the company.!! They promote a new hire to a manger within 1 year. You will train your future manager as I did many many times. I loved the people I worked with. And being there as long as I was I did gain some respect from alot of people just not the people you would expect it from. Its okay pay. However if it would have stayed Merrill Lynch alone I would have been making double."
good,Typical day involves mostly phone support for clients. slow progress for career advancement but overall good working environment and good benefits. Working hours are okay. work life balance could be better
good,You have to be careful with who you align yourself with - otherwise your career there will be short lived due to  the internal politics played by management.
good,"Everyone has a different experience depending on the manager they are appointed. My managers made it very stressful to work in an already stressful environment. You always felt like you was going to be let go for small things. And the managers made you feel like you wasn't doing enough even though your numbers meet or exceeded requirements. You are just a number at the call centers, it was a revolving door because of the environment the managers created."
good,"The inexperienced management team developed processes and changes without input from staff. This resulted in confusion between the staff and the lines of business they support."
good,"NOTE: My position was part-time so that will reflect this review"
good,"It is a great place to work, they provide an amazing training so that you are able to help customers improve their financial lives, but everything also depends on the manager and supervisors. In my first year I worked with a great team. And in the second year by cutting employees I was transferred to another branch and that was a disaster. The organization had no communication. It seemed that everyone worked on their own and was not a team plus all very hurried. There was no time to take the trainings on time and the worst part is that I made referrals by taking the client to the desk and no one posted my referrals. I told my supervisors about it MANY TIMES and they would tell me yes and assure me that they would post it but when I checked my numbers they never did. When I started working for BOFA, my numbers were between 6-7%. When I finished working, it was down to less than 2%.  Nobody cared."
good,"Bank of America was a good job and a good working environment until management changed and then it became a not so friendly environment to work , the managers really make a difference in the worksite."
good,"Good place to work, just a volatile industry and no job security.  The people at BAC were enjoyable to work with and were extremely, extremely, knowledgeable."
good,This company has clearly gone down hill.  They have managers releasing employees before accessing what their contributions are.  The place is broken and management needs to be replaced
good,Met alot of nice people and team mates. I worked on a newly created team which was fun but stressful. This allowed you to have ownership. It depended on team if work was fun.
good,"Reception duties, to include answering and screening phones. Greeting customers.  Receiving and processing deposits from clients.  Picking up mail from the post office and processing."
good,There is a lot of upper management changes which involves continuous changes down the line.  Created My Work program to allow associates to work from home anywhere.  Then brought in new management who required a 60 mile radius which is being reduced again to 30.
good,"Positive employee networks and good working relationships."
good,"Good place to work, good culture, good benefits large corporation. Many locations.  Some works spaces better than others.Flexible work arrangements available."
good,"Back to back calls from angry customers. Upper managment doesn't listen to customers. They're more concerned with reducing costs than serving the customers. Replacing tenured, experienced employees with contractors with no experience or education who don't know what they're doing, all to save from paying employee benefits."
good,"Always under staffed with the right people, people who make the company more money are valued above all others, hardest working people are often rewarded with more work and responsibilities rather than more pay."
good,the environment  would be better if the management style was different. too much micromanagement and its a lot of in work politics. there is growth between  departments
good,"Production oriented role, people development secondary.  Leaders tasked to drive the numbers, process improvement did not appear as a prevalent job function."
good,Reviewed daily report or review queue for file.  File worked according to  closing date than file was task driven. various task must be completed by the end of day.
good,"No room for advancement very micro managed, customer service is 1st rate as well as client experience. Best part of the job is helping client reach there goals and priorities. Bank of America has changed the way clients do their banking. They are leaders in digital banking.ie, Mobile, Online, Phone."
good,"A very hard paced environment, The position always seemed to be in jeopardy then management style was more looking at numbers in a call center environment then production"
good,Worked for Countrywide before it was acquired by Bank of America and the transition was felt by most employees. B of A is an old established organization that does not foster innovation or new business ideas or models. No employee engagement.
good,"Typical Day - mostly clerical work, typing reports, financial accounts, opening up accounts - retirement accounts, college funds and 403bs"
good,"Two reviews...first, the branch I worked at. The branch I worked at was very enjoyable. The customers were great (some get mad but that comes with the job). Managers were great and supportive and co-workers were always willing to help. No complaints there."
good,"In my department, everything was monitored.  Productivity, web history, keystrokes, how long someone was in a customer's file, phone calls recorded.  The job was easy once you knew how to do it, but the oppressive culture made it suffocating.  Leaving was the best thing I ever did."
good,nonya  cannot approve loans  I think the focus is on servicing and not   origination   Comp plan changed to an hourly wage in January and sit in an FC vs outside
good,"Very metric driven environment with constantly tightening requirements. My position does not have a variety of tasks and can be very monotonous. It is challenging, but unrealistic expectations and metrics make it a stressful environment."
good,"Great learning experience. Is a great job to gain customer service and problem solving skills. Worked with great people. High stress, particularly Fridays."
good,"To many young people, did not enjoy work environment at all. The hardest part of job was lack of compensation for the work performed, although i have heard they have improved. The best part of job was my co-workers."
good,"I was treated well, until I wasn't treated well. By my last position I felt like I might not be provided the skills to fulfill my job requirements. I liked it for a long time. Then there was a reduction in force..."
good,"A typical day involves two, to three meetings, answering phones, assessing the performance of stocks and bonds, helping customers and educating customers on account proficiency."
good,"A typical day at work included following up on emails, completing project requirements, reaching out to stakeholders and resolving issues.  I learned how an IT department functioned within a big bank.  The culture was a formal to semi formal environment. A very diverse work population. The hardest part of the job was understanding how every tiny mechanic of how the entire IT department worked.  I really enjoyed working with really smart people."
good,"the role of investment specialist is a great role to get your "" foot in the door"" of a a big bank/broker-dealer "
good,Released due to outsourcing so the company could save a few cents at the the cost of the American market. Not a place i would recommend. ............................
good,"Easy enough to work for, good benefits. Not for those who want to get ahead. No good raises ever, no advancement. Management is stuck in the past with no innovation. No recognition."
good,High Expectations of employees with limited tools and functionality to provide exceptional service to customers. Customers complain daily of a poor phone system and lack of ability for the first point of contact to completely address and resolve issues. I totally agree.
good,"Day starts with a conference call with the team in India, followed by more conference calls.  In between I worked on special projects such as reviewing all 2nd liens to confirm flood insurance was properly disclosed."
good,"its a job. not a fan of the schedule nor phones. vacation scheduling is horrible. Fridays, mondays and sundays are blocked from vacation day request. training is horrible as well."
good,"I would prefer not to include a review at this time.  There are many things that are complicated to explain in this format.  Overall the benefits are great, but its a typical cut throat corporate environment."
good,Inconsistency is the biggest issue with this organization. Upper management allows associates to run the department which under mine the authority of the management staff.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Bank of America. Some managers were better than others. I worked the third shift and rarely had to stay overtime. My family was able to enjoy the benefits and I enjoyed the paid vacation time that was offered.
good,"High stress environment but if you find the right team and right job it can be fun."
good,Research analyst left firm to become IR at one of coverage companies.  Branch office sleepy and provincial. A majority of the personnel have since left.
good,i believe the bank is a good place to work and learn about customer service and sales. unfortunately there are people that don't know how to be managers and ruin the experience of hard work employees with the company. Managing is a lot more than just sending emails.
good,"Challenging workplace environment for folks who are interested in advancement and learning more about the industry. Surrounded by smart people who are interested in delivering for clients, but little opportunity for young employees to grow."
good,"I really enjoy working with our clients at BOA.  Unfortunately, I am able to do less and less with them because the management wants to utilize technology rather than people.  A Client Service Rep is a Bank Teller.  It is an entry level job and you do not need extensive experience, however, you do more than your share of work for an entry level pay check.  The most enjoyable part is working with clients and helping them handle financial transactions with ease.  The hardest part is multi-tasking and still maintaining the ability to be perfect.  (no cash differences, keeping your sales rate up etc.)"
good,"The manager was a screamer, and would surprise you in weekly meetings with how much you are late with this, with that, with this, etc..  I felt he was more interested in locating your weaknesses, then encouraging good moral and teamwork.  This made the job unbearable.  Luckily it was a 6m contract."
good,"Dispense customer service daily, answering incoming calls, providing general information, adhering to federal and financial regulations. Consistent up training."
good,"As a relationship manager you have very high goals but yet they want everyone to use self service devices so you don't have to come in to the bank unless you want a credit card, mortgage or some product that the Bank can sell you."
good,"The hardest part of the job was learning how to understand merchant statements and to figure out the best prices to offer different businesses."
good,The company in itself has a problem with their management and the way you can move up within the company. They are flexible with my hours because I have school but aren't expecting much out of me even when I'm in the office.
good,poor management and training. If they trained us a little bit better the job would have went smoother. Did have some fun and worked with great people.
good,"My district manager believed that her 12yr old daughter could do better than the bank managers, which was my role.  She forced mortgage applications even when signs of a recession were imminent.  Their quotas were very demanding and unfair"
good,Mostly have meetings comp are to day to day work. Management is a key point and it is not really helpful towards your growth. Easy job and there not much opportunity to learn.
good,"As a large American institution with a strong brand, the environment can be bureaucratic but positive from a career perspective. Future employers will value the brand name"
good,One has to have a certain level of maturity to take being belittled because of your age or previous skills. The location I was at was very slow paced and hands off.
good,"BofA is one of those banks whose reputation is based on consistent delivery of core banking services.  Persons who work there in any capacity are not innovators, but rather are persons who deliver on the status quo."
good,"I worked in the Bank of America Loan Center and it was very fast-paced, overwhelming and constantly had to meet certain goals everyday of would get written up."
good,Okay place to work. Management switches often which made things difficult. Something that is okay with one manager is not necessarily okay with another which proves to be challenging at times.
good,A wonderful place to work. A cool culture with a good mix of people. There are tough parts of the day but it all works out at the end. Management is cool and informative.
good,Great company to work for only if they compensated their staff well. Loads of work for little compensation. Management shows a lot of favoritism. Bank of America is still laying off employees with no definitive time to stop these layoffs.
good,I worked at a horrible location with racist managers and racist customers. The company is a good company with benefits. Teller positions do not pay well.
good,"As with most banks, focused on fee acquisition, and pushing cross sales."
good,"Needs Rebuilt-Bank of America, like many of its jumbo-bank competitors, offers access to a wide network of free ATMs and branch offices. Well-designed online and mobile banking tools complete the banking experience."
good,"A typical day for managers is meetings and meetings and follow up notes and escalating up and down all the details from the meetings."
good,"Bank of America is not a bad place to work if banking is your thing, however if you have a family or desire to have a life outside of work think twice. Management could and should be better and staffing across the company is a serious issue."
good,"BOA was a great learning ground for me in my career. They have a clear way of doing business and developing leaders. The biggest gap is true consideration for who the associate is and the direction they want to take their career. Some, not all, leaders manage from a top down approach very collaborative and inclusive."
good,"This job taught me a lot about personal finance, and it provided me with a great income and benefits, which gave me the freedom to return to school. At first it just seems fast paced and exciting, but it quickly turns into a climate of never enough, never good enough, and never fast enough, and the ridiculous politics make for an uncomfortable work environment and impossibly slow resolutions. You have lots of responsibility, but absolutely no power to take action."
good,"A lot of different personalities."
good,The bank was engaged in to many mergers. People became a number not an employee. Benefits were ok. I worked with 44001k and other investment vehicles. I sometimes worked late to accommodate clients.
good,Working for the team at BoA was great and it was a pleasant experience for that type of situation. Sales was a big deal even if they tell you it's not.
good,"i loved my job the first couple of years, but then there became too many favorites and typical gossip in the workplace. Great benefits and okay pay. Not much advancement in my department."
good,The culture is what you would typically assume a bank to be. Each branch is different in terms of management style and personality but regulations are strict so there is not much difference between training and execution of tasks.
good,Bank of America is a global company offering both retail and consumer products. The corporate culture is typical big organization culture. Being a bank it is often subjected to compliance notifications and trickle down all the way to its employees.
good,"None of the jobs were too stressful, but they are starting to require higher degrees and advanced certificates. The only problem with that is that they arent willing to pay for either. They also do not pay for student loans."
good,There is plenty of work to keep you busy as the markets are constantly changing. Management was ok but there is a culture of 'mean girls' so beware. The job is great for advancement.
good,"I worked for bank of America for 22 years the department was shutting down so i applied for a project working from home which was temporary for a year to convert clients. I was able to stay at home and keep my mother who was in hospice care, They worked with me when it came to her."
good,Processed millions of dollars worth of checks a day. Pay bonuses were given for employees that processed checks faster. Which encouraged us to work faster and more efficiently.
good,Great 25 year career. Management could be better. Big focus on cutting costs. Could be a great place for younger person developing a career. Comp is reasonable
good,"I learned in my low level position, it's demanding & stressful. I can only image what its like the higher you get. It's 100% sales, do not be fooled. We are supposed to suggest products & solutions based off of the needs of the customers, but when your back is against the wall & your facing high goals, it's easy to force feed a product just to hit your numbers. I can honestly see why Wells Fargo got into the trouble that they did."
good,"I mostly use EXCEL and SQL to pull and compare data from different sources and periods, document findings and issues. Good team and flexible manager, which is much appreciated."
good,The company provides an appropriate compensation but the environment is very fast paced and can be quite stressful particularly with the significant reduction of staffing and continuous restructure of management.
good,"not a great atmosphere or culture to work in, employees are not valued, managers are inexperienced and have their favorites, not a productive environment to be in"
good,In IT it is common to allow work from home. Bank of America does not. Due to the nature of the position we were unable to take our unpaid lunch. So in effect we were working an extra hour a day for free. The position required us to be in the office on bank holidays so we effectively got no paid holidays.
good,As a relationship banker there is always a task you can take charge of and learn about within the financial center..unfortunately I didn't find very many opportunities to grow.
good,"In the 15 years I worked at the bank, we went through a lot of changes mainly due to the mortgage meltdown of 2008. WIth change in CEO, the culture changed dramatically and there was not the same attitude toward employee satisfaction. There is no dedication to the employee anymore and you can easily be replaced."
good,Always work to do. New things to learn. Sometimes workload not equally shared among team. Clients could have been spread out more across teams. The teams were great to work with.
good,"The company culture has become very politically correct, very supportive of all things progressive, good for some but not very balanced.  In terms of management, there is a stronger expectation of delivery of, but not much expectation of good people management or real leadership.  On the upside It is a reasonable place to work, people are generally friendly and helpful.  Being a very large corporation there is a great deal of bureaucracy, so there are many challenges on getting things setup, or getting appropriate access, etc...  All in all it is reasonably good place to work but don't go in with a high expectation of meritocracy or the hope of ""promote from within""."
good,I worked there. Then i no longer worked there. It was good that i was working. Now i need to move on and look for something else. Please let me do so as this page is hindering that progress.
good,Worked for over 6 years and in multiple roles and I loved it. My last role and direct manager were not what I wanted to do and left for a more fulfilling position.
good,Just do everything they teach you and you'll perform up to standard but office politics can be gruesome. Work at a comfortable pace in order to avoid errors.
good,The claims department is a high stress environment and I believe that shows in the employees and sometimes the management. I think it takes a special type of person to be able to effectively manage a team in that environment. There are some managers that have a tendency to compound onto the stress that employees already feel in their roles and I saw how this caused tension and eventual burnout.
good,It's an okay job  to work..  Some manager will work with you schedule when having small children and doctor appointments.  Some manager's will help develop your career and some mentor's will do the same. It's all about the area you work in  and position that maybe available.
good,main issue was the changes implemented blindly and not thought through before implementing by inexperienced bank management to the brokerage sections.
good,During my tenure here...my work life balance was non existent. Load leveling and staffing played a key issue in this. Would have like staffing to meet the demand of the pipeline size
good,"Working for  Bank of America, was not bad, I just could not work for the pay anymore with my long commute. I have work in many different department and was educated on the important of  processing every documents to obtain a mortgage."
good,"This should sum it up- 8yrs, with advancement.  Entry level to Vice President.  Minimal salary increases. Manager told me- 'you're moving up to fast'."
good,"They care more about their image, rather than the truth. They have shady department heads, and they promote people simply because they've been working there for a while, not on expertise."
good,great team but management and recent DOL changes make work environment rather difficult to deal with. Not sure if its BOA or just broker dealer life in general.
good,"i felt like they took advantage of my skills and my willing to work they had me working as a part time teller but gave me responsibilities as a branch manager, no benefits and over all the pay was not very well paid for what i was doing."
good,Fast paced workplace with opportunity to grow.  Have to be very diligent and a self starter in order to gain some traction in this type of industry.  Need to find a mentor to support you.
good,"to many people over your head about sales and getting account opened and new credit cards. the employees where great and most of the time they where always short staffed , because they did not want to hire new employees."
good,"If all you want to do is work and have very little time with family, then this is the place for you. The constant ""fire drills"" and stop/starts are endless. Senior managements drive to make quarterly earnings and not having a clear path how to accomplish it leads to constant decisions being made to quickly, then at the last minute changed. They also do a poor job of talent management. Employees go for rated top talent, to being eliminated within a year."
good,great team mates poor support from product owner.  he never communicated and well woth me and seems to dislike working with me. The rest of the team members were great!
good,"Bank of America, after acquiring from Charles Shwab, further eroded a once stand-alone and stellar brand by effectively dissolving the uniquely wealth-management relationships spanning decades.  That same approach was visited on U.S. Trust employees, as well..."
good,This was my first call center mortgage job learned a lot. Very big company loved the location met a lot of different people. Didn't really like the layoffs though.
good,"Typical corporate America. No loyalty, pay is minimal. The good thing is the experience and knowledge you will gain is priceless. Overall experience with the company is a 3 of 5 stars. Not somewhere I would recommend planting your career flag."
good,Management would be the only thing i would complain about. They only watch out for themselves and started to put insane goals for us. The coworkers were nice tho.
good,"The benefits are great but there is no job stability and no growth.  Management does not help promote within. Work life balance is good because of the benefits.  If I was able to better use my skill set and expand my skill set I would be very pleased with BAC. I have been looking to move internally but have had no luck for some time, therefore I am looking external to the bank."
good,"Bank of America offers very good benefits and the pay is actually pretty good.  Most of the people you work with are great.  However, as is typical in most call center environments, there are metrics with moving goal posts and at times it feels like management is setting you up to fail.  The survey system used to score associates is very unfair to the reps and you're likely to be coached for anything below an 9.  You are required to have at least 90% of your surveys be a 9 or 10, otherwise life becomes miserable.  If you're above that 90% mark, you practically have free reign to do whatever you want."
good,"Best part of the job are pay and benefits. Worst part of the job: constant changes, adding more and more duties without notice, management never has the worker's back and no idea what it takes to actually DO the job! Any suggestions to make the job more productive and to give consistent customer satisfaction are dully noted, but never implemented."
good,"We used two scrren because of the data that must be reviewed while speaking, verifying, documenting and analyzing the customers account. If a customer request to speak with a manager or supervisor they spoke with someone on my team. we attempted to deescalate the situation resolve the issue and retain the customer. Almost every customers complaint was because their card was declined. The are alot of really wonderful managers, and workers at BOA. I enjoyed when a customer gave a compliment that always made mine and the associates day."
good,"Bad management who dont know their job "
good,Bank Of America is a massive company. With that in mind there comes certain positives such as resume building and learning to become a self starter. Negatives are constant changes without input from associates and dealing with the polities of moving up the corporate ladder.
good,"I was treated poorly from from day one . the company culture is flawed and its very ""you cant sit us""if you are not from the banking industry. I had to work really hard to finally be accepted"
good,"I needed a change off the phones in a call center environment. I have been with the Bank since June 2013 and current position since October 14, 2014 and need to be off the phones."
good,BOA is a good company if you are hired externally.  Promoting is hard and the pay is terrible for internal promters. Also there aren't very many positions in the branches.
good,Bank of America is a good company to work for. They have many programs in place that can ensure one's success. Management by segment can be an issue. A person can be successful if they keep full focus on set goals
good,"Bank of America has a lot of requirements not listed in the job description. You have to cold call from a list of clients, lobby lead, maintain relationships with current and new clients, build great rapport with clients, learn new systems and policies, conference calls every Monday, prepare for audits, keep up with mylearning web trainings, help out on the teller line, coach tellers for quality sits, incorporate large deposit plays and any other plays in place to have quality sits to build revenue, know the operations side of the job, know the teller side of a job, monitor suspicious activity in the branch, follow opening and closing procedures, cut hours to avoid paying over time, making sure you hit your monthly goal and also the branch goals, making sure you sell everything to each client, create a need even if there is no financial need at the time, and count money with the tellers along with surprise cash counts with no manager."
good,The GMRT group in which i support is very robust and massive. Work life balance is good for now but recent management shake up will definitely change the environment.
good,The people were great and management was fantastic.  Stressful however given your managing peoples bank issues they inquire about when calling - worst part of the job.  I learned a lot about banking as well as customer service and the way banking works from a financial institutions perspective.  A typical day consisted of taking phone calls for deposit accounts and the issue the client is calling about.
good,Good benefits working with this company and the company is very diverse. I am not sure about the other departments but the Mortgage areas is very unstable at times with high turnover in management staff.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Bank of America, but we were always understaffed and I generally did the work of 2-3 people each day. It was exhausting. The culture was mostly good, with the manager being somewhat rude which had a trickle down effect for the other employees who had worked with her for awhile, making them rude as well."
good,Your career is what you make it.  Management dictates your experience.  Workplace culture is dependent upon your immediate and 2-up management.  The hardest part of the job was the shrinking workforce and the increased workload.
good,"The first step in the acquisition of wisdom is silence, the second listening, the third memory, the fourth practice, the fifth teaching other by Solomon Ibn Gabriol."
good,"Learned new technologies,"
good,They need to weed out the bad apples and antiquated policies and become a bit more streamlined and consumer friendly. Lots of good benefits but has some very poor upper management in place and needs greater transparency and some new blood.
good,"Must be able to multi task."
good,"In all fairness, the financial industry has cut back since the great recession of 2008. This company offers good, health care benefits. The rest of benefits are standard."
good,My workday s very busy; I've learned a lot since starting in 2008. The management is adequate and the workplace culture is as well. The hardest part about my job is the long hours but the most enjoyable pat are my teammates and management.
good,"Heavy workload, overtime is not paid. Need to hire more people to do the work, however budgets do not allow it. Benefits are still ok. Environment differs from one department to another."
good,The product of multiple acquisitions the opportunities are in the culture.  This is a great company but may be too big to be effective.  Difficulties in retaining top talent.
good,"Bank of America: If you enjoy to THE SECOND, 15min bathroom breaks, you'll love it here!  If you are even ONE SECOND over your punch in time, expect to be written up.  Has one of the highest  employee turnover rates.  You'll see friendly faces come and go in your short time here if you decide to work for Bank of America."
good,"Team member were great to work with, A typical day a Bank of America consisted of reviewing, monitoring and correcting data. Management was never around, only showed up sporadically."
good,Reductions in force severely impacted morale every year I was there.  Pay was lower than expected and promised.  No room for advancement.  Old boys club.  More attention to process than delivering on work.
good,"The job is a very competitive job which you earn bonuses within good stats. The customers call into the call center - which are always so angry with the policies of Bank of America. These customers will let it out on you to the point where counseling is a ""must"". Also, management for home loans is horrible, they are supposed to help and take escalated calls, however, if you ask them for the simplest thing, they will make you feel horrible for even asking. I've come down to the point where I don't even ask for help anymore, I ask my co-workers who have worked their for years. The job itself was easy for me, making sales and obtaining good stats was great as well. I wanted to have a job where I felt like family and fit in...this was not it for me. It may be different for others, it was a great learning experience! Just need better management and higher wages for these rude customers."
good,"Offers great benefits, however expect to get moved around a lot. Also doesn't matter how strong your sales are behind teller line because bankers will allow or turn away your sales opportunities and not give you credit, complaints fall upon deaf ears."
good,"Very Stressful and cut-throat environment. senior management was slow to listen and often showed favoritism to specific ""friends"". Very lopsided when it comes to Sales versus Service."
good,Mainly they hire only contractors. Most of the VP becomes manager of contractors. Most of the project lack of documentations and they expect everything from contractors.
good,"BAC is a market participant rather than a market leader. They have the potential to be a great place to work but 9 years after the great recession they are still struggling to right-size and align businesses. While other companies have gone through the painful process of downsizing and are on track for growth and expansion, BAC continues to lay people off and constantly move people around. That makes for a very unsettling work environment with little certainty."
good,"Strategy often shifted when a division or unit manager came in. The culture was not interested in the big picture, and getting employees in other departments to assist in a project was difficult."
good,"Very challenging place to work. Very political. Difficult to advance unless you play the system correctly. Lots of deals keep you busy, but the culture requires you to be available nearly 24/7. It's a good place to start your career but is tough to stay there longer term."
good,Weird place to work. Matrix management used here when I was there. But now that it is owned by Bank of America I could not tell you what it is like to work there now.
good,"Most of the representatives had little to no training. Even with information provided to the reps. they had no interest in learning the industry."
good,"Bank of America is a huge corporation. Although goals are attainable, the workplace morale is low due to the pressure placed on the associate to achieve it. The most enjoyable part of the job is the associates who work for you."
good,"Good pay/bonus/benefits.  Management at the lower level is childish and terrible.  Managers do not support their direct reports, only suck up to upper level management."
good,"If you find the right leadership that embraces creative thinking and initiative, this place will be great. It's imperative you do your homework to make sure your leadership will position you for success"
good,worked for bank of america for irs for tax seasons and it was fun because it was a fast and fun working place . was that you meet different kind of people
good,You work Saturday and only get one off per month. You offer products to everyone that comes to your branch. It is a starter position; if you have a great team if was not bad to be at work.
good,"Bank of America was a different machine. A typical workday would begin with helping any clients with their needs as well as trying to cold call to generate new business. We kept a portfolio and tracked our calls. I learned how to manage my time greatly at Bank of America, since they have so many customer. Management was always willing to help in any way they could. The hardest part of the job was handling the volume of clients but I also viewed that as the most enjoyable part."
good,"	Drove operational excellence by engaging staff on business strategy and performance results"
good,"Very supportive of Work / Life Balance. As of the Job security, the banking business in general is volatile, so job security, advancement and work stability are lacking."
good,"Training you will get here is subpar, although policies and procedure are very specific there isn't a lot of time given to go over all of the ""one offs"" that are encountered. There is a very heavy workload and high expectations. You will often times feel like there isn't enough time in the day and often be overwhelmed. It is to your benefit to be extremely organized and focused to complete the daily activities. The pay is at the bottom of industry standards."
good,"Great benefits, low pay compared to competition, overall good place to work. good training. great opportunity for woman. friendly and professional atmosphere."
good,difficult to work in an environment where theres only 2 tellers with 30 people in line.  Company did offer good benefits.  Bonuses were paid out but were at management discretion to be paid out.
good,"Stressful environment, demanding managers, failure to show appreciation, micro manage, low pay, workload is too much for one person. Benefits were the only plus for this company- including a 4 month maternity leave."
good,"generating new business on a day to day basis, generating leads by cold calling local clients. Creating daily sales plans. training our tellers how to identify possible leads for the bankers."
good,"Bank Of America is a great place to work, depending on the job/ position most are great work life balance. "
good,Unrealistic work standards. Great co-workers.  Middle Management did not support their workers.   I learned risk assessment and how to know the customer through the customers relationship and credit report and FICO score.
good,"This institution is a bank, thus IT is the last on their budget list. Constantly looking to cut resources or replace seniors due to budget cuts. People fear for their jobs creating a hostile work environment."
good,B of A used to be more associate driven. They cared more about employee satisfaction but now it is all about the bottom line. They have cut back so much that the company is just a shell of itself and long time associates are taking their talents elsewhere. Annual bonuses are becoming extinct in all departments yet profits are in the billions. You'll be lucky to get more than a 3% annual raise. Basically you will be underutilized with no advancement opportunities
good,"The company at least in my department did not care if they had to inflict mandatory overtime without notice, day of, last minute.  They would mess with your lunches and manipulate your day to avoid paying OT if they had to.  I had to retake the series 7 and 66; however, they didn't allow me to study at work.  I was required to work and then follow a strict study plan at home.  I passed, however, many good people failed and were let go."
good,Typical large corporation atmosphere with often times shifting job descriptions and expectations. Top down environment and stringent work conditions. Reasonable pay with very good benefits but little potential for long term growth.
good,There is plenty of room to learn from coworkers and gain new skills and knowledge. Management has made it increasingly difficult to promote from within and encourages external growth.
good,"The company took great care of their employees in regards to benefits. However the schedules provided left little to no work/life balance, managers expected to work 50+ hours."
good,"exciting in learning new currency exchange policies, and healthy environment  for learning and career base job that can help you strive in the banking world and train you in all accepts of banking."
good,"Depending on the department you work at your opinions do not matter to management. You are a peon within a large corporation that can barely make a dent in anything. Working there turns you into a zombie as you are supposed to clock in, do your work, then leave. Engaging with others is ""encouraged"" but highly limited an controlled as to how long you can interact with people without being harassed by several different managers."
good,A fast past environment where I am typically involved in meetings throughout the day. I learned a lot about strategy and metric measurement. The co workers are great. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done that you want to get done. The most enjoyable is seeing positive results as a result of good teamwork.
good,I enjoy working for bank of America. it has given me an opportunity to work in a financial institution that has potential for growth. bank of America was a good advancement
good,Used to be a great place to work but now jobs are limited as company is moving them overseas or out of Jax market. Positions and advancement based on who you know not what you know.
good,Bank of America LAS department does not have the potential for growth at the moment. The bank has great benefits especially for new parents. The bank also has a lack in pay when it comes to their employees.
good,"Good entry level job. IT will help develop a sense of the financial industry, improve sales skills and learn to deal with public."
good,"Loan Modifications,Short Sales, and Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure. Manage a portfolio for multiple mortgagor loan investors.  Worked directly with agents,attorneys,homeowners and city officials providing loan servicing options.  Identified the appropriate loan option for customers and then provide the best product. Following Investor guidelines,negotiators modified interest rates or extended loan terms.  Short sold properties that fell short of the balance of debts secured against the properties. Management team provided good guidance and my Co-workers were the best. The hardest part of the loan servicing business is not being able to fix all loan issues."
good,"My rating says it all, where the stars highlighted clearly show my opinion for the company. I truly want more advancement in my next position as well as management team that wants to hear my ideas."
good,"Bank of America had inconsistent leadership, had very high sales goals which, atmosphere was more about sales than taking care of the customer, put a lot of pressure on the assistant manager to keep banking center audit ready (which was primarily driven by associate actions) thereby difficult to control."
good,"see resume and management needs improving"
good,"Management is lack luster. They don't really want to help, or award on merit. Not the worst company, though. Pretty good job security."
good,"Everyone seemed like the stepford wives.  Always happy, with a good 360 degree coaching environment.  Every day was a day to learn something new."
good,"Very stressful environment, training does not cover what the job is entitled for you to do. Not very supportive on getting you the proper training. Great health benefits."
good,"Bank of America is a great place to advanced, you just need to know how to stick out and show the management team what you are capable of doing. "
good,"Not much help in advancing in the company. I would recommend for students looking to work part time. As a student Bank of America has been more than amazing but as for a future career, I do not see many opportunities other than being a banker. Good stepping stone entry level job for anyone in Finance."
good,fun while it lasted but only lasted for just under four years.  was displaced due to right sizing activity at the bank. learned a lot. enjoyed many of my coworkers.  I had a good boss who cared about work/life balance.  enjoyed making a difference
good,"Good pay, nice co workers, busy all the time, no benefits when you are only a contract. Has lots of overtime if you need it."
good,I went to Merrill to give good and well researched financial advice and planning to clients. I quickly learned their advisers are valued for how quickly they could close a sale or securing outside assets NOT the quality of advice. I was looking for a position that allowed me to earn additional business NOT pressuring consolidation or opening new accounts on the first call. If you are a pure salesman and a so so adviser motivated by money it is a good place to be.
good,"Bank of America offers career advancement available for entry level associates that have a desire to learn and grow."
good,"Call center environment. Not enough room for growth. Bonus and incentive opportunities are constantly getting harder to reach, but the workload is still the same."
good,You are always busy that is all I have to say expected to meet all deadlines with no exceptions and perfect. Vacations hard to get when needed attendance a must
good,It has become more and more an organization of who you know and how much they like you and less about qualifications of your ability to do the job.
good,Bank Of America was a fun work environment to work. The market that my branch was in was a very affluent one which made is fairly easy to make our quotas as they were often brought to us without us seeking them out.
good,Great starting to early employment. Once you have gotten everything you can either post to another postion or be stuck where you are.
good,"It was fun learning about the banking basics and there were a lot of good co-workers. However, the expectation the Upper Management puts on Call Time Invested is unreal. They want you to give World Class Customer Service but they want you to average 490 seconds. It's almost impossible. Those who work the day shift may be able to achieve an average CTI score close to that but that's because the customer base during the day is rushed. They are customers in the work field and don't have time to stay on the phone. The night shift has a customer base who had just come home from work and doesn't care how long they stay on the phone or are the elderly who need you to hold their hand which makes it difficult for night shift to meet the expectation of 490 CTI."
good,"A typical day at work can be stressful because managers has to receive a morning count from night shift before there morning shift meeting. What I mostly learn about working at Bank of America you have to be patient and work well with others. Management could be more hands on everyday and not only when the work is heavy. Some co-workers was very hard to work with but overall everyone controlled there actions under pressure. The hardest part of the job was being trained on a function and was excepted to exceed after a short amount of time of training. And it would be weeks or even months before you are back on that particular function. The most enjoyable part of the job is for the most part meeting some great people and working with them for more that ten years,"
good,"fast paced job, loved the math part of it. Was honored to meet and help out as much people as I did. Would love to have this job again but at a different branch."
good,"Pros"
good,"I've work as hard as I could for this bank and was let go after receiving the ""Employee of the month"" award a week earlier. They talk a good deal about people, places and helping, but left me holding on to nothing in the end. I am very disappointed how they continue to use foreign managers who are so dead pan you can't tell if they're recordings or its in their nature to react when you ask them questions. I've worked in bank finance for over 20 years, lead many many teams,but that didn't matter. They have over 6,000 jobs posted on career sites, yet somehow manage to lay off hundreds of people every day? I think if you do your job, the least they should offer you is a reduction in pay first, which makes sense."
good,The pay is horrible for everything they ask you to do. If the manager does not like you tou are misserable. But they do have good benefits
good,"The Bank of America workplace displayed a numbers driven culture with a serious lack of employee development. The management team did not seem to understand their roles or the roles of their team, and did not display a forethought capability. You were made to feel disposable."
good,"I did not receive training that I needed. Everything was self learned. After learning some stuff, I worked really hard to meet my monthly goal and got a big paycheck. Managers are up in your business if you don't hit your monthly goals. My partners are somewhat friendly."
good,I worked at BAC for many years. Great strategy but need greater focus on consistent execution. Many great people who want to succeed. Experts at cutting expenses.
good,"My journey as a loan specialist was very challenging and at the same time, very satisfying. I had to work with a number of different teams and at the same time communicate with our clients, the branch offices, to make the loan application process more simplified. "
good,I loved my time at BOA my teammates and manager all excellent people to be around however the work schedule was extremely excessive and upper management are not very personable people to work for.
good,Manage the release of many loans and related transactions. Provided training as necessary.  Found many ways to improve the service release process.
good,"Bank of America was an excellent learning opportunity."
good,"good company , no room for advancement just a lot of departmental moves but no lateral moves for increase pay. Micro management and long sitting because you have to remain on the phones for your full shift. Cant make major decisions without managers approval."
good,"This job is very demanding and requires and lot of product knowledge. Very hands on field of work required intensive money handing skills. Must continually balance at the end of the day."
good,"I have really enjoyed the people I've worked with in the mortgage realm. Very intelligent, hardworking and easy to work with. Great sense of humor as well."
good,You are paid for stay in the same place for a long time. Skills and hard work get you very little. You just have to be there a long time and hope your boss pays well.
good,Management do not take interest on grooming their employees for advancements. Need to focus in cross training to keep talented employees within the company.
good,Overall a go place to work. The upward movement is reasonable if you have the credentials to do so. Heavy sales push for bank employees.
good,Not a great place to make your career. This place is simply a job on your resume until your position is no longer required.  Leadership is unstable.  Peers are awesome!
good,Haven't worked there since the early 90's... many layoffs during and since my employment there. The management and coworkers were generally top notch.
good,"I was at BOA for 12 years. It is a cool place to work, but not very easy to move up. The morale is not very good due to constant layoff's. The coworkers are great and everyone gets along, its just that everyone hates coming to work knowing that you can get laid off at any time."
good,"The workspace was major minorities (blacks and hispanic), however, in my department there were 13 mid level manager and all of them were white. There was one african american manage when i started who was later pushed out of her position.I'm not one to push things on race, but i felt a racial divide while working for bank of america. Besides that i work in collections where regardless of the company there's usually high turnover. The environment was a little too tense at time."
good,Overall not a bad job. The benefit package is good in comparison to the salary rate. Management varies vastly depending on the branch.
good,"With many leadership changes and reorganizations during the past 5 years Bank of America no longer values their employees, employee years of service, experience and contributions. Layoffs are frequent."
good,the company has set unrealistic goals nation wide as has many other banks.  as a result it is nearly impossible to make a commission check or even maintain employment it seems to be set up this way on purpose so that only the executives ever make a bonus check.
good,I have worked here for 9 yrs and I have been through quite a few transitions in which if my job was eliminated they did their best to repurpose and keep employees.   Although their pay is significantly lower than many competitors.
good,"Working for Bank Of America is demanding. Training is well put together, they make sure you are well acclimated before throwing you into the job. Typically there is 3 months training. May feel overworked and underpaid. Work/life balance is ok. They need to increase pay!"
good,Bank of America is a great place to work. It give you opportunity to advance and excel in your position. Great job to review/audit home loans files.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for Bank of America, Corporate America all the way.  Work was constantly stressful and pushes each associate to the limit.  The people are amazing and you become part of a tight family."
good,High call volumes. Great opportunity for growth if your willing to sell. strong sales culture. Management not always very helpful or professional.
good,coworkers not to be trusted; management consist of young adults who are fast tracking their careers and lack empathy for their associates.
good,"The pros about working for Univ of Phx is that the company is very innovative and forward minded.  They incorporate technology in their approach to business and they are always seeking to improve as a company.  They also show their appreciation to their employees by having an annual BBQ or something of the sort and do a recognition for those that have achieved excellence.  The work environment is very fast-paced, which could be a pro or a con, depending on your POV.  The associates are generally helpful and teams usually create a sense of work family.  The initial training process is very thorough, but continual training as an existing associate depends on your department and your manager's value on training.  Policy and procedures are constantly changing so your ability to adapt to changes is very important. A big perk about working with UoP is the benefit of having a huge discount on the cost of your college education."
good,"Work schedule is very strict at Bank f America and every minute counts.  Everything is based on numbers and not on actual customers who really need help. "
good,"For someone making a transition from application support and administration to development, this was a great place to learn and get exposed to different technologies. It was challenging but there was good support from co-workers. There was lip service played to Agile processes which was very frustrating. I would have preferred a more cohesive structure than was present."
good,Everyone seems to work really hard due to comission. Learn so much about different documents. each transaction different. Stressful enviroment due to meeting closing on time. But fun to be there.
good,I'm sure everyone knows this companies story! They promised the employees the world. worked people like mules. 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day.
good,"Diverse, the ability to grow. There were different changes that at times I felt were not necessary, however without change, how would you know what works, so I got to with the company goals and standards to insure the company grows and customers percentage not stay the same, but grow for the better."
good,"tellers are among the most unmotivated people i've yet to work with. as someone with management experience, seeing how miserable the employees were was very off putting.  pay is mediocre and i wanted to move up quickly but the position closed and i was left as a teller. left shortly after because of the lack of opportunity"
good,"Fast paced call center environment with little management support, facilities are up to date and clean. Benefits and pay do not reflect work load."
good,Good and Bad. Depends on the department and the managers. Overall it offers competitive benefits. Salaries are better elsewhere.
good,Decent amount of red tape and politics but this is expected of a big company. the management is very young and inexperienced. The compliance would rather you not sell.
good,"I was a chat representative, Everyday we would take three chats at a time, talking with three customers at one time, and having to be able to serve each customer with pulling up multiple systems at once. It was very stressful, and sometimes manageable."
good,"rushed, high volume work, "
good,"Bank of America has great benefits, but has been downsizing considerably in the last few years, therefore has very limited career opportunities for a mid-level experienced employee."
good,I was working prior all the market collapse but generally I love the contact with people and helping customer with out knowledge of bank services
good,"Not much room for promotion, schedules are rough and cannot hold on to personnel for a very long time. A lot of moving around of personnel happen in a single day"
good,"It was very hard to navigate in my department.  "
good,"The company offers tuition reimbursement, adoption reimbursement, child care reimbursement and paid maternity leave."
good,"8+ hours daily"
good,"Good co-workers to work with "
good,"My experience at BOA was distorted becuase my department was in the process of ""building the plane while we're flying it."" Not my words but the department. That didn't work becuase this BOA department was brought out by another company. The people that worked that were very used to getting laid off. Some prided themselves on being able to come back after working over 10years or more with BOA. That should say a lot."
good,Learned about Capital Markets and Institutional clients. Deal with Traders and was part of setting up a brand new team. Initially the team was made up a lot of fun and hard working people.
good,This company was very good at the banking industry.  They were very focused on sales.  Opening new accounts and finding new ways for the customer to put their money in the bank to be used were the highest of priorities.
good,"Research microfiche statements, printing from system processing request, logging incoming statements returned processing of microfiche."
good,"I was a banker and a teller at once. I would help individuals with sales on the banker side as well as process transactions on the teller side. "
good,"working at the bank for as long as I did gave me invaluable skills and taught me a lot about management.  The bank has many different work programs and was a good place to work, including their benefits"
good,A typical day at work was arriving to work and immediately answering any emails received.  They could contain important new training or laws that were vital to your daily job tasks.  Management was big on reviewing your goals with you and any calls that were monitored.  Co-workers were usually very happy and excited to have a job.  The hardest part of the job was attaining goals.  Many employees did not like to have to give bad news to the customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was understanding it was not personal decisions being made but on facts from their financial past history.
good,if you're a phenomenal salesperson.  Sales goals very difficult to achieve and there is literally no formal training despite what they tell you up front.
good,"Great job work/life balance; however, there is not much job security. There is not much compensation. Management that I worked with directly was always great."
good,The culture of the bank has changed a lot and thats all I am going to say. Employee satisfaction has gone down. Mangament has been getting strictor which doesnt create a very productive work environment. Customers have been transitioned to self service options.
good,"Large head count reductions for years after merger, but very much enjoyed working for BOA.  I am unsure of the state of the company, I think it is now a BOA entity."
good,This company has a lot of perks for someone fresh out of college trying to get into corporate banking/mortagages it will allow you to obtain basics and move up.
good,"benefits for education, vacation, medical, etc are great! management is ok.  jobs are scarce in area, tends to hire from within."
good,"Work tirelessly. Goals to be met are very high., compared to customer base. Work/Life balance very poor. Management is okay."
good,The entire work arrangement is demoralizing. The atmosphere and work environment is very frustrating on a day to day basis
good,"Worked in Cust Marketing in Kennesaw. Probably the most stressful professional environment ever. The sales quotas are nearly impossible to meet coupled with a hostile management culture. BofA itself is a great company to work for: excellent benefits, decent pay, holiday/vacation/sick time/personal time, etc. But unless you are a  heartless liar by nature, Cust Marketing is not for you. There is absoloutely ZERO job security in this position - even if you are hitting your quotas each month. Management says you have to remain in that position for a year before posting out. But after making your year, they come up with every excuse to not allow you to post out to another position."
good,Bank of America has been a challenge to work in their environment.  It continually goes through changes with their policies and procedures.  They makes it hard for their employees to try and achieve within the company.  The turn over rate is very high.  They always want the personal bankers to keep pushing products on customers that can't afford to maintain their product.
good,"It's an ok place to work if your all about sales. Numbers drive this company and you can be the best employee if the sales aren't there you won't last. Not a very fun environment to work in. Great pay and benefits. Pay for child care, paid maternity leave, paid vacations and holidays. Benefits start immediately."
good,"BOA over all is a good company, however the company has been going through some layoffs lately. A typical work day can be expected however the company does require extra work."
good,"As a work from home associate, my typical work day was not glamorous, but productive. Getting up and getting right to work makes getting up not so bad."
good,"A typical day would be to count money from the night drop, mail, or customers. Selling bank products, charging fees when necessary, doing certified checks or money orders."
good,"Company is working hard towards maximizing the profit as a result people are changing often, those who stay are overworked and poorly compensated. Work-life balance is poor. A lot depends on the management of the particular branch/market, policies are open to interpretation as a result moving from one branch/market to another often feels like working for the different companies. When I had good managers I highly enjoyed working at the company and career seemed to have a great potential, but some managers can make your life unbearable and you just hope that the company will get rid off them before you loose your patience. Benefits are good, co-workers mostly were very professional and friendly. Promotions within the company always given the lower compensation compare to the people hired from outside. If you are planning to work here be prepared for the constant change of work processes, staff and management."
good,I will say that Bank of America's work from home program is great. I was in this program for a very long time and was very satisfied.
good,Large comapny awesome coworkers but but bad comminicaton in all lines of business.
good,"Great job to get started with , but there may be layoffs . Decent pay and good time management , but there needs to be a way to prevent layoffs ."
good,"1) Very bureaucratic and top heavy"
good,It was ok.  Made really good working relationships.  Management was ok.  Nothing to be proud of but they worked with you.
good,"A typical day at Bank of America was simply walk in, and get right to work.  My job position was based on both hourly and commission so most co-workers were primarliy focused on getting the job done as quickly and accurately as possible"
good,A lot of mandatory overtime.  You process incoming mail fast and there is no room for errors.
good,It was a job.Production based.Need better management.Offer more hours better scheduling.
good,"I printed documents, included supporting documents, then checked these for accuracy. After gathering all pertinent information these were signed in front of a notary and shipped to the attorney for court."
good,"I answered phones, greeted clients, assisted the Small Business President, assisted all of the bankers as needed with any clerical or computer needs. Made travel arrangements, Made reservations for lunches with clients.Made presentation folders for all meetings. Assisted other Administrative Assistants in other states as needed with any clerical help. Enjoyed all of the bankers and assistants, very professional and friendly environment. Worked with Government Card service assisting all branches of the military with their credit cards."
good,"This business is now a part of US Bank, and therefore I cannot comment on it since many of the variables have changed."
good,"All of the above Companies were great to work for, until they decided to down size. I had many great leader and associates, I learned a great deal about the Mortgage business. Working with the Federal Government and the Changes President Obama made to the Mortgage Industry. The hardest part was getting to know all the quick policy and procedure changes almost on a daily basis."
good,"ability to fill needs of Financial Advisors and their clients "
good,Fine place if you just want to put in your 40 and have no potential for advancement.  Small minded management with no capacity for change.
good,"I provided customer service in a call center environment, I answered questions and resolved problems as well as serviced customer needs in timely manner. I would also refill prescription orders and provide customer care. I utilized computer knowledge for extensive use of computer and phone networks. I referenced medical insurance information and the processing of medical information. I used an information database for prescription based questions for a limited maintenance of prescription medical information.  I assisted clients with payment issues and delinquency questions. I addressed concerns from physician’s offices in regards to patient prescriptions. I identified situations that required further assistance from the pharmacist.  I was required to be familiar with all privacy laws to protect the customer’s information. "
good,"Learned a lot about the default servicing area. Worked in various departments where the culture was to cut corners to appear compliant. Overall, I had great management (although it declined as new management was brought in), peers, and staff."
good,"Treated well however no real opportunity to stay with company after department laid off, some sour grapes"
good,not a bad place to work except low wages at the start. There was too much emphasis on making money for the company but not enough care for associates.
good,"A typical day at work will be attending a weekly meeting with the leaders and other banking center associates to go over our Week to Day Sales and operations. Conduct a daily huddle with associates in my banking center, discussing any findings we may have recognized on our operations board. Setting up a champion to make sure we are following all compliance's. Making sure each associate knows what are sales goals are, and executing a plan to make sure we achieve them as a team. Recognizing each associates for their improvements. Following procedure to open banking center, night drop, automatic teller machine, and safe deposit vault as well. Engaging and delivering excellent customer service with every client, or potential client that we interact with. Resolving any issues or concerns they may have, escalating them to the appropriate specialist if need to. Reporting all completed task, sales, role plays, and banking center plans to our consumer market leader at the end of the day. Over the years I developed more of an understanding of the business. I conduct myself as a leader would. I have a good standing relationship with my associates. I have learned that in order to succeed, those around you must succeed as well. The most rewarding part of my day is knowing  that the customers come first. Without their loyalty and business I would not be where I am today."
good,"I was happy until it was clear that since I made the Unit Manager`s metrics far above goal, it would be difficult to grow my career in the path that I wanted it to."
good,Disconnect between Core Values and what is actually practiced.
good,"Work was hard sometimes stressful.  In the 9 years working with this company I learned the importance of project deadlines, quality criteria and adherence to company standards.  I had the opportunity to work with, a very intelligent, hardworking, irrepressible businesswoman, that was my pleasure to work with."
good,In bound call center/ received calls for credit card customers that have had their card blocked due to fraud. I would look at the risk for potential fraud on a customers account and also risk based on making sure fraudsters are not getting through on the phone. I would assist off the phone in special projects that managers assigned such as reports to decorating for events within the office. Also with this job I participated in a lot of volunteer events throughout the community. The most enjoyable part of my job would be catching fraudsters from committing the crime. The most difficult part of my job is probably dealing with the upset customers that are being effected by fraud. I feel that I have great expertise with turning a bad situation into a good.
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with but the atmosphere was extremely high pressured to try to meet unrealistic goals.
good,"Bank of America is a great company, I enjoyed the my time there and wish it could have been longer. Benefits took care of my family for the last 16 years. ."
good,"I was on the phone all time as call center. "
good,"I learned many things while working for BOA, such as balancing general ledger accounts, basic computer skills and basic customer service inquiries."
good,A typical work day for me is being productive. I love to learn new things which is a great challenge for me and it keeps me on my toes.  Being open minded is a part of my personality which allows me to adapt very well to change.
good,"I am a professional with a major in Public Administration, good communication skills and customer etiquette is what I strive for daily, successful satisfaction of customers.   My work day depended on team work, as a senior employee in various job functions throughout my career; following through process complex trust agreements, creating the closing settlement statement, research and retrieving borrower’s documentation, being graceful and tactful under pressure from title company to have Hud-1 documentation ready for borrower to sign the closing documents in a timely manner to complete the loan process. "
good,"The co-workers are excellent and help you get through the day. Management doesn't listen to the voice of the associate and seem to not care about the employees. The bonuses are great. The job responsibilities are ever changing. Love my paycheck just not what it takes to get it. Therefore, I'm still a college student."
good,"I worked as a contractor for Bank of America when it was a San Francisco-based organization, as well as contractor and full-time employee under the current Charlotte-based structure."
good,Could be better work environment and pay structure. As they require constant sales but back office and processing looks to cancel on anything as opposed to look for alternative solutions.
good,"Suggestion: Executive Management - Take the time to meet one-on-one and in a group setting with associates, (""without notification to lower and mid-level management""). Reduce the juggling of managing so many departments at one time, without fully understanding what the department does for the organization."
good,Having a variety of functions in my department meant there was always something different to do.
good,"My day consists of making and receiving calls from severely delinquent and bankrupt mortgage holders.  I am very knowledgeable in all aspects of foreclosure , modification processing, lending, and have over 20 years with a litigation background,"
good,providing services for customers who have issues with their ATM or banking problems
good,"enjoyed people"
good,I enjoyed this job but it was just a stepping stone on my way to grooming. I could have advanced as a supervisor but between the hours and commute it wouldn't have worked out.
good,"The best thing about working here is the benefits:  vacation, child care reimbursement, tuition reimbursement."
good,"Great job, no job security. Was laid off after two years, found it hard to advance from the position I held"
good,"customer service, balancing the ATM and drawer, sales, shipment and etc."
good,Corporate setting with ability to advance internally and to work from home
good,"May be it's not a problem with Bank of America directly but with the general culture in Charlotte. Discrimination is sensible every where. I don't want to call it racism because they can discriminate against a person who is coming from the north as well."
good,Open branch get things ready for opening hour. I learn to listen ask questions to offer financial products that fit there life style and that were beneficial to them. I got along with my manager so well when ever i need it help or coaching she was there for me and help bring out the best of me and how to become better at my job. My co-workers were the best team I had we would always try to help each other while still achieving our goals as individuals. There was no hard part of my job because with out any challenges my job would be boring. Knowing that would go to work and feel appreciated and making a difference.
good,The project provides I am involved continues to provide me with wide set of experience helping me to enhance my programming skills at exponential rate so early in my career
good,I was a temp at this job and the short time being there my supervisors and co-workers exposed me to a variety of different skills that I couldn't have learned in a regular office. I enjoyed being able to have such a flexible schedule and work day in general.
good,"I enjoyed working with a culturally diverse group of people. there was a family environment. Our goals were clear, the benefits were good. There fun activities and events. A good selection of affinity groups, volunteer opportunities. The managers were very quick to congratulate the associates for a job well. We were given opportunties to participate in meetings. The managers made sure to try and incorporate fun whenever possible...i.e...contests, food days,games during meeting and prizes."
good,Assited customers with needs and request . Provided assitance in organizing departments to look presentable.
good,"Great managers but not to much opportunity to move up, overall decent pay and benefits."
good,"Bank of America is a good place to work, however be ready for change almost every week . I would have stayed at this job for as long as I could however they told us our department is going away  this Oct 2014."
good,"2014, may company going through restructure having many layoffs"
good,"BofA used to be a wonderful company to work for. I transferred in from SeaFirst in early 90's. Routine work day included cash handling procedures, policies and procedures, balancing, checking id's, developing relationship with clients."
good,"Bank of America's greatest job experience is the avoidance of commuting by allowing tele-workers to work 100% of the time from home (or other remote locations)."
good,"Typical Day:"
good,"Overall, the company itself is a good company which offers some nice benefits. You get all the bank holidays off and paid, 2 weeks paid sick pay, and 2-4 weeks vacation depending on the position. They also offer fully paid paternity\maternity leave. They will also reimburse you for a portion of you day care expenses which is really nice. "
good,"Good set of people. Bright guys."
good,Work flow was fair and challenging. Fast paced and ever changing environment.
good,"Worked there for 10 years my department was always good but from 2006 to 2009 it was terrible bofa made some bad deals ,country wide,"
good,Constant Customer contact with little compensation. I became knowledgeable of the banking system and how sometime it can become corrupt. Management only really considered the goals rather than the individuals needed to accomplish the goals. Advancement was not ordinary within the company. Co-workers were constantly taken advantage of as they were asked to continue to work off the clock. The most difficult aspect was having to deal with regional mangers constantly increasing goals on a whim without real knowledge of the market in which the branch was centered in. The most enjoyable aspect is being able to utilize the better managers as references when looking for a different place of employment.
good,I waork in the mortgage depart when the market changed. I guess you can say they did the best with what they had
good,"Its bank of america what else can i say."
good,During the time that I was on assignment working as a loan modification underwriter- it was challenging speaking to customers who were under financial distress and in the process of potential home foreclosure.
good,Bank of America has no feature in place to deal with the “Mark to Market” issue of compensation.  In addition the legacy issues of the different cultures still plague upper management with a Hierarchal vs. Team Unified environment.  The unneeded layers to cover the inability to communicate and problem solve will continue to have an adverse effect. I have worked here for 18 years and love the company that hired me and it breaks my heart to see the unnecessary path to destruction that we are inflicting upon our brand.  In short there are too many Chefs in the kitchen.  Bank of America could be so much more.
good,"Good place to work, however job politics takes over atmosphere"
good,Make numerous phone calls to title companies and insurance companies to insure all requests were covered. Contact borrowers 2-3 times per week to keep them informed.
good,"Research fraud claims on debit cards. Which included looking over cardholders pass statements and transactions, calling the cardholder/ merchants in dispute to get further information, and then would be responsible to make a final decision on claim."
good,Company culture was strange and not a fun environment at all.
good,"BOA was a very flexible place to work."
good,Working in the customer marketing department was like the boiler room. It was always pressure and stress. Goals that werent realistic and lazy management
good,"a typical day at boa consisted of processing checks, deposits,and paymentsand giving excellent customer service.  i enjoyed the people that i worked with.  made good connections with my customers"
good,"* Open and closing procedures, avg. 200-300 transactions per day, cash handling and balancing, processed payments, and referred customers to personal bankers when selling a product. "
good,Fun place to work for prior to shutting off completely all and any of Countrywide related business activities...subsidiaries or not.
good,Fast paced with lots to do. There is a lot of room for latteral or upward mobility. Strong team first mantality.
good,"Part-time teller.  Worked the drive thru and lobby.  Helped customers make transactions, looked for sales opportunities that fit the customers needs."
good,"A typical day at work involved answering phones, processing loan modification documents and analyzing qualifications of a customer. I learned how to process a loan and new and improved assistance programs to help homeowners save their home. The hardest part of the job is learning how to understand that I am not able to help every homeowner save their homes. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was able to help the homeowner and give them home."
good,"Culture has shifted.  Gone are the days of being proud of your work, but there IS plenty of work."
good,Working at Bank of America was a new experience. This is where I really learned about sales. As a bank teller we had goals we had to meet everyday. I also learned a lot about cash handling and customer service.  My co-workers and I all got a long very well.
good,heavy focus on training and compliance. lots of people from different areas.
good,My typical day start with answering voicemails and email. After that do a list with all the cases are priority and work from there. at around 9am I start calling clients and prospects. Sometimes attend networking events during the day. Following with more paperwork that it needs to get done that day.
good,"I enjoy the flexible work hours which allow me to balance work and home as well as school.  The staff is friendly and always upbeat.  Management provide positive coaching moments that enables you to do your job better everyday,  The hardest part of the job is working short staff at times.  The most enjoyable part is providing exceptional customer service to all clients."
good,"A typical day at work consist of managing 13 bank branches, and making sure to plan day proactively.  I have learned great leadership skills, weather it's coaching and development, or resolving customer issues while providing the highest customer satisfaction, and overall experience.  I believe there's no challenge that I can meet or exceed about my job as long as I have ambition, drive, and respect. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my team helping them achieve success and recognition, and interacting with my clients, and meeting new clients."
good,I enjoyed what my job entailed. Promotions seemed to be a little biased. It was a fun environment.
good,"Initially working for Merrill Lynch was a great experience, co-workers helped and assisted each other as well as leaders. But once  the bean counters came they looked only as the $ cost and not the knowledge loss. I enjoyed helping my branch customers and supplementing them as a knowledge source so they can shine before the client."
good,"Overall an ok place to work.  I worked in a mortgage call center and pay was small base salary plus commission.  They would change the incentive plan as needed to make sure you didn't make too much money.  Also schedule was based on performance and varied from 8-5 to 11-8 and included 2 Saturdays per month."
good,"working at bank of america is a good starting opportunity for young adults.  The benefits are nice with 401k matching full insurance paid time off etc.  However, the expectations and goals have risen to a seemingly ridiculous amount in the past year as bank of america attempts to raise revenue for its shareholders.  what this means is that it can be hard to perform especially at slower branches.  it can be luck of the draw where you are placed and subsequently how you are advanced based on your initially placed branch.  the managers are leaned on everyday to focus on sales beyond customer service, and this in turn reflects on the service provided."
good,Execute all customer transactions and suggest products to assist them. I have learned the value of helping others. Management was very encouraging. Co-workers work as a team to get the job done. Counting change while the line grows was the hardest part. The most enjoyable part was helping the customer anyway possible.
good,"I have overall enjoyed my time with Bank of America - spent 3 years as a part-time teller and was very happy that I could purchase health insurance and had other perks like Child Care Reimbursement, even though I was part-time. As an assistant manager, I don't care for the middle management - they are overly harsh, and are so focused on the sales numbers that everything else gets pushed aside."
good,"Processed underwriter approved loans"
good,It is an ok company tio work for but I really enjoyed working with the people more than the job.
good,I handled deposits; large and small. It was mandatory to try and upsell new accounts to non-account holders. I was also required to keep my drawer balanced. I enjoyed my job with Bank of America. I like to work with finances.
good,"Loved working here for 4 of my six years. Last 2 years were really tough, redundancies etc, at this point management style changed rapidly from supportive!"
good,"The overall environment and culture of this institution needs a major overhaul! This company cuts financial corners that don't turn out to be for its success in the long run.  I think the company was attracted to the speed of online banking. However, management doesn't understand how to make the workplace environment more productive for team members."
good,"The main tasks are daily operations, sales and customer service on the teller line, and depending on the needs of the bank, I support the operations, sales and customer service for the personal bankers. I act as Assistant Manager and Banking Center Manager during their leaves of absence, vacations and/or sick time. I have learned a great deal about leadership, compliance, risk-management, team-management, customer service and sales. I receive continuous training for new changes, compliance, sales and operations. The hardest part of the job is managing the overall banking center with insufficient staff. The best part of the job is customer service, operations, team environment and fast-paced environment."
good,Company is comparable to other corporate financial companies. Each division is like a different world.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was the execution and feedback on projects. There were no typical days within Corporate Communications. Flexibility in adjusting workflow practices and meeting new challenges and deadline were the normal course of business. The hardest part of the job was often unexpected changes to deadlines.
good,"Overall its good experience working with BoA. The working culture was good, but the management was not. Its almost 2 years for me that im into same process and same shift.So, I never got the chance to move to the other department."
good,"The one thing, I really enjoy is working as a team makes the day go by faster."
good,Working at bank of america is good feeling.I learned a lot about trade  and process .It helped me to apply practical applications and extend my academics gains.
good,Being a telephone sales associate was not a good fit for me. No opportunity for advancement as I hoped for.
good,I enjoyed working for this company along with my fellow co-workers.
good,Come in to work... greeted by wonderful security personnel and coworkers.. I enjoyed my job.. The hardest part was leaving
good,Not a lot of fun at this place; people were not friendly and could have been more helpful
good,"Crazy work environment. A lot of overtime, 600 hours of out the last year I worked there. I work for a JV and that is why I had the crazy hours."
good,"This company used to be an awesome place to work if you lived in Jacksonville, Florida. However since they closed down the elementary school on site, it has caused parents to lose the schedule flexibility that they enjoyed by having their children there with them at work and not having to worry about where they were or if they got home safe. A lot of parents left the company because of this and a lot of people who were interested in working at Bank of America, lost interest. If they kept the elementary school they would then be able to retain the best employees and attract new ones."
good,Typical day involved engaging with team across the US and helping to develop tools for reporting and support for project management.
good,"Position can get to be stressful over a period of time, dealing with customers anger & vulgar language in the call center but you just have to remember not to take any of it personal. I learned a great deal overall about different types of fraud. I enjoyed the PTO, 401k, tuition reimbursement and my co-workers. Some of the managers were totally clueless about systems, policies, or how to assist."
good,"No two days are a like each day changes with the LOB (Line Of Business)"
good,The best part of this assignment was working with the business on process improvements in the loan space.
good,"Invoicing for MRT department.  Review invoice, approve or reject than select correct cost center and apply payment. The importance of coding to the correct cost center. Management will assist when able. Co-workers are hard working. Hardest part is the uncertain day to day feeling about the departments life. Enjoyable the compensation and benefits"
good,"High productivity case management, monitoring accounts that are in active chapter 13 bankruptcy."
good,Generally a good place to work but after devoting 10 years of my life I just felt like a number in a large company.
good,"Not a stable working environment, very hard to be transferred from a temporary/contract employee to a regular employee."
good,"Assisted custumers who had hardships with variuos payment options."
good,They have great benefit. But they can get rid of you fast. No loyalty working 6days a week with an hour or two here and there. No set schedule 
good,I worked for this company and loved being a teller. I was so good at it that they made me a commercial teller my second month where I had to assist big businesses with their accounts. The only thing I didn't like was the location and the manager. She didn't know how to communicate to her staff respectfully.
good,This was a very relaxed but production oriented environment.
good,Good company but any chance of advancement is based on who you know and not what you know.
good,"This position had no ambition for growth within the department. The department only cared about the work. Overtime in this department was mandatory every day for 2 to 3hrs in a already stressful environment. "
good,"relaxed work environment, great benefits, sales, great if you are in school"
good,"I handled inbound calls from customers having  problems accessing the bank’s website. Assisted customers with password lockouts, website problems, and helped them in getting familiar with many of the features and products on the website."
good,"Company great, direct co-workers okay. Employs those that are happy all the time but not capable of doing work"
good,A typical day at the bank is non stop traffic. We are constantly processing transactions and doing maintenance for customers. We also open accounts and sell products and servics to our customers. 
good,"No two days were alike, The most enjoyable was working thru a problem and find the answers to help  the customer internal and external. Management was easy to work for, they did not hover if you had question they were there to answer them. On most typical days I was there to answer and coach my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was reporting a co-worker who could not handle the work load. "
good,Over the years that I worked for Bank of America I enjoyed the challanging work as well as the training options that were offered.
good,"Managment, culture, balance very undervalued throughout company. Job security and advancement were in place, but not easily obtained often forced to stay in current role for extened amounts of time."
good,"High sales goals, achievable but low staff and low bonus potential"
good,"Management is awesome, I am assigned 2 bank branches to solicit mortgages from. Our processing and underwriter is some of the worst in the industry but I am confident it will get better."
good,Took incoming calls about overdraft fees and sold them a reason why they were not getting there money back. This was a hard job to have during the recession.
good,"Busy from the time you clock in to the time you clock out, fast paced. You learn a lot about management and leadership. You must adapt to change with little resistance. Coworker are nice people. Very friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is working unsupervised most days."
good,"Filled with lots of work and recognition not present, People don't care about you and your development."
good,"A typical day at BOA consisted of assisting homeowners over the telephone with missing or misapplied mortgage payments. I enjoyed the people I worked with, with the exception of some management. The hardest part of my job is what prompted me to leave, with the economy being what it is, it just became to hard to talk to people who were losing their homes and looking to the bank for help but were turned away. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was able to resolve all the homeowners issues."
good,Nothing negative about the company. Overall it didnt work out for me because im not into the financial business! Great people though :)
good,"The co-workers I had were much older then me and did not take me as serous because of my age. I performed well, then they took notice. The environment was dull, and it seemed that most people did not like what they were doing. I decided after working there that I would not like to be in this field of work anymore"
good,I was only here temporarily I knew I wanted to join the military so this was a just time of being place. I remember just being there counting the hours till I could leave
good,"Working for a Wire House and working for an Independent Firm is a lot different. Merrill is a Wire House and in control of your salary, reviews and benefits. So everything is based on a sliding scale. Hard to make any real money if you are on salary and not commission."
good,They really believed in Higher Standards. Bank of America felt that the customer is always right and they strive to give it to each customer that called the call center.
good,"Worked there for 6 years, first 1.5yrs I spent working my up and gaining experience, got to the job and position I was comfortable with loved it, loved my team, my manager was great. Had to move departments..... I no longer work there!"
good,"I worked as teller, my job was customer service, cash handling and little bit of sales. I have had great customer service experience. My managers were good but in two years i worked with 6 different managers. All my co-workers were great help to each other it was more like a family. there wasn’t anything really hard at my job i think if something was little challenging, was cashing checks for non bank of america customer. The most enjoyable part in my job was my customers they would wait for me to help them :)."
good,"I loved the people that I worked with. Consumer banking provided me the sales and service experience that I needed to make a difference in the community. In addition, loss mitigation also taught me a lot about the mortgage side of the business. Reporting, and customer service was key for success. Everyday I was responsible for pulling production report, draw a game plan for the day to ensure production goals are met everyday. Delivering the goals to the team in the morning huddle, and follow up with the team managers through out the day to ensure daily goals are met, Lead, manage and coach associates to success everyday. Perform reviews and create developmental plans for the associates."
good,"I got this job because I was home from my freshman year of college and needed a job, I went to the town recreation office and my soon to be boss was posting an ad for a personal assistant to help her with her job. I managed excel sheets, organized paper work, made inventory purchases, and got coffee in the morning. Over al it was a good summer job, but there was not much chance of a pay increase and because I could finish some assignments faster than expected, my boss had days when there was no work for me to do."
good,work hours are great and benefit package is great but they don't pay that great and really hard for advancement.
good,Management lack of training and the employees confidence made it hard to work. Most of the times the individuals who suppost to know what need it to be done didn't know the proceedure or what need it to be done.
good,"Sadly my professional experience with Bank of America was not as I expected. Working in the credit card call center was one of the most challenging jobs I ever experienced. I gain a lot of knowledge about credit cards which helped me to limit my use of them dramatically. When I worked there the credit card call center was completely over whelm, lack of consistent guidelines, too demanding on employees to push promotional credit card programs to unwilling customers and there was very little chance for advancement as well as they also discouraged employees from using the tuition reimbursement program due to their personal lack of education."
good,"This was a fine place to work. Flex hours, dynamic place to work."
good,It was a quality experience to gain insight into the financial services industry as an intern.
good,I process loans with properties that needs serviced due to vacancy/ foreclosure. Following the guidelines of FHA/CV/FNM/FMA to get properties into convey conditions. We compete to be the best within our teams. The hardest part of the job is the system down time it breaks down frequently. I enjoy being a top performer.
good,Working for Bank of America gave me good management experience.
good,"Dont except this job to be a cake walk or something you can just ""do"" everyday. This job is tiresome and extremely stressful."
good,The new Bank Of America.is not as supporting as the Old Bank of America with employee. Nations bank turned Bank of America into a production Company with less care for the employee that's why I rate them with 3 stars.
good,I enjoyed my job while working with the three senior commodity futures brokers. They allowed me the freedom to handle their business freely. We had mutual respect. Upper management could have been more professional. The company philosophy did not work in the Midwest.
good,"As a contractor, you tend to be treated as a number, rather than a person. The TM's were stand-offish, on a more personal level. When addressing a group of people, they were very friendly, but when asking a question one on one, you got the feeling that you were causing an inconvenience. They would also offer the open door policy of ""feel free to ask questions, if your TM isn't available, ask any of the others, they are happy to help"", but they were frequently not around - either in meetings or on break. The proficiency coaches were very rude and didn't take contructive criticism well, often becoming defensive and becoming very condescending. Several training classes had the same suggestions to make training better, and while these suggestions were asked for by the UM, nothing was put in place to address these suggestions. One suggestion was to train us from start to finish on the project, rather than jumping around from section to section, each section taught by a different person. At least three training classes made this suggestion, but it was never done. The people training us repeatedly said that we were asking all the same questions as each previous class. A suggestion was made that if we all have the same questions, perhaps they should be addressed more in-depth during training. The response was that we were asking all the right questions and that is how they jugded whether or not we were understanding what they were teaching."
good,"A typical day included cash handling, customer service, and managing the teller line. I learned how to be a leader and how to get to know my customers. Management held people back from growing within the company. The hardest part of my job was after learning everything I could to run a branch, my manager held me back from my dreams. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"Although the company promoted a sense of serving the customers at all times, the management philosophy of associates left a little to be desired in the form of the advancements made due to purely networking status versus skill and ability. Overall, the company is sound and does provide good benefits. I was proud to work there and was dedicated to my job at all times."
good,"Bank of America is a client driven company, focusing on making all aspects of their processes as transparent to the client as possible."
good,handly cash in big quantity
good,On going training on the values of customer service was a plus in performing our day to day jobs.
good,I learned how to manage and coach employees and was given good training for all the management positions I had at the bank. My abilities were recognized which resulted in my being promoted and transferred from Los Angeles to Dallas.
good,I maange a team of quality analysts for the home loans and modification department. Reviewing U/W processors and customer service associates
good,"Good benefits, culture and work/life balance. Poor job security"
good,"writing rules, examining securities firms to ensure that they’re adhering to those rules and, when necessary, taking action against brokers or firms that don’t comply;"
good,"Every morning I get my personal draw and work area ready. I log to 3 to 4 differents computer base on my role,checking my emails. and we always have a daily connect either with my team or the whole Boston market. What I like the most about my role is the fact that I have knowledge about every section and every other role,however my main responsibility is maintnance and service for consumers and business clients. I create a list of task every other base on customer request, I learn something every day while interacting with customers due to their different request. my co-worker are just awsome, they do understand how overwhelmed it can for me to manage all the requests all together they make sure they schedule appointments for the customers through an application called BBA Bank by appointment. Sometimes it's a little hard for me to share some tuffs message to customers regarding any type of fees, I always find a pleasant a professional way to make sure that they understand why and how I am going to help them to avoid certain confusions and fees in the future and they always satisfy."
good,"Consistent Lay Offs - No Job Security, Managers are under extreme pressure to do more with less. No one is happy there but remain to keep a steady income which causes them to treat yo poorly."
good,Work with homeowners that are in default. Help homeowners through the loan modification process. See resume.
good,"The overall experince was not horrible. The training was horrible, not training class nor material to refer to in the event of questions. Work culture was fair while"
good,lacked management guidence
good,Customer Service
good,"I was working as a contractor to migrate a system for which they had fired / expelled the experienced staff. The department was 98% Indian and H1B. If you have expertise they need, they'll keep you till you train someone of poorer quality until they fail, are replaced, and only in desperation, a quality person brought in temporarily at a liveable wage."
good,good company and can move around in the company. just collected on credit card accounts
good,There are so many opportunities to advance and the management is great.
good,"I would write procedures, make sure they are in compliance with the government. Managed a team of 12 associates on their day to day operation. Completed their monthly, quarterly, and yearly review."
good,B of A does is good for getting knowledge of the financial industry
good,I believe BOA could be a great place to work.
good,I enjoyed the work balance and the benefits. The managers were good when working everyone's different circumstances.
good,"The people I directly reported to were excellent, creative and highly motivational. Unfortunately, the people they reported to were not so much. Very archaic thinking in how to drive business. ""We have never done it that way so we won't start now."" mentality."
good,"When I worked at NationsBanc there was one good IT manager, several who were mediocre and one who was really bad. The bad one has now retired, the good one has changed companies and I don't know about anyone else. Since I left the bank has changed names, thrown out their established project management methodolgy and implemented 6 Sigma; I know nothing more about what kind of company it is now."
good,"Co-workers are as team players within the company, you to be flexible."
good,It was very quiet but with a steady work flow. Very secure building which made you feel very safe.
good,"I love working as a teller, and I hope to continue doing so with a different company. I have always wanted to be a teller and so am so excited to have the opportuiny to do so. The customers are great, it is a pleasure to help them. My coworkers are great people, but the management does not respect, or appreciate their workers."
good,I accepted a part-time position that I was over-qualified for to just get my foot in the door.
good,"Conferred with study teams and other document management staff in order to fulfill job responsibilities and activities; Processed documents, updating various systems, deciding which files are to be shipped to Lien Release or offsite storage; Completed departmental projects as assigned in accordance with specified guidelines; Processed receipts, documents and shipping; Provided quality control by indexing documents, return additional documents to client/study teams; Provided information necessary to complete client and departmental status reports as requested by department heads; Prepared shipping labels and customer service with outside customers, and operate image repository in order to view or extract images."
good,Bank Of America is 1 of the best place I've work. They pay you what your worth but its hard to into new position. You seem to get stuck in the same position for years. I like growth and love to learn new skills.
good,"A typical day. Login to phone systems. Communicate properly with customers. Watch time spent per call. Know how to maneuver bank systems to assist customers. Assist coworkers with calls they are not trained to handle. The hardest part of the job, was not being able to claim irate customers, because you followed policy and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job. Is assisting in training procedures."
good,"Bank of America is a good bank to work for, they have great benefits that assist student and parents, Working in an environment that did not allow for room to adapt was a bit of a set back, but a typical work day was to modify loans and to also follow guidelines and change or with the business as it was required."
good,Learned the sales aspect of finance. Great interactions with management.
good,"A lot of number crunching, excel and PowerPoint reports. Coworkers are very professional and generally helpful. The company has way too many organizational realignment, which adds to inefficiency, and eliminates any sense of stability in the process or position."
good,Always ready and positive to start a new day at work.
good,Unfortnately I was terminated from my postion at call center with Bank of America . I loved this position I was working at for many years and also loved the people I worked with. But they accused me of disconnecting customer by phone. This after I advised them I was having difficulty on hearing some of the incoming calls. They fought the idea of having to pay unemployment to me..but after the judge hearing they were unable to show proof of this. But I was not allowed to work there anymore. I am a matured woman and valued my job..I would have never put my job and life in any type of jeopardy. I had worked in the banking industry for over 35 years in different areas with the bank from entry level to supervision.
good,"I manage anywhere from 15-20 front line associates who work foreclosure files that are awaiting documents to be executed. I have learned that change is good and this place is definitely ever changing. Management lacks communication, which brings general morale down. My co-workers are great which is one thing that keeps me here. The hardest part of the job is to manage people in a production, fast paced environment. My favorite thing about the job is that I love the people I work with and the benefits are great!"
good,Bank of America is about what you'd expect for any major financial institution of it's size and scope. Strict regulatory environment guides many policies and procedures company wide causing it to be highly matrixed and subject to frequent change. This can bear on employees and have a direct negative impact to job security and overall work life balance.
good,Great support from my area manager. Overall experience positive.
good,"Working for Bank of America Home Loans was a stressful occupation as in this economy many customers were losing their homes. The benefits were excellent, but management did take away some of the existing morale boosters due to business need."
good,Great place for a taste of business world but if being just a number is a problem for you then this may not be the position for you.
good,The policy was written to support a work/life balance but that was not the workplace procedure. The bank was your life no matter what or was threaten with being fired or not being apart of the team.
good,I had a summer internship with them and learned a lot. They are hard working people who are more than willing to share there work experiences with you.
good,"This was a great learning experience about corporate America and the banking industry. This job was too monotonous for me as far as the teller part of the job because it's the same transactions repeatedly and you don't really move around. It can be difficult to keep up with all the constant changes and ""classes"" they want you to do while you work. You will also need to be able to keep your cool with people who will get angry with you about the fees/ rules and regulations. If you have thick skin and enjoy people and don't mind standing or sitting in one spot all day the pros might out-weigh the cons."
good,"Good company, strict rules less employee benefits but ample scope of Learning. Have a stressful environment and need to meet deadline on daily basis which would help a person to be more professional and disciplined."
good,"If you are straight out of High school and would like to learn more about banking its a great job to start. Sell sell sell is the mantra, so be prepered"
good,Productive work place and aggressive deadlines. Flexibility is good for work schedule. Scope to learn but too much dedication is required. Fun place to work with great co-workers
good,The bank is a good place to start but avoiding getting caught in a layoff is a kill in of itself. It can be a wonderful place to work or terrible based on the group. It is not one company but many under one banner. You can be in a good place and one re-org changes everything. Still training is offered and it's a good place to gain skill and advance your salary.
good,Think about it twice before working as a teller at BoA. This place basically slaves you to death or quitting. Lets not mention the incredible amount of responsibility you have and the fact you can’t sit at the teller line. Fridays are nightmares.
good,Worked in Customer Service  Sales. Always on the phone. As soon as one call ended another came on the line immediately as it was a call center. Sometimes customers were rude and demanding. Had weekly hour long training to keep up with the latest industry changes.
good,"All in all there are some benefits to working for a large bank like BOA.   I was promoted a few times and offered training.  But during my time there, we experienced restructures and staff reductions regularly."
good,"Nessuna possibilità di crescita , il lavoro e ottimo ma non offrono ciò che promettono"
good,"We were required to work 10-12 hour long shifts, a lot of training and on the job learning. Can be stressful but if you are confident in your abilities to please a customer and learn the material, you will be great at this job!"
good,The compensation was very good. The work was challenging with communication problems at times. Personnel changes were frequent. Very fair severance package.
good,The hardest part of your job as a relationship manager is the stress of meeting outrageous goals. Your direct manager is not on site. You work with the financial center manager but she/he dont do your annual reviews or vacation approvals. You report to offsite management.
good,"HR is very embedded in the business and culture which has its pros and cons.  Lots of red tape...mainly due to the size of the organization.  They have taken away the ability to work remotely full time, which was a definite perk."
good,Customer service is less important than sales production.  Little or no authority to make decisions on customer issues.  Everything is based on a policy that often does not fit a customer needs or situation.
good,"Like any contracted position, you will have people treat you like second class employees. I found at BoA that the culture varied greatly depending on the group you were in. My first contract my manager was horrible and mean. That said, she treated her full time employees just as badly as her contractors. I quit this position. My second contract was much better. I had a great manager who actually put effort into mentoring me. That was the first and only time I have been mentored as a contractor."
good,"Okay company. Fast paced. Sometimes very sale focused, no days off if you’re not meeting goals. Coworkers are nice. Opportunity to grow if you are able to show on numbers not your effort."
good,"Bank of America was a decent place to work.  My specific responsibilities I thoughly enjoyed.  Great team work in my area, and always learning new things."
good,"I loved working at Bank of America and loved my team who I worked with. However I started to feel that even though I'm a top performer I'm not getting the proper coaching sessions that I needed with my manager. On multiple occasions sessions were cancelled and the only time I had a session was telling me I hung up on a client and it was less than 30 seconds and HR would investigate. Never once was the people who play on their phones all day, take videos of other employees and post it in a group text was addressed.. hmm I wonder why. I've always did my job and excelled in what I do. Surveys and stats prove that. However that means nothing when they want to get rid of you due to a reason why I believe but won't say. What they should investigate is folks breaking the no phone policy and recording.. I hope management will do their best in personally getting to know their staff so they can be open more about the mental health issues that they have going. Someone who smiles often is not always ok. I was that someone and even losing my job I am still going to hope for better days."
good,After 7 years working for the company they didn’t have any sense of empathy when it comes to fire so they just care about how much you can sale specially in my regional Market the only thing they care about it’s how much you can sale.
good,"It is a call center. "
good,"if are willing to handle the pressure for sales, this is the place for you, otherwise, consider your options, the most amazing value of BoA is the team, it was a marvelous experience working with them."
good,"Company is a sales company, every position is designed to sell. Company doesn't invest in employees as much as they should. Company makes billions upon billions but never is satisfied"
good,Very complicated systems to help customers with some pretty basic services.  I felt frustration on about a daily basis.  And there were way too many hoops to jump through to earn any kind of bonus.  So they ask too much for what you get in return.  But they do have good benefits.
good,"Definitely a good place to work for if you’re looking to gain experience in a call center because they’ll hire just about anyone as long as they don’t have anything on their record related to theft/bank issues. Other than that this place is a revolving door and has trashy reps. I personally stayed out of all drama but it’s always around you. It smells like a cheap department store the way everyone sprays their cologne, perfum, body sprays, and oils. Also people steal food from the fridge on all floors so don’t pack it unless you can lock it. The pay is mediocre at best, only people okay with that pay probably came from a minimum wage/retail job. Incentives are based mostly on surveys so if you have a customer who is just mean they’ll give you a bad score, or the survey was meant for someone else (the call was transferred or came from a banking center) it’ll effect your monthly bonus which is messed up. So basically if you follow polices and procedures you can get a 1 on a survey and they take it away from your bonus. One really good thing is all of the managers are pretty cool as long as you’re not a gossip and just do your job. Also as long as you have the time available and you’re honest they’ll definitely approve your time off. And they have a really good benefits package for people with children. That’s probably why so many parents stay."
good,"Fast paced environment, things are always changing, you have to have the ability to adapt to any and everything. Procedures change constantly and you have to be aware"
good,BofA is not a place for people with big aspirations. Less Transparency in Promotion and Appraisal cycle. Very Good Company for Job Security for people with less aspirations.
good,"BofA offers excellent benefits- generous paid vacation and sick time, good medical and dental benefits, 401k with company matching, employee networks and volunteer activities"
good,Constant interaction with local and national staff utilizing Skype and daily conference calls.  Fast moving pace with daily challenges solving clients needs in a timely manner.
good,It's been over 5 years since I left the company so thinking back on it now I would have to say that I loved the team I worked with but the silos and structure of the cooperation made it hard to know if you really made a difference.
good,Most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with my knowledgeable and truly genuine colleagues.  My colleagues are focused on the teams success and openly share information and collaborate.
good,Bank of America has been a good place to work with challenges faced by other similar companies. The flexibility once offered seems to be going by the wayside making it more challenging for a work life balance to be achieved. Salary is fair but benefits aren’t great. Emphasis is on attracting new employees rather than keeping the ones they have motivated and engaged
good,"We were family at the bank, for the most part management was fair. We had a lot of organized fun activities to participate with. The environment was very comfortable."
good,it wouldn't be so bad if they didn't have surveys that determined if you get a bonus or not you can't make these customers happy and all you're doing is Bank of America's dirty work when they won't refund fees or place extended holds on people's checks you're constantly battling a customer and they give you different ways of a basically giving them the run-around in your answers but you're held responsible for their happiness and it's not fair because we don't own the bank the managers constantly coach you I feel like I'm a toddler people have just stopped coming to work that pay raise has to do with the fact that people probably have to go and get a psychiatric evaluation after dealing with these customers the surveys are the worst and this is a call center not a career they sell you a dream about being a digital person and digital migration but really all you're doing is getting yelled at because of Bank of America's policies and procedures
good,"Great place to work. There's a lot of work and lots to learn, will definitely prepare you for your next job. Flexibility is offer by the company however, it depends on how flexible your manager is."
good,"typical day at a call center,back to back calls and a hour lunch break. great benefits.hardest part is training but once you get the routine you'll be fine."
good,"BOA doesnt have many open positions to advance, they are not very responsive and would rather hire from outside rather then within which very disappointing."
good,"I learned a lot at bank of America, however like any other call center you are nothing but a number and you are easily replaced. Great benefits. Good vacation time, good pay. Its just not for everybody, being couped up in a desk just taking calls is frustrating being that boa has a lot of things to improve. Managers are never available when you need them and all the leaders have some different to say and often mislead you."
good,"Busy but had an opportunity to learn "
good,"Nothing was great. It was ok. A couple of times a year downsizing occurred. If extra time was worked, the efforts were not recognized. Priorities kept changing."
good,"Between having to work 6 days a week and frequently changing managers, it’s no longer the company it use to be. Health insurance is decent as is vacation time."
good,If your looking for a placw to get your foot in the door in the financial industry BofA is not a bad place to start. There are opportunities for advancement if you know the right people
good,"Good place but no enough work life balance we often work six days a week. Systems often do not work overall a good company, need to include employees in system updates"
good,I was initially content with this job opportunity and held Bank of America high on the corporate level but was tremendously disappointed. There was some great people in leadership but the greatness did not trickle down and it was like a college campus play ground rather than a business climate.
good,"Co-workers and customers were the best part of the job."
good,"This was strictly call center work, back to back calls on many different systems.  We were promised over a month of training, and that was needed, but they cut it in half and I was very lost for a while.  My co-workers were nice though."
good,"This was many years ago, but the environment then was a good place to be. The people where professional and some of the managers. Was a great place to work."
good,"If you’re into drinking Kool Aid, this is the job for you. Management micromanages everything you do, but they do it from a distance. Expect numerous emails every morning with new directives and the expectation that you will report your daily activities to them EOD. Checklists and workflows for every task and so much oversight, 95% of the job is just knowing what you can’t do."
good,"Position is entry level. Many trainings and for the stress, you are highly underpaid. So many procedures to follow and hours are inconsistent. Expect to put in 40 plus hours a week."
good,"Biggest concern was a lot of managers played favorites.  No matter how well you did your job at times, there was still no moving up or recognition unless you were in the ""circle."""
good,"Depends on the team. Certain teams are small in size with good opportunities; whereas, most of the teams are giant size where no one actually knows what the whole project is about."
good,"A typical day at work involves uncovering customers needs and trying to find solutions for those needs. It is a very structured and corporate environment that strictly adheres to its policies and procedures. You learn how to structure your day and create a mission statement of ""to do's"" to accomplish. The MO of the company is data collection on clients. Every single interaction is tracked down to the smallest detail in an effort to find out if the company can find a product to benefit the client. The most difficult part of the job is that money rules everything. Clients that have capital know that they can treat you like garbage and get away with it. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually finding people that need financial help and assisting them through difficult situations."
good,"I worked for this company for over 10 years and climbed the corporate latter only to be told my position was eliminated, they didn't even have the decency to advise us of the change until the day of. I was offered the opportunity to take a job within the company making far less than my current salary at the time....I respectfully declined. Yes, they are into the ""we can't afford you anymore"" games."
good,"Bank of America offers great benefits like Child Care Reimbursement, 401K matching, Discount program, Short Term and Long Term Disability and many different health insurance programs. But, the management is terrible!!! Senior management does not know up from down, and it gets very frustrating when you are trying to do your job properly. You have to be ready for change at any moment as things constantly fluctuate depending on the mood of senior management. Depending on which department you go to...the training will be TERRIBLE. They just throw you right into the wolves and then wonder why you are making so many mistakes."
good,"Competitive compensation and benefits.  Cubicle work stations. On site Cafeteria. Work from home was not available to the masses however, for some it was permitted."
good,The benefit package was very good including holidays and vacation.  However the number of hours you have to work offsets any paid time off.  My immediate manager was one of the worst managers I have ever worked for.  The best work day was the day I was informed that my job had been eliminated.
good,I would really not be able to provide a fair assessment of this company since I was a contractor.  Contractors were treated fairly but  just had no real idea on how the environment actually is for permanent employees. I only saw various reactions from permanent employees.
good,"Bank  of America is a very diverse place to work. Management ranges from really good to really bad. It really is about who you know there rather than experience. The only reason why I would not recommend them is because they don't pay well at all.  I mean its really bad. Looking at your pay check is depressing and does not motivate you to do your best or wake up and go to work. The way they decide your yearly pay increase is not proper and again, its about who you know.  The benefits are pretty good though."
good,My job was to answer phones and emails with requests from clients. I handled between 50 and 75 emails and 10+ phone calls per day involving simple to complex banking issues.
good,"The fact that your job depends on your sales numbers is very stressful where a lot of people only last a few months. Your sales really depend on the customers that come in and the location of the bank. Traffic in the bank can be inconsistent, which means upper management will micromanage nearly every day. Some of their ideas are excellent, but most are absolutely insane. Good news is you learn a lot when it comes to management and sales, and also the benefits/pay are above average."
good,"Bank of America forced us out. The cash vault department was let go, we were outsourced to another company. Bank of America never said anything to us except go work for another company."
good,"At BoA, I  have learned the importance of catering to my peers. It is important to be diplomatic when giving and taking criticism. As I   complete my first year in management with Business Analysis, i   can see that it is important to work on any and all goals step by step. It is important to have a healthy debate when trying to reach a deadline, especially when it comes to satisfying our stakeholders and our employees/clients. Our company boosts morale within each department. This is a great stepping stone for me when it comes to project management, but now I   am ready to reach new heights elsewhere."
good,"Very busy with many phone calls and a little too much time on the phone makes it difficult to solve issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is the monthly meetings where we play games and play mini basketball,"
good,I am at a place in my life where it is time for change. I have been in the financial field for many years and now feel that I want to do something else.  I enjoy speaking with people and helping them. I have a lot of experience in customer service and would like to continue in that field. With your help I hope to find new employment.
good,"The environment was very nice. I worked in a satellite office of Bank of America in their real estate loan division.  Thought the compensation was very low, I would still recommend Bank of America."
good,Bank of America the company is great to work for but as with any company it is based on the management. They are pretty lenient when it comes to needing time off for emergencies but the upper management steadily change/alter whether in personnel or in operations which trickle down to the financial centers and effects the employees and the clients/potential clients in a negative way for the most part. But they have great benefits if you're willing to take the pay cut. The right manager will want for you to move up in the company but that changes from market to market and financial center to financial center.
good,"Was a great company to work for prior to 9/11, but then every industry went south after 9/11, including the financial industry, including Bank of America.  Luckily, it has rebounded since then, but I was not there for the rebound."
good,Constant re-orgs are to be expected with large orgs but every couple of months is a little much. Benefits are great and attempts are made at work like balance.
good,"Liked my work, but was stifled from elevating. I definitely enjoyed the associates and made life-long friends. Culture was great until the recession. After that time it went downhill."
good,"This was a great contract opportunity to get me back in the the real estate business. "
good,"Work culture could use some help, but the benefits and compensation were competitive and attractive. Support from the management was a low score if I was to give one."
good,As a proof operator you are required to encode item with speed and accuracy and limited errors. Items were encoded with dollar amounts and processed as debit or credit
good,"I met a lot of great people, many of which I still keep in contact with. Opportunities for advancement are not always fair, sometimes management plays favorites. It is a stable company and as long as you play by their rules you will go far."
good,"The company offers great benefit, management is not the best. They are unorganized and no one is on the same page. Multiple managers have different answer on ""the right thing to do"". Pay is not amazing and hours are not flexible. Plus side it the company benefits that's about it"
good,Productive and stressful with employees being laid off and work load being that of 3 jobs descriptions into 1 role. Management favorites and only care about production.
good,"Was to sign in and take calls from customer wanting to balances, open new accounts and to submit a complaint. Management was lazy and some of my co-workers I was close to and the other just complained too much."
good,"I only worked on the Merrill Lynch side. It is like any other major investment bank. The hours are long, there are a lot of difficult personalities and LOTS of politics. The pay is very good, but you will pay for that in stress and time commitment."
good,Recent college graduates are encourage to seek opportunities.  Excellent place to work for novice employees.  Work life balance is great for positions that do not require 24x7 support.
good,"From a technology point of view, don't believe that the ever shifting management understands what you do or the value of it. Make sure your skills are current for the job market rather than trying to work hard at your current position. Severance agreement is extremely restrictive and one sided and you give up all rights to even criticize them. If you don't sign, your severance pay, severance benefits and eligibility for COBRA are immediately stopped. No 30 day opportunity to look for another position within the Bank so put the effort into networking yourself before the axe falls. Laid off by phone call and someone waiting at your desk to collect your cell phone and laptop. Immediately locked out of all of your resources like email and personal folders so make sure you have everything you might need save off in another way."
good,Worked as foreclosure specialist. Signed affidavits all day. Not the most pleasant thing. Entire site in Pittsburgh was eventually laid off as housing market improved
good,Great environment to work in.  Coworkers show you the ropes.  Customers were great.  Very friendly and family-oriented.  Felt like a family and there was room for advancement.
good,Overall Bank of America is a good place to work as long as you are working for a good manager. The biggest downside to working here is the perpetual state of layoffs. I know layoffs are just the way it is in a large company but these seem to have no link to performance. Some executive decides that they don't want a certain position any longer and you are out the door. No opportunity to take a new job within the Bank even if you are a top performer.
good,"Bank of America was a great place to work, very easy going and had a lot good things going for it I worked I. The home preservation department and was very interesting."
good,"Every year they kept taking perks away.  In the beginning they were ok, but eventually turned into just a job.  If the Sr Execs would employ enough employees to allow flexibility, then it may improve.  But people are worked extremely hard."
good,"Bank of America Tower has slowly gone downhill. We never had solid managers, no one communicated, very little to no consequences for irradical behavior"
good,Only worked for one year.  I felt like I had good direction and alignment from management on my day to day and how it contributes to overall strategy.
good,BOA was Ok. While working there i felt as though there was limited opportunity for growth. Management encouraged the assistance at  times. Needs to have a better employee culture.
good,"Worked from a queue very fast paced."
good,"work hard, team supports each other to keep smiles up.  Especially after 300 plus calls, two complaints, and mandatory overtime....."
good,The job wasn't the worse but management could really use some coaching or training. The unprofessionalism that the managers were involved in was pretty bad.
good,"Typical works day is waiting for management to call back with directions and next steps once a presentation is given to him."
good,Se trabaja bien pero hace falta que la parte de RH vea por las personas
good,"Mainly coordination of testing activities.  This role did not require strong technical expertise,  processes were already established and the team was to follow them for every release.  No feedback would be provided or any changes were implemented from retrospective meetings."
good,"Workplace is really good nice area to work during day a night.  Best part about the job is you get to go in any time you want. The hardest part of the job is cleaning windows.  Management is decent, but when you need supplies it takes a very long time to ger supplies"
good,Worked on financial models to help with the rolling 13 month forecast and ultimately the annual budget.  Answering questions from the departments support a lot of time building multiple ad hoc models and reports to understand the variance that was in question.  The culture was open door with the ability to offer thoughts and opinions on a situation.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours and getting managers to give an approval on a deliverable in a timely manner.  The people I worked with and ability to advance my career.
good,such a large company.  You can get in and get work done and not have to bother with making nice with people. Most people kept to themselves as they all had a lot of work on their desks to complete. It was good for a while - but then things started to change and it became more and more difficult to work there.
good,"Sales type of job. If you bring donuts to the supervisors, more than likely you will get promoted. Learned about the auto loan industry and saw the bank only worries about himself as well as some of the supervisors."
good,"I went through the bank's credit training program for almost a year. Got promoted to a Loan Officer position in Beverly Hills. I handled high net worth individual customers, as well as privately held companies."
good,"Great place to earn money , great work place and I loved working with my co-workers. Good benefits for you and your family. Very easy to get to and from work."
good,meet goals always changing and co workers are not team players some managers talk bad about theyre own employees all the time and don't help you if they don't like you
good,"I learned a lot, i liked my job, I opened mail, processed payments, and changed addresses. I started there in 2007 and got severances and came back in 2013."
good,I enjoyed working at Bank of America.  The problem was that I could never get enough hours.  Part-time work does not give you enough money to survive with a family.
good,Strong sales and service environment.  Strict sales goals at every level and strong marketing and sales experience is a plus.  Good benefits and fair pay.
good,Recruiters are paid to get people to join the company and will fabricate the compensation plan along with the market managers while going through the hiring process. Do your homework and talk to existing employees or former employees before accepting any role on the retail side of business.
good,There have been continuous layoffs since 2012.  The management does not listen to the employees unless they want to know how to do something.  The pay and benefits are good.  There is no opporttunity for advancement.
good,"Great co-workers, management hit or miss. "
good,"No fair treatment of employees, matters reported to HR Corporate and complaint told to management who was causing the problem and created more harassment. No employee protection again harassment."
good,"I feel Bank of America has a lot of great qualities. You will learn a lot with Bank of America, the staff is great. People tend to help each other.  There were a few bad qualities too. Its hard to move up in the company and very challenging to get out of one department once you are there."
good,You meet your goals or you're out. It is a great place to learn banking and they're always hiring. I worked there when it was the original BOFA before being acquired by Nations Bank. That's when it changed.
good,"So many things have changed since I started at this company. My direct manager is amazing, I wish I can say the same for upper management. Work wouldn't be so stressful if upper management would stick to what we tell customers."
good,It was more fun to work in our own office and not really be client facing. Team was great and that would make you love to get to work. Workplace culture has been great.
good,"Bad management and no work/life balance. Their culture believe more in job titles and money than people’s  real life and ethics. They care more about quantity of money and not quality of service. They are always making so many changes many are positive many are negative or not necessary. They do not enjoy the positive of anything because nothing is good enough. They Are always changing, adding and taking away from their own software to policy’s to procedures to sales goals to employees. Nothing last long enough to work with joy, consistency and stability."
good,Bank of America is your typical bank filled with a lot of governance and bureaucracy.   I was in the mortgage division where they were winding down operations and selling off as many loans as they could.  This resulted in a very difficult environment to enact change and have any career advancement in
good,You'll love the benefits and the training is exceptional.  Learned the process of reviewing legal documents when a customer passes away and what is needed to assist the family for closing out the decedents accounts at this difficult time.
good,"I was hired on for a 3 month temporary assignment with another temp. We assisted in the call center for those who assist with loans. It was a very fast paced environment. My main portion was just scanning in loan docs and printing documentation all day for records keeping. The people were friendly. The management was good. The hardest part of my particular job was the repetition of doing the same thing scanning all day long for three months. There wasn't variety, but I was temping. I enjoyed working with the other co-workers. It wasn't uncommon to have team parties for the group for appreciation."
good,The actual work is great if you have a great management team that actually cares about you as an employee aka human vs. a number.  A lot of time you will feel like a number.
good,Great job learned a lot. That was good company too work for. It was was challenging job that pushed me every day to learn and adapt to ever changing environment.
good,"Bank of America is an extremely competitive and highly stressful place to work.  However, their salaries and benefits are certainly competitive with, if not higher than other corporations within the industry."
good,"-Structure was very corporate"
good,"I had 9 hours a day and I learned about the corporation's level.  The hardest part was job security,  One day you are there the next day you are laid off.  The most enjoyable part was friends."
good,"Manage and advise the sales team with current market trends. Evaluate costs and revenue of agreements to determine continued profitability. Direct the teller referral program to increase sales."
good,"took a temp role in charlotte as application developer. The project was very short term, planned poorly, and didn't go anywhere but the pay was good. Would recommend to someone due to high hourly rate."
good,I was a contractor and found it to be a good professional working environment. I worked on a lot of cool projects and learned a lot while solving difficult issues as we developed and maintained applications
good,"Merill Lynch was merged with Bank of America so its tough to provide reviews now."
good,"it is just an okay place to work nothing more. it is a good place to start a banking career, and afterward, proceed to a better banking center to gain more experience"
good,"Great people to work with. Managers for the most part are fair, great benefits. Not the best training. Upper management needs to be more involved in the day to day"
good,"Although the pay was pretty fair. The work schedule was less than desirable. The entire day is spent on the phone, in order to provide support to customers. However, the culture was a bit of a political one. You would find yourself in a better position for opportunities and favorable consideration, if you are good at ingratiating yourself to the boss. However, despite the call volume and the rapid pace of the work, they are flexible enough to allow you the time to take car of personal problems.  Also, they value the quantity of your work, rather than quality. If you handled 50 quality calls, against someone who handled 70 incomplete and sloppy calls, they would value the 70 incomplete and sloppy calls over the 50 quality calls. Also, procedure that is provided through the guidelines are often fluid. What may be correct today, won't be tomorrow."
good,"After over 8 years of hard work, I was let go, due to company reorganizing. Never had a manager that lasted more than a year thus never had a chance to be recognized for my contributions to the company, even though I was one of the higher producers and did much to improve my team's work quality and performance by training and helping new teammates. I was always treated like a number that is easily expandable and not a valued employee."
good,"I did not work for bank of America "
good,It was a wonderful experience learning about how to manage your finances and to help others achieve their goal as well. I made a lot of connections with others that I would have not been able to make if it wasn't for working at Bank of America.
good,"there is no point in this review, it was in 2000, too long ago and the division I worked for closed causing my department to be laid off.  the agents for M L wanted to give they stock customers anything they wanted even crossing department lines and trying to give perks we were not legally allowed to give."
good,typical day was enjoyable I learned to be patient.. management was ok.. workplace culture was ok. the hardest part was nothing the most enjoyable was working with customers
good,"Heavy workload, poor management, favoritism by management.  Worked for at least 3 to 4 portfolio managers.  Staff never felt like the job they were doing was good enough.  My peers were great to work with and my portfolio managers as well."
good,"Lots of stress, fast paced, competitive, lots of travel. The  salary was  low for position. Colleagues were great - smart and talented. Work load as heavy, lots of hours logged every day."
good,"Culture has changed drastically.  No longer very entrepreneurial.  Very much risk and compliance driven.  The initial move to monitor risk more closely was necessary and welcome, but pendulum has swung too far."
good,The company in a whole was not bad to work for. The everyday tasks were challenging as they werr changed often. It was hard to complete all items required in a day. The business is a stressful line of work.
good,if you are career and goal oriented this is not the employer for you.
good,"Potential for a good career if you have the strategy and stamina to last ten years to earn one of the coveted positions."
good,I like many of the people that worked with did not have any experience. I started as temporary worker and after 3 months I was hired full time. Promotions come easy as long as you prove yourself by working hard. Overall I enjoyed working there. Was laid off due to the mortgage meltdown.
good,"This is a company for people that don't want to work as a team. This is a very individual work environment. People are out for themselves, not for the company's best interest."
good,Our jobs were always threatened and we were always stressed out and over worked. I learned a lot about assignment transfer and generation and the other side of loan processing.
good,"Great employer as far as hourly compensation, vacation and benefits. The downside is that the standards of selling cause roughly a 50% turnover rate. It's quite stressful and overly competitive, but if you can make the sales, the rewards are great."
good,I didn't get what was due.  I was given three certificates because I had zero differences. I wasn't given what I due. I wasn't paid. They had good health benefits at that time.
good,Don't do more than you should as if you do you will have to do the other person's work that does nothing but you get paid the same. I learn to watch out for yourself.
good,Bank of America will just use you and the moment you need them they will leave you dry. My brother was murdered and I was given a hard time with my bereavement.
good,"A fun fast paced environment, but pay is on the low end of the scale.  Good training, nice people, good facilities and work environment.  Respectful managers and coworkers."
good,"BOA is a heck of a job to bite off. On one hand, you get great benefits and opportunities. On the other hand, you might just be miserable. If you get on the right team you can have a family, on the wrong team, though, and they don't even expect you to stay long. A clear bias for people on the sales team for obvious reasons."
good,I liked the environment but the manager was looking for experienced help immediately and was not good at coaching. Was thrown into the mix from the start. Not upset but looking for a better opportunity.
good,Bank of America is a huge company that basically only cares about their bottom line. Management is under constant pressure to perform and that pressure gets handed down to employees that can get let go easily.
good,"No work life balance, employees feel under valued per annual employee survey. Cut throat, upper management could care less about employees beneath them. Polices and culture should be reevaluated."
good,"The company had great benefits, when I first started their, the department I worked in was great.  It had a great group of people. The second department was also great."
good,"Its an ok job. Depends on the department you work in. BUT, good benefits. Be careful and document everything and ask questions of the positions and what you get into."
good,Got placed with a group head that was not what I had intended. He took one of my accounts and was only concerned about himself. He claimed to be a big Family guy but was the farthest thing from that. I asked for over a year to move to another group that wanted to take me in but it fell on deaf ears.
good,"Typical day - take inbound calls, within the fraud department, in a call center environment from angry customers whose debit cards are being declined at a merchant. BOA customers are either very nice or completely rude. There is no middle ground."
good,Working at Bank of America over the years the company has changed drastically. The company is more focused on the share holders rather than the customers. There is too much pressure to meet sales goals. The good thing about the job are the benefits.
good,They want you to do more with less staff. Nothing you do is ever good enough and management doesn't care about staff. The only good thing is the benefits offered.
good,if you want a place that you will work hon but get compensated this is the place. you will be challenged and encouraged to both persue the companys role and your growth
good,"Typical day is heavy with meetings for the team you are on and other teams,"
good,"Bank of America offers great learning opportunities and challenging jobs.  The executive training and development is very strong and there is a good culture.  "
good,Childcare reimbursement and backup care are the biggest benefits for me. Working 6 days each week is less than desirable. 30 minute lunch break too short.
good,"A typical day at work is stressful due to work loads being distributed unevenly. Management have favorites that are allowed to do what they want when they want, The hardest part about the job is remaining calm when you feel mistreated and over worked. The enjoyable part of the job is being able to communicate with other employees that share the same view as to how things should be managed."
good,"So much has changed after the merger with Nations Bank.  The culture once was very positive. It has changed to non personal work place.  As a result of the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis, there were many branches closed down.  After 18 years, I among many others did not have a job."
good,"BA Continuum India pvt ltd is a part of Bank of America, work life balance over here is good, but the management is not good, politics in each and every part is one of the worst thing over here. Also the career growth is very much slow and at a time it becomes stagnant."
good,"The work environment is very competitive.  There are many nice people that work at Bank of America.  However, HR needs to do a better job at hiring individuals in management positions."
good,"BofA is a great company with lots of opportunities.  To advance in your career you must have a strong network and the support of your direct management.  My direct management is not as strong as my peers and my peers careers have moved along further and quicker.  My desire to leave a Bank I've worked over 9+ yrs is due to my most recent management experience.  It doesn't mean BofA is not a great place to work, it just means I caught a bad break with poor leadership."
good,Working at BOA is a different experience for everyone depending on your role.  I was in a sales role that was cutthroat and hyper-competitive and it wasn't a good environment for me.  This doesn't mean others won't thrive on it or that this is the culture in every group.  In order to gain real insight into the culture of the group you are working with you need to have honest conversations with people in that group prior to joining.
good,"Bank of America actually bought out MBNA whom I was initially hired with and everything went downhill from there. I was hired into the customer assistance position. The culture changed from management on down. We went from being like a family with MBNA , to every person for themselves and even management being out to get individuals fired. Very stressful place to be once Bank Of America took over the credit card department. They then shut the Newark, NJ site down in May 2013"
good,Working during the tax season required high a paced low error environment which could provide very stressful to anyone not able to handle that type of pace.
good,"While they try to show themselves as a ""local bank"" BoA is anything but. They have limited advancement for those without a financial background, are limiting the amount of personal autonomy for many of the customer service positions - every decision not part of the ""script"" has to be approved by upper management - not even the immediate supervisor can make any blanket decisions. Everything is said to affect the bottom line, yet it is never shown exactly how it does when asked."
good,place does get stressful at times in dealing with customers over the phone and managers that you have to work with the stress in having customers do surveys on you
good,"Answering and assisting 401k plan participants by phone.  Hours each week were to be 40 hours however overtime was constantly assigned due to short staffing.  Employer was not fair in assigning work times and hours required for work.  I was assigned late morning to close shifts which required staying on the phone lines until cleared, usually after posted end of shift times."
good,Staff are rather friendly and try to help each other when run into problems. No communication available with supervising group of people. Work hour is pretty regular.
good,"This is a company that is a great teacher in leadership, management and relationship building. In my department job security was the issue, we had layoffs each month for 3 years so moral was down. I consider this company a good career builder and stepping stone for a future postion."
good,The one thing I was not happy about is we were promised that we would become permanent employees and then were layed off a year later.   This was a temp position.
good,It's an easy job. Typical day you come in and get on the phones. The calls are back to back and you don't get any wrap up time. Management is mostly busy as they are dealing with other agents or on an escalated call.
good,Very tedious and constantly changing systems. Nice people to work with but very uptight workplace. Write ups are constant and you get emails from people you have never met that scrutinize numbers they don't even truly understand.
good,The culture is respectful and supports a work life balance but you must be assertive at times to preserve this for yourself.  The management is supportive overall but there can be some challenges.
good,More compliance work being added with less resources to do the work. Starting to feel like you are a paper pusher. Day to day work is now being outsourced to India yet you are held accountable for their output
good,"Closed several sites"
good,"It's been twelve years since I have worked there and knowing how times are changing not sure what the environment is like now, but when I was there it was a great job."
good,The management is rude and disrespectful to the entire staff. They speak to with disrespect and belittle the staff. They also don't care about your personal or family life.
good,"when i was there if you performed they took care of you. some of the CMM's (regionals) are very arrogant. i have not much to add on thios one."
good,I worked with Bank of America for 2 years An never got a raise I tried to work as hard as I could. I learned a lot as far as myself An my patience my customer service skills
good,"good place to work but because its so large people are in fear of lay offs yearly, sometimes difficult to move up, if you are technology qualified this is the place to be."
good,"You will work in a high stress, fast paced environment, where your bonus is not capped. In role development and hands on training combine with virtual instructors."
good,Great job for a young adult who has graduated HS and is ok with a challenge day after day. If you can sell products and enjoy it then you can do banking.
good,Working as a bank teller can be a good opportunity for one to maximize their customer service skills.  Also if you are seeking a career in banking working as a teller is an excellent start because there is much room for advancement.
good,"The work environment has improved a great deal since I first started and could improve even more under the right management team. I have learned  a lot about coaching and development of agents both in a group setting and one on one."
good,"I was never as comfortable in the contract as I was in many contracts.  The job responsibilities were not well defined or communicated.    I was the only person on the 20+ people team that was not born in India,  I do not feel I am xenophobic, but I never really fit in."
good,small business is a really new dept that needs a lot of work. There is a unwanted high school feel in the contact center. They need better and more managers.
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work. As a large company it has many lines of business and I enjoyed ATM fraud.  The culture was one that encourage career development.  I experienced both good management and bad, it went along business lines.  ATM fraud was fantastic moved to prepaid cards which was under non-fraud and management was not as good.  In their defense they expected to get contracts for Perpaid cards that never materialized.  The hardest part of the job was the pay-deny decision but helping people recover from a fraud event was the most enjoyable.  I enjoyed my time at B of A except for the last year."
good,"depending on what branch you are at will ultimately determine your success. each branch is different and clients are different. some locations are easier and some more competitive. I was in Burbank. the manager was way too high minded and difficult to work with, there were too many mandatory meetings what repeated the same information you received in an email. I was tired of driving 30 minutes to work on a Saturday at 7am to go for an hour meeting on my day off. the compensation can be good, but again depends on your branch and how much help you receive."
good,"You can tolerate long hours, and independent work style.  The culture is independence and management is friendly.   I worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch for a couple years."
good,"The PMD role is very intense.  The training is hit or miss, depending on the person in charge.  Potential for success is unlimited.  However, likelihood of success is extremely low.  As a PMD you are often reminded that you are the lowest person in the ""food chain"" and a cost deficit so you have to be very mentally tough. This is a good role for someone a ""workaholic"" with a lot of connections to people with people with a minimum of $250,000 in investable assets."
good,"Management, stress, and workplace culture truly depends on the department you work in. Work environment for me now is relaxed. Manager is flexible and really gets to know her employees."
good,I enjoyed working for Bank of America. I left because i feel that job is made for a person that is not enrolled in school because they were unable to work around my hours.
good,I recently had very petty experiences with management. Some managers were very bias to some people. Flexible work options were only granted to their favorites. Had a injury that required surgery. Didn't need to be on short term disability but need a few days for swelling to reduce. The surgery was a primary limb. Asked to work from home for a few days and was denied the option instead was required to use time off. Wouldn't have been a problem if others were held to the same statndard. People were working from home for pet appointments.
good,"This is a high-paced, cut-throat industry and you can make a lot of money. It wasn't my cup of tea because money is not my priority in life. It's just to help me afford living costs. But if you are driven and want to make lots of money. This is the place for you. They offer training and support to help you build a great financial team. This is where I'd go to invest my money."
good,This isn't a bad place to work and probably one of the better jobs in the area.  The benefits are quite good but the pay is less than I would like it to be and I don't really think I can advance at the current location.
good,Is very stressful. Not enough training. Managers are not willing to help you. Favors all around.......................................................
good,"Like I said it WAS a good place before Bank of America took over. They actually CARED about their clients. When B of A came in all they wanted to do was push sales, sales, sales. Thats why a lot of clients left."
good,There was a lot of job uncertainty. We were uncertain how long the customer assistance center would be open. Some management issues. My colleagues were very nice.
good,"Again, i prefer to keep my opinion to myself.  The loan center i worked for has long since outsourced and closed down. "
good,worked as a temp and was treated as such. as a result desk and supervisor changed frequently. was asked to come on as permanent employee but health issues arose.
good,I loved my job at the bank.  I managed a highly efficient team of Business Analysts and Technical analysts across the globe.    Even though I was consistently rated highly over my 16 year career I was laid off.    I worked 50 - 60 hours a week and sacrificed many hours that should have been spent with family.  My thanks was a 6 month long severance when my entire department was well aware that I was in need of spinal surgery.
good,"Zero room for error"
good,"Actually good place to work at and is very flexible hours of working, had to leave due to maternity and had to care of the baby.  But working here was a pleasure"
good,sorry I worked here a long time ago. I don't really remember much about it. lots of forced selling of credit cards. have to meet those goals. didn't really care for that to much
good,"Working for Bank of America is an fulfilling job, I have grown in the bank within the past 15 years. The hardest part of the job is the constant uncertainty of having a job the next week."
good,"Tuition and child care reimbursement options were phenomenal. Health insurance options were really good, really high, but really good. I enjoyed working downtown but didn't enjoy paying to park and there was no reimbursement for parking."
good,"Competitive environment, but we strived to be number #1  in the industry and in client excellence. I enjoyed my job and handled the fast pace environment for 15 1/2 years. Work life balance was hard to achieve as mortgage industry volume was up. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I enjoyed building/training a team and building a great relationship with them and assisting them in achieving a work/life balance and advancement within the company."
good,"Sweat shop. They want you to complete the work of 4 people with no OT offered and will get on to you if work is not completed on time, no excuse works for management."
good,"This was a temporary assignment.  It should have been better organized and thought through.  It took entirely too long to receive login and access to the applicable systems needed to perform assignments.  "
good,"OK. As a company good benefits  etc,  people are great managers need   more training on fairness and compassion for their employees, The need to not hire   family and friends."
good,"Good company to work for, depends on where you are as allot of families are employed causing stress for peers. managers have favorites and  hard workers  do not get acknowledged."
good,Worked  for BAC for 30+ years.  It can be a wonderful place to work.  There are a lot of opportunities to move up in the company.  Also a lot of opportunities to cross train.
good,"A typical work day is that you stay busy and that makes time fly by fast."
good,Decent compensation and benefits. Work life balance is OK.No complaints about the  Management .However job culture is still evolving.Overall a decent company to work with.
good,"Good benefit, friendly employees, welcoming environment for client, chasing professionalism. building skills quick."
good,"It's a fairly cut throat environment, but that was before the most recent lawsuit, so I don't know how it's changed. The policies are constantly changing, so you don't know what to be hunting for from one day to the next."
good,"Bank of America is a very Professional environment ! Focuses on building Relationships mostly for customers . Employees are just numbers and they do not care how long you have worked for them , they will let you go in a minute . The Company provides great benefits and rewards hard working associates ."
good,Flexibility is the best part of the job.  Compensation is below industry standard and there are overlapping lines of business that can make getting things done challenging.
good,"I do not have much to say, this was not a fun place to work, they preached about employee happiness and all but never really cared for its employees. since I do not have anything nice to say I will end it there"
good,"Not personable. Upper management is starting to crumble. So many changes, nothings consistent. It can be difficult to move up even when you hit your goals constantly."
good,Minimal training and high expectations! Lots of employee appreciation events. Nice business culture and great work schedule flexibility which allows time to incorporate family events and personal appointments without losing accrued time.
good,"This is fast-paced environment that aims to focus on customer relations but dependent upon location and management, only cares for sales and numbers. Great company to start a career, internal promotions vary upon who knows who, and comes with benefits and 401k plans. Don't believe them when they say what you say to anyone is confidential. they stalk everything you do daily. Hardest part is making life easier for customers with teammates because some team members only care for the end result. There are too many favors and not enough consistency regarding policies for customers. Most enjoyable is making acquaintances who are easy to work with and essentially there to work, not hang out. Which a lot of management does....."
good,Worked multiple roles during employment as the company moved employees at their discretion. Advancement within was available. Management was not very transparent. Learned each role with training and extended training offered.
good,Bank of America is great to gain work experience in the Financial Industry with giving great organized training and a great system to wok off of. It is not easy to be promoted.
good,"Being a personal banker is a good job to have and BofA was a good company to work for, however their compensation stood out as being  well below market rate at the time. But I enjoyed my time there and my coworkers and management always seemed fair."
good,You over work yourself and the pay is not great. Work/Like balance is not good. Very competitive and micro managed management style. No recognition for employees and hard work.
good,"Nice place to work, no work pressure, low salary, not much to learn, helpful management, not good transport faculty, boring work-life, less salary appraise,"
good,You are timed even to use the bathroom. The pay is great but employees are not treated very well. They fire you for any little mistake. You're under a microscope and the pressure is terrible
good,"Started as a great company offered career advancement/ growth. After being successful for years went into a new position. Had salary pay cut with higher commissions. Bonuses rates/ points lowered every other month when volumes were projected to increase/decrease, which was not the case and left lower and lower bonuses. Laid off without notice after previously told jobs were secure and department was doing well."
good,"I made life long friends Schedule was okay Location is too far away, The pay could be better. Location should better job as well as pay. There are good people who work there"
good,"If you like working in cubicles and being stuck to a phone and computer for 8 plus hours. This is the job for you. If you like a little more flexibility  at work, do not apply."
good,I would say Bank Of America is a tough place to work because the timelines they provide is always very stringent. Also they are very backward since they have not yet adopted agile practices yet. Work life balance is very poor.
good,Company never seemed to retain important and effective employees.  No room for advancement. Work culture struggled to accommodate staff while removing many rewards and perks.
good,Bank of America is a great company to work for depending on which department you start in I would recommend staying away from any department dealing with credit cards.
good,"It was a very fast paced, keep on your toes job.  Liked my co-workers and the customers.  Bank was in a plaza setting.  Saw the same merchants on a daily basis, had  a great relationship with all of them."
good,"Work flow can be draining mentally and emotionally. Management is more concerned with saving money for company, rather than what is best for the customer."
good,"The company offers great benefits across the corporation. The pay is relatively low compared to other companies in  the industry, but benefits compensate. Some departments have eliminated bonuses and layoffs are extremely common, they come to be expected, but severance packages are typically offered."
good,"Working for BofA can be hard for most people.  Given the nature of the Job, most people wouldn't be able to handle of the strict policies and securities.  The actual Job is OK. It's just the fact that you're watched at all times which can be an overwhelming thing considering."
good,After Bank of America acquired US Trust the management team took a major step backward.  I worked in a SoCa office and we had a manager from Scottsdale who would spend two days a week in our office.  He was barely competent and I'm being nice.  When US Trust was a stand-alone company the leadership was outstanding.
good,This was a very fun workplace that was productive and fast moving.  There were calls goals and sales goals that were required to make incentive.  That were easy to maintain based on effort.
good,I didn't like working here one bit. The culture was just on sales and not as much with customer service. They demanded sales everyday and if i wasn't meeting sale goals than ill get written up. I should have never left Wells Fargo the three dollar pay raise wasn't worth it.
good,"Didnt really enjoy it. Too fast pace and no time to breathe. Being cussed at and talked down to and you have no power to do anything, but bear it and continue to try to get a 10 survey."
good,Great job if you dont care to enjoy time off and if you dont have a family that comes first .  Lots of hard work and sometimes long hours. Pay not enough.
good,Working for bank of america was a fun job. Great people to work with and fun at times. It like riding a bike and falling every day but its fun when you can make somebody's day go alittle better and you hear a smile on someones smile.
good,"I worked in the short sale department for 7 years.  Many of my co-workers were laid off during that time and eventually I was too.  The environment was pleasant enough to work in.  However, in spite of job postings, it was very difficult to find any opportunity to advance to a higher position."
good,"Compensation is not very promising"
good,"enjoyed employer before take over of Bank of America (formerly Countrywide Mortgage) was able to actually thrive, but after take over of Bank of America, attitude and management changed, less favorable environment to continue employment...was a full time employment at time of employment, felt very uncomfortable with immediate management, lost sense of security in continued employment working."
good,Bank of America had great pay with great benefits. The management was very uptight and not approachable. Advancement seemed impossible and the upselling on credit cards had a great deal of pressure on everyone. I loved having a set schedule with reasonable hours.
good,"Coast to coast organization with a multitude of employment opportunities. Great example of a company that excels at both external and internal branding, with very structured company goals and values."
good,"It is a Big bank with Routine work, not exciting and challenging. And the job is not that stable too.The salary is not good and not much bonus."
good,"The work environment can be stressful when trying to meet productivity goals. However, bonuses would be awarded when goals were met. Eventually, the bonus structure was eliminated which brought down employee morale.There were opportunities to advance due to different departments were always hiring. The hardest part of the job was always being subjected to supervisors micromanaging  the employees. The best part of the job was helping customers."
good,"Company varies unit by unit. Make sure you work in a progressive area not fully restricted by budget but has room for product development, customer relations and employee appreciation."
good,"Bank of America is a good place to work, depending on the job/ position most have a good work life balance. "
good,"Standards has gone done compare to 2011, at that time there was lot of fun, salary hikes were good, but later lot of cost cuttings lead to low salary hikes, late promotions, bad transport management, lack of facilities."
good,"A typical day consist of a group meeting with managers, and colleagues, to go over the daily goals for the day/week. Usually review over the performances from the pervious day too. Remain at you desk, all day, on the dialer taking inbound and outbound calls. Management usually micro-managed majority of the time, but that was to make sure you hit goal on a monthly basis. Sometime I would miss my breaks because I was stuck on calls with clients, and get scolded for that. Bank of America's slogan is ""Customers come first"", but employees usually get scolded for assisting customers too long. I would say that was the hardest part of the job."
good,My group has a relatively flexible work and life balance as long as you complete your deliverable. Small tight-nit group that has one of the better cultures on the Street.
good,"I was a fraud investigator for BOA , BOA is a decent place to work for. "
good,"Not a terrible place to work, depending on the area. Some areas are better staffed than others. If in a sales position, incentives are somewhat easy to obtain."
good,"This was a  decent place to work. They were very detailed about appearance, however the position knowledge was never clear to the employees. The management was very stand off in presentation."
good,Bank of America is a great start to a career. Bank hours are great and the team is typically very friendly. The customers were always nice.
good,"Management is very non-communicative. Nepotism runs wild. Incoming contractors were led to believe that they would be hired at the end of the year, and instead were let go. Management would not release this information to the contracting company, thereby rendering them unable to help you look for a new contract position."
good,The benefits were good.  I was able to go back to school and not have to pay a lot out of pocket.  I utilized there tuition reimbursement program that helped me out a lot.
good,"Bank of America is a large corporation where you are reduced to a number, but with the right attitude you can still demonstrate your skills and knowledge to make client's financial lives better.  I was pleased with their community outreach and their matching gifts program too."
good,Strong culture of change evident. Generally a good experience all in although the benefits are not the best and compensation has been down consistently during my time with the company.
good,"Work life balance non existent, asked to complete hours above contracted hours and if you decline you are frowned upon by management, Hard work With no Appreciation."
good,It had nice benefits.  I learned a lot about banking and finance.  Management was ok.  My co workers and I didn't have much time to get to know each other between calls.  Hardest part was long call queues and most enjoyable was helping people.
good,"While the telephone calls are constant with customer issues, the help is always there to assist with any issues you are having to resolve the problem. The co-workers are great, always willing to share their best practices. The advancement opportunities are there but if you are struggling with your stats you will not be able to take advantage of them. The hardest part is satisfying the customer and the company at the same time, and surveys are everything. The best part of the job are the customers that recognize that you did everything to assist them and just say thank you."
good,"Hard sale goals, management gives unrealistic goals and lots of pressure to hit it with little leniency. Someone with a degree will not be compensated that well."
good,BAC would be a perfect place to work if not for the upper management not appreciating their employees. Changes are done last minute and only accommodate the managers and not employees in general.
good,I was entered for BOA through a temp agency.Work was ok nothing to brag about. Work was long. We did Lots of certification.no interviews' was there for 16 years. Until I was Laid off.
good,"Merrill Lynch is a great deal for aspiring financial advisors- solid base salaries, great B of A benefits, top-notch training with all the right licenses, and a great name for your resume."
good,"A typical day involves a fast pace of production, while working effectively and efficiently as a team. This opportunity has challenged me in many ways to help me grow professionally. My co-workers are more like family members due to the amount of time we share throughout the day and the team outings we may have. We make the work environment comfortable enough to lean on one another for support when needed.The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the high volumes of business that may come in due to being short staffed, while transitioning into new processes and changing software. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great staff I work with and being able to help my clients make their dreams come true."
good,"Worked as an analyst:"
good,"All my BOA co-workers, current and former, have been amazing people. The downside is, in my opinion, that sales trumps everything. Helping clients is acceptable, but mostly if we don't see a sales opportunity, we are encouraged to hastily get through the interaction or suggest they use a ""convenient banking option"" such as online banking or the ATM."
good,"Receive and count working cash at beginning of shift. Assist customers with all the inquiries in any of their accounts. Promote, and advice bank products and services and explain how they work to customers.Identify referral opportunities and make relevant referrals. Balance currency, cash and checks in drawer at the end of each shift."
good,"I was responsible for providing a positive customer experience to improved satisfaction and sales. I processed transactions accurately and efficiently in a fast-paced environment while also introducing products and services that  may meet the customer’s needs and would also expand their relationship with Bank of America. "
good,"My typical day at work is working on the automatic dialing system, taking inbound and outbound phone calls for borrower's that are delinquent on their mortgage and assisting them in anyway possible to help bring their loan current and stay out of foreclosure."
good,"The most frustrating part is still being under Contract, after being there for a little under one year. The work environment is great, and management treats their employees well. I would recommend applying to a permanent job. When you go into the company as a contractor, you don't receive any benefits or PTO."
good,"Too much management, the company is full of managers and bosses but no leaders. Good pay and great room for advancement,"
good,"Bank of America has many talented and friendly people employed in the Global Markets Division. I feel many of my former colleagues are the cream of the crop in their endeavors. I have made life long friendships there.Unfortunately, the culture pits employees against one another. Management is not always knowledgeable of the product line they are managing. There is little to no job security, even for me with 25 years of loyal employment."
good,"While benefits are ok, pay isn't the most competitive. Also tends to be more of a high school environment at least at the Gate Parkway campus."
good,The job itself was very enjoyable and rewarding. Getting to help families connect and see each was an amazing feeling. The leadership at the job though was sub par at best. The supervisors judgment of character is cringe worthy.
good,"Bank of America,processing checks over night from nine till six in the morning.Light data entry.Kept records of health and business accounts .I've learned how to use a image tracking machine for capturing images of the checks.Management was great.My co-workers was like family.The hardest part of this job was staying awake.The most enjoyable part of this job was the benefits."
good,"The working environment is streamlined and fast paced.  The motto is do your job right way and do it quick.  The company is a good place to working, but has also been downsizing for a few years now, so there is an elevated level of stress associated with the unknown."
good,Not alot of growth potential and very unstable. Layoffs seems to be the norm every few months. Most managers are great with work/life balance and do not give you hard time when you need to take off or work from home.
good,"If you have a busy life schedule (family, kids etc), then this is a fine place to work. They benefits are pretty good, the work life balance is good, the ability to work from home and to work around your schedule is excellent."
good,"good place to learn, but hard to advance, and pay is low.  Good for Entry Level jobs.  Would not recommend for anyone looking for a high salary or moving up in their career."
good,"Pays well in some areas, but lots of re-orgs. Poor life work balance. You survive by networking your way out. You productivity is measure not by how well you do what you do; but mostly by what others think about you. If you are great at networking, then this firms is great for you. But if you are an introvert, it is unlikely you can make a move up, unless you have a God father."
good,"Had to meet Sales goals or else into the room for a meeting."
good,"The management is constantly in a flux state.  The associates are always left with a shaky feeling, due to organizational change after organizational change.  The camaraderie among fellow associates was some of my favorite memories, but the movement for movement's sake, kept the goals from being easily reached, due to ever shifting priorities."
good,"I love my job, just not the way the department is managed. favoritism and abusive managers."
good,"Overall, I worked with great people and became friends with some with whom I'm still in contact with.  "
good,"Production support by it's nature can be long hours.  Need to be quick to assess a situation accurately.  Must be able to multitask and handle stress.  Need to be diplomatic and able to project manage.  My teammates are the best.  They are intelligent and work as a team.  We support each other."
good,The company has changed drastically in the past five years with work life balance becoming non existent. My manager is great but overall the company is more concerned with doing more with less and have streamlined so much that people are burnt out.
good,Management is not forthcoming on news and information regarding changes and lay offs. No job security or stability because you are always thinking you are next.
good,"Good Job training programs, super underwriter qualification requirements. Excellent immediate managers, Excellent people to work with. Flexible hours. No job stability."
good,"Cold calling prospects, reporting to manager, making phone calls, meeting with prospects, signing up prospects. Would not recommend to anyone to work for this company. I got cheated out of a major ""deal"" by the ""corporate"" ""customer service"" department."
good,"Dealing with unhappy customers, possibly loosing their home is stressful.  There are many contradictory goals and this adds to the stress of the job."
good,"very hectic but fun"
good,"Good work/life balance and pay, but that's about it. No career advancement and management can't make up their mind about anything."
good,"i enjoyed my time here and met some great people"
good,Several career paths but it seems like you are required to jump from one department to another to go up the corporate ladder.
good,"pretty good company, fairly diverse, many opportunities to live wherever you want to go. I felt like it gives people a great opportunity to control their own destiny as far as advancement."
good,Amazing how different 1 location can be from another? I was with them in New York and it was a dream job!:) I had to relocate due to a family illness to Georgia and it was a nightmare...enough said.
good,"Establishing, retaining and deepening relationships with banking center customers and potential customers to achieve team sales goals and provide quality customer service."
good,"Log in complete 2/3 fraud claims per hour, working claims from beginning to end of claim with 10 to 20 outbound calls and 10 to 20 inbound calls per day."
good,As is the case in most financial establishments. Employees are numbers and only have value until they have been burned out.
good,"High volume work environment. Primary point of contact for Large Corporate clients - many in the Fortune 500.  Primary responsibility was to solve a variety complex issues in the shortest amount of time, utilizing many tools, departments and individuals as needed - updating clients throughout process until matter had been resolved."
good,"bad management, coworkers did not get along very well.  Training not good.  The team leads not on the same page so never knew really if we were doing our work correctly"
good,"Responsible for assisting customers with questions or issues regarding their bank accounts, received via phone and/or correspondence."
good,They moved me from branch to branch and wanted me to learn new safety procedures for each location and had to prepare for audits at any time.
good,I would get there and turn on all my systems and begin taking calls. I would help customers with their existing accounts and sell them on new products and services as well. The hardest part of the day was trying to force sales when the customers were not interested in buying. The most enjoyable part of the day was helping the customer save money.
good,Typical day consist of handling executive complaints from the CEO's office and regulatory agencies. The environment is definitely one of a team and co-workers enjoys leadership.
good,"I liked working at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch"
good,"Competitive environment.  Departments keep getting downsized and it takes a toll on morale.  At times, a stressful environment."
good,"Most managers do not have an open door policy. They have so many meetings during the day, that they don't have tome for the associate"
good,"a typical day consist of me coming in handing security my license and getting searched , locking up my belongings going toward the back towards the tax processing room. Hardest on the job was learning how to work the machine because sometimes paper gets caught in the machine. The most enjoyable part on the job was working with some of the coolest people EVER!!!"
good,"Customers constantly take out their issues on you. You have to have some thick skin otherwise you will break. Don't take anything personal because they're frustrated at the company, not you."
good,"Being a Credit Support Associate was an interesting job. Our manager was based in Seattle and we did not have much communication with her during my time working in San Francisco. "
good,"High Stress, Multi tasked position...Co workers are great to work with...the position calls for someone who is very accurate and efficient..."
good,Bank of America has a great benefit package. With that being said Management needs training. It seems that manager are hired because of their friends that are in upper management and not because they have the experience or knowledge.
good,"Due to changes in the banking industry and the lifting of the OCC Consent Order, BAC has been going through many organizational restructures causing stress due to job security."
good,Bank of America is a good place to work. They have good benefits. They are really big on volunteer work and helping others.
good,I did enjoy the freedom of doing your job at your own pace. Would have preferred to have been working with the public. Hours were not flexible at all.
good,"They call retail banking ""retail"" for a reason.  It pays better than JC Penny or Walmart, but you still have to deal with people."
good,Extremely stressful environment with poor outlets and poor associate satisfaction.  Answered incoming calls and assisted with solving complex issues with their accounts.
good,Very long ago.  Was going to school.  Then was offered a job from the CFO of Herzog Meier as a Warranty Admin.  Decided it would be nice to try something new.
good,"Division helping customers that were in the military. This division no longer exists."
good,Okay place to work. They pay well. Management is always changing the org around to try and be more efficient and cut costs.
good,"I truly enjoyed my job with BoA.  I was a flexible MyWork associate and I felt that my salary was in alignment with my position.  My internal business partners and sourcing colleagues were a pleasure to work with.  The most difficult part of my job were the constant changes with regard to polices and procedures; in addition to fear of the inevitable, which was my position being outsourced to an offshore company.  A typical day was centered around meeting the needs of my line of business; e.g., creating Statements of Work, Change Orders, contract creation, vendor negotiations, mitigating risk to ultimately protect the bank's shareholders and business stakeholders. I learned that diversity and inclusion are very important both internally and externally."
good,"Currently manage 14 Underwriting Associates for FHA/VA and Conforming loan products in a quality and production driven environment."
good,"Helping the customers stay in their home any way I could. Answering any questions they have about foreclosure or bankruptcy, and how the process goes. Correcting any information in our system that was not correct"
good,"Frequent lay offs, work overtime or you'll lose your job for not reaching insane productivity goals.  I watched management find ways to let people go who'd been there 17 to 20 years.  Then, they shut down the entire Beachwood, OH. operations, laying off about 2,000.  The way they laid people off to prevent severance packages for long-time workers was absolutely terrible.  Management's goals were virtually impossible to reach and things beyond your control affected your numbers.  For instance, if a 3rd party notary got a flat tire on their way to a mortgage closing, and they missed the appointment, this would count against you!  Absolutely wrong!  I miss the people, the pay, and the benefits.  I don't miss worrying about losing my job every single day I worked there - 6 days a week, 55 hours a week.  Not working overtime was frowned upon too.  Would rather dig ditches for less money."
good,"Consumer banking is a horrible environment for some from a professional background, many of the employee's are not highly educated and lack a certain level of professionalism,"
good,"On a typical day, I deal with about 50-100 people. Personalities and age can range, but with my excellent people skill, I am able to leave customers satisfied. The management can use some help. There are too may changes in the company. I am able to get along with my co-workers well. The hardest part of my job is staying on top of all the daily company changes. With this being said, I make my work place enjoyable and put in my best work."
good,People with more authority decided to blame employees when things did not go well and their decision making was based more on personal preferences than professionalism.
good,"BOA has some extraordinary talented and smart people that have been in the banking/financial industry for most if not all of their careers. BOA has some world class HR programs and initiatives,diversity and inclusion and community events, talent planning and leadership development are just a few examples. I have  the pleasure to work with some amazing colleagues and peers."
good,"The company has tenure, but that doesn't always mean its ggod...it has a strong financial structure and could easily teach one to become better in that field, but the growth potential is limited, as oppose to going up, there are a lot of positions they post that promise more structure and more advantages while making the promotional move ""LATERAL"" and that doesn't always keep people happy"
good,Busy with not enough staffing.  I have learned to be able to handle stressful situations under pressure and to work different people and customers.  Co-workers are great and very good at what they do.  Hardest part of the job is working short staffed every day. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and making them happy.
good,"Good company to work but declined permanent offer due to micro management. call center environment, tons of rewards an employee incentives."
good,My co-workers were a good compliment of folks that brought many views to projects which was a plus to delivering projects that met customer needs.
good,"Fun people but not to much advancement options.If you end up doing one job, you will be doing it forever with another additional duties that business brings. But no advancement in career."
good,I just came in and did my job. The vibe hasn't been good for awhile with all the layoffs going on. The people on my team were the best part about the job.The hardest was just dealing with all the layoffs and negative things.
good,Bank of America is definitely a leader in employee growth and training. The pay and benefits are fair in comparison of other industries. Entry level employees are given a plethora of opportunity and the training offered is top notch.
good,"This was a 6 month contract, and there's not much to add. Very busy 6 months. Job was changed to another group after several months under the same contract\rate."
good,"My job used to be great, however the management has driven the workforce into the ground while cutting pay in half. I am on here because I want out, so perhaps my view is jaded. That said, I would not recommend any serious professional to consider Bank of America. It is full of senior leaders who jump ship every two years so the stink of their failure does not follow them into a new position."
good,"Great learning experience"
good,you must be linked into an affinity group. Networking is key to be successful in the company. Learn and grow in every position your involved in and make yourself visible.
good,only flaw is the communication between management and employees. that needs work. Other than that it is a good company to work for.
good,"In the Preferred Service to Sales department we are to address each clients concerns while uncovering the potential to deepen their relationship within the company. We are tied to the phones with minimal flexibility to move around. It is easy to become too familiar and drift away from protocol, which is why the consistent role playing and training is helpful and beneficial for individual growth."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"Daily work includes identifying referral opportunities, processing transactions accurately and efficiently in accordance with established policies and procedures, connecting customers to resources, teammates and specialists to meet their financial needs, making customers aware of convenient self-service banking options, identifying and minimizing risk."
good,"The job has it's challenges, not bad if you don't mind not knowing what your day to day work entails.  Management isn't much support."
good,"Working with Bank of America over couple years have been great had a chance to learn and a lot and develop different skill. The process is different every day its a lot of reading, critical thinking, and problem solving. The management is not so great they tend to be disrespectful by the way they speak to you and sometimes they say one thing, but tend to do another. They also have favoritism within their employees. Co-workers are great they tend to help one another, share information, and help each other in any best possible way to solve issues. The hardest part of my job would be poor management skills, but other that the best part of job is that i learn new things and develop better skills for the future."
good,"This company has a very negative corporate culture.  It doesn't care about its Associates.  The Executive levels lack leadership that inspire.  They lay Associates off, yet have openings that require the very skills needed.  This is not an Associate friendly company."
good,"As a teller you must be customer service and sales oriented. Day to day I work with customers deposit's, withdraws and try to have them sit with a banker to upgrade there accounts . Sales would be the biggest challenge. For the tellers the goals are never consistent and there is no incentive. As for co-workers and management, there is a high turnover rate and people are always getting moved around from location to location. As frustrating as this is for employees, regular customers notice all the time and wonder why can't anyone just stay in one place. The most enjoyable part of the job are the hours and holiday's off. The benefit's are a plus also. I've been with the company for 8 years and from the start of my career it's always been a pleasant one with a few bumps just as I would like to assume come with any job."
good,Several layoffs  Unfortunately the layoffs hurt moral. Company if focused on becoming smaller after several large lawsuits.
good,At Bank of America in the department that I worked in management didn't know that we were being told that our hour were been changed by the work flow and utility clerk.
good,"Professionalism, ethical behavior and excellent customer service was enforced on a daily basis. Associates worked well as a team. I learned discipline in ensuring that the very best service was  extended to our customers, and that empathy and relating on a human and honest level was key. Educating the customer on various products was essential."
good,I met great people for the most part; enjoyed the job and atmosphere overall.   But banks do not pay well.  More often than not they over-manage their workforce.
good,"Excellent work/life balance and culture. Great people."
good,"on day to day basis file proof of claims , learned a lot I the bankruptcy dept the procedures and chapters. Worked with different atty. The co workers kept the day going . management was not real helpful , not able to assist you with the question   that you have making it hard to new task that's needed for your job."
good,"Great benefits and work life balance. Advancement opportunities are very limited unless you have your sponsors (within the right crowd). Promotions are NOT merit based and raises are very minimal. However, health, vacation, paternity/maternity leave etc are all great"
good,"The management team is terrific but after 18 years I have decided I would like to change career, and the people I work with are terrific"
good,I started at Bank of America when it was still NationsBank.  The bank changed constantly after the merger.  I learned from good managers how to manage my time and to share my skills.  Job was never secure at BofA as bank was constantly reorganizing and laying off employees.
good,Bank of America is working to replace the tellers with virtual tellers. There is no job security with Bank of America. The Bank also pushes for large sales numbers while cutting employee hours and offering no incentives for reaching sales going.
good,"It was my first major job after college. the money and benefits were good but, the work environment was a bit chauvinistic."
good,Fast paced environment in a very competitive business.  Everyone is very helpful and there is a lot of training opportunities.
good,"Due to Major $16 Billion Government fines in 2014, the Bank is unable to manage human resources and appears to be losing ground in Market share due to banking center selloffs."
good,"*My typical work day is very fast paced with a wide variety of responsibilities, which I prefer."
good,"Good benefits including 401k match, paid vacations and sick days etc, even for part time employees. Not enough Flexible and work with school schedule."
good,Good Learning Experience. Exposure to a various financial products and services.
good,A day at work was all about coaching and helping employes achieve goals along with making the environment pleasant place to work.
good,"Very Simple job"
good,Great job for helping with family illness.  It is hard to move into a new position.
good,"Working as a intern at ML let me see what a day in the life of a Financial Advisor was all about. It reinforced that I wanted to be in this industry."
good,a secure place to work at for customer service. very little growth.
good,"After 10 years, there are no complaints with the bank in an overall setting. Benefits are good, internal opportunities are available, and chances to be a contributor to the community are abundant. The potential for improvement is in their compensation packages for the amount of responsibilities and requirements within the work space. As the largest bank , under the most scrutiny , showing the staff that salaries are competitive in the marketplace would go a long way."
good,"good company, good co-workers , a typical work day is busy and the time went by fast. i learned a lot of skills working at this company"
good,"I enjoyed working there, but it is easy to get stuck in a position."
good,"Day to day operations including problem solving on existing loan applications that have stalled or somehow, been over looked, to where a solution was not provided, for Loss Mitigation options. My reviews of the CRM's actions, allowed coaching opportunities to problematic associates, who needed to be informed of correct procedures to follow, when reviewing applications."
good,As a Sales & Service Specialist you are expected to expedite customer service wait time and teller line wait time while still uncovering customers' financial needs.
good,"A typical day at work depends on my outlook calendar and appointment."
good,Good place to work.   Good benefits.   Training and development.  Customer service driven.  Typical day is taking 3 chats at one time and responding every 2minutes to each chat to resolve customer issue with deposit accounts.  Co-workers are great.
good,"Very nice place to work. fast environment to be.great people, excellent boss though pay was low."
good,"They had us start at 7 am which could not be changed, even though it had no purpose for our job function. Very little to learn and no room for advancement, at least in the post closing area (called Legacy Asset Servicing, or Document Servicing.) Management could be very friendly, pleasant and helpful, but the bad eggs were never taken care of, regardless of complaints. They are stick with goals, but don't increase them once you get used to them."
good,Bank of america is a financial institution. BA Continuum  is non subsidary of bank of america.
good,Good working enviroment. management was approachable although not always able to assist.
good,"The only thing i liked was the benefits. I was in aggressive sales call center. I worked 4 days a week 10 hr shift. You can only choose what shifts they have available and you have to stay there a year. Because no one else wants that crummy schedule. I knew people that worked there for over 2 years and never was given an opportunity to advance within the company. Its about who you know and but kissing up there. This job really brings in the revenue for the company, we make the paychecks for the other employees. Once your sales start to go down they are ready to have someone replace your seat.Their incentive is nothing I made them $1 mill in a month, no incentive because my customer service surveys were not perfect 10s.I left because i felt like i was working for nothing."
good,"see BOA review.   Already reviewed this company,  Management in the MRT dept was not helpful or well explained  to the needs of their  employees"
good,"Good place to work. However, pay is less when compared to Skills/ experience."
good,"Good Company to work for"
good,"PROS"
good,Manage title curative process consisting of 3 vendors and 20 FTEs.
good,Great people to work with but management is a pain. Coworkers are very friendly and will to help when needed. Upper management feels very disconnected from the people they manage.
good,Dynamic work environment; Meaningful work; Good values and teamwork; Compensation and Benefits leave more to be desired. Lack of continuity or long term focus from leadership - every year is a new long term vision with no follow through.
good,Very goal oriented and not customer friendly. Micro- managing and very picky about dress codes. Sunday best is what they expect
good,"Fast paced hours of the day. Learned to multitask. Management fine, coworkers good"
good,"no comments, do not want to discuss working for this company"
good,"In my 3 years with Bank of America I grew into a new role each year. Although the Bank has a strict rule about being in a position 12 months before moving onto something else; I have to say that my management team did everything to make sure I could get where I wanted to go once that time was up. Management itself is a bit disconnected from their particular department, very few managers here have people skills. They are good at their process, but lack knowledge in how to lead their people to be good at it as well. I have to say I was pleased with the opportunities and benefits the Bank provided but was put off by the unwillingness to stray from written policy when something required a more human approach. The real problem with this company lies in the recruiting and training; if there were a category for this I would rate negative stars. Each position I went into, I was promised things that didn't exist such as the ability to work from home. When I asked about it later, HR stated that it was being considered at the time but it is ultimately up to the department to approve any MyWork (from home) positions. The training in the majority of cases consisted of a PowerPoint print out, a couple of online classes and a couple of days sitting with a random associate that did your job. Considering these were people's home loans I was working with, I would think that they would have more checks and balances when it came to training. When I would bring it up that our training needed beefing up, I would hear, ""well, that's not in the budget."" All in all, I'd definitely recommend Bank of"

Hardest part of the job was everything was always changing. most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my co workers"
good,As a teller manager I was assigned to ensure that all tellers met their sales goals and internal processes were followed to exacting standards.
good,"A typical day for me would be coming in a few minutes early and going throuh any emails and writing out my to do list for the day.  After I sign in I review files and close out what can be done.  I attend educational sessions for job performance improvement and new objectives.  The most enjoyable part of my day is helping my customers and knowing that I have done the best that I can do.  My co wrkers are great and we assist each other as much as we can throughout the day.  Management will deliver objectives and try to make sure that we are successful at achieving our daily goals.  the hardest part of the job would be when i am not able to help a customer.  I know that not every person can be helped, but I would like to at least try."
good,"Typical day at work:  Review of company assets assigned to contracted vendor and provided analysis and feedback for training and success."
good,"Too many meetings, daily interruptions to promote BOA culture. Piped in music very distracting."

good,"My typical day at work now is on the phones, assisting our card holders, analyzing if there is fraud or not, assisting them in maybe locating where the fraud may have occured, assisting in providing them some assurance that they will be covered for any fraudulent activities on their acct... My co-workers are great, they really help when you may be in a slump. or encouragages you. The hardest part of my job is not being able to actually see face to face the cardholders, not able to build a repore with them. Overall  this position has given more skills to have under my belt, if I ever run into any one who has had fraud I can give them a little knowledge of how and what to do next.."
good,"fast pace*  20+ years of accurate, successful administrative experiences"
good,"Feel as part of a team, great benefits, enjoyable part of the job is fulfilling customers dreams of home ownership and financial stability"
good,"While I was working there as a temp, I saw that the environment and the management were not very professional; what I observed was quite a bit of favoritism amongst the managers and a majority of the employees. Most of the people that worked there were also temps (as well as the managers) and a majority of them were pretty young; they all had their own ""cliques"" and most of the time had nothing better to do but slack off and talk about other employees."
good,"Worked with Countrywide that BOA took over, the wholesale processing business was not continued with BOA"

good,This is a good company to work for and I appreciate the experience I gained and the good people I met
good,Working for the Bank was a good experience because I learned about mortgages.
good,"The job as an Business Managers assistant is a typical 9-5. Besides the usual administrative work which consists of answering telephones I was able to learn alot more of the compliance and risk management side of the business which was quite interesting. The management was immature and seemed lost at times. Communication was lacking and would often cause friction between management and employees. Despite numerous promises to help with advancement or even mentor, our outreach was often ignored. The hardest part was managing the personalities and moods of management as well as some of the employees you would work with."
good,"My job at Bank of America gave me the opportunity to work with a variety of different people and departments giving be valuable experience. I enjoyed most of the people I was able to work with within the company. However, I was not happy with the pay and as time went on the only incentive was to not lose your job. The office where I worked closed due to cutbacks."
good,Worked in Risk Technology providing testing solution to determine if a mortgage loan was a good or bad debt mortgage
good,"A typical day at work is a busy one. Of days you would receive large volumes of work. I worked well with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job I would say is making the deadlines, but they were always met. The most enjoyable part of the job was being faced with challenges/deadlines and in the end, completing them. I enjoyed it."
good,This typical day at work consisted of review of loan files and provide the underwriter with conditions to add to the files and help provide the client with the items they needed in order to get their loan funded. My skills were utilized and kept me at the top of the list for production. The hardest part of the job was informing clients of results based on their submitted information.
good,Best part of my career were the many many great people I was lucky to cross paths with.
good,"Not a good place to work, mamgers are playful and immature. The environment is not conducive and their is just to much chaos."

good,Job consisted of reviewing loan data for errors. 15 files per day.
good,A typical day was non stop incoming calls regarding a variety of banking needs.
good,"when if first started, i sign up for a 8:30-5:30 job, but somehow, I am required to come in on certain days from 8-6/7 pm. With that being said, they expect you to work longer hours, and take longer lunches so they wont have to compensate you for OT. Not only that, I've been with the bank for about 7 years now and have gone through 8 different managers. I'll let you be the judge of Bank of America from that comment."
good,"Bank of America gave many opportunities to shine and show technical ability, but all of that was overshadowed by poor management and BofA became a victim of being too big. The wrong people make the decisions. We were consistently handed jobs that were destined to get delayed and come in over budget."
good,"Good company with nice benifits, but job security is less. Lots of politics in management side."
good,"Busy environment, have a chance to work and serve different types of people."
good,"Too big for me! Due to corporate infrastructure, not much opportunity for flexibility regarding vacation, etc."
good,Delinquency resolution and collections. Call center environment.
good,Managers leave out associates in critical forums pertaining to their job responsibilities.  Learned to keep all associates involved in what goes on in the work place.  Found out from another associate that I was a prime candidate to be laid off approximately 5 days prior to it actually happening.  How do peers find out about this information?  Management needs to either give associates a heads up or keep these things in strict confidence.
good,Bank of America is one of the top banks in the world.  Though we have a challenges that's the price to pay to be a large as we are.  It is a wonderful place to work if you want a banking career.  The are many different departments to move around in. They have a pretty good benefits package as well.
good,Great place to start your career.  Learned a lot about financials working with people's money.
good,Third party and user IT shop. Meaning that lot of the jobs are outsourced and there are not lot of in house development. Because the management is trying to save on IT costs there are lot of pressure
good,Very Stagnant. No room for advancement. good Learniung Experience as Mortgage collector
good,"Bank of America has a global presence that gives it's employees the opportunity to seek employment is various lines of business and locations.  They preach an inclusive environment, but when it is time to live up to those ideals, they rarely meet the expectations of their creed.  "
good,"Merrill Lynch was a very difficult job for me.  It was my first job in corporate America."
good,Bank of America has changed a lot since I started in 2004.  And not in a good way.
good,"Bank of America's biggest strength is the same as its biggest weakness.  Being a large bank, there are many career opportunities and training resources.  However, the company can feel cold and overly bureaucratic."
good,Bank of America is a strong company to work for and has given me an opportunity to grow my career.
good,I worked hard to help customers with any banking issues and needs
good,"You answer phones, look into accounts and go over fees. Your day is as good as your callers. Some days you have mostly happy customers who are calling for general information and assitance with their accounts. Other days you have a influx of angry people who want their fees back from their accounts, unfortunately most of the time you can not give them their money back.It can be difficult to be yelled at a lot, but they pay is good and if you have a hard shell this job can be a great place to start to move up in the company."
good,"A typical day at work is very intense and goal oriented.  The compensation and benefit program is absolutely awesome, but there is a price to pay for the program.  "
good,"Great place to work, lot's of help while getting licensed. Once you receive your production number you're on your own and once you get behind you're done. The current monthly goals are difficult to obtain. Great place to work and learn, but very difficult for new advisors. If you are offered the opportunity take it, but be realistic with yourself and know that it takes hard work to make it and even then it may not work out. Good luck"
good,"I started my employment at BOA in Dec 2012. I would of made a year, but my office was shut down. I know this area of work has its up and down especially when the rates are high. It was a challenge, but like always I raise to meet that challenge. I feel if my site had not been shut down we would of been awesome!  I enjoyed BOA there system needed to be updated and there processes are different. But we all had the same goal. To help families, I looking for a bank with the same high standard of excellence.  I look forward to raising to the challenge"
good,"Management doesnt really care about its employees, it's all about meeting the monthly or yearly goal. It is a great job for students, but leave after you graduate."
good,Quiet place to work.  Fairly-treated with nice people.  Just don't expect much help.
good,"I wasn't here long due to medical issues, but I liked it very much."
good,I would work my files.  Learned about the REO business.  There was to many chiefs and not enough Indians.  I like most of the co-workers. There was really nothing hard about the job.

good,Provides challenges on a daily basis that keeps me on my toes and moving at a rapid pace.
good,emphasis on 6-sigma processes. Good place to work at but BAU lacks competitiveness.
good,poor leadership and lack of communication makes this company difficult to work for.
good,Worked with a great team. Loved that I could interact with my customers. Management had very obviouse favorits and would not accept negative feedback.
good,I learned many different things at Bank of America. The most valuable thing I believe I will take with me is the importance of customer service and how to delight your customers.
good,"My typical day would be arriving to work between 7:30-8:00 am. Preforming opening procedures, then getting cash ready for the vault and for each teller for the day. I would also have to make sure the ATM had enough cash to fill our day for customers needs. If we were running low on any supplies I would then check and place an order. When the banking center would open, I was very customer focused and preformed transactions based on the need of the customer. I would assist the tellers if they needed help preforming a difficult transaction. I would also check our goal to make sure we were meeting them and on point."
good,Great pay and benefits but a very difficult environment for balancing work & life.
good,"customer interaction, opening and closing deposit accounts."
good,"Work hard, management could always be improved. I enjoyed working with my customers and being a part of a team. I learned that in order to advance you have to put forth your own effort and make your own way. You are the owner of your own destiny."
good,"No day was the same, dealing with 108 people on the trading floor I mostly had very busy days but I always got the job done.  Some days I wouldn't be able to walk in and sit on my chair before my name was called for assistance.  Mondays and Wednesdays I had deadlines to report back on.  I placed many different types of orders each day and liaised with all different departments, there were always projects to get involved with and departments that needed updating with information. I would deal with a number of invoices on a daily basis.  Traders are very demanding, I had built very good relationships in the different departments I worked with and could get orders or helpdesk tickets prioritised.  I have improved my ability to deal professionally with the different levels of staff, built my confidence in attending meetings, conference calls and dealing with stressed senior managers.  Every day I would go over and above what was required of me, so much that people actually stopped calling the helpdesk and would just ask me as I could fix most helpdesk tickets saving our department the charges for desktop support.  The hardest part of the job would be having to deal with managers when other departments or teams in EMEA do not fulfil their tasks, which I had to take the blame for as I was always the go to person.  I am very passionate about getting jobs done when I say they will get done and get them done right.  The most enjoyable part job was completing large projects or tasks and getting good feedback.  I have received a number of emails complimenting me on my work.  I loved learning"

good,Review loans and close loan modifications. I work in the downtown Charlotte area which makes for a great workplace. We are also granted unlimited overtime.

good,"A typical workday included assisting customers with purchase, refinance, and home equity loans. I would answer incoming calls and assisting customers with any questions he/she may have regarding his/her mortgage. I would also find offices and loan officers in the customers area. After a long week of work, we would often have game days and lunches on Fridays."
good,"My typical day at work would include spending one on one time coaching and training associates, as well as speaking to upper management and team leads about specific associates on the floor, where their biggest opportunities were, and how we could all work together to make the unit better. The hardest part of the job was earning credibility within the units that I joined, so the associates would view me as a valuable resource. The most enjoyable part of the job was making many friends over the years, that I'm sure I'll have once the site closes."

good,I started in the Glendale call center til it was moved to Brea. Up until then I was very happy. Bad people in managment.

I have increased my knowledge of policies and procedures regarding default and non default customer issues. I work primarily with attorneys and we work together well as a team.

good,"After many years, it was family.  A lot of red tape to get the simplest of things accomplished."
good,"Personally uncomfortable. Training for new hires is nonexistent.communication is with the chosen few. Additional communications are with the latest Corporate Buzz words, I.E. I was hesitant until I Drank The Kool-Aid, now I have seen the light and believe in the new way......."
good,"I collaborate with upper management on projects geared towards process evaluation, real time production management, technology upgrades and business continuity. "
good,"A TYPICAL DAY AT WORK: Interact with 25-35 costumers. 50% of them would want a copy of their statement, 25% a temporary debit card, 18% would want you to explain a basic math transaction, 5% would provide you with a quality sales opportunity (credit card, new account, loan, etc.). And 2% would have a general complain."

good,"Hired as a collector and we had a lot of fun days, ice cream days, winning prizes and days where we would decorate our teams cubicles and prizes were jean days, or day off. Once we became customer relationship managers, everything was taken away and at times mandatory overtime on a holiday or in general mandatory overtime weekly. The morale was very low and we all new it was a matter of time when the restructuring began and lay offs to come."
good,"Good place to work. Helped educate me on the finance industry and gave a lot more prospective to what I would like to pursue next. Management varies, might get an awesome manager but the center as a whole is terrible or vice-versa or you may get lucky and get the whole package. Hardest part is the work load; you must truly love what you do because it becomes monotonous very quick. Most enjoyable part of the job is actually being of some service to people. At the end of the day is all about the bottom line - SALES - but you can still impact people in way that you wouldn't believe."
good,I enjoyed helping most Borrowers locate alternate solutions to Financial Hadrship through Bank of America's Mortgage programs.

good,"I enjoyed my time at Bank of America overall. Management was great and supported you every step of the way, my co-workers were great, and most importantaly my clients were great."
good,"Working for Bank of America was what most people would expect of working for a large corporation. The initial training was good and the pay/benefits were great, but the treatment of employees was terrible. Personal preferences and concerns were completely ignored and your voice was simply not heard. A good example is the way I was laid off. They hired a ""consultant"" to basically fire half of the sales staff due to ""departmental consolidation"" immediately after which we were escorted out of the building by security staff without being allowed to collect our personal items from our desks. As I said, their employee treatment was horrid."
good,"A stressful job with very little pay. The best thing they had ever offered was stock options for employees which they discontinued. The benefits was ok, but they expect way too much from employees."
good,A Bank that is so fractures by different departments doing differing thing in the mortgage division alone. They can't seem to decide between centralized or Branch MLO's nor at this time do they want any (outside Off -US) business. Just trying to manage and mitigate existing risk.
good,"Good company but expect ALOT changes, some of which will go back and forth and make very little sense."
good,"At Bank of America its a fast paced, ever changing environment, we help assist customers through Home Loan Modifications or other work out assistance of course based on Investor guidelines.

At this moment we are in the Bankruptcy Department in which we through FHA Guidelines are to pay very close attention to the guidelines."
good,"This is a call center position dealing with online banking and suspicious activity, so it can be a little stressful. When I started working at the bank, it seemed like a great environment to be in but I slowly realized that the bottom line was focused on how much work you could get done and not how customer's are treated."
good,for the passed 5 yrs I learned a lot from this company and i had a lot of fun working with some of outstanding associates which gave a lot of experience in the financial industry today
good,I like the company overall but the pay is really poor. The managent could be better. Bank of america does like to promote within but the pay doesn't match the title.
good,"the job was somewhat rewarding, customers were agreeable most of the time, tasks were completed most of the time, co-workers got along well, management was helpful, not enough training was given for what was expected of employees, decent hours and benefits."
good,Change is constant in the LAS orginization. Communication is very weak between upper management and middle level management.
good,"The expectation is for every associate to be involved with the company past their department and position. That means different clubs, activities etc. The participation is not supposed to be required but if you want to advance, its a must."
good,"Great benefits, but the pay isn't so great. Sometimes the job could be stressful when angry customers take their anger out on you. Management did not make it any better. The best part of the job was helping out grateful customers who really appreciated you help."
good,"A typical day includes reviewing associate performance statistics and coaching associates based on those results. I manage/ supervise a 10-50 associates a day and answer their in the moment servicing questions, handle their escalation issues, and resolve payroll time keeping issues. I host meetings and one on one coaching sessions with lower performing associates and create action plans to build performance."
good,"Very stressful, high pressure, great benefits, not great pay considering all you are responsible for, very sales oriented, you can move up quickly."
good,US Trust can be somewhat monotonous and potentially frustrating when trying to advance your career. Job descriptions are not accurate when speaking to number of years of experience - it will usually take considerably more.
good,A lot of changes in the years. Some good some not. Didn't feel in the end that I had the opportunity to grow with the company. Upper manager not a people person and everytime I did a good job he always stopped others in the dept recognizing it
good,"The job itself was excellent. A good manager, excellent co-workers and good compensation. However, working at least 10 hours a day and generally 60 hours a week in a repetitive position where management is both micro managing and has very high expectations."
good,"Over all B of A had the potential to be a great company for me, however the department that I was in was in transition and somewhat unorganized."
good,"•Performed daily transactions with over 150 customers including consignment items, and certificate of deposits"
good,"A typical day at work consistedmostly of training fronline associates in customer sales & service skills. I learned all aspects of sales & services, customer experience, need based selling.

good,•review move matrices for relocation projects and plan programming changes to phones and voice mail accounts
good,BOA does not pay well for entry level and lower level management positions. They do have excellent benefits and in my experience they are very flexible with scheduling.
good,"I would start my day off with a confrence call and then check my sales numbers from the day before. From that point on I would stand in the lobby greeting customers as they walked in the door. After the doors closed I would then get to do the work that had piled up on my desk throughout the day. I learned that time management and organizational skills were a huge factor in this job. The management team were extremely supportive, however their management team above them seem to look more towards the dollar then towards the emploee or customer. That made the enviroment hard to work in. Al my co-workers were great and there were a few that would be difficult at times and I would have to coach them, but for the most part they made my job easy. They hardest part of the job was having to stay until seven or eight about every night. I wouldn't be able to do my work throughout the day so I would have to do it after hours. However there were those bright spots and that were the customers."
good,"Fast past, 360 coaching, building relationships with customers"
good,"multicultural work environment, job is easy but there's not much room for advancement :("
good,"Customer Relationship Managers are the single point of contact to borrowers who are having home loan problems. We are the liason for collecting documents to be reviewed for a loan modification, short sale, or deed in lieu of foreclosure. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with people. I like to build a repore with my customers, even if I have to deliver a hard conversation."
good,Working inside of the banking center has its good and bad days. Sometimes it feels like working at the bottom of the totem pole compared to the rest of the company. Depending on the position the job can be very repetative at times. The benefits that the company offers such as child care reimbersement are good.
good,"A typical day would start with the review of the overdrafts for each portfolio manager. Trades would be placed on those accounts, that were not considered sensitive. Would handle special requests for investment presentation material, and various different projects to assist in helping with the clean book process."

good,"Make sure that my tellers are kept busy with work, and at the same time creating an environment where it is based on equality amongst everyone. From my six years experience at working for Bank of America I have grown and learned in a place where professionalism applies and to adapt to the many different races and cultures in the Los Angeles Area. The hardest part of the job is to make deadline every single night when we are short staffed. It is a difficult task but at the end we as a team manage to get through it"
good,"Working at Bank of America provided invaluable work experience, however, working at a banking center is a largely retail position. They expect you to sell, sell, and sell more products."
good,It was great working for a company that respect their employees .
good,A typical day at work starts with helping out all the wonderful customers feel secure about where their money is. I love taking my customer service skills a step farther by servicing our Hispanic customers by translating their transaction needs in their own language!

good,"Very good benefits, 4 weeks vacation. Overall a good company to work for."
good,"Good company, great benefits, other good perks. Team-focused environment, quite stressful, but if you had good leaders, the day went very well."
good,"The way to get hired is to know someone, you don't have to know the job just someone within the Bank."
good,Good place to stay if you like to meet new people and help them. Need to meet sales goals and always keep up with teller requirements. Pay to start isn't so good.
good,worked in the lockbox department.
good,"This position oversees the staff of the tellers in the banking center, while being on the management team, and back up to the branch manager as needed. You will be responsible for overseeing all cash in the banking center and insure all customers are getting treated in the up most professional manner, and being provided accurate products suited just for them."
good,"everyday is a new day, but we all get through it as a team. i've learned many things while working for this company that i can take in for future jobs. i've worked under 5 managers in my 4+ years, i've learned how to adapt to change very quickly. my co-workers, i've had plenty coming and going in and out of my banking center. i now know how to work with different personalities. i work well under pressure, but when short handed it can be difficult to accomplish daily tasks in a timely manner. the most enjoyable part of my job is working as a team, while teaching my co-workers new tasks that benefit their everyday performance, i feel that i grow as a leader."
good,The company culture is very good. Good solid place to work. Solid benefits package. Competitive placement opportunities.
good,"Productive,fast paced environment with multi-task functions and constant procedural changes. Learn new software applications and job functions with dual screens. The staff was friendly easy to work with and enjoyable."
good,"Responsibilities include working with business, technology, and service/ops counterparts in developing/editing business requirements, scheduling and conducting project meetings, managing open issues, preparing test plans and coordinating implementation plans. Responsible for monthly financial and project reporting to senior management. Responsible for managing the Payment Card Industry Security Standards compliance audit assessment as well as all remediation projects associated with this assessment. Responsible for vendor management contract reviews and payment invoices. Provide project support for all Visa Fraud related initiatives including the development of new policies and procedures. Resolve all Executive management escalations."
good,This is a good strong company to work for if you get into the right position. Many that I know that work for the company are very stressed out and are always on some sort of leave of absence from the pressure.
good,"A plethora of duties with little time to complete tasks with proper attention to detail. Staffing reductions have complicated the problem. Helping customers is the highlight of the day, cooworkers are mostly team players, and management is most interested in meeting goals vs. office morale. I increased my knowledge in many technical aspects of banking operations."
good,"The place is unstable due to lay offs. Each year around October you expect lay offs happening in each group and in recent times more like two times a year, October and March."
good,"Bank of America is my 1st financial services job that I held. Working in the bank is very stressful and very busy. As teller, my duties is to services our clients with there banking needs. Teller is a easy target to get pick on my the clients. One mistakes and they will tell the bank manager of how they were serviced. But working there for 2 years is enough and it's really time to moved on."
good,Bank of America was a nice place to work with great benefits but any desire to service the customer will be killed by the pressure management puts on their employees to meet the bank's high expectations. Can take a long long long time for a person to advance up the ladder unless you know someone who wants to help you advance.
good,"During nine plus years working with this firm, with hard work I was able to challenge myself to get out of my comfort zone and become a diverse employee with great experience and knowledge of many different departments."
good,MBNA was acquired by Bank of America-- Management did not buy into the MBNA core Values therefore did not practice
good,"Management did not practice the core values of the company but the company is a good compy to work for.. My experience has a team Manger was great because I had great mentors and Leaders. Also my Credibility, work ethics and integrity was the trail to my success."
good,"truly like a family, they held competitions and had team building, my manager was the best I've ever had and I'm still in contact with her. for a teller, there was no incentives the hourly pay was low. but I got to make new connections and friends. I had a blast working for the company"
good,Its a job. I would say a career but they dont hire temps and they seem to prioritize looking diverse over hiring quality people. Overall it will tide you over til you can find something better. If you are a minority you might actually enjoy it.
good,I worked under a contract and not directly under BoA.I would not be accurately describing this company and my review should not be used as an example.
good,"look for something with better security, advancement if you can. honestly its cool for a little while but at some point you want more and the roles there make you stay in the same spot 12mos minimum."
good,I was allowed to make judgements without being second guessed.  I was unmanaged for a lot of the time.  Meaning that I was trusted to run the site by myself on many occasions.
good,Change of management frequent which and lack of continuity has destroyed team atmosphere. Also changing compensation structure hurts those individuals early in their careers.
good,"The good and the bad of a large corporation.  Impersonal; frequent upper management changes.  Local management can do what they can, but corporate decisions override their decisions."
good,"Meet all my expected goals for the year 2019, but is under horrible leadership and looking for better leadership and growth opportunities with a organization that values their employees."
good,"be on time, very strict with time "
good,Very sales focused company that is always seeking young new talent.  Not all management or leadership are created equal and very different views  and expectations
good,"It's a SIFI; expect appropriate scrutiny, risk profile, and governance to comply with regulatory requirements. This impacts appetite for innovation, speed of execution, and range of flexibility. That draws a certain type of talent. Either you fit that profile and flourish or you don't."
good,"There is a disconnect between communications with financial advisors, assistants, and management. Otherwise, pretty standard work environment. Not a bad place at all."
good,"OK place to work. The site managers did alright, but the next layer of management had little idea of what we did and, therefore made sometimes unhelpful decisions."
good,"The hardest part of the job was management, workplace culture was good, was able to learn a lot during my time there, was able to work with very knowledgeable people"
good,Be prepared for a lot of change within the company. It is a pretty good company overall. Some departments may be subject to layoffs due to Down sizing
good,The main way to get a decent raise is to change roles. The Culture has gone through changes in the last 18 months that is not worker friendly. Chances to work from home have declined.
good,"ok place to work. "
good,"My experience will be different than others, I experienced a colleague who showed lack of respect as a fellow worker which clouded my work experience and made it less than favorable work environment. If that person was not part of the team I would changed my outlook on the company and the job as a whole."
good,Bank of America has a typical call center environment. The shifts are designed for people of all job levels. Flexible schedules and lots of growth potential
good,"Competitive compensation"
good,Milk the company’s money as much as possible because they will do their best to downsize buildings to save money. Good luck with your severance pay! Don’t open a bank account with Bank of America!
good,It's a great place to start off your customer service experience also teaches you about most bank accounts and different credit card options available
good,"I'm from the military so the work life balance is great. 4 weeks vacation at my level with option to buy another. 3 months maternity and paternity leave. Benefits and retirement are good."
good,"Again, I will not be providing a review for thousands to see on a public site.  My impressions, thoughts, activities and experiences should be mine alone."
good,Good place to work. Learned many valuable work and people skills working in various different positions throughout my career. Many volunteer opportunities available and encouraged.
good,The Bank was very focused on process improvement. As improvements were made jobs were lost. It was a high volume environment in which productivity and quality were very important.
good,"Good company to work for, I worked for them as a contractor. This is the company where I got my start, and introduction to hard core networking. I am very appreciative about that."
good,"- User and development interaction on daily on development and testing of features for the product."
good,I found the staff great to work with but the management was a challenge. I did not feel the support for the challenges that we were facing. We were always short staffed.
good,"The bank was fine, I no longer work there due to the asst group, who would never back me up, I was the teller ops spec,  and the branch manager wouldn't listen to me when i went to her, she didn't want to hear it were her exact words"
good,The bank offers flexibility to work from home.  There are many processes within the bank and have learned son skills to work with people to get results.  The toughest part of the job to get all team members from other team to be on same priority.
good,"I learned a great deal working here"
good,The company is known for work life balance once doesn't provide the same anymore and the politics at the workplace is not good for the career growth of the individuals
good,There was too much emphasis on performance metrics and not enough on serving the caller. Other centers never advised callers of important matters that should have been told to them.
good,Learned a lot on regulations and requirements.  The department itself was very unorganized and there were a lot procedures that needed improvement.  It was a hit or miss with getting management to assist. Definitely learned how to get the job done regardless of the tools or support available.
good,They have great benefits. If you are looking for great benefits they have them for you and your loved ones. There will be ups and downs but at the end I think it pays off.
good,Has a lot of employees and hence quite a laidback culture. I did however learnt a lot from the manager who spent a lot of time in coaching me through my first few days.
good,"Good place to go if you want to be there a long time. Place moves incredibly slow, not very entrepreneurial if you're trying to make things happen. Otherwise, the place to be."
good,"Unorganized managers never help with anything, sca's dont do anything right. the whole floor is screwing around alot of personal relations goin on its terrible"
good,I enjoyed the job very much a productive and fun workplace.  The managers and shift managers were very helpful if you had any problems with any of the work that was required
good,Working for Bank of America was a pleasant experience. Working under certain guidelines lead to opportunity and advancement. With the right managers and team you can be successful. With the right drive and connections upward mobility is a plus!!
good,"If you're looking for a job that offers great flexibility, good (but not great) pay, and excellent work life balance, then this is a great spot. If you're looking for rapid advancement (compensation or responsibility), diversity of work, or recognition, this is not a great spot."
good,You are the manger of your career.  You must take the initiative and own your training.   Explore certifications such as Six Sigma and ITIL to provide you work-class framework.
good,The supervisor who work there was not fair at all about vacation time. It was like first come first serve. So we had some people getting all of the major holidays off. For the past 2 years I worked there I could never get a major holiday off. Not even Labor Day. I feel that if you requested Thanksgiving off then you don't get Christmas off. It was very unfair not to be able to spend one of the major holidays with my family. Very disappointed in how the vacation time off was done.
good,"Mondays are your busiest. Call centers are definitely a little stressful. I learned so much more patients working here. Need more fast pace though. I would say the hardest part of the job, if you enjoy being yelled at by customers, can also be with management. Not a whole lot of resources around to help you with what your customers are asking. Long hold times trying to find a manager to assist you with an escalation or a specific matter. I do enjoy the breaks, lunches that are provided, fun t-shirt/hat days. It's a decent job, just for me, i enjoy walking around not sitting all day."
good,Bank of America was a fun place to work. My co workers were very nice. The office environment was upbeat. I would definitely recommend Bank of America to more people.
good,"You have managers that actually care about you and you have others that only care about what their payout is going to be. They constantly push you to reach these goals and make certain amount of calls, emails, and out reach practices that really takes time away from you trying to reach those goals. You can never give an excuse because they start to compare you to others who are at a slower center and have the time to do everything the bank wants you to do. I do not believe bilingual representatives are not given enough credit for what they do. There are times where we are back to back clients with no lunch brake. It was ridiculous at times."
good,"I was an operations rep, very simple job just keying in information from withdrawals to deposits I was the man for that. I picked on a lot made fun of by my managers. I left the job without giving a two weeks notice. Bank of America is a good company to work for, its just some of the people who are very rude."
good,I enjoyed my time with Bank of America. The work was easy and came with low percentage based annual raises. There was quarterly spirit celebrations with games for all employees and recognition rewards for productive employees. There was also charity events like bowling that was optional. It was a fun place to work.
good,BOA was a great place to work until they decided to get rid of their work from home benefit.  They eliminated that benefit and unless you agreed to relocate at your own expense you were without a job.  A lot of talent was lost.
good,Fast past very busy large call center ok place to work. Easy to move up. average about 100 calls a day or so. Great training...........................
good,I was a contractor so do not feel able to comment. Although it was a Bank of America site I actually worked for MBNA which has now been sold off to Lloyds Banking Group.
good,"working 40 hours in the building, Talking to clients and back office. You can move to a different departments. Fun place to work and a good team. Safe"
good,Call center agents are required to score 9 or 10 on customer surveys. Any lower is considered a 0 score. Refunding fees are also counted against your total score and you are not allowed to fully educate the client on what we consider for a refund such as hardship bank error or 3rd party error. It is so busy that management will take 20 to 30 minutes  to respond to your needs on a call
good,Stay focused and patient and career progression is possible.  It's hard to find a new position within the company due to job titles that are over stated for the work that will be conducted.  It seems the only way to get anywhere is to know someone in another position.
good,"Fast paced call center, management focused mainly on your performance scores rather than the employee satisfaction. Job advancement was seldom and very rare."
good,"Bank of America was a good place to work.  Job security was an issue.  As a manager I had to submit ratings for my team every quarter.  As a result, layoffs usually were not far behind."
good,"	Having a passion for helping customers and making clients feel appreciated"
good,"It can be very stressful at times, but the team dynamics make up for the crazy days. I learned the importance of supporting your team and witnessed the impact a coworker's absence made to the flow of the day."
good,Very stressful environment to work.  Managers on the floor are not always on the same page. Benefits are outstanding like health insurance and vacation time off.
good,good benefits good hours if you have kids and is very flexible when it comes to your school or any other job you may have. I would recommend this place to family or friends
good,"i was in the foreclosure department. it was Monday thru Friday and i worked 7:00-3:30. over time was offered at times as needed . the  benefits were great, i miss work there."
good,"There is a lot of opportunity within the company, but the management style has changed a lot over the recent years.  It may not be the best environment for all people."
good,Mortgage and credit card back office work is done at this site.  Customer service and collection is at this site with a lot of other research and other back office work.
good,"Answered client inquiries, promoted products, assisted with online inquiries.  Very engaging work environment.  We took trips and had award ceremonies."
good,Bank of America does offer great benefits and time off. there are many jobs possibly available once you've been in your position for over a year you can post out (in most cases).
good,Hi call volume. May go through a customer service training.  Knowledge of bank card services. Strictly monitored. Breaks and lunches on strict schedule.
good,"Inbound calls and working in depth cases with little to no supervision. Little contact with customers directly but consisted of multi tasking, attention to detail and time management."
good,"Ok company to work for. I been there for 10 yrs. Benefits are great. 401k is awesome. Tuition reimbursement is awesome. Work environment is ok, salary good, days are busy , alot of work, little fun"
good,The environment can be very stressful and challenging as work volume drives your day. There are constant changes made when errors occur instead of making the individuals responsible for the errors accountable. Advancement is only an option when management likes you. Speaking up and out is TABOO!!! After a while the repetitive motions wears on your body.
good,This is a corporation that is revenue results driven with emphasis on client growth.  The work environment is numbers driven where the employee drives their own career growth.
good,"Very Good Work Environment , but very stressful due to lack of tellers  and work life balance. Mobile banking and lack of tellers made the company run like an chicken with its head cut off during peak hours ."
good,"I worked at BofA for 10 years until things started to just be focused on their customers, and no longer supported their employees with and without kid(s)."
good,This company has a potential for being better than what they are. You are over work and under paid. Very long line and customer service sucked. Upper management did nothing to boost you up. It was always negative energy with upper management.
good,"Good company, I worked there for a number of years and for a short period of time I had a strong management team but because of territory restructures it wasn't as pleasant."
good,Required to write a summary here. Not sure what exactly to write but I know it needs to be approximately one hundred and fifty characters which I've done.
good,Company will bring you in and then even if you are doing well wont help you out to convert to full time as you are on contract. Would suggest not to work for more than 6 months for a manager who is not fit.
good,"Hours are flexible, management can be too cost focused.  Like most workplaces, the people make the job what it is.  I had the pleasure of working with great people which made the job enjoyable most days even when stressed."
good,During my short time there I thought they were very careless about abruptly fring people without notice or warning. People were terminated too easily over minimal things.
good,Could not advance in career .  Only if you are in the inner circle of managers will you become leadership or management. Regardless of qualifications.
good,"Working at Bank of America helped me to get my foot in the door with regards to working in a Call Center environment.  Working there helped introduce me to the corporate environment, which has served me well since."
good,A typical day starts with meetings and collaboration with offshore teams. Second half of the day is spent mostly on Management meetings and sync up calls. Workplace culture used to be great but off late it is declining. The hardest part of the job is run an Agile train with teams from across globe. The most enjoyable part is to use bank provided learning opportunities to enhance your skills
good,"BofA has no loyalty for it's employees. Company would rather layoff hundreds of employees at one office, and then run a hiring event the next following day."
good,"While employed at BOA there was very little room for advancement at my location. Because of a very lengthy commute, I looked for a position in Boston to utilize public transportation, or closer to home, but at the time there was a hiring freeze.  There was a Career Mentor program I fully enjoyed, and was thankful to be a part of. My mentor was at the opposite side of the country, but she inspired me to make positive changes that allowed me to continue my career in a move that would benefit me and lead me to new experiences."
good,It is production driven and so the time expected to be seated and taking calls is a 5 minute window due to the systems being so slow when beginning the day.
good,"Started as a lobby teller. Worked my way up as drive-thru, vault & ATM teller. Worked in San Antonio worked as collection agent for overseas military."
good,"It was a great place to start in the financial industry, I worked at Merrill Edge. However, there was no room for advancement and no real initiative to promote across the enterprise. Also compensation was reduced every single quarter. Still, the benefits outweighed the disadvantages. I was disheartened to see that coworkers who had much higher credentials than I, still were not given a career path forward in the organization. I worked with young people with CFA designations and no effort was made to retain them."
good,My time at Bank of America was short. But while I was there they gave me the opportunity to learn how to process VA loans. The office environment and management were helpful
good,Bank of America was a good place to work. The manager was fair and treated her staff with respect. Overtime was paid. Bonuses were offered yearly. Good benefits.
good,Bank of America helped me to become a more confident and capable employee. They allowed me the opportunity to grow and develop my skills and to reach my career goals.
good,"is a huge organization. constantly undergoing changes, a lot of the employess complain about the not so flexible schedules and operations. the pay isj"
good,My experience with B of A was on a temp basis and the branches I worked for were both very unorganized and every file was behind in closing. Every file I worked on was at least 45 days old and every file was a fire to close
good,"Typical day at work: 9 to 5"
good,The culture of Bank of America was a good place to work for the first 2 years of the 8 years that I worked for them. Things changed after the second year and made it a hard place to work. Also job security was in question.
good,If you could handle sales and competitive environment with getting chewed out by customers every day you will be fine. This company is very greedy customers but great to employees.
good,some great employees but overall high stress.  didn't care for the call center director he liked to run around like a cheerleader with pom poms when someone got money from a transfer
good,Sales environment is competitive. Work is meaningful and with the right leaders is very rewarding as you move through progression. Great company to work for.
good,"Expectations were achievable but consistently every day we dealt with system issues due to upgrades on programs.  Systems would freeze or shut down which caused undue inefficiency for customers as well as further stress for associate.  Consistent negative feedback from superior for customer surveys and performance for which they did nothing to help resolve the issues by escalation.  I can control my controllables, but the IT department had to control the programming which consistently provided errors and bad experience for customers and employees."
good,"It was adequate. Typical bank activities. OCC exam is common. Multiple Business Units. Growth by acquisition. In the process of moving to Scaled Agile Framework, SAFe."
good,"it is a regimented, stressful position that I ever haD. Too many regulations to remember and follow. It is not DISNEYLAND. You have the pressure of making your calls efficient and fast."
good,"This was a job that just did not work for me. I do not have anything else to add, therefore, I will conclude my response. There is nothing else. Thank you"
good,"The job was advertised as primarily being support for Online Banking and the Mobile App. After completing training and getting onto the floor I would say that over 70% of calls were actually just basic banking questions ranging from people asking why they're overdrafted or why a check is on hold. So overall they weren't very pleasant calls and definitely not what I interviewed for or signed on for. Overall the job is good, it's just not for everyone. The pay is good and the benefits are good. The negatives I would say are that it's a very stifling environment, breaks and lunches are all staggered so you rarely have interaction with any co-workers. Also they track all time off the phone, so unless you have a medical condition and a doctors note, you'll get spoken to for bathroom breaks."
good,"The people were nice to work for. The work was challenging but it was a job requirement. Management was good. I was a contract and during the Bank of America Layoffs in 2013, the contractors were the first to be let go of."
good,"worked in multiple locations, with wide range of duties , work environment very different in each location. Conservative underwriting philosophy, very interested in reports."
good,"The industry is ever changing and anyone that works there needs to be flexible and open-minded."
good,"Bank of America, provide me with all the skills I needed to continue to grow in the Mortgage industry. I worked on ever loan type with a mixed pipeline, FHA VA MHA JUMBO LOANS CONVENTIONAL SASSY UNDERWRITING AUTHORITY. They prepared you to work in any department on any loan  But it was extremely overwhelming with high pipelines of 60 or more loans and it was not realistic."
good,This position helped me learn about financial institutions and how things work. Helping customers get refunds from vendors that were charging monthly fees.
good,bank of america is a very hard sell environment.  This makes making your goals very difficult to achieve.  The goals are so high so most of the employees never make their quartlery bonus.
good,"The Management does not always consider the well being of their employees.  The pay is good, but you work hard.  The workplace culture is okay, it is not easy to advance to a better job."
good,average place to work.  Many challenges to overcome. Ambiguous pay structure. Would be better categorized as a franchising opportunity.  One should not work there without understanding that you are running a business.
good,"fun place to work, however, it depends on the manager and project. sometimes, it is relaxed and other time is stressed. However, when it is production support, need to stay alert even off office hour and during holidays/weekend."
good,"I work in the Call center for Digital services. With everything that we service and with Bank of America being the 2nd largest Bank in the country, we should make more than 16.75 an hour. The pay is not bad but not enough for the role."
good,Having a great staff to work with makes the day a lot easier. Everyone gets along and communicates easily. Having a fun atmosphere in the office creates better work habits for everyone
good,"How much you enjoy your job will greatly depend on your management team where you're at. Some departments and areas will be great and present you and train you to allow great growth, and others will micro-manage you to where you feel invalidated in your position.It was a stressful environment for little pay. To be fair, it's been many years since I worked there. It is a large company that is financially stable if that matters to you."
good,I had a good exp. but I also saw a lot of turn over and a lot of emplyees with high pressure goals and not a lot of support from management.  If you do well in sales and are personable its not a bad gig
good,"Professional atmosphere, friendly employers and co workers. fast paced, timed work, meeting once a month on performance. there is no more to state. thank you"
good,"The best part was the flexibility to work from home, which was needed due to a family health emergency.  Culture was a bit frenetic, constant reorganizations instituted continual change in duties and made job feel insecure."
good,Job was good. Bus timers were very nice. Job can be demanding but what job isn’t. Company culture was good along with a decent work life balance. Be on time.
good,Decent place to work. Difficult to advance. local management typical of area.  Promoted due to nepotism or virtue signaling or to promote diversity.  Workforce demographics did not reflect local population.
good,"Was expected to sell products to people who didn't really want them, if you didn't sell enough you didn't get a permanent job. Fine for people who don't mind exploiting others, personally didn't find it very moral."
good,"Great place to work if you like or require structure. Great employees, office space, very clean atmosphere. Really hate that I had to leave the company."
good,Management can be a lot better. The moral is stressful. It seems as if you are being watched as if you are a child. There is constantly a change. No direct answer in every scenario. Hardest part is dealing with customers that call in and blatantly disrespect you verbally attack you with no immediate answers wrong transfers
good,As with any large organization my satisfaction with the organization had mostly to do with my direct manager. I had great managers and terrible managers during my time.
good,"The way the commission structure is setup is so you get paid on things overtime so you have to have a really good pipeline in order to fund, no goal adjustment for time off meaning that if you take vacation you really will most likely not be able to fund the following quarter since while out you are not contributing to your pipe line and will have a gap to your already unrealistic goals, why do I say is unrealistic well lets put it this way when you have 85% of your sales team not funding quarter after quarter that tells you the bar is set too high and here is either you fund or you don't get paid commission meaning if you are not at 100% all the work you did for the quarter is gone down the drain most sales jobs they at least pay you a percentage of what you sell."
good,"It was an environment of growth,  structured learning and care. I received several awards for my quality as a personable customer services manager. I enjoyed meeting my customers needs and tried to always show them that they matter."
good,The benefits and pay are exceptional! Customer service is a challenging work environment with all the changes and expectations required as an employee.
good,"Worked as a teller, nothing especially different than any other bank. You have to stand on your feet when with customers and the hours were not always great."
good,"I met some of the most accomplished professionals at BoA/ML. The management are a mess and often just have to be left out of any real discussions if you have to make any progress with real work. The organization does not develop its employees much or at all, causing them to become ""locked in"" or ""stuck"" there. There's way too many meetings. Benefits are very good and pay is good to great."
good,"bank of America as one of the biggest bank have a nice culture and environment for work."
good,"fair place to work. days go fast, people are constantly walking in and out of the building. There is always someone to help or something to do. The pay is nice too."
good,"I worked there so long ago, I do not remember a lot of details to provide a review.  It was not an unpleasant experience and management was pretty good as I recall."
good,"Some days were laid back, other days were productive and busy.  The workplace culture was fun.  Working at BofA isn't for everyone.  You must be able to cross-sell product to customers.  You have to be patient and deal with upset customers."
good,"This job would be WELL WORTH IT if...we had an hour lunch, better pay wages starting at $17/hr. & complimentary breakfast on Mondays & lunches on Fridays (especially during peak busy season). Currently, they are Under new management so everything is changing & a lot of people (especially employees with senority) are leaving."
good,"i was preforming Basic help desk services to only bank of America employees all over the word. Help in providing fast solution for majority of technical issues including but limited to software, applications, passwords resisting, phones, cell phones, computers, printers and much more variety of devices and machines. "
good,"Was not all bad, worked with some great team member which made the job bearable. Team Managers were busy kissing up to unit manager(s) to do there own job. Best thing was the vacation, PTO, and medical benefits. Micromanaging, and unrealistic goals made job stressful. Which is why there were so many people on leave."
good,"Great opportunity to learn what makes big business ""'tick.""  No limit on what you can do or where you can go.  I gained many valuable skills that I've carried with me throughout the years."
good,"no I don't feel like taking any survers. stop asking me for my opinion.  it does not matter any ways. stop stop stop stop stop "
good,"A typical day consist of checking email and following up on client needs and making a sale. I've learned that everything is about numbers and meeting quota. Management is strong and goal driven, workplace is varied with strong sales objectives and professionally driven. Hardest part of the job is overcoming objection and making a difference. Most enjoyable is making a difference in people's lives and exceeding expectation."
good,"start the day by logging into computer phones and follow-up on anything that was left from the previous day, check voicemails and emails, return calls and reply to emails and start the day by company pipeline."
good,"I was a teller, and a typical day was to process numerous"
good,"Worked there for almost 9 years.  They were bought out by Countrywide Home Loans, and then it went down hill.  Several branch closings took place and I was in two locations that were closed a year from each other"
good,"Very fast paced job. Long lines almost all the time and can cause for you to miss breaks and have late lunches or no lunches at all. Short staffed, Customers are usually taking it out on staff if they have to wait. Pay is not equal and fair through out each position."
good,"Horrible, micro managing culture. What might be construed as “nimble” management was really the inability for management to make up their minds on which way to move the company. Brow beating management."
good,"Great place to work for training, educational, and employee engagement opportunities. The benefits and tuition reimbursement plan is also great.  Many line of business areas."
good,Good company to work for in the financial area. Teams didn't always collaborate to make overall improvements. Technology and direction was moving to cloud based solutions.
good,"Job was stressful, but do to lack of work downsizing was always and issue with this job. People were nice, but they didn't offer the chance to work from home either."
good,"It is a customer service based company that focuses on the needs of clients that walk in the door. It is a fun company to work for with great co-workers that make it fun. I have learned a lot since I first started in banking. I have learned to deal with diificult customers and deal with different situations. I have learned how to utilize the different computer systems that constantly continue to change. I have learned about the different products and services that fit each individual, financial needs is not a one size fits all we have to accomodate each client according to his/her needs. I deal with different customers each day, therefore each case and lifestyle is different, what may work for one person may not work for another."
good,I worked in IT as a project manager responsible for  programmers/IT people.  We were at the bleeding edge of new technology and managing the shift from mainframe to desktop in the mid 1980s.
good,The company motto is to be the best bank but they never cared about the clients. There is a lot to pressure to sell sell sell. Customer service was never a priority. Management was always expected to be in meetings to help create a better customer experience but were seldom there to help so it always seemed understaffed.
good,"They are focused on their mission but too much sales pressure "
good,This was my 1st job and no other job has been fair in the amount of money that you are paid compared  to this company. Bank of America does believe in paying a fair wage for working.
good,assist client with products checking savings credit card debit card stop paymentand online backing auto loan heloc mortgage etc talking over phone working in multiple system
good,I worked for Barnett Bank which was acquired by Nationsbank and then Bank of America.  Barnett bank was an exceptional company.  The people were great and the mission was to be the best bank in Florida
good,Well trained for job. Patient management. Great leaders. Fun atmosphere. Rewarding Job! Never felt as if I wasn't appreciated. No average salaries. Supported diverse personnel.
good,Daily manage and communicate with a group of 10 processors to maintain service levels for outside sales reps and problem solved to drive loans to closing
good,"As is the case with any large organization there were good days and there were bad days, good times as well as bad times. I was a part of the legacy Merrill Lynch force when Bank of America took over. I understand that a business has to do whatever it sees necessary to protect it's shareholders and I happened to be a part of the resulting downsized. I think it's a great place to work if you don't plan on being there too much of a long term."
good,I worked for Countrywide which is no longer there since Bank of America bought them. It was a different culture and environment. At the end if was not good due to the RIFs.
good,"it was cool but lay-offs happened too frequent. It felt unstable. In 2008 when housing bust happened, about 1/2 the workforce were let go with no notice. It was scary and created a sense of unease in the entire group."
good,Jobs within the banking center are becoming more difficult to find and paying less. This is a dying industry and will not be around for long due to electronic banking.
good,"Worked here for 21 years.  Throughout my career I was promoted based on my merits and was recognized for all my accomplishments.  I feel the company does help promote from within  but at times they did not offer anyone on the team a chance to grow they preferred to bring in new talent.  Through the years the benefits (especially medical) became more expensive and covered less. The workplace culture was pretty relaxed and the people were great to work with.  Unfortunately after surviving many cuts I was eventually laid off and given a severance package.  Despite my package being pretty good, I would have liked if they would have given me at least 30 days to possibly look for employment within the firm before severancing me as my layoff was due to a reorganization not a financial downfall.  Instead I was called on a Friday morning and given the news.  I thing any firm who has had an employee dedicate 21 years of their life to a firm should be given a little more consideration not just say ""here's a package thank you for your services."""
good,Great people that are constantly leaving because of lack of promotions. It's all about who you know and who likes you. C-Level management doesn't practice what they preach.
good,I prefer not to respond to this question at this time. I am not completing a review on this company. There is nothing that I have to say at this time.
good,It seemed at times that there was no autonomy for employees. Every behavior was managed and every behavior was dictated. That said expectations were fair and well expressed and benefits package was good.
good,good place to work. everyone there is nice and helpful. always around to be there when you need them.the culture was good and you get along with everyone fast.
good,"Wonderful culture, benefits, and overall quality of individuals. Resources to acquire and develop new skills are abundant. Continued learning and development is highly encouraged."
good,"Focused customer service needs, weekly sales plan,  team players, positive leader, made the workplace and culture a great place to work! I recommend Bank of America."
good,Advise clients on a variety of long term financial needs.  Opportunity for growth.  Need to have experience with banking as well. Can be very successful depending on location.
good,The company was a wonderful place to work for. Great benefits and days off. I loved working BOA. Did great things with Bank of America. I met wonderful people
good,"This company is a great company to work for with plenty of potential growth within, I would highly recommend this company to anyone who wants to pursue a career in mortgage."
good,"I can't imagine that the company is the exact same as when I was there. Like any other job, your manager really makes the difference in how great the job is."
good,"•	Assisted homeowners who were in various stages of delinquency attempting to resolve debt by setting up workout and repayment plans based on investors requirements "
good,"I was in the last training class for default operations in the Pittsburgh area.  First job in the default profession, learned many new skills.  Site is now closed."
good,Management doesn’t give you a plan of where the department is headed until the day of. Depending on which department you work the pay raises are minimum.
good,bank teller mostly processing transactions very customer service orientated and be able to offer credit cards auto loans and home refinances and pay close attention to detail.
good,They provide good training. The managers are strict but fair. They are tough on sales goals. The position I was there for ended up moving back to Baltimore. Richmond was a test market.
good,"Too large of a company to get anywhere except average. I spent a many years working there, only to be lost in the shuffle and eventually laid off when no longer needed."
good,Company is not assessable for all employee needs. It is a lot unfair judgment passed by employees in higher position based race and gender. The work environment is also not a comfortable one.
good,"My job here involved keying and verifying tax data, mostly for NYS Tax and Finance plus various lockbox operations. In the early years, we keyed withholding and estimated tax, as well as corporate and sales use tax. Those early years were pretty busy, too, with things happening like 9/11 and New York tax amnesty. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace of work, especially when we had PIT 2000 which involved personal income tax forms. The various mergers, like with Norstar and Fleet, then Fleet merging into Bank of America, also made things interesting. In the last few years, the work slacked off, and our hours changed. I hated that. The benefits, though, were pretty generous, including the family and health leave which out a bundle of cash into my account in the three months of my recovery from an ankle injury in 1997."
good,Loved working with people. I have learned a lot about people and how money works in our everyday lives. I have learned how to manage money to help it grow individually and professionally.
good,"Coming in as a contractor at times is difficult because you get moved from one department to another.  During those times I have to say you feel very welcomed and trained in each department you go too."
good,No one seems to last very long at this company because they rotate people out so they don't have to pay higher wages. The employees at entry level have to work harder than everyone above them to keep their jobs and still lose them.
good,It was an unpaid internship over the summer. The people I worked with were great and I enjoyed the culture. They said I could apply for a job there and would be happy to hire me.
good,worked there a long time ago. I dont know what the culture is like now. It used to be strictly sales and was handed a phone book and was told to call. It may have changed
good,Within retail there is no room to move up or gain recognition. In the Boston Market there is a lot of congestion and cronyism. There are some very talented people in this market but the market is not big enough to handle all of the talent.
good,"Good Place to work, but no growth"
good,"This time with BOA was a project for Digital Risk, completely different than working direct for the bank, this is a separate situation all around. ..."
good,"Performed cashiering duties in the absence of the cashier; received and processed a variety of cash, check, and/or charge payments; prepared customer receipts; provided check cashing services; prepared manual CIT check to replenish petty cash box to $2000. "
good,"Worked here less than one year,  good benefits and great coworkers.  Leadership was fair.  Did not participate in all programs due to length of service."
good,ML is one of the hardest places I've ever worked.  You have to be extremely detail oriented.  This will be the lowest pay for hardest work you ever do.
good,Great team oriented environment.  There was a high expectancy for selling additional bank products.  I enjoyed the fast paced nature of this job and building relationships with regular clients and coworkers.
good,"on a typical day, we ran checks that came in from the branches and we had to stay till all the work was done.  If it snow and work were late we sat around till it arrived.  Management was always changed"
good,"Typical day 9am until 6pm"
good,"I enjoyed working for Bank of America. I was a fraud analyst. "
good,"Repair and verify over 500 transactions domestic and international inbound and outbound via CHIP/FED and Book transfer in ACI worldwide Money Transfer Department."
good,Merrill Lynch is a good place for an experienced sales professional. There seems to be some training but most is self study. For the the right candidate it can be a good place to work.
good,"Supervisors are usually not present when needed or required. No one will be at there assigned desks. "
good,"It was nice working here, the problem was the lack of employees for every branch and the volumes of customer overwhelming for only 2 tellers. The pay could be better , especially when there is only 2 tellers for the amount of customer that comes to the branch,"
good,"It has been a long time since I worked there and I remember it was a good company.  I loved my co workers at the time.  However, the pay was not very good."
good,"Good pay, not good with post training and keeping up with changes. Mostly reactive than proactive with changes. Usually results in quality failures.Could do much better with transparency and giving a real answer rather than passing the buck."
good,Bank of America does have great benefits but the environment in which I worked was extremely stressful and much of your job was rated over client satisfaction overall which you the individual did not have much control over.  Management is similar to other companies in that it depends on which manager.  A typical day at work entails calls in and out to clients and a policy of you must always pick up the phone on all incoming calls. Working on client files calculating income qualifications and reviewing documents provided by the client.  The hardest part of my job would be taking the calls from clients that are hateful.  The most enjoyable part is helping those that really want and need your help and are a delight to work with.
good,"it was a good job, fun job and very fast paced. The management was a bit harsh and strict but it is understanding being in the area it was they had to stay on top of all."
good,I learned a lot from working for this company.  It provided me with DE and VA Underwriting Designation.  However it became stressful with underwriting being required to carry the majority of the load.  I am fortunate though to learn a lot and will always appreciate the experience I gained.
good,Team work with sales and fulfillment is strong and well structured. Pipeline management is great. Fulfillment in brea was a phenomenal division to work with.
good,Good company but lack of growth and some internal politics. People believe int he mission but are more driven by own team goals. Overall stable company with good benefits.
good,ok company to work for - good training ground to move onto another Bank - Very Big so its hard to get things through . Over experience was ok with BOA
good,Work place was usually very busy and interactive. The branch was in a very busy location hence it afforded opportunity to interact with clients from all walks of life.
good,Good strong company to work for. The down side is the new managements that have different ways of seen and doing things. Good benefits and great paid vacation.
good,Assisted customers with banking needs. ATM custodian (assist w/atm reports and loading money). Promoted the bank to potential customers. Suggested appropriate bank products
good,Too much pressure to sale accounts rather Than provide great personal service.  This makes it hard to develop relationships with customers. Working with minority employees was great!
good,"When you start your interview process, and even during training, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SET FINANCIAL BRANCH YOU'RE GOING TO!!!!!! I started off in the company being hired to work for one specific financial branch, but during training they gave my position to an internal hire; since they already spent the money to put me through training they wouldn't fire me, but they had no where to put me. So, I was forced to go to a different financial branch every week for MONTHS, with no end in sight; they don't care how far they send you (my longest commute one week was 2 hours, each way), they don't cover your cost of gas or tolls if they send you places, and then they get mad if you don't meet your quotas (which if you don't have a set ""home,"" most branch managers won't let you sit out on their floor to take sales away from their people). The only GREAT thing about the job, was the pay and their great medical benefits."
good,"I have worked in lending before, and the clients were clamering to get their applications and you are the point of contact.  With BofA its a little different.  You are trying to manage a lead pipeline from within the branch which requires floor time, calling warm leads and competing with other locations within your AOR.  Also you are competing with the Website and 800 number, any of those leads that come through get routed through another system. The managment was also conflicting,  what was told by your mortgage dept manager what not how the floor manager wanted things done, etc.  What a headache."
good,I don't really have much to say. As long as you go in got your work done. There really wasn't room for much concerns. Management try but at times some situation can not be avoided.
good,"I worked in the claims as a contractor and they did not treat the contractors pretty well. There was not an option to chose your schedule as it was set for you and you were more than likely going to be working weekends. Again, this is from the perspective of a temp at the time in 2016."
good,Bank of America/Merrill Lynch is a fast pace highly competitive work environment. Has a good culture and positive people to work with. The hardest part is time management.
good,"I was not happy working for this company, This company does care for the employees, their main concerns is opening accounts for people including elderly that do not need these accounts, this is includes pushing credit cards for customer that only get social security income."
good,"There was never any realization to the production of the work you put out. Very political with the idea that perception is reality. Very little focus on quality of work, with a lot of focus on how it was presented.."
good,I am extremely grateful for the vast support and learning that all the staff and customers provided that taught me the skill sets that I now possess.  The HUD and FNMA support was beyond recognition and guidelines clearly defined to provide excellent support
good,"A typical day starts with headphones, ends with headphones and regimented workdays with fun interactions between employees. You are evaluated constantly with the intent to improve performance. I found the constant rating as invasive and unnecessary."
good,"It really the refection on wait time when clients are calling in. "
good,Working at Bank of America was my first real corporate job out of high school.  I started a a file clerk and was able to work my way up to Accounts Payable clerk. It was a very good first grown up position.
good,Internal advancement opportunities If you know the right individuals and/or where to look. Learned diverse skills while working here.  Many opportunities to gain hard to acquire cybersec skills
good,friendly co workers  management helpful i dealt with bankers and their expense reports small office   manager always avaulable to help  not stressful quiet office
good,"Overall Bank of America is a great company to work for and my ratings was solely based on the department I work in. There was no room for growth and upper management was not fair and seen a lot of racist action being displayed. The different deployment was endless, there was no stability and didn't know from one day to the next if you had a job. The job itself became very stress and undesirable. I am positive in other areas of the bank it would be a better experience"
good,When I was there Bank of America were laying off a lot. As of today I think they still if you're trying to get into the mortage area of employment. It was a very comfortable place to work. Made many friends there.
good,"Working with great people who value the input, however, not much improvement on personal growth and opportunities. Culture and management go hand in hand but overall enjoyable place to work."
good,We was out sourced and had to relocate. I had to either chose to move to California or leave the job we was not offered jobs at other locations. The pay raise was ok.
good,"Many changes both organizationally and functionally allows you to work on many different projects.  However, there are many meetings and many processes.  There are still areas that need to improve and processes merged from the ML merger but progress is happening."
good,"After arriving at the given employer, I had a premonition that it was going to be one of the best experiences of my life. And I was not wrong, no not at all."
good,"It has a rather formal working environment, not as relax as in other companies. Also more bureaucratic than other companies. Many times the company could not retain talents"
good,"Customer service in the credit card department, screening for and reporting fraud or assisting customers with card issues. Company chose not to renew lease at building location and laid off the personnel at the location where I was contracting."
good,Bank of America acquired Counteywide Home Loans. This was a loss mitigation position were it was extremely stressful to be empathetic to the homeowner and also mitigation to the company. The acquisition was a tough transition for most employees as there were waves of layoffs and not much support to the staff. The pay was descent and benefits robust which made working there worth it at the time.
good,"It was a typical day at work, everyone did they assignments for the day, While they I learned the basic of banking, management was good. The workplace was good. I did not find any job hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was how we work together."
good,Great place to work. Hours can vary at closing time . This made it hard to get to school on time. I enjoyed my coworkers ans we were all very team oriented.
good,Work is sometimes fast-paced or can be very slow. Must know how to multi-task and handle all the job has to offer. What I have learned working there is that there are a lot of services that can be done online on your own time. There are a lot of things that are ATM's can do to make banking easier for the customers.
good,"I've gained a lot of knowledge working at Bank of America.  The work / life balance used to be great but as they are removing remote positions and some flexibility,  They have made it hard to achieve the goals they once did.   Morale is important when working at company and removal of programs can tend to bring that down.  Also, compensation is not as competitive as it is across the industry."
good,"The Company aims to run with the herd with the latest technology."
good,"•	Overlooked the overall management of branch sales, service, customer relationship building, portfolio growth, and profitability. Sales of mortgages, home equities, investments, and general bank products."
good,Bank of America provides reasonable employment in the retail banking industry. Most positions available in the Rochester area are related to sales and referrals to generate business.
good,"call after call...managers have favorites very friendly people . they do give info in the training to do the job right the place is business casual  no hoodies,, room to move within the company. many depts. with them"
good,"the experience that i had here was not bad at all. the only thing i had a problem with was the rude associates that felt they were higher than and demand so many things out of you, and If you did not have it done correctly they would try to get you fired."
good,My position was a proof operator during the evening shift. the assignment were manageable and the daily productivity was met. The schedule was not conducive at the time when you have younger kids.
good,"Not a whole lot of personality here and overly focused on production numbers. There is no such thing as a casual conversation here. It's always ""how's your pipeline?"""
good,"I had a good time while working at Bank of America. I was able to show my skills, get additional training, learn management skills and was able to apply to the next job."
good,"Great discounts, a lot of pressure of certain goals to meet as far as sales and referrals."
good,"•	Supervises the execution of transactions and responses to customers, investors, or 3rd party related inquires."
good,"I left to work at aol"
good,"Bank of America supports continuing education and travel to legal events.  An employee's experience at the bank is good or bad depending upon who your manager is.  Compliance is the  best that I have seen in a corporate fiduciary.  The most enjoyable part of this work experience was working with clients.  The banks mission was to give each client a ""wow"" experience.  Spot  bonuses are given to team members performing an outstanding job."
good,I do not wish to comment further than my resume. The activities throughout the organization were mediocre at best. There has been so much time passed since working there
good,Good hours and pay. Adequate training. Plenty of locations so there is always room to transfer. Plenty of opportunity for advancement within the company
good,"Bank of America offers good benefits and 401K. Workplace culture has been doing well and communication is open between staff, managers, and senior management.  It has allowed me the flexibility to go to school while I am working full time which is a huge benefit.  They are very encouraging of furthering your knowlege and experience."
good,I was not at Bank of America long.  I was working contract and our project ran out of funding so they had all the contractors helping out in other areas needed within the organization I was working for.
good,"A highly competitive workplace. Lot's of opportunities to succeed, but you have to defend your territory. They give you the freedom to manage our own book of business."
good,The positions are competitive and the Benefits are good. Volunteer work welcomed by the company. Family is important to upper management. Minimum growth.
good,"* Answer telephones for all departments to include online banking, bank accounts & credit cards"
good,I did not like the fact that it was not very customer service oriented. Hard on meeting minimum standards.  Not the work culture I was looking for. The branch staff and my manager were great.
good,Bank Of America very time managed and stats were very imporant Fasted paced.Long Hold time Not enough Staff. Seveys were based on yours stats and hold time effected your numbers. I felt the traing wasnt enough and there was really no support on the floor. Lots of change.
good,"It has been a long time since I have worked here(18 years), but I did enjoy the culture and working with Banking systems.  At the time the benefits were good but don't know what they are now."
good,"I was happy for a long time working for the bank, then I found out how much being able to truly advance depends on who you know, rather than what you know.  I have worked hard and done more than my job on a regular basis and still am struggling to advance and find something more challenging within the company and that is what is leading me to look outside."
good,"BofA buys and merges faster than they can grow responsibly. Layoffs 1-3 times a year now, raises are a joke and everyone getting hammered to do more with less. Spend most of day either babysitting or cleaning up someone else's mess and processes are being offshored faster than we can train. Train wreck"
good,"To much favoritism in some units. If you are a friend or relative of the unit leader you move up but if not you don't move anywhere. Also those friends and relatives are placed in the back rows along side of managers. I left company after 7 years due to this. They were un-trusting of employees that are there for years with to much micro-managing and monitoring and questioning everything. if your employee does a great job and no complaints from borrowers and never works overtime and always exceeds goal then they should not be second guessed and questioned  about every phone call, call log,  etc. It got out of hand (in my opinion) and became a place I loved to work to a place I would cry on my way to work because I had to be there. It really went downhill from when i started to when I left. Mostly due to the leader i was under."
good,I loved working as a training assistant. It allowed me to be creative and helped me to be more of a leader and improve my communication skills. This allowed me to be promoted to my next career opportunity.
good,"The company may be going through structural changes.  Worked there as a contract employee for a specific project as part of a group.  As we had more projects added and were able to stay longer, I noticed that many departments were being eliminated, many people laid off or their jobs relocated too far away for them to consider staying.  They hired a few of the 50+ contract people as permanent employees, but having seen the other departments I would be doubtful of long term employment unless there is the capability/willingness to relocate."
good,This was a production environment where the goal was to achieve accuracy in making timely deposits on lock box customers.The environment promoted positive engagement among the leaders and associates. Incentives were given based on the amount of work that was produced
good,"Typical work day requires performing transactions for customers by opening accounts, withdrawn money for customers, and attempted to introduce theme to bank's other products (opening credit card account, money market and saving accounts)."
good,"Working as collections was very hard -  angry people on the phone calling in - hated BAC "
good,A typical day at work can be demanding at times but for the most part is inline with industry standards. Overall can be a great place to work as the staff is one of the best within operations of an FCM.
good,There are better corporate culture to experience than in banks. Business planning team relied on data set without much business intelligence tool to work with.
good,The typical ho hum 9-5 job with many people performing the same tasks for years. Progression is slow but job security is guaranteed. Very diverse campus.
good,3 - 3.5 stars is all I will say. As a relationship manager the location of your bank is the largest component and also your manager. The goals have become unrealistic due to the traffic slowing down with the intro of online banking. Numbers are more important that overall customer satisfaction unfortunately.
good,i rather skip this survey. I remain neutral to my past employer.  there was a lot of office politics that i did not agree with and if you like an environment that is a revolving door well then that's the place to be.
good,Due to the transition from Countrywide Mortgage to Bank of America not being a smooth transition I was not at the company long enough to form a good opinion.
good,"I would say Bank of America is a good place to work, from my past experience. It may have changed over the years, but that is what I remember about Bank of America, Charlotte, NC."
good,"•	Identify customer’s financial needs and help fulfill those needs both for the individual consumer and small business customers."
good,"Retail banking is turning into a client managed portfolio where it is banking by appointment. Traditional banking is in the past, now it is more of a Financial Solutions atmosphere."
good,"Great place to work with great people but career advancement is difficult unless you work with the same manager for a while, which is quite rare.  Once you position yourself for advancement an organizational realignment will occur or new exec will take over setting your progress back to square one.  Great place to work if content with good pay and benefits but no forward growth."
good,"Reconcile invoices, answer office department phone, greet customers, attend department meetings.  sort  department mail to various departments. Distribute meeting material."
good,"My jobs duty is collect documents from the borrowers upload and validate to underwriter for review. Signed off conditions based on my SASE authority."
good,"Ran teller line, as well as working Customer Service opening safe deposit box contracts. Also opened personal and business accounts for customers. Also trained some on opening loan accounts."
good,"Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi "
good,I will forever be grateful to BOA but other than the benefits there really isn't any room for growth. If your on a write up they tend to treat you like an outsider.
good,A job where you work and are paid. I worked in several offices for several different managers and I assisted many different brokers. It is just an OK place to work.
good,Pretty good company. I enjoyed my work environment. My coworkers were nice and my manager was very accommodating. The hours were fairly flexible with good benefits and vacation time.
good,This job definitely paid well and the hours were good. Everyone i worked with seemed nice and they offered plenty of training so I easily understood my job expectations.
good,"Again, I was a consultant not employee and only here for 2 months"
good,The building was in a great location. For the most part the management staff was nice. The café was nice. The little store was open on Saturdays for associates that worked.
good,fun place to work. typical corporation  to work for. cut throat rood for advancement and promotion. wold probably still be working there if i wasn't outsourced.
good,"The program is rigorous and challenging, but allows you to grow into a financial advisor. Your first months begin by studying for your Series 7 and 66 licenses. Once you become licensed your training ends and production begins. You are expected to bring in 10 million in assets under management in the first year, along with 7 million in net new strategic flows, and 5 million in fee-based assets. It is a great learning experience in knowing what it takes to survive and thrive in the financial services industry."
good,Sales and service to existing and potential clients. Peer coach. Group huddles. continued training. Sales of financial products and referral to business partners
good,The work environment is stressful and the management does not value you as an employee.  Interruptions during your breaks; unless you leave the building.
good,"Review critical emails that need to be addressed."
good,Loved working for the bank. Unhappy that my department moved to Brea. It would be 42 miles 1 way for me and traffic is horrible. I transferred to fraud dept because it was closer for me. I was driving to Brea prior to that.
good,"I have only been at bank of america for a short time. I can already tell there are lifers, people just passing through, and contractors. Decent place to work with a culture all its own."
good,"Retail banking was highly focused on compliance management. Managing such a global company's risk reputation requires all hands on deck. Unfortunately, it didn't appear that all employees were onboard with taking necessary actions."
good,"helping customers with credit card statements, helping with refunds, interest rates, sales of credit cards, consolidations of paying off other credit cards, direct deposits from credit cards to bank accounts."
good,"Had a  upbeat professional atmosphere, Employees were always willing to help on work related project. Training could use more tweaking to help develop stronger associates."
good,"Pay is fair, benefits are fantastic, and for the most part, the people that you work with are decent.  My major concern is that the corporate culture (at least at the market level where I am) seems to focus more on competition rather than collaboration.  Maybe other teams operate differently.  I also have an issue with the way goals are set.  I don't mind hard work and accountability and I am not in an individual contributor role, so I have to individual goals to meet.  However, I believe it is problematic that goals for in-store team members are consistently going up while the business is simultaneously driving self-service and convenient banking options that necessarily reduce client foot traffic."
good,"The Bank of America I worked at was very fast pace and on a average I would help between 150 to 300 customers. Not all branches were like this though, I was able to help out at other branches when there wasn't enough tellers available to work. The manager at my branch wasn't very helpful, and she didn't know much of the bank policies. We depended mostly on the assist manager, which the bank manager did not like."
good,"Work Culture okay"
good,"My stay at US Trust was short"
good,Enjoyed working in a department where the job responsibilities were in the process of being developed/re-designed.  Positive support from management in all aspects of the position.
good,Great place to start but benefits are overpriced and not great.  No job flexibility and not enough opportunities to advance in your career.  401k options are great!
good,Learning the software was very difficult and challenging. I was very hard for me to remember all of the millions of steps to be successful at my job. But I did enjoy the type of work I did which was manage the properties
good,Pay vacation leave all great.  Toxic culture.  The company is so big that everyone is working in self interest.  Very difficult to find solutions to any problems.  Having said that the hours and benefits are tremendous
good,"Bank of America Corporation is an American multinational financial services company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is ranked 2nd on the list of largest banks in the United States by assets"
good,Your day was pretty much the same each day.  Management for the most part was honest and open with employees.  Some managers were very afraid of an employee learning more than them or performing better so they would do things and create issues for employees.
good,worked here for a brief time several years ago. it was on occasion fun but very distracting with the noise coming from each department. associates worked with were enjoyable
good,Customer service is only as good or bad as the customers you have to deal with. The stress would not be that different for any other company on the same line of work.
good,The hours was long some days. The work was easy and laid back. Free parking at every bank. Work at all banks in Baltimore. The hours was long for little pay.
good,"typical day was working with about 30 clients"
good,"It's a good place to work, but like any other company, you have to be aggressive and. As a temp worker the will work you to the last day and take full advantage of it."
good,"Respectfully decline the opportunity to provide feedback regarding my employment experiences with Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Pennington, NJ at the present time.  Thank you."
good,It is a great place to learn and implement new technologies. Needs to let team maintain their work-life balance. They should provide better discounts on BOA products to its employees.
good,"Assistant to department head and responsible for all correspondence, scheduling, detailed reporting.  Preparing paperwork and processing to meet compliance regulations"
good,"Productive work environment with the ability to grow."
good,We are very short handed which makes trying to take any time off very difficult. It prevents you from enjoying a family vacation. The work is becoming more electronic.
good,"Depending on this dept you work for."
good,Sales goals were almost impossible but the interaction with the clients made this job ok. My supervisor was very helpful and approachable with questions throughout training as well as through the course of my employment.
good,There is an issue with your bot. I do not wish to write reviews for my past employers. They are in my past and I wish to leave them there. They no longer served me or advancement was not possible.
good,"I like the multi-cultural and diversity of the company, not much room for professional growth unless you move around within the company to look for promotion and better pay."
good,"Bank of America was great, however being such a large company, they can get rid of your department and transition you to another position very quickly."
good,I wish to give no additional on bank of America during the time that I worked there. it is what it is . a banking industry providing financial services to its clients.
good,"Nice place to work in , not bad pay and good benefits , u have to meet your goals or team goals everyday by selling what the bank offers and asking every customer"
good,I was given opportunity to learn and advance.  which enable me to move on this the business.  My manager was very encouraging.  I learned how take my skills to the next level.
good,"Training was great. Management was poor, inconsistent, and insensitive. Workplace culture was diverse and coworker were fabulous. The hardest part was lack of support from upper management."
good,Bank of america has avery competitive culture about their business. Advancement of average for its type of industry but one must be organized and always perform your due diligence.
good,Although i was not at this company very long I did enjoy it for the most part. The people I worked with were very good and  management was very hands on. In fact it was management who recognized that I should have been doing more than I was and recommended me to a different company (law firm) that would better benefit from my talents. I am very thankful for that.
good,"Sales are a very important part for every day banking. There were many opportunities for referrals. These require time to connect with the customer. It is a very busy bank and with the lack of employees, it becomes very stressful.  I would say time management needs to be looked into."
good,I worked in a call center. I was required to be on the phone 95% of time. I was given two 15 mins breaks and 1 hour for lunch. I learned to build relationship quickly over the phone. Micro management to the upmost. I loved meeting new people over the phone from different parts of the country.
good,I thoroughly disliked working here. It is extremely political and you are at the mercy of the system. Your future is entirely out of your hands and have to hope to get lucky to succeed here.
good,You are encourage to take advantage of the companies many Learn Programs but never given the time to take class (which can only be taken during business hours.
good,It's okay to work as part time over there. Team members are nice to each other. you always can have someone back you up. easy to talk with the highness.
good,"If selling products is what you like, then this is the place for you. You will learn how to see and fill the customer need in a fast paced environment."
good,just being a stepping stool for BOA customer could saying anything they want about us on the phone and we were suppose to take the abuse they seem like they dont care about people feelings only about making more money in they pockets
good,"Do not recall a lot about my day at Bank of America, as it was so long ago.  My time there was brief and we were going through the consolidation process."
good,"My time at Bank of America has not been bad.  I feel that overall the company means well, but they really need to focus on DEVELOPING THEIR MANAGERS!  I have had a few absolute HR nightmares of managers and directors who don't need to ever manage anyone.  If you have a good manager who gives good guidance and actually cares about their direct reports, then this can be a great place to work."
good,It is an overall good place to work. Does have excellent benefits. Does promote workplace diversity. Provides ongoing employee coaching. Gives timely performance reviews.
good,"Great Company , great management , great pay for temp employees, the only issue was the work hours . They weren’t conducive to living a life with children, but understandable depending on the companies needs"
good,"Working for Bank of America was very challenging, its very fast-paced and very demanding when it comes to your productivity while maintaining a great quality performance. And I think its an advantage for me because I was able to test my self and learned a lot from doing a lot of things. Its always a fulfilling feeling at the end of the day when you know you did your best. I was able to work with great people too, who helped me and taught me about things that I needed to understand."
good,everything is out of date goals are unattainable. managers are good. just hard to work for company who is behind on technology for their employees. wouldn't recommend
good,"I did not work on the retail side, I work for the Trust operations.  Back then, we were already trying to improve on transaction processing and automation.  We succeeded.  The group of people I worked with were hardworking and reliable."
good,I liked working as a Teller. I enjoyed cash handling and the professionalism of the job. It was a fast paced environment that made the day go by fast. Although they were constantly under staffed which made the job stressful.
good,There was a different vibe when the merger first happened.  That went away and it no longer felt like banking.  Felt like a sales job.  Customer service meant nothing as long as the customer bought the products.  It isn't Bank of America alone.
good,"The years I worked for Bank Of America, I found it to be a very stable place to work, Benefits were excellent and I feel that every one was treated fairly."
good,this was my first real job as an SA.  leaned alot from this position and became very good at day to day unix administration work.  people were very friendly to work with
good,"My day included greeting and meeting all customers that came into the banking facility. I was responsible for loans, customer service and any duties that were needed at the time. I also had the responsibility on training of new procedures. I kept in touch intermittingly with my Teller Manager and was notified if there were any issues arising on the teller line. I met with my personal bankers throughout the day watching, listening and involving myself with their daily duties. The most enjoyable part of my position with Bank of America was definitely the customers. The most difficult was the pushing of sales. Banking has become more about what can be sold than how we take care of our customers. There was time that there was pressure to sell at all times."
good,"The management was great, the hours were perfect and the pay was awesome. It was too bad my time with them was only on a temp contract thru an agency. I must say my time with Bank of America was a pleasure because as a temp they treated their employees well therefore I can only imagine how they would treat their permanent employees."
good,I worked at Bank of America for approximately 6 months in the consumers card division the experience there gave me much insight into the world of Credit Cards
good,Started my Registered rep career here. Good place to learn the business. Had lots of people to train me. It did not take me long to Gert started or become successful.
good,Productive fun workplace. Good training programs and workplace culture. Flexible work environment and setting. Good benefits package and competitive salary.
good,It was a good entry level job.  There was no training and zero chance for advancement.  The management was lax but then this was pre financial crisis so that was going around.
good,"If you don't need or want to be noticed for the work you do, this is a great fit. Operational-level managers are a hit or miss I have found. Being bright doesn't get the job done, playing politics does."
good,"overall to much pressure for sales , standing all day and not enough staff for the whole day ,sometimes it would only be 3 people the whole week for a busy small town"
good,"The company environment was productive and efficient,   Also, company community participation very good.  Management needs to engage more positively with employees."
good,Lots of hours pay was not great did not work the long enough to out much input into the company. Im sure it is a great company to work for if you have been there for awhile
good,"I held many positions while at Bank of American. I was responsible for that part of the loan process, and the respa documents as they came and and th review the files for information as needed."
good,"I liked my manager and it was a relatively long assignment from a temp agency, so I liked working at Bank of America.  The team was rather large for a temporary assignment.  There were more than 15 of us.  It was good pay for a temp assignment."
good,Similar to other big box lenders. left because there was no room for movement in the sight I was located in. Bank of America also tended to hire from outside or an entirely different division to fill higher roles.
good,it was fine.the company was bureaucratic and not enough say in the linew of business. otherwise it was a fine job. I would not say it was unpleasant but it could have been better
good,"Help customer protect account from fraud"
good,"as an offshore unit, though the vision and mission remains same but implementation of the same is different being in asian region and being operated as seperate unit of the company"
good,"Always helps when you have a manager who understands your goal and can help alligning these with his department and company goals. "
good,20 years of providing excellent customer service to our customers.  Learning.how to excel in helping our customers with their financial needs now or in the future to help better their lives.
good,OK place to work at the time I first started and it was a a decent time with great hours. Also the opportunities there to grow are awesome if you stick it out and show them your interest.
good,It was okay a typical job didn't show much love or care toward employees and their needs. Will never work for the company again. A great job for beginners.
good,If it wasn't for so many lay offs and lack of advancement this would be a great company to work for. They have some of the best benefits including child care reimbursement and a great work life balance. Also it would be nice if they offered a living wage or higher wage increases. They are some of the lowest in the industry.
good,Sometimes the environment appeared to be very competitive.  Many of the employees would make my job difficult.  I was a contractor.  The managers were great but sometimes the employees would make you feel that you were an outsider.
good,"The difference between a great experience with the company and a dreadful one can hinge solely on the luck of the draw - specifically, the management staff you're assigned under. The work isn't bad, the the culture can be grating and advancement opportunities can be sluggish."
good,The traing received for the Loan Processor position seemed very quick and short. It was difficult to engage with the instructors as the training class was too large (70-75) people. I would recomend more in depth smaller training classes and ongoing training after hitting the production floor.
good,great place to work great management team and great benefits lots of opportunities for advancement great work environment lots of rewards and recognition
good,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians as they would say.  High Quotas and lots of overtime.  Bonuses were very good when obtained. computer system was old and antiquated.
good,This was a very fast paced environment.  They invested many hours to  train for Customer Service positions. You were given opportunities to move to other areas as often as a position would be available.
good,"Good Place to work and great benefits"
good,Lots of pressure to make the sales.  No work life balance.  Incredible technology and client centric.
good,the pay at the Amon carter location is low. The on boarding process is difficult when it coms to pay. What's promise is never what's given. To make a decent amount you would have to work a lot of overtime. The calls are back to back which helps the day come by fast but can cause a bit of stress.
good,"Training - the training I received was informal (on the job training and from other contract employees);  The formal training gives you an advantage and you don't have to ask additional questions."
good,"When your manager comes from a different financial institution and begins to make changes that are in-fact ILLEGAL, you know it's time to leave the company.  For example, providing clients guiding questions over the phone to enable them to successfully pass their security questions over the phone is ILLEGAL, yet my manager insisted that I do it and was floored when I told her that it was illegal and I would never do it.  This routine continued for 4 months, while she learned nothing new and showed no growth, at which point I quit due to incompetence."
good,The company is focused more on its own growth rather than the growth and potential development of its own employees. I have worked for better companies.
good,"work well under extreme stress"
good,"Bank of America can be a good place to work if you have a good Manager. I've seen the pressure to cross sell bank products can sometimes lead some people to do some unscrupulous things to attain their goals. Coercing customers to open multiple accounts or obtain bank products because it's good for your goals, and not necessarily for the customer is morally wrong. Banks in general need to reassess ways to maintain profitablilty without touting more fee laden products on the backs of their customers."
good,Typical office set job. handling of up to 30 home loans daily. handling and protecting sensitive customer information. plenty of room for advancement.
good,"2007/2008 was the beginning of the end for Merrill Lynch.  Fee in lieu went away, selling of Bloomberg, Black Rock, auction rate preferred market froze up, bought by BoA to stay solvent.  Have been trying to find their identity since."
good,On the phone all day. Dealing with customers that are irate and aggravated. But the managers and the employees were all cool so that made working there ok.
good,"Like any large bank, BOA is only concerned with how many products per client they can attach.  Sure, they talk a great game about ""providing solutions"", but if you ain't ""providing"" enough ""solutions"", kiss your butt goodbye."
good,The work place culture at Bank of America is relatively well balanced. There seems to be no major problems between colleagues and everyone gets on with their day to day roles.
good,"I enjoyed working here.  Great customers, great employees.  The pay SUCKED.  I left for another company, doing the same exact job and my pay was double what I made here."
good,"Enjoyable being able to help customers with their financial needs. Productive and competitive a lot of contest between employees which made it fun, but a professional environment."
good,"Review new customer records for compliance"
good,"I started with bank of America because I wanted to live close to work, and the bank provided excellent benefits for those who carpool or take alternative means of transportation to work ."
good,"Stay off managers report, they stay off a report and life is good. However, it would also be nice to write a revie of Indeed an how they make you write these reviews."
good,"Bank of America's policies were constantly changing. The corporation seemed to put profits before customers. Moreover, I found some of their policies to be highly unethical, which they had several class action lawsuits filed against them."
good,"Held a variety of position at MBA America (before Bank of America bought them out)."
good,"This review is for a period of time when I was in trust trnsition/project management work.  The organization has changed so my comments which would have been valid in the 1990s may not be valid now.  Overall the management team, located in dallas were very good.  They were supportive yet let me work as I wanted to get the job done with out hanging over my shoulder.  I worked a number a projects and in various locatons.  St. Louis during the boatman's bank acquisition, washington, dc during the sale project of a 40 act investment company and dallas/florida/phoenix/las vegas during other bank acquisitions.  Worked with line staff on investment projects and wrote training and product docuentation"
good,There is not a high level of trust between some coworkers and some members of management.  It was very hard to move up unless you knew the right people.
good,This is one of the best company in the corporate world. There was a good environment. BOFA took care of their employees they provided best security and also they provide more opportunity to learn and develop our skills & experience.
good,Excellent work environment. Management was good in one department but bad in another. Hard to move up if you don't have any experience. A lot of networking organizations.
good,"Benefits are quite good."
good,"It was a good place to work, I was able to get my series 7 license. I was also able to get a comidation letter from CEO of BOA, for helping a client..."
good,Started working at age 18 and stayed 19.5 years.  Absolute growth both professionally and personally.  Enjoyed serving senior management in all areas of job assignments.
good,"Enjoyed my job and the experience I gained but people are just a number, Long term associates are laid off on a regular basis, Loved the PTO availability and bank holidays."
good,Great job stability and flexibility.  I've worked for bank of America for 15 years and have experienced growth opportunities that have helped strengthen the person I've become
good,"I worked for BOA for almost a year . very stressful they wanted the teller to have five referral per day , if you did not meet your daily goal is was added to the next day."

good,Bank of America on of the worlds largest banks. Very fast past working environment. If you are Bilingual it will be a plus. Bank of American is an overall good place to work.
good,"The Manager and the VP were awesome as were the developers I got to work with. Great group with a can do attitude. "
good,I did not like the transition from face to face to computers based...All the company cared about was making more money. I did not like how my raise depended on how well other associates performed
good,great job great pay the hours where nice a lot of great people work for BofA  Have built relationships with employees of BofA that are very helpful and kind
good,I can review this very well as it was a long time ago. I have not worked for the current management or staff. So therefore I can not provide a valid assessment.
good,"Prepared and processed new loans and amendments for part-bought clients."
good,"I have no comment regarding the time I spent at Bank of America and don't really remember my employer/supervisor that well. I worked there when it was transitioning from Bank of Tx., NA."
good,"My previous employer, NationsBank, was bought out by Bank of America.  I was a supervisor over a team of 12 people.  I continued that position with Bank of America until the layoff effective November 1999.  After the merger, it became very tense because we were awaiting the ""ball to drop"" concerning our positions with Bank of America (even though they had assured us that they were not going to close our center).  The work was intense and stressful.  Demands from the transition from one company to the next caused moral and quality of work to suffer.  However, people remained loyal and dedicated to the job.."
good,"My job was outsouced after three months,  was able to ""stay"" only because as managers  we had to off boarded many tenured employees only to be replaced with less experienced individuals"
good,Global approach to rates trading while harnessing the bank large balance sheet and resource through its strong platform and merrill lynch. They defined client Franchise.
good,"work hours were ok , hardest part of job was dealing with customers, bank had strict rules , workplace was fastpace , learned alot about credit cards ,"
good,"Long lines and only two tellers. Not enough staff so you are forced to work 6 days a week and stay after your shift should be over. Instead of hiring more people, they continued to let them go."
good,The Bank of America culture changes depending on the dept you work in and what role you have. They have job security but they lack in career advancement opportunities.

good,"new to position and company, cannot say how the atmosphere is as of yet. Would not be giving a fair assessment of this company..............................................."
good,Very professional place to work.  Always treated fairly.  Company had layoffs.  I was layed off because I was one of the last ones hired.  It was a nice place to work.
good,"Pros"
good,"This has been a difficult position for me. Getting my necessary licenses was challenging, but the the most difficult part has been my struggle to acquire clients with a relatively small social/professional network."
good,"it a good place to work, high sale culture, have to be able to multi task, were different hats all the time, come in early for calls, pre for the day, management is ok, could do more, hardest thing never happy with meeting goals, most enjoyable, helping clients meet there goals."
good,Worked downtown NYC and home on Friday.  Manager and rest of the team was in California so very little interaction or chance to get more involved.  Consultants can only work 18 months max
good,"The hours and the culture was really challenging after 9/11, 2001. Therefore the time at the company was less than ideal. That said, I did make very positive connections and long lasting friendships, due to the bonding of the experience."
good,"When I worked for Merrill Lynch I was at MLIM's, {Merrill Lynch Investment Managers}, corporate campus. Located at 800 scudders mills road in Plainsboro, New Jersey. Which handled investment of 1.5 million and above. This was a position in which I moved up to team leader. Merrill Lynch definitely invested a lot of money into my financial education. While their I began CFA classes on campus nights after work."

good,cannot be treated in fairly way and very stressful working environment. Besides vacation barely break time in work day. No connection between coworkers from each other.
good,Financial Industry tends to be behind in a progressive culture and very political.  It is difficult to grow your career and tends to be more who you know not what.

good,Not the worse place to work at benefits and pay was ok I would recommend to a friend who needed a job management was fair and seemed to have an interest in the employee
good,Quiet atmosphere with tight security. A typical work day is quiet and organized. Management is cordial. Workflow can become a little monotonous. The hardest part of the job is the continuous standing.
good,"It was a good company to work for.  It had a good work/life balance.  In some areas assistants report to an administrative coordinate, which can be a plus or not."

good,A non stressfull work day and I learned to be competitive and assertive and there was nothing hard about the job very enjoyable The people were very pleasent to work with and the supervisors were equally as nice
good,"Lack of defined process and procedures. The work was reactionary and not open to solutions to get ahead of problems that interrupted work flow and effectiveness,"

good,I learned many things with BOA that will help me in the future they have an amazing team with them. they are all very friendly and up to beat. beyond amazing staff members.
good,"Politics, and sterotypical bank culture. Benefits are decent, but you always have to keep your head on a swivel. They promote a culture of 360 degree feedback."
good,"Got to work with great people and immediate upper management was great, upper execute management did not have cohesive plan or direction with business segment."
good,The process took about a month due to weatherNOT MUCH TO TELL THEY PAY YOU DUE TO HIGH STRESS LEVELS. The mgrs were ok however the clients always right no matter what and in this role you have to roll with the punches

good,Its a large company with many departments and employees which can be challenging.  You definitely need to promote yourself in order to gain job growth.
good,"Professionally I grew up at Bank Of America.  It taught me how to connect with people from all walks of life, the value of hard work, team work, accountability and how to manage people. In all how to be a true professional ,an advocate for my clients while maintaining a focus on driving business."
good,I worked only as a Temporary position around the time of tax returns. It was insanely busy and stressful. Very fast paced and had to meet tight deadlines. Hours were not very good and constantly changed.
good,"Management changed and there was no way of knowing, what the managers were going to do in regards to the culture of the organization. The drive to work was 2 hours a day"
good,"Too long ago to remember much about the company. From what I do remember, it was a fair place to work. I was part time and worked with nice people and customers."
good,"I was in the mortgage division, I learned a lot about taxes,escrow, and insurance. It was a great experience. I was also in the escalation department, where I was responsible for resolving any customer complaints."
good,Bank of America is a fast pace job. As a teller we have to perform accurate transactions while making sales and help our customers with their banking needs.
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work.  I made a couple of good friends there that I still have some contact with. If I could have gotten on FTE, I probably would have stayed."
good,"I  worked part- time so I don't really know about benefit and management but co-workers in my department were very nice."
good,The company lost focus on both employees and the customer base. It used to provide individual attention to meet the employee needs and the needs of the customer demographic. The model went to cookie cutter and it was no longer a great place to work.
good,Great company but direct management in mortgage was not connected with the staff and only used punishment to motivate performance.  This isolated the staff and lead to a culture of fear. Overall company is strong and a lot of great opportunities to learn and network.
good,"Not always feel comfortable as a contractor."

good,"Very stressful.  On the phones all day. High stress work load, expectant 100%  grade on all work monthly, accuracy, loan portfolio start to completion of loan in 30 day, but far from reality of 90 day turn time to close loans.  Workplace culture changed dramatically due to high turnover of personnel.  Worked 10 hour plus just to keep work load manageable.  Not all overtime was allowed to be recorded or paid.  Dramatic change in workplace culture when  Bank of America took over Countrywide Home Loans."
good,"a typical day was fun"
good,"I enjoyed my time as a sales and service specialist, but once I was promoted I felt I was not ready for the position I took on. I felt I ws rushed into the promotion without appropriate training."
good,"I was employed with BOA for 9 years.  They have a revolving door and unless you were ""connected' or a favorite there was not room for growth.  It was a great place to start a career but do not get comfortable in one department.  Keep moving around and learn as much as you can so that you are more marketable when you leave."
good,"I was employed by Bank of America from 1985 until 2002.  I held many positions including Teller, Teller Supervisor, Customer Service Representative, Loan Officer, Annuity Representative, Helpline Informational and Support Associate, Reconciling (Check Processing) Representative, Team Captain, Team Leader and Trained new associates.  I left to relocate, in order to care for my seriously ill husband. Customer Focus and Accuracy was always the main concern to strive for."
good,Wealth mgmt is set up with a very client centric approach. Provides banking and lending solutions as well. Can be a collaborative place but you have to find the right people.
good,"Stable, depending on manager you get a lot of support. Lots of benefits and resources at the corporate level. A friendly and collaborative environment that is less cut throat and better work life balance than the rest of the street."
good,With this job you did't run into many issues. So often it was very slow paced. Not much need for problem solving and the energetic drive I have. I did enjoy working with the verity of people. Still not challenging enough for me. I was bored all day every day.
good,"Great compensation and benefits.  Good work life balance, for front line employees. Excellent work culture. The mortgage servicing is currently having large scale layoffs therefore there is no job security."
good,My internship was a great experience. I worked in the records management department of Bank of America as I worked towards an advanced certificate in the field.
good,"While it was a good job, the corporate structure provided little consideration for the human condition.  When they were done with us, they simply laid everyone off."
good,"good place to work. good atmosphere. easy to get along with management. the work is easy, not complicated. simple keying work and you can listen to music while you work."
good,"I only worked there for six months to gain teller experience to work for another bank. But I did enjoy working here, it was fun environment with the coworkers I was with and they were helpful knowing I was coming from being a sales associate in retail tonow dealing with cash handling all day and make referrals. The only hard part I have to say is I wasn't trained well enough on selling products, it was competitive, as a part timer I needed seven referrals a week and a lot of our customer either already had an account or for non members, they didn't like Bank of America at all. But I kept trying my best to gain some experience from it."
good,This was not the right fit for me personally or professionally at the time. Worked here during a stock market crash and merger which effected the majority.
good,"Slow pace and helping hand when available. Management roles were tenured and needed to be more open to suggestions. My 8 year career there was good and I learned a lot about corperate america,"
good,Everything was ok in the department that I worked in there weren't shift options available when I worked there. I think that my manager could use some more training other than that it was ok.
good,Pleasant company to work for. Bank of America 's Management Team respects  employees input. Occasionally new processes introduced prior to being thoroughly tested.
good,"Expect to meet sales goal or be written up. must push products that pop up on screen. "
good,Very large and challenging. Difficult to learn but can be done with hard work.  Environment / people changes often.  A great number of consultants used.
good,"I haven't worked at Bank of America for along time, and effective review of working there 18 years ago would not be productive. Banking in general is a very stark environment."
good,This place is a very fast pace environment that can either make or brake you.  The people you work for and with are very respectful and have a lot of respect for their job.
good,I have worked in the Data processing field for over 15 years and find it to be a good way of learning more about the company and its people and procedure that go alone with it..
good,"shrinking branches and staff like most  big banks, laying off long time employees with a very small severance package.  limiting 1 teller on the teller line."
good,"Strong leadership development established. Need to be self motivated and prepared for continuous change. Staffing can be a challenge. Tremendous opportunity with an array of employment options, but will determine based on experience and location."
good,"I worked in a busy call center environment where we took a wide-range of client services calls, some easy, some difficult. I learned a lot about the banking industry, especially the mass affluent segment (assets between 250,000 and 3 million, although the definition does vary)."
good,"I'm not comfortable providing this information. I believe it to be confidential and proprietary. In general terms, BAC has good departments/managers and not so good departments/managers."
good,the benefits are great. Very easy to get along with other associates  whom do what you do on a daily basis. Need to be complete focus at all times while on the production floor
good,I assisted with collecting on past due balances for 2nd mortgage. Called via auto dialer. Provided other sources of payment to help customers avoid foreclosure.
good,"It's been over 30 years ago that I worked at Merrill Lynch. The company was acquired by Bank of America, so I have no idea what the culture and compensation is like."
good,"If you do not fit into the corporate culture you will never move up. very clickish, political  Management tends only look out for friends and family and themselves"
good,The most difficult part of the job was the extremely fast pace of the call center.  We would just cycle through phone calls continuously with no space to deviate from the scripts that were given to us during orientation.
good,decent place to work closed the divison after mortgages crisis .. nice building outside underwriting was tough to get through... most were in  kansas city
good,"Advanced my career by working in the Risk area. This allowed to better understand complex strategies to the financial industry. Also, I was working on a project whose life cycle was winding down. I did not see many opportunities at Merrill Lynch at that time."
good,"but definitely stressful at times as well as fast paced. "
good,Very large company with the workplace challenges that come with that. Lots of structure and somewhat of a top down management style. Marketing support is quite good.
good,"Sorting incoming mail"
good,"The bank has one major goal and that was to add on products and services to every client, this was accepted by some clients but produced little customer service."
good,training was awsome but when you got on the job the upper leaders were like little high school students if you were a contractor...if you were a contractor they let it be known
good,I enjoyed the years that I worked at Bank of America mortgage.  Loved my manager and co-workers were great.  Good atmosphere as long as you performed your job.
good,A temporary job which offered me the experienced to advance my work experience and job reliability in an  industry which is very  competitive and to advance my skills to there best abilities  but will get you ready to advance yourself when ready to make yourself ready fore  more difficult tasks a very good learning environment
good,"BofA has tons of departments all across the country.  The pay is below average, but their demand for performance is 200% what you're getting paid.  It's a fit for some but not others."
good,"This role is 100% sales.  The training is medicore and could use a lot of improvement.  In this role, you need to put on your sales hat every second.  It's not much of a financial advisor role, rather someone to show customers what direction to go."
good,"worked for a local communitiy bank, which got bought over by  natwest bank, culture good at both banks worked there too many years ago so all good there."
good,As a teller I handled cash as well as try to upgrade and customers account based on the things they already had. it was quick paced and I got to meet new people every week.
good,"i love my job , and it was very  hard for me to leave something that you enjoy it  "
good,"As you enter you are greeted with customers who do not seem happy about the wait. You know you are going to be apart of helping the line shorten and that's it. If you cannot keep cool, I suggest you not work here. Customers are entitled and seem to forget about all rules. They expect everything to be free. Management is very poor. They just sit and write emails to other bankers and pretend to be working. Everything seems to be done last minute. The managers usually don't back their tellers up if there is a discrepancy."
good,I gave a rating of 3 because it all depends upon which department you work for. I was lucky and had a really great manage and worked with some wonderful teams.
good,"Good work environment...good benefits and culture..management depends on what department you are working in..some good good, some really bad.it is competitive"
good,If you have the ability to adjust to an ever changing environment and able to work wit little to no supervision then I would say this area is for you.  Must be able to analyze and reason out job function usually with little guidance.
good,If you enjoy the fast pace of a call center environment then the would be an excellent place to start your over all knowledge of back office operations.
good,Goals are unrealistic. Emotionally draining job. Managers expect a lot from you. 10 week training is very long. Not that many people succeed from being an RM.
good,"Once they took over MBNA, I had to sit on pins and needles knowing that it was just a short matter of time before my job was eliminated. This was very stressful."
good,"I learn a lot from a teller to personal Banker "
good,poor leadership and management does not like people who worked outside the office.  helpdesk was understaff and sla was below satisfactory.  overall I would not recommend working as helpdesk technician
good,"It was a great work place. Very open and professional. Fun oriented. I enjoyed my peers and teammates. If the opportunity presented itself, I would like to work there again."
good,Irrelevant information on my search for a new position. Would like to proceed with finishing all info needed in order to start looking for a new career.
good,"This was a staffing company position and not an internal one. Hard to rate or make any opinions, they paid low but had ok benefits. Great if you are starting the industry but that's about all I know."
good,got job just prior to 9-11 and we were all laid off after 9-11. don't have a lot to say since the job just ended before i really had a chance to do it.
good,"closed down the whole division during the banking crisis because they couldn't afford us but 6 months later gave the horrible CEO a $50,000,000 bonus!"
good,I decided that a life balance is more important.  The workplace culture is one to be desired.  Management could benefit in skill set training in the area of communication.
good,"fast paced, stressful coping up with strict deadlines and stakeholders requirements. Company was huge but has excellent benefits program for its employees. Upward mobility is achievable but you have to really work hard and to deserve it."
good,"Good place to work, but heavy on politics, but moral and company.  Needs to be reengineered, but momentum is very great, so despite problems the company will be around for a while.  Very much laying off everyone and hiring contractors or outsourcing jobs."
good,"The digital world promises consumers a better, more connected life, and we’re the ones delivering it. We make it possible for people to stay in touch and businesses to connect with their customers. We’re also bringing technology and hands-on learning opportunities directly to kids who need it most. Our goal is to inspire tomorrow’s creators to use technology to build brighter futures for themselves, their families and the world."
good,my typical day at work would be getting breakfast with my peers talk about what happen the night before and making sure  they were in good sprits for the day. After that back to business needs and what they needed to preform their daily job. I  tired to make it comfortable for feed back and to inform them we are working as team so we sound be understandings and respectful of are peer .
good,"We are guided by a common purpose, to help make financial lives better by connecting those we serve with the resources they need to be successful. Our purpose and values form the foundation of our culture — a culture that is rooted in accountability, disciplined risk management, and delivering together as a team to better serve our clients, strengthen our communities, and deliver value to our shareholders. This all comes together as an engine for responsible growth."
good,"I find it frustrating how many hoops have to be jumped through to get things done. Very locked down environment, development tends to move at a snails pace."
good,"One of the more reasonable banks to work for in Charlotte NC with technology innovations due to pressure from competitors. That is, it becomes interesting when the bank needs to follow the market which sparks interesting projects."
good,"Low pay tedious day to day I did not get much out of the kay,situation because we were hired as temps and when the offer for full time employment came around they pay was decreased significantly without the employees consent I think that was a bad move for moral because a lot of us started looking for other opportunities after that. If they were to offer us more pay or at least benefits that were comparable to the pay then they would have had a better chance of keeping the staff that had proven themselves time after time at that point. In the future i would like to join a company that really invests in its staff growth and development."
good,It was a very fast paced workplace. The benefits were also great. It was a little stressful and challenging but it only helped me grow. I enjoyed working here and I loved their gym!
good,"Stress some time when dealing with typical customers via phone call.  Satisfy customers is priority.  Responsible for job assignments."
good,"Change is necessary, I just found the environment to be stressful. All positions may not be the same, but trying to recover from regulation violations is not easy."
good,Working part-time worked great while raising a family. Bank of America met our needs and I enjoyed working as a Senior Cash Handler for Bank of America's Vault which was not known to the public.
good,Working in the private bank has few opportunities for advancement. Culture is lacking and is VERY risk adverse. Has good platform for clients but conflicts at the advisor compensation level mean that certain better options not presented.
good,"bank of america is going digital, they are very high spirited. Also there a quota. Management is great customers are also one of a kind. you'll learn a lot on your first day."
good,I would call on clients and prospects to meet them and offer our products and services.  I would travel to training events and prospective meetings with clients and prospects to do business with them.
good,Bank of America is a wonderful company. It is especially great for resume building. The company is very flexible if you are a college student and they are very supportive.
good,"Supported computer users. Imaged new computers and laptops, Encrypted computers and laptops, supported printers, supported software.  Worked with range of users from management to interns."
good,"Buen compañerismo,descuentos en café y comida de comedor, seguro medíco"
good,I was promoted to this department from my initial job. My job duties involved receiving inbound customer calls and assisting customers with account and online banking problems they were having. I enjoyed helping customers to get their problems resolved and was good at my position. My department management was inconsistent in providing assistance and allowing job growth. The hardest aspect of the job was that you took constant calls all day without any break between calls. It was a very stressful work environment and performance metrics constantly changed making it difficult to reach exceeds performance recognition from month to month. I enjoyed the people I worked with and learned a lot about small business customer practices.
good,"I learned how to work on a Teradata database, and also brushed up on my SQL querying skills as we had to write complex SQL quiries on a daily basis.  All in all a good place to work."
good,"In my position as Relationship Manager for Bank of America, I assisted and developed trust with people of diverse backgrounds.  This career has been highly collaborative, consistently working with my peers to achieve greater levels of success and communication.  In this role, I was responsible for addressing the financial wellness of my clients.  I was also the primary Spanish speaking associate in the bank for over 4 years, and my clients were satisfied with my level of proficiency.  During my tenure, I helped consumers and small businesses protect their accounts, save, ensure strength of credit, and support their families. The banking industry has changed vastly in my 7 years working in this field and so I have always adapted with information system updates, procedural changes, and client contact approach.  I have exemplar communication skills, used with my coworkers, superiors, and clients.  I always approach tasks with an open mind and open heart; helping my fellow community is a passion of mine."
good,Bank of America is a Fast paced environment. They will keep you very busy and the company is extremely competitive. If you have that type of competitive spirit then definitely this company is for you.
good,"Very good company to create a career. It is a world class customer service company, respectful  environment, it is a big family you end up spending more time than with your own."
good,Upper management was very hard to work with. My managers were deficient in team leadership and knowledge. Some managers knew what they were doing as others surely did not simply because lack of computer knowledge. Working closely with my peers/ coworkers was the most important resource as a new employee for myself. Also I really enjoyed the diversity groups inside of BOA. Those are really helpful to network and meet different people throughout your facility.
good,The level of micro management in this company is truly remarkable. I have never worked for a company so dedicated to wasting time with conference a daily check ins. I have worked in corporate company for almost ten years. The level that higher ups require you to operate a Financial Center and the Head count that they give you is so unbalanced.
good,The Manager was always willing to allow the contractor to participate in some of the activities the the FTE's were enjoying. She would often pay us for holidays that the Agency did not pay for. Allow us to leave early with pay to enjoy community activities that the Bank was involved in.
good,loved my co workers customers are brutal here very mean got to kill em with kindness sucks the company doesnt offer any over time but other than that it was okay if you take things personal i dont reccomend you working at this company
good,"Nice place to work, fair and diverse.  Not too political, people know their jobs.  Excellent commute.  Remote access is a plus. Hardest part of job was conference calling.  Very hard to hear and digest from the many different sources of information on the call."
good,Bank of America conducts their business fairly in regards to employees. Wages and benefits were comparable to the market. Management worked well with staff.
good,You are constantly dealing with people and are responsible for handling a lot of money on a daily basis. Must work well with others and be very personable.
good,"I worked for 6 months at bank of america,I felt that i didnt have much freedom to learn new technologies, too much process. "
good,Very long work hours with no compensation for the extra work hours.  Inconvenient work location in Southern New Jersey.  Work from home option only available on certain groups.
good,Typical sys admin role.  Forcing me to right this review before I can continue is very frustrating.  I do not agree with this policy and would hope you will change it.
good,"I thrive in a busy work environment . Not only can I handle client customer service, teller line and lobby managment , I also maintain positive attitude towards my clients and my team."
good,It has really been a long time ago since i have worked there and am therefor not qualified to provide an accurate assessment of the current work environment.
good,Between there being so many regulations and rules you can be fired for that no one employee can tell you all of them. To the question you are judged on in the survey asks what the customer thinks of the bank and does not mention the rep who helped them at all. It is very easy to lose your job and management did not seem to care about that. When I left most of the veteran employees had left already.
good,"Bank of America grew through combining many different organizations, through mergers and acquisitions, which created a rich culture of workers around the globe."
good,"Things have changed from the BOA, since I came back some good things has been added . The part I like is they allow you to growth by providing on-line training, cross training in other departments."
good,"This was a competitive atmosphere, often with people being rewarded with promotion only upon finding another job offer elsewhere.  Most employees did not feel appreciated."
good,"Adecco was a contracting firm who placed me at Bank of America's FHA loan processing department. Although the environment was relaxed, they had an area of opportunity in continued training and development to ensure the expectations were continuously met. In spite of that area of opportunity, I enjoyed working there for the duration of that contract assignment."
good,"This department worked thru third party vendors. The people were great to work with, the system and quota were somewhat unrealistic, after is filtered down to the actual operators."
good,Very political and hard to advance.  Management competency varies by division.  One person can hold you back.  Great benefits and vacation.  Not great for older workers.
good,"A large corporation is in an of itself a microcosm of society. There are areas where process and technology is impressive, teams that function well perform well. Individuals that are removed tend to drift, and social as well as competency in area of expertise is what sets people apart. "
good,there are some great associates that work for and with the bank.  my position included a lot of reporting and system testing which I enjoyed.  associates were willing to assist or would take care of the situation
good,Worked long hours and sometimes had to stay after closing to attend meetings and trainings. had to work every Saturday. Position was salary and turned out to be worse in pay because of the long hours.
good,"Job was good. Good pay, some good people. I would recommend someone to work here if applicable. Great job security. This company is a good company to work for"
good,"Bank of America was a very fast pace, fun loving place of employment. Many areas of growth and development. However the area in which I worked has been closed down for a few years."
good,"Typical Work/Life Balance"
good,The work environment varied according to the job. Some departments were very stressful to work in due to quotas. Other departments were less stressful due to not having a quota
good,"I used to work as a Client service Representative (Teller) for BofA, I learned how to be a good listener. They have good management system. A typical day at work was boring. I had to do the same transaction at least 50 times a day. I felt I was not learning something new, that's why I decided to leave."
good,"Worked from 8 to 5pm. Workplace was enjoyable, everyone had a positive and helpful attitude. I enjoyed my time in Bank of the West, and everyone can learn for them."
good,I learned a lot about mortgage handling escrow  and mortgage payment issues also how property claims work.I received 50 to 100 calls daily regarding these issues. The management support at BOA was severely lacking. The hardest part of the job was moving to the property claims department. The bank would receive the insurance claim for the home damage due to the outstanding loan. There are many guidelines set up  for funds to be released( to protect the banks investment ) which was frustrating to the clients trying to fix there home. Many would ask for a supervisor. The managers I would have to wait about 45 minutes for a manager. Then have to explain the banks policy and walk them through the call. I did have some nice co workers and the company also had a quite room to relax in during breaks.
good,"The bank has it's pros and cons. So far my experience at Bank of America has been positive. "
good,Numbers are the most important part of the job to management.  Majority of time is spent on opening new accounts and not on taking care of customers needs.
good,"I prefer not to provide a review on Bank of America.  The bank has it's pros and cons.  My overall experience was great.  However, like all companies, there are always things that can be improved when it comes to policies and procedures."
good,It has been several years since I worked at BofA and I cannot accurately rate/review this institution. I would imagine the company and culture has changed significantly over the years.
good,"managed office in Moorpark Ca, managing day to day bank operation including making sure branch was hitting all metrics in sales & service, also it was my responsibility to bring in new clients to the bank by holding financial workshops, community mixers and mortgage classes"
good,"Highly political environment. All business decisions had office politics involvement. I learned a lot about stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. Good people. The Firm does take care of their employees but has no problem laying people off during bad times."
good,"Things have changed from the BOA, since I came back some good things has been added . The part I like is they allow you to growth by providing on-line training, cross training in other departments."
good,"management was not helpful, asked to do job duties that we where not paid for. always worried if we would be laid off. pay was not accurate with we where asked to complete"
good,"Impossible to get even simple things done in technical roles. Also, I don't appreciate Indeed forcing me to give a review of this position. Unusual to have something anonymous that is required."
good,BOA was a decent place to work.  Had a few work culture and management issues but the people overall were pleasant.  After leaving BOA for another bank I realized that BOA was a decent place to work with fair pay.
good,It was extremely stressful but you do have oppurtunities to advance if you want. That's probably because a lot of positions go vacant since workers are stressed.
good,"Salary in line with mkt"
good,"Co-workers and supervisors were great, however there was so much shift at the top level, lay-offs and downsizing happened quite a bit; entire departments disappeared overnight."
good,"It was a stressful, but a fun place to work. I learned the ins and outs of banking and also got a chance to meet a lot of interesting people from all over the world."
good,"We serviced over 2.1 Million loans and we, 47,000 of us, were laid off for our effort. While I liked working there I was surprised we were all laid off because we were advised we would be transferred into different positions. I do miss working there, there are very good people at the bank and I did enjoy my time there."
good,The duties in my role vary daily.  This position requires a lot of different software knowledge and expertise in time management.  The co workers and management are great.
good,Management is not the best and it is difficult to move up unless you know someone. In my case manager did not understand what job I did or how to work cases that I had.
good,Bank of America is a good place to work.  Many benefits and discounts for the employees.   I would recommend the entry level positions of the Customer Service Representative.  There is detailed training for this position
good,Working at boa was a typical day at work. You go to work do your job and go home.  Management didn't make a big fuss but was always respectful to their employees.
good,"This is a great company to work for,  However they are closing many corporate offices that are local to all around in the Ft. Worth area.  In order to continue working with this company in my field would consist of travel out of the area."
good,"Can be stressful but if you put the time in you will be compensated, the hours are pretty good. depending on where you work, youll have a good team. just be positive and dont take no for an answer."
good,Lots of pressure on performance and micromanagement is the rule of the land. Very little room for personal input. Great people working there and convivial atmosphere.
good,"Honestly the pay was very good but was very competitive and after the buyout from bank of america most of us got laid off, dont know if i would recommend this place"
good,great place to work . you can make money here long hr great time off good office. great location  good team and manager . they will look out for the team.
good,Bank of America is a nice environment to work at. The employees and management team are like family. They are big recognizing on their employees. We work together to accomplish our goal.
good,Very intense high volume extremely busy atmosphere.  Strong corporate structure and culture.  High volume of customer fraud calls.  The hardest part of the job is conversing with angry customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is also servicing the customers.
good,"BoA/ML is a fun, fast paced place to work. A typical day at work involves lots of meetings with different project teams- reason being no one has just one project at any given time. On average, each contractor has at least 6 projects they are working on, depending on the department they are working in. I have been in the Core Enhancement Team, which deals with enhancing systems based on requirements and regulations. Some of the most recent enhancements that have had to be implemented were to do with the Department of Labor and FINRA rules, which in total had about 70 projects sprout from them. I was involved in just a handful of them- about 10. This meant learning a lot on financial rules, researching on what regulations needed to be put in place and how our clients would be impacted- whether directly or indirectly."
good,Bank Of America was a great place to work and teamwork was great. Wonderful hours no one was better than there counter part. I learned new process and procedures. management was helpful.
good,Pay is ok but the workload is heavy and often have to put in extra hours without overtime pay to keep up with the work. Management is great though and get to work from home one day a week.
good,BOA provides both banking services and products for personal and business customers. Bank of America was founded in 1874 and based out of North Carolina. Locations world wide.
good,"it was great big bank.. was really happy when i got the job leant alot in that era... lack of management lack of staff suffered alot but did not give up ... "
good,I would prefer not to provide any review at this time. I was a consultant working on a contract with Merrill Lynch and therefore limited direct interaction withmanagement
good,Operated like most call centers.  Change was always constant.  Pressure was always high.  Threshholds to bonuses were always increased.  Lots of shifting around and would have a new manager every couple months.
good,"A typical day of work would be checking the system for appraisals, calling clients for loan paperwork and bank statements, and opening escrow accounts with title companies."
good,"There is no typical day at work.  New problems and issues arise each day.  I have to scramble to find solutions for our clients and put out their 'fires."""
good,Bank of America is great depending on who your manger is.  The goals are outrageous and totally unattainable but the people at the branch are so fun to work with.
good,Overall good place to work.  Lots of changes going on and lots of layoffs.  Would of liked to have found another job and be able to stay with the company but....didn't work out
good,I was an employee because the acquired my prior company.  If it had been my choice I would have stayed with the original company.  They do have a lot of opportunities.
good,"Balanced Tellers and ATM’s, utilizing the Teller Journal and Interchanges.  Interacted with Banking Centers to help resolve and reduce reoccurrences of various issues."
good,"Managers provide good support, it is difficult to balance work-family life due the long hours at my area.  I am sure it may be different depending on the specific area you work for."
good,"Each day, I checked the equipment for functionality, then checked my computer for scheduled customer appointments for the day. I learned to wear may different hats from opening the branch balancing it. I received support from management when needed. The work culture as a bit too driven. Hardest part of the position was finding ways to produce the weekly sales goals. The most enjoyable pert of the job was the friendships I established."
good,"It was a good environment to work in and they had a lot of employee development options.It's been a long time since I worked there, but I left because I lost interest in the financial industry."
good,"It is a great company to work for. There are a few things that needs improvement such as job advancement, job security, more pay, and more opportunity for growth based on your skill set, not because of who you know solely."
good,"Merrill Edge is a good place to start a career but it is not meant for long term. Coming in they give 120 days to pass the series 7 and series 66. After passing exams they put you through a couple weeks of training and then you are live on the phone. It does have ""call center"" atmosphere to it and must be on the phone for a majority of the day. Frequently micro-managed"
good,"Initially hired as an entry-level teller; promoted quickly. Continually rewarded for job performance and exceptional customer service. Supervised tellers, scheduled work hours, resolved conflicts and advised upper management of employee development and performance. Oversaw all the operational activities including completing monthly audits, documenting findings, coaching individuals towards immediate operational and sales improvement."
good,Had good time working at this company. I was working as a contractor for project. I am not sure about the benefits personally but heard they are okay from my teammates who worked full time for a long time.
good,"The company itself is a good company to start with. You get the typical starting salary and above average benefits. However, advancement is not a progressive nor is it clear. What you think you may be qualified for you actually wouldn't be. Taking promotions isn't really a thing. They are minor pay increases and sometimes even for less work. If you want to move up in the company, it's not something you can do, especially with compensation. In your 4 years you may see a 10% increase."
good,The people you may work for at boa are great but when it comes to corporate you will be in for a terrible time. maybe one day they will care to take care of there own instead of the big wigs
good,"Again, hard to remember since it's been so long, but i do now that it was a professional and happy atmosphere. I did enjoy working here and i think the pay was decent"
good,"-it was a great way to learn to sale products"
good,Technology was a bit outdated.  Communication from upper management could be better.  Some branches needed renovations.  Didn't feel that I had enough support to do my job.
good,"this is the job over all, just got customer payments, and keyed them into customer account. balanced with computer at the end of the day. same thing, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week."
good,"very busy day."
good,"Bank of America was a great learning experience into the financial and banking world.  Though advancement was slow in some cases, 90 percent of the promotions were in house promotions."
good,This is an large corporate bank with many job openings. The job it typical and what you make of it. Banking hours are a plus.  Not a lot of challenge involved in the job.
good,BofA was my first banking job. It was a fast paced environment but I enjoyed it because it was challenging but I also enjoyed helping others and the ability to sell products and services to the clients was exciting and challenging which I enjoyed very much.
good,"I have been given many opportunities to learn, you can expand your career if you are in a line of business that is expanding. Groups that are reducing will try to fill other roles that are needed within the company."
good,Over all it's a good company. There's a lot of things they can fix in the terms of helping out their employees a little more and having an easier way of reaching out to them
good,This company is forever changing. If you cannot adapt to change ... You will not last here.  Management frown on change resistance.  If you are a hard worker. You will be acknowledged.
good,"Extremely competitive job, You will be stressed, coached once a day and pushed to make sales whenever possible. Keep in mind your and your boss' check depends on you and the other tellers successful sales."
good,"not much of a place to work since it is a large banking business, in the past few years, the bank has paid out to the government  penalty fees for breaking good business practices and good business law."
good,"This job was a temporary job.  The managers did not do a great job of training, therefore I felt the job was difficult and help from management was not available."
good,"I enjoyed the company. I would recommend to others. good sales environment. good management. good job duties. nice office. I would go back, good job opportunity."
good,"OK company. Management is strict and a lot of pressure for in-branch positions. I would not suggest that anyone can work at B of A."
good,"BofA is very good for stability and internal transfers.  However, layoffs are sometimes experienced.  Very unpredictable and unstable.  BofA is always reducing staff."
good,I started out working for a team leader who was very well organized and focused on the immediate goals.  He left for a better education and potentially better job opportunities. I ended up with lot of erratic job assignments  I would either work 50-60 hours a week with hi levels of stress and short deadlines or I would have times of little or no work.  It would have been nice to have a level work load.
good,I wasn't challenged nor kept busy enough. the place was a good place to work; however the commute became too much. they hired too many people and then had to let them go.
good,"In the beginning it was a great experience but when the market changed it became completely unpredictable layoffs, pay cuts and changing positions. Towards the end I couldn't wait to leave."
good,"The pros of working in my department is the exposure you gain to onboarding, off-boarding, defects, remediations, kyc, customer communications and Sales communications all under the same title. "
good,I did not enjoy working for this company there is way to much of a focus on sales and not on the customers needs. Fees that can be avoided are rarely talked about
good,primary issue I found was that no one was in control of company strategy or overall direction.  mid managers were scared for their jobs and unable to make decisions without approval from above nor courage to do the right thing. duplicated jobs all across the enterprise. many processes not defined or changed on daily basis.  constantly changing priorities like toddlers with attention deficit disorder.  people worked in silos without knowing what was going on with their neighbor who was probably doing a duplicated job right next door. constant confusion on direction.
good,"It is an okay place to work at. Typical work culture in a financial firm. The people in my team are nice, although firm wide culture can be somewhat rigid"
good,Ienjoyed working in the Remittance Procesing department.  Very fast-paced and the managers always promoted within the department.  Great benefits and employee discounts.
good,Bank of America is a good place to work especially for an individual starting out in the financial services industry.  They provide excellent training in all aspects of the industry.
good,"No support to grow and develop"
good,I found the culture at Bank of America to be less personal than US Bank. I was just beginning my career in banking though and was much younger. I believe it was a good place to start as a teller and I learned the basics.
good,Bank of America is a great place to work in general.  The company is very client focused. Great health benefits and company discounts. Management believes in giving people an opportunity.
good,Work/life balance is an issue. The hours are very long and days off are hard to come by. Upper management is helpful and available. Compensation package is good for management.
good,good work culture to work in. I learned about where I could of seen my future working there but the bank did not offered any full time positions. so I had to move on.
good,Good place to work if you are coming in from a different company. Once you are in the pay increases or disappointing. Very stressful due to goals and upper management micromanaging every move. Decent work/life balance and flexible with scheduling.
good,It was a great company to work for but the only thing that made me look for better opportunity was the reason that it was very overwhelming and you needed to meet each month number and the management was there but wouldn't have to help and if they did it would be with a bad attitude.
good,"The project implementation structure was extremely sound.  This includes organizations, talent and processes."
good,"Bank of America as a company is terrific. The job itself, is not. Your workload is constantly increased but your salary remains the same. Management spends more time talking to each other and in ""meetings"" then helping associates. Many are fired at customers request. Advancement is very difficult and any excuse is given to avoid the conversation as to why. Most of the people you work with are great, but due to a high turnover, it's hard to make friends. Very stressful job, which is sad as the company itself is truly great."
good,"It is a ok place to work. Once someone doesn't like you it is very hard to undo the reputation especially if your work ethic shows you are valued associate. No matter how hard you try, they have there favorites and do not compensate for your worth."
good,Bank of America is a good place to work. Provides great benefits and job security as well as coaching to ensure you are successful in you position.Better compensation package and more advancement opportunities would improve moral of employees and make this an even better workplace.
good,"This company will do anything to earn a buck. So competitive, associates are forced to do unethical things with clients and their accounts. Everyone is replaceable."
good,I would say that If you were close to the management you seems to get preferencial treatment. I see that on the everyday interactions between staff. It's ok to work just don't stay too long
good,I was a contractor who was placed at Bank of America.  So in reality Bank of America  was not my employer.  It was very fast paced  in the beginning but then a lot of people got hired and most days there were only a few of hours of work even though you needed to stay for the duration.
good,Bank of america was cool. paid me well while i was in college. but i had to leave because of school. dont miss interacting with rude customers face to face though.
good,"not really a career job,  was a victim of a bank robbery.  Worst experience I ever had in a job, not to mention it was my first day on the job!  Managers only watched out for themselves."
good,"Getting to work on time going there with a open mind willing to learn new thing being a team player, the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing  I was able to put a smile on someone face. The hardest part about my job is not able to finish a task that I may have started"
good,We offer a wonderful schedule if you like four days on three days off you receive an hour launch nice cafeteria good food I have a gym on site they have weekly team meetings monthly floor meetings great benefits
good,Great company to get your feet wet and make a career home with.  Solid bonus structure and aggressive peers to keep you motivated to move up.  The sky's the limit mentality.   What you put in will be what you get.
good,This was my first call center job. It overwhelmed me with the irate people that called in. We assisted people with setting up a payment plan to correct their negative balances on their personal accounts.
good,"Good place to work and good startup program.  The only reason I left was because they changed the minimum balance for a household from $50,000 to $250,000.  This made the job too difficult for my particular location and had to seek employment elsewhere."
good,"Part time position. Great area, but not enough hours. Caters to seniority and advancement took to long. Pay needed to be more due to the job duties. Great company!"
good,"Good work life balance, Nice growth opportunities, great benefits, Challenging work Easy access to leaderhip, allows creative and out of the box thinking"
good,The job was not very challenging and found it repetitions. It involved a lot of customer service. I did like that I learned about FEMA regulations in regards to flood insurance.
good,"Bank Of America is in no way a bad place to work, but isn't easy. The pay is good, but I had several issues with my insurance through there and there is a lack of communication with many many things within the workplace."
good,Good Place to work. People are nice and welcoming. Management is always willing to help. Learned a lot of interesting skills. Training process is helpful.
good,Bank of America is a great place to work. Relocating to Mississippi is the reason for resigning. I also worked in credit card and collections. A Lot of opportunity for advancement
good,Bank of America is an overall good company to work for. The pay is not well and the room for advancement is little to none. The company does have a good sense of work life balance by providing 3 weeks of vacation and 2 weeks of sick time for employees with the company at least 5 years.
good,"The professional ethics of the company seems to extend a cut-throat, impersonal persona. There's no truth or accountability. Fail to show appreciation for the efforts given to satisfy the external customer and administrative internal customer. Pay me fairly !!!"
good,"Huge company located all over the world. Number of different departments on site- room for growth and advancement. Great diversity, everyone is treated equally. Very well organized and structured new hire training."
good,"A typical day would include reviewing customer accounts and issuesing debit cards... all day... "
good,I worked there for a couple years as a financial advisor and although I learned some good things I also learned that the system wasn't very conducive to a great client/advisor relationship
good,"Ok Place to work. This is a typical large firm where you can coast along, but if you are ambitious and want to put in the hard work  to advance in your career, you will find it a little slow moving to your liking."
good,i really liked this job  the people were direct about instructions there was not alot of playtime. they were fair to all employees everyone was treated equal
good,I have worked in various departments. One of them was CANDLING. Over there we have to check for the relevant documents which were missed by the previous departments eg. checks and other tax related documents.
good,"Overworked for the salary you receive"
good,The company wanted temp workers to donate to a charity were poor temp employees. Finished the job no travel close to home. Had to lift heavy file boxes.
good,The company I worked for was acquired by Bank of America. Bank of America did not keep the same bonus structure that we were used to and instead of paying bonuses changed to gift cards and spirit points.  Bills cannot be paid with gift cards and spirit points.
good,"Good Bank, as its an MNC, but the Branches work environment is not that good. The Mangers are helpful. Perks and incentive structures are very good. Process is also very good."
good,"Overall good company however, Company culture changed for the worst. No longer feel as strongly about them being a worthy organization. Overall great training provided"
good,My position with Bank of America requires a very driven self sourced employee.  Management is very helpful and there with any support needed.  Typical work day includes generating own business with cold calling and warm leads along with maintaining current loans in pipeline.
good,"Enjoyed working with Bank of America and would go back if opportunity was made available. Lots of outsourcing while I was there, to the point my job was moved to texas, but i was not given opportunity."
good,I haven't work there in over 15 years.  I am not a good reference positively or negatively for the company as their practices may have change dramatically.
good,Staff was very helpful and always kept you trained regarding updates to policies and procedures that impact your specific department and corresponding departments. Great benefit package and other benefit options that many other companies do not offer.
good,management changes almost every 6 months not very stable. Goals are attainable you can exceed them just have to be consistent and work closely with tellers.
good,Always willing to work with your schedule. The management team goes above and beyond in investing time into its employees to assist in position knowledge and growth within.
good,Good company to work for. very good teammates and helped make sure customer cards were printed according to company quality guidelines. Not bad benefits. Thanks
good,The company is great! Management was very supportive of new ideas and always open to chat. The only downside is that moving up in the company was extremely hard because there weren't many options.
good,"Productive and fun workplace with table tennis table"
good,"Good company to work for, but customer service/ collections was stressful. "
good,Typical day was busy and on-going. Filled with different ethnic backgrounds. Learned how to deal with different customer service issues. Learned to speak spanish
good,There are a lot of departments at this job and so there is a good potential for growth. The management team provides coaching sessions to help us when we are not meeting our targets.
good,"High earnings, potential, stressful, favoritism, micro management, favoritism amongst banker and management, solid vacation time, decent benefits, lack of support"
good,"The job was very repetitious. Customers would get upset with you if they bounced a check. Had to sell products also. Had certain goals to obtain. Had to deal with alot of money, but paid very little."
good,You will probably not receive better Financial Advisor training in the industry than what is offered by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Completing the PMD program will open many doors for future career opportunities.
good,"Huge company that focuses more on a ""cog in the wheel"" philosophy, independent thinking and learning is discouraged. you can learn alot and use this place as a great springboard"
good,Loved the job. Did not like the assistant manager. Absolutely LOVE the branch manager. Customer was okay. Did not really enjoy having to work every Saturday.
good,"I've been in banking for sometime and depending on the role,you can definitely be well compensated. The culture doesn't allow for quick  change or suggestions to management."
good,"Very good benefits if you get in. Fair opportunities to advance. They did multiple layoffs, then later re-hired workers when needed, and lay them off again down the line depending on work conditions. Unstable and stressful to the ones hoping for a stable job only to get let go."
good,"Stable, depending on manager you get a lot of support. Lots of benefits and resources at the corporate level. A friendly and collaborative environment that is less cut throat and better work life balance than the rest of the street."
good,enjoyed the time here it was a great company awesome atmosphere great managers great employees during the duration of the time working here no complaints at all
good,"I'm not going to give a review, I do not feel this would be confidential.  A typical work day is stressful and fast paced.  Not complaining.  I like fast paced.  The hardest part of the job would be managers that are very biased.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others."
good,Great place to work! Company is committed to its employees and recognizes them as a valuable part of the companies success! Company has frequent layoffs and downsizing.
good,"Good Company; decent benefits; pay was not the best but not the worst. Great culture."
good,"I enjoyed the diversity, the work was a little off beat and unorganized but with the right team members you can make it work.  I have no bad feelings about the company."
good,You can learn and grow here. Its a large  bank and you can move around within the company. Plenty of job growth great place to start your career. I gained many skills working here.
good,"Calls every day , twice a day , work load is not easy to handle . Burned out team members looking for a different position all the time . Start working 6 years ago as a part time teller , moving  up is easy ,but as you moving up , pay rate is almost the same ."
good,I worked at Merrill Lynch prior to the merger with Bank of America and shortly thereafter.  The work environment at the merger was very strained and stressful.
good,"Ban of america is a terrible company to work for. The call center sucks. The metrics are nearly impossible to meet, and the hours suck. However the people are great to work with."
good,"Bank of America was a fun place to work at first, then it got stressful, and closed the call center we worked at. Some managers there, shouldn't be managers, they got their promotions from being friends with the higher ups.."
good,There are plenty of diffrent things you can do while working there. You can learn from alot of people.  Good place to learn about banking industry and finance.
good,Learn many new things at Bank of America. There were many departments which if you the more option to grow and move up within the company. It was a good environment.
good,OK place to work if you have the right people around you that's willing to help solve major problems a without delay. Most people are not self starter are refuse to maintain a good work effort; which causes extra work for others around them when you everyone should be a team in the same department.
good,Good environment but could get stocked in the same position if management doesn't like you. Good salary but the really make you work for you to get your bonus due to very unrealistic goals.
good,"One of the most pushy commercial banks, you are required to meet irrational goals every quarter of the year. Economy has changed and they are not aware of it yet!!! people do not want the products offer by banks anymore."
good,"A highly professional, client centered, compliance based environment committed to excellence through service and education. Excellent training resources available."
good,"Its a huge company,  give you the opportunity to  learn about a lot of things, and accelerate  your experiences due the bigger environments that we support"
good,I have been working here for almost 8 months and I think BOFA is a good company to work for if you are looking for a part-time job. They even have health insurance and 401k for part-time employees.
good,"Was a great job for my age at the time but after being promised promotions that never came time and time again, the amount of effort i put into the job began to fade away."
good,"Provide sufficient information to allow for an efficient, profitable, transaction that meets the client's needs and objectives, as well as CarMax standards for quality and integrity."
good,The company is great. The benefits and pay are beneficial.  The work environment is safe and fun. The employees are motivating and compassionate.  The hours are perfect.
good,Average workplace environment.  Communication of job expectations are not clear at times.  No room for advancement within line of business and difficult to post out to new positions in other departments.
good,"friendly, environment as well as stressful at times. The goal is to protect and use or instincts to ensure we are working in the best interest of our customer and the bank."
good,Bank of America provides competitive salaries and benefits. However jobs in Bank of America here is California is very unstable.The company tends to either outsource operational support work or move it to Charlotte N.C.
good,Working for bank of america has been a great experience. However they do not make moving up in the company as easy as they sell it to be.  I am in a Sales Capacity and the bonus structure is in constant fluctuation which makes it hard to know what you need to do.
good,Not a lot to say as my stay was not that long as a full time employee due to the mortgage market volatility. Enjoyed the people and the building with ample parking.
good,I like that Bank of America is very involved with the community around them! Bank of America donates to a lot of charities dealing with the youth and making sure that they have what is needed to success in life.
good,"This was a great company to work for many, many years ago (when in the Merrill Lynch buildings).  Kind of sad to see how much it has taken a turn for the worse."
good,"great environment. loved my bank manager. she was the best. Good training and nice neighborhood of people, many locals come to the bank. Fun environment but worked hard."
good,I enjoyed my time while working at BofA except for the lack of technology. BofA is years behind the industry and never leads the pack when utilizing tech to further its business. At the time of my employment they were still working tirelessly with Legacy systems among several other systems and not succeeding at any. This made servicing clients extremely difficult and cumbersome....leaving a client with a poor front end experience.
good,"I worked with some great people at Merrill Lynch, but the BoA corporate culture and structure gets in they way of what could be an absolutely fantastic wealth management company."
good,Collections and customer service for person to person. Providing solutions for customers that are in financial situations. Meeting the needs of the company
good,"handling cash and transaction the correct way"
good,"i enjoyed my co workers, but never felt appreciated for the extra on the job work that was done for example coming in when not on schedule or stay later than scheduled."
good,"They're just a big bank. They don't care about their employees, only numbers. My manager was unempathetic towards tellers when it came to sales numbers or even family issues. I would definitely NOT recommend them to anyone."
good,"great compensation, not so much of a culture, a lot of dress rules considering is noty highschool, streamline processes and no attention to their human resources"
good,"Analyze customer accounts to determine whether it is considered delinquent"
good,The work place is very professional. The  management team is always willing to offer assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customer
good,Good company to work for. Supports associates who volunteer by allowing an amount of time per month to do so and with pay. Recognition programs for top performers.
good,"This is a high stress atmosphere.  There are sales requirements you must meet in order to be considered performing your job minimum.  The clients are demanding and do not embrace changes, which is unfortunate since banking is changing due to technology and information protection regulations.  The regulations are in place to protect the clients, but it is a hard sell to them.  The ability to balance and accurately fill out paperwork is a must."
good,"I liked the freedom to work at your own pace at this job, the offices were new and nice and the staff was nice an helpful and easy to get along with. I would work here again."
good,"I stated working for Bank of America a very long time ago, and over the years they have grown to be a very big Corporation. If you like banking and are good with sales this is the place for you."
good,"Manager was the best I have (might ever) had. Competitive workplace with credit cards, accounts, etc. nice yearly raises but no flexibility with hours and it always seems like offices were closing. meaning lots of people out of jobs or trying to move into any available advancement positions."
good,"Good structured company to work for, very organized."
good,"If you are looking for an entry level job right out of high school or during college, this is a good place to be. The pay is decent for someone with these characteristics."
good,"Bank of America is a good, competitive place to work - especially in Charlotte, NC.  You have to commit to self-development as there isn't a lot of focus on associate development compared to my previous experience at consulting firms."
good,Really was just somewhere to get started. No job security. Benefits where good and had great hours. Great career advancements but just no job security. Really would not want to work there again.
good,lots of government regulations and rules.  most offices are revolving doors for management.  typical banking environment.  training was good extensive
good,It was a good company to start with. They value your effort and commitment to your job. Most of the people in my group were young and it was a challenge keeping up with the younger generation. I took everything in stride and just focused on accomplishing my job for the day.
good,"I worked in the cash vault area that was relocated. At the time the job was perfect. Great hours, flexible hours and you can get overtime. You could also were whatever you wanted and listen to your iPod while working."
good,"Very structured with little freedom. "
good,The operation was the $10 billion internal proprietary global trading operation for Merrill Lynch.  The group has been defunct for many years now since the financial crisis
good,"Excellent company and it provides its people good opportunities for growth. "
good,"typical big bank environment so many meaningless/low efficiency meetings. good benefit overall, people in general help each other to get the projects done"
good,"busy"
good,"flexible work, laid back, not difficult. i can't recall because the department closed three years ago and a different company owns the building. liked the job because it was on weekends only and i was able to go to school full-time."
good,"Management had trouble keeping honest employees.  "
good,Very professional and inclusive corporate culture. It was an interesting transition from the utility to the banking industry. Very effective with procedures and processes.
good,"There were opportunities for promotions within the branch. If you were able to show that you were a hard worker and go above and beyond what is expected of you, it was noticed and opportunities were given to those individuals."
good,It was a relaxed enviroment. I learn how to do 10key and different procedures and protocol for banking. mangement was ok . ouiet enviroment. sitting or standing for long peroids of time.
good,"As usual with banks, they had had a higher compensation than other types of companies in the industry.  The team and direct management was good but there was little communication from higher ups."
good,Management is not supportive. However technical clients from LOB are very much supportive. Work culture is good and would have been better if management and HR would have been supportive.
good,"I worked there in the early 2000's and the worst part of this job was that it was considered less than part time only, with no benefits or vacation.  I would get up to 30 hours a week; up to the point of where they would have to (by law) make me part time, and then my hours would fall to less than 20 for a week or two.  "
good,"Able to move up quickly. Very micromanaged. Management can be clique-like. Of course focused on what's good for the bank vs employee. Focus placed on customers, not employees."
good,"I enjoyed my time at BAC but the changes in the mortgage industry became a roller coaster, no real transparency and understanding for the direction of the mortgage division, if i were to go back it would have to be outside of mortgage."
good,"It was a typical banking company. Decent benefits, but morale was not always great. They were flexible about working from home which was a plus for me."
good,"Good company, great people I learned a lot while working there. I do recommend it. Good company over all i have a good experience on a daily basis i would return."
good,I was a hard job but I liked it BOA in famous for hiring a ton of people and laying off just wished I knew that before I went there. Over all they are a good ban.
good,"Bank of America is an ok job if your into corporate America. I am thankful that I had the opportunity to work there and learn what I did, and they have great benefits with decent pay. I also moved up each year, however it is very competitive."
good,Mellon Financial Services is and competive lockbox environment. That processes payments for hundreds of companies. They are fast and productive. They are a great place to work.
good,Bank of America was a nice place to work. The company provided decent compensation and good health benefits and growth opportunity for people of all backgrounds and gender.
good,"I have enjoyed my 4 years here as an event planner, but I am in a very niche group within this company with our culture. There is a lot of red tape and they are always reducing headcount."
good,"Not much of a challenging work, pretty secure and relaxed company. More like a service company where work really does not matter, what matters is what you do for your manager. "
good,Bank of America is very goal focused and does not have any toleration for anyone who falls shy of the demand. That causes a lot of stress on the employees and causes Bank of America to loose their strong talent to competitors
good,Daily trade support provided to trading desks.  Job is fast paced and requires attention to detail of trades for the day.  Multiple facets of accounting and trade support are required.
good,Could be a lot better with advancements- A lot of higher ups always randomly being let go without notice - too much change with departments- constantly entire departments being migrated into a completely different one to save money
good,"Great working environment. Family oriented company. Diverse culture, Delivering bad news to applicants. Meeting new people learning new process, Cross training with different  departments"
good,"In an increasingly digital environment, it is difficult to not only capture walk-in traffic, but once the customers do come in to the financial center it is generally due to an exceptional service or maintenance issue - making it even more difficult to discuss financial priorities or goals."
good,Not sure as did not spend much time to know the company inside out. Therefore unable to provide my review on this. But heard lots of good things about the company.
good,"ok place that is constantly cost cutting, needs buildup of experienced mortgage personnel. Worked in various stages of the company, as Countrywide, Bank of America when merging with Nations Bank, most recently negotiating the loans that Bank of America had pending claims against the government, pmi companies, etc."
good,"I worked in a call center for this company.  Although I have many good things to say about the bank in general, the job that I had was a poor fit for me.  A call center is a tough, very high pressure job with a lot of turnover."
good,Management was very easy to get along with; I was left on my own to do my job as long as I met requirements; management did keep an eye on us to help us if it looked as though we were about to fall behind.
good,"Meeting were particularly important and regularly scheduled and attended, management was greatly involved in decisions and projects. Management was readily available."
good,"I was a contractor on site at BofA.  I was able to learn a lot and work with some great folks.  I would go back to work there, as the location and environment was great."
good,"I did not work for BofA, but was on site as a contractor, although I did enjoy the enviornment and staff I worked with.  I was able to meet and keep contacts"
good,I enjoyed my time working in the banking industry and glad I had the privilege to work for this company starting off as a teller.
good,"I work with a great team we meet our goals the benefit package is very good. My position requires that only one person of our team be absent per day.  It makes it hard to take a day off without at least two week notice. Pay incentive could be better, hiring people without equal experience at same pay scale.  Job security is very good."
good,"a typical day at work, no raises, no growth opportunity, just isnt the environment for me. Would like something with growth"
good,"more importance and salary to leaders and analyst treated as workers.there should be personal guidance mentoring grooming to individuals who are tenured,"
good,"If you enjoy managing your stock portfolio and wish to help other people manage their portfolios, then Merrill Lynch is a good place to work."
good,Staying busy and multitasking essential in daily routine.  Building customer relationships is very important for customer satisfaction and sales.  Most managers are great to work with.  Had a bad experience with on Operations Market Manager is 23 years of my working there. He didn't treat everyone same. He showed favoritism to his own Nationality. Dealing with him was the most difficult part of the job.  The most enjoyable part was helping customers to make their financial lives better.
good,I found working on the Stock Account Management team was very stressful. I didn't feel included as part of the team as it was very male orientated. They don't have a very useful training program especially for beginners going into that environment.
good,"if you are in a bad location, sales are hard to come by. "
good,Working with the public and handling their financial needs. Providing insight on banking products in addition to their personal accounts.
good,Excellent company for learning data center rollout and deployment operations. Work life balance is challenging due to long shifts and immediate work freeze conditions.
good,The place is in a constant state of flux and re-org which is at times can be very disruptive. You have hardly established a relationship with your manager when the rug gets pulled under your feet and you have a new manager thus having to restart all over again
good,This company has the opportunity to learn many different divisions within the financial sector. This company believes in growth for its employees and empowers them to learn different roles within the organization.
good,"no thanks, i dont feel like i have to answer this. so Im just typing this for the sake of typing just trying to make it to the minimum of one hundred and 50 charcters"
good,"Overall I am happy with what I worked on and learned through the investment banking internship experience: financial modeling, strategic advisory and market analysis."
good,They always are pushing for more. Which in turn pushes the employee to want to do more but sometimes it is not on the best side for the company and the employee.
good,"Bank of America pay more than many banks, the health benefits are one of the greatest perks, salaries are fair, just have to make sure come in at a fair wages, because raise incentives are horrible. Job security in CT are probably the worst"
good,"great company to work for, but very difficult to move up in. I worked with a lot of older people that weren't really motivated"
good,A great company that has been around for many years. I have never heard anything bad about them. I loved working for Bank of America
good,working in Bank of America has provided me with the insight of how big financial company work in US. How many large scale projects run in parallel.
good,This is the place to come if you like banking and are looking to learn. The management from top to bottom really care about your success i would recommend to a friend.
good,"typical financial advisor duties and responsibilities. comprehensive financial planning and investment reviews.  retirement planning, 401k rollovers. quarterly goals."
good,"Solid management teams look to encourage professional development and foster a team environment. Client first mentality. Good, hard working people make it a good place to learn and grow."
good,"9 am to 4 pm "
good,"I don't have an opinion about this company, only gave the rating as your site would not allow me to move past it. "
good,"B of A is a HUGE banking operation that encompasses multiple facets within the financial services world.  Sometimes the gargantuan size made it seem unable to function smoothly. The annual blood-letting rounds of layoff (which usually came in October or November) always seemed to leave the staff on pins and needles wondering what would happen next -- was the division you were then working for going to remain in the city in which you worked, or was it going to be moved to some other city across the country.  There was a much higher level of stress working for this company."
good,"Not fun. Working at the branch is not something you want to do for the rest of your life. You see too many customers with endless problems, especially overdraft related problems. Having to sale can increase your level of stress."
good,The job is tedious as you constantly deal with customer complaints and issues.  Overall it gets the bills paid and is a relaxing job that gets you out on time.
good,wonderful company I loved to work for bank of america. awesome benifits good to its people all around. I would work for them again in a heart beat.
good,"I loved my manager and associates at my branch, but I did a lot of work assisting at other branches which made it clear of how lucky i was to be where I was. The sales requirements (not goals) can be almost unrealistic depending on your branch location and the call center is almost worthless when there is a problem."
good,"it is fast-paced, growth-oriented financial leader with an overall personal approach to business. It is engaged workforce where colleagues of all levels, cultures and backgrounds interact freely and experience more opportunities for learning one from another."
good,"In my time working there, we were always short staff.  It was a very busy center.  Customers always complained about the wait time for the teller window"
good,"Professional Environment"
good,Easy to work with established teams.  You get support when other are not too busy.  Fast paced environment.  Learned a lot but not so easy to implement as job is different each day.
good,"A typical day would consist of reviewing and analyzing borrower documentation to determine income and payment ability. Analyzes borrower hardship, housing expenses, and determine proper loan resolution."
good,Good place to train and start your career. Team atmosphere and collegial environment. Gain a lot of experience in a short amount of time.
good,Bank of America was an excellent company to work for. The Joint Venture with First Data was not so good. Many people lost their jobs and it became a depressing work environment.
good,"- Large organization"
good,Business acumen is needed. Various cultures within the bank. Some managers are not effective but some are.  Benefits are ok.
good,"Local, Good Benefits, and enjoyed coworkers. Able to volunteer to be in Committees: Emergency, Safety, Spirit, Good Training, open door policy with management."
good,"Employment was an equal work / life balance which is why I stayed there. The schedule met the needs of my family at that time. The pay raises were unfair, and although you would bonus Management would still find some excuse not to give you your raise. When Company shut down there wasn't any offer to transfer to another area, or location."
good,Merrill Lynch a good place to start but lacks a strong culture for the young professional to develop. Every advisory practice is independent so the fit really depends on your team. Your main point of contact is your team so there isn't much sense of camaraderie.
good,"Good work experienced, had fun learning processing all the different types of transactions. Good experience to work with customer service and all the different types of clients."
good,"Fast paced environment, low staffing levels contribute to poor work life balance and create a high stress environment.  "
good,wasnt a bad for my first full time job. however after a few years i knew i needed a change. i met some great friends and learned alot which allowed me to move on.
good,"too big to help customer -        Established and strengthened relationships by identifying customer needs and referred the appropriate products and services"
good,"Once one of the major fixed income shops as ML. Since the BA takeover and regulatory changes, difficult to say more. BAML has been making strides and trying to make a footprint in the space."
good,"They really want you to progress with your career with Bank of America."
good,I worked normal hours providing customer service to GSO clients.  I learned valuable skills which I will take with me in my career.  Climate is competitive with turnover under new direction of Brian Moynihan.  Focus is put on customer service as well as transparency and due diligence.
good,"I was able to move around to different departments to gain an advance knowledge of banking and credit lending"
good,"compared to the other two US banks I've worked for, BoA is not as good as JPM and GS"
good,Bank Of America is a good company to get associated. I have worked here for 10 years and work culture is very employee friendly.
good,"As far as banks go, Bank of America is not as lucrative as its competitors. Bank of America has a strong vision and is led by a focused and passionate CEO."
good,Company is very risk-averse and treats their employees with Southern charm. The company has become less agile in an industry that needs to constantly evolve. They treat their employees with fairness.
good,I worked here for over 18 yrs until our whole team got hit with a layoff.  It was a good place to work but I worked from home and only had to go into the office once a month for meetings.
good,I was hired to work for the short period of time and it was fun to learn about Loan Processing. I wish I would have worked there for long period of time.
good,"This role was outsourced in the end. The immediate management group at the time was horrible. This is not just my manager. This was across the board. At the end of the day, it seemed the team was sacrificed for there gain."
good,Co-workers are great and fun to work with - always willing to lend a helping hand!  Some management would benefit from additional training.
good,Everything is just average about this company. You have to work very hard to be recognized. Salary is just OK. No going up and beyond.
good,"Great lunch breaks, entertainment options, good infrastructure and good work-life balance..overall excellent place to work"
good,"A food place to work with supportive management, time off taken well into consideration although wage is below industry standards. My department was downsized & relocated to California otherwise I would probably still be working here"
good,"staffing was terrible and if you had to be off for anything it seemed to be a problem for everyone because it wasn't enough help. advancement was out there but it's very hard to move up especially if you didn't know anyone, no matter what you know."
good,Loved the friends I have made from this company. I really appreciate the great family culture vibe. Hardest part of the job was policies and procedures changing daily and sometimes information is not received timely or confusing. Everyone seemed to have a different answer for solving a problem whether it be right or wrong.
good,BOA pushes sales on their employee hardcore. To the point its discouraging and a turn off. Besides that it's a ok company to work for. Good benefits.
good,"Sad to see many jobs being pushed offshore when you have citizens here who are looking for jobs. End of the day, they care about what it is in their pocket and not about the people. Senior management is great, however direct managers are threatened by employees since they are afraid they make take there jobs. While I was there, 10 people were Full Time and all the others were contractors who are let go after 18 months or people with work visas."
good,Bank of America was a great place for me to gain work experience while I was in college. They worked around my class schedule and helped me build interpersonal relationships. I learned how to work productively with my co-workers in order to reach our individual and company goals.
good,"The people you worked closely with were great, but rounds of layoffs did a lot to employee morale and made for bigger workloads.  Benefits were very good."
good,"Good place to work, strong focus on customer satisfaction.  Good benefits program that has good focus on employee needs"
good,"A lot of micromanagement and involvement. Benefits for medical, maternity, and backup care was the only worth working there."
good,All based on the executive you support and their team.  Hardest part of the job is advancement.  The most enjoyable part is the company is still very flexible compared to others in the area.
good,"Great place for career minded people, room for mobility and advancement.  Great team atmosphere and partnership across functions and businesses"
good,I've been working at BAML for 5 years in two seperate roles. decent place to work. i started as an intern - then analyst - now associate. All locations in NYC.
good,Working for Bank of America was a great opportunity. I left the company with so much knowledge of all of the different products the bank offers. I also think the bank can make changes in how management handle certain situations. Overall I would recommend Bank of America as an employer.
good,I met a lot of people and learned a lot. Helping people get their financial lives in order was a good experience. It is a sales culture though.
good,"Typical work environment, compensation and benefits - "
good,"Worked for Bank of America 1 month shy of 23 years"
good,"Fun company to work for, but they need to be more open for innovative ideas and try to plan for long term and changeless more their employee"
good,"It's an alright company, great benefits but the management structure is horrible. Pay is okay and they are very strict with compliance."
good,"Great firm. Not a huge fan of the bank side. Awesome opportunity, local management was great. The firm changed a lot when the bank took over."
good,Overall it is an ok company to work for. I met many great people and continue friendships with them to this day.  Good brand name company to work for.
good,"In many departments managers, team leads and supervisors are at alternate locations so you may not be micro managed.  Where this can be ideal for some, if you are an individual that needs guidance or constant reassurance about your duties or performance, you many not get that kind of feedback until review time.  It is important to be a self starter and a researcher for your own benefits. Do not be afraid to ask questions."
good,You were just a number there. Very tough business to work in especially during the 2008 financial collapse. Changes every month. Some were good but others were difficult to adjust to.
good,management has their heads stuck up their rear but if you enjoy helping people its a great place to be.  the rules and regulations are VERY STRICT ! You are dealing with peoples money after all.
good,"With being such large financial institution, it was a lot easier getting the job done.    When the sold their Cash vaults it was time consuming to get the same results."
good,"It's a good company to work for. The pay and benefits are great. The only downside is they don't provide a realistic opportunity for advancement. Management plays a major roll in providing the lack of opportunities. The customers are ok. Definitely need thick skin but, not much different than any other company. It kind of goes hand in hand when dealing with the public."
good,"Bank of America allows some associates to work from home, which i am a part of right now. This allows me to get more work done and be more effective. They also have a very good carrera site with a very good job search if you wish to stay within the Bank."
good,Great place to learn how to manage different personalities. This was a place where I was given great responsibility and was in control of several million dollars. Really learned how to multi-task at this job.
good,"days start early and end late, u will learn a lot about sales and customer service, your coworkers become family because you spend long days with them, they hardest part of the job is the long hours, but you will get paid overtime so it balances out."
good,I love working with my co-workers but management needs to take in to consideration that customers are more than just a number. The level of stress does not match the pay.
good,"The contract in general was OK but they didn't seem to use my skill set to the fullest. I enjoj being challenged technically and this did not happen at BofA. "
good,"I worked there 15 years ago but I have found memories."
good,Bank of America is a great company. I had a bad experience with the management. There was not enough training for contractors.
good,My team lead wasn't technical sound enough where we couldn't weather the proper user stories so we have to leave from the company.
good,"Over the course of my 10 years at BAC I worked the majority of 3 day weekends due to project implementations, although I was able to advance my time with my family was hampered.  Over the course of time I realized I needed to change that."
good,Nice experience! Learned alot about banking and the industry. Did not afford the opportunity to climb up the latter. Alot of the positions required spanish speakers.
good,I loved working for the Bank and what I was doing for the bank.  Unfortunately the Operations Side of the House left the state and my opportunities dried up.
good,I hated how they forced us to push sales on customers. The customers hated when we would offer services they didn't want but if we didn't meet quota we would be sent to an in-service. Eventually had to quit because they didn't want to work with me going to college. Big red flag!
good,"I do not want to comment."
good,"A typical day here was to focus on customer satisfaction and sales. The bank had sales goals that needed to be met. Opening accounts, loans, wherever it may be I would help facilitate that and help keep customer satisfaction at its highest along with the bank manager."
good,"Every day is a learning experience. Everyone is cross trained on different platforms of production in lockbox."
good,"We had to constantly keep a log as to why we were away from our desks. "
good,"Too be perfectly honest, management process at BOA could use improvement. They tend to call out anyone whom makes mistakes, rather than calling out one on one using coaching as a best practice."
good,"A very large department, with a very high turn over rate with employees coming and going. But there was a lot of room to grow within other departments of the company"
good,">  Provide armed security protection to Bank of America Headquarters in Uptown Charlotte"
good,It was overall a good working experience. What I gained here was the customer service experience. Now that I have the ability to speak to customers I am willing to move on and continue my journey of great customer service.
good,The division I worked in had no growth plan for their employees. Not any chance of promotion unless you live and work in NY.
good,They were okay to work for. They eventually started having to develop many rules that made it hard for customers to bank with them. It is understandable due to the fact that fraud is so high.
good,The most enjoyable part is assisting our customers and satisfying them to the best of my ability. Working with others is also a strong point in this company
good,Overall I had a good experience working at baml. Unfortunately the bank is ran by the HR department and none of the groups really control their own destiny.
good,"Ok place to work , not much more to say , depends on location staffing and what quarter you arrive. Cannot give a description on what the plan is , things change every day."
good,Over the last year a lot has changed to make it an unfavorable place to work.Too many open positions leaving it up to you to deal with longer wait times on hold and having to do a lot of more than what would be normal for the position.
good,"The role of a client associate is basically based on the financial advisor that you work for. You are essentially at their disposal for anything and everything. If that doesn't bother you, then you'll be fine in this role, otherwise you will most likely begin to develop pet peeves with their every day requests that are normally not part of your job description. Your pay is also based on the FA that you work for, so if you go out of your way more, you could make more money, but again it depends on the FA."
good,"This is a good place to work. It has a culture that accomodates work life balance and fosters development. "
good,"A fun workplace. Work on data processing and data extraction automation."
good,My co-workers were smart and knowledgeable always helped enter the necessary info for client.  The days where relatively stress free.  The hardest part of this job was that it was forever ago and remember very little information.
good,"I worked there for 33 years, met numerous people and built life-long relationships."
good,I was blessed with great Mangers however beyond that they don't care anymore other than how much numbers can you produce. Employees great to work with. Higher mangers are hard to reach.
good,I have been apart of this company for 19 years. I have learned new processes throughout my time here. I have worked with a great group of people for the most part. The hardest part of my day is when it's slow. I like to stay busy.
good,"Great talented group of people that are inclusive in all aspects of projects.  A company that strive for client wellness, always putting the client first."
good,"good team members and always willing to help others and very reliable for all tasks need, hard part of the job working with other she is a excellent person and very enjoyable to work with"
good,"I loved working for BOA but only for my branch. Not every banking center operates the same, so depending on your location you many get lucky and work with a great team or may not."
good,"Best place to work, people, "
good,I work ten and a half hours a day and every Saturday for six hours and am hardly able to keep up with workload.  They ask us to work on Thursday for 12 hours but I gave up that as I am exhausted.  It is hard on the eyes looking at two computer screens 10..5 hours a day.
good,"Good Company."
good,This is a great company with great solutions for the clients that I worked with. The culture is a bit old school where the old 'brokers' are having to accommodate the new DOL rules and are fighting it.
good,One will never tell when the company will dissolve a department. Always be prepared by having an updated resume and circulating with a variety of departments.
good,"Bank of America is a good company to work for in certain aspects, They are very competitive pay, and really treat you like family, Although the training on new updates are delayed at time, they are an overall good company to work for"
good,"Really busy because they don't have enough teller to help customer."
good,"Great opportunity to lean the ins and outs of banking"
good,Large employer in competitive banking industry with traditional corporate culture and organization reporting structure.
good,I worked for this company for over 18 years and there was always room for advancement. Management was professional there and the employees were very nice to work with very rewarding job.
good,"This is overall a great position for someone looking to attend school while working. If you land a position anything above a teller you can expect to have a decent paying hourly salary. Once you get into a position such as a Relationship Manager you can expect to make even more with great quarterly bonuses however you can also expect to be micromanaged. They track everything from how long you sit with a client, how many emails you sent, how many phone calls you make, how many sales, how many complaints you log in, how many escalated problems you log in, how many referrals you log in, how many appointments you make, how many auto loans, how many home loans, credit cards, mobile/online activations, how many credit cards, small business accounts and credit cards, on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. This sounds fairly standard for a banking position right? Well the pressure comes when you are being emailed hourly to report these things all while trying to make each interaction 30 minutes long. The training is very intensive web-based when it should be more hands on seeing as a lot of my peers had no idea what they were doing until thrown into the fire of client relationship managing. The benefits and the salary/bonuses really help keep retention of employees in line. Not saying all BOFAs are the same across the country but this is the experience in the New England/Boston/New Hampshire/Conneticut/New York areas. You can easily make over 20/hr in BOFA which is amazing compared to most companies that dont require a degree. However you pay for it in terms of stressful micromanaging."
good,"Good overall company. "
good,"Solving complicated issues. Working in sync with colleagues at work."
good,It is a normal place to work. Office attempts to include employees by providing activities and breaks from regular day of work. The people and culture makes it a great place to work.
good,"Great Place to work, you will enjoy the professional environment, after a year you would be able to move around. You will be able to work overtime in a lot of departments."
good,"High production environment where people come and go either from lay offs, termination, or massive hiring. Either way, this is a place of constant change. If you give notice, expect to be black listed and to not get rehired"
good,"Worked as a personal banker. Work was demanding and busy. Worked long hours. Not many opportunities to move up."
good,The location was beautiful and a good area for one to get started.  Customers came in with different needs and different financial backgrounds that needed me to stay informed on current regulations and products offered to best suit my customer.  I would have liked to have stayed with the company but unfortunately there wasn't a strong desire from my peers to welcome me.  The team was very clique.
good,"Bank of America is the best paying job I've ever held.  Base salary, bonuses, overall benefits, raises, it is all there.   The work atmosphere isn't bad either, as long as you are on the right side of management."
good,"Poor management, no room to grow, employees are great to work with and benefits are outstanding. Periodic layoffs in departments take place at least once a year."
good,Great people to work with and fun learning curve. It will teach anyone lots about operations of banking and technology.
good,Working here is great the hours are good as well would like to advance my career.  been here for almost a year nothing more really to say
good,"There have been great moments, there have been bad moments. I've seen a lost of people get promoted who did not necessarily deserve it, and a lot of people overlooked in the way of promotions."
good,Worked for this company for 13 years and the first 10 were absolutely wonderful.  It became very political and long time employees were being squeezed out to make room for younger and less experienced people.
good,"In Tampa pre 9/11, Cap 1 was the place to work. Amazing culture, people, location, campus, leaders, this company had everything. "
good,"very sales pushy, sometimes outrageous sales goals, but that should be expected. There are better banks to work for though, like PNC Bank, if they are in your area."
good,It was a nice experience going from full time teller to a personal banker role. I really enjoyed all the learning that I had.
good,"A good day at work is if there are no melt downs with our system but if there are we can handle it with in one to two days. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Bank of America. I received excellent benefits, and a clean work environment. Due to new policies, the company cut back on the amount of tellers needed during prime banking hours. This made it seem more stressful for the existing tellers as well as for the customers that had to wait in longer lines. Overall it was an enjoyable experience but could use at least one more teller during peek hours."
good,"Its a production support project and will have tickets to be sorted out."
good,Pro-Great Benefits Con-Need more room for growth. Looking to grow at a reputable company and may even consider within Bank of America.
good,the best job that you could every have just needed to do what was asked of you at all time. This is not just a job it is a place of growth.
good,Great compensation benefits but not great work culture . Lovable management but no consistency with work . Its a typical day at work
good,"Good vacation time, and good people to work with.  Your experience there is completely dependent on upper management in your office.  Decent pay but not the same since it bcame BofA"
good,"Policies need revamping, a lot of good working people let go due to the smallest things. Upper management not available"
good,Work balance is good.  Only issue is withing Default Servicing you are always worried about layoffs.  It comes with the industry.
good,Proof operator hours are mostly evening hours. Great atmosphere. No micro-managing. Work is given and expected to be completed before leaving.
good,Goals remain the same despite campaign to migrate customers to digital banking. Huge decline in customers coming into the branch; no change in metrics.
good,Great company all and all but rapid changing environment can make work environment difficult. Infrastructure is not reliable and too restrictive.
good,"This job is okay to work at also for beginners. If looking for part time work while in school, I would recommend this job area."
good,"I would like to comment that I have worked in multiple depts. within the bank.  One thing I can say, is that during the housing crisis they were a major contributor in helping to reset the market."
good,"Manage SMA accounts for three major plans."
good,"Even though it has been a number of years since I worked for BOA, I also enjoyed my time there being able to serve the customers.  We also had great teams that got along well and made working there enjoyable.  There was a high demand for sales."
good,"the best department to learn about financial planning."
good,"Worked for this company for a decently long time."
good,There is always room for improvement in any company. The work environment was common. I would go back if there was a position for me.
good,The bank is too large after the acquisitions of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.  The human touch is no longer there for employee/client relationships.  The job application process is cumbersome requiring several online tests before you can speak with  a person about a position.
good,"It's not what you would think. It's retail, plain and simple. We sell products that may or may not be beneficial to our customers depending on their needs."
good,"They don't care about the employees... benefits were great but the moral and culture was awful. "
good,"I worked on a team that was required to clear out the AML backlog. I worked with many people that I worked with at Well Fargo doing the same thing. The management staff was a pleasure to work with. The direction we received was stellar. The staff always worked together to achieve month end numbers. The days we spent working was pleasant because we always had a team that would look over our work before we turned it in, too minimize errors. I also remember when it was needed we would take a break and go into a conference room and review a persons case just to level set ideas on how to complete the review."
good,Company appeared to be well managed and work environment was acceptable.  Flexibility across the board regarding remote capabilities as applicable was not there.
good,Good place to start in the financial world. Great place to learn about what you want to do and understand places that can be improved upon in corporate america.
good,I was third shift running and verifying checks all night.  I learned how to be very proficient and detailed. Management was great and so were co-workers.  The hardest part of this job was staying awake on the third shift.  The most enjoyable was the activities and the treatment of their employees.
good,review already provided. Bank of america even is still a good company to work focus with a lot of growth and a lot of potential.
good,"Supervised 12 employees"
good,The team was great! Management was very informative. I would recommend this company as a great starter in career path. My only issue was that there didn't appear to be many growth opportunities if so the process was long to achieve a worthy position.
good,"very energetic career"
good,"Bank of America is strong in the application of risk management models to ensure employees do ""the right thing"". The leadership puts forth great effort to ensure customer deliver/satisfaction."
good,"Very good company to work for. typical office environment, very formal and encouraging. if your looking for a job with a good group of people to grow with, this would be a good place for you."
good,"It's stressful but pays well and has excellent benefits, which is why I have chosen to stay for so long. Everyday it seems like they add more and more tasks to get done."
good,The day to days are highly structured and focused on production. Time management and organization is key to completing the daily tasks. Management is structured and focused on helping associates complete assignments quickly and correctly. The people and the culture is very rewarding.
good,I really enjoyed my job while working at BOA. The challenge is that BOA is unappreciative of their employees. They are out of touch with the clientelle they serve. BOA does not listen to the boots on the ground employees.
good,"Bank of America is a bank. It is a big bank. A really big bank it is. If you like working for a big bank work at bank of america, a big Bank"
good,"Great company to work for good benefits and work life balance "
good,"Lots of opportunities for you to grow into."
good,This company provides a Standard banking career. Within Small Business Banking there is a Glass ceiling and it is very difficult to move past this position.
good,"I would open the bank, go through routine  steps to make sure the location was secure and open the vault. I organized paper work for the day  and attended customer with their day to day needs and questions. Sales was a vital part of my job. At the end of the day it was imperative that we balance with 0 difference in our cashbox. If i or anyone were ever under or over I had investigate what the problem in their work through out the was. The management at my location was very helpful and always very up-lifting."
good,"What I don't love is that they transition your job like crazy and make you do the job you were not hired on for as full time."
good,I enjoyed my job at B of A.  the people were extremely nice and the atmosphere was terrific to work at.  I learned many thing to take me to the next level of the business.
good,Not the beast it used to be. Training program could've been better. Co worker were not friendly. Almost the same as being a cold calling broker
good,"In this role, I managed a portfolio that allowed me to learn about releasing and acquiring partial property. These actions were done thru research and mortgage lender approval."
good,When I first started at B of A I loved it the co workers the management everything. Then management changed and the face of the company was not the same. A lot of pressure and deadlines to face. Soon it became a place where I worried for my job every single day
good,My current job is a nice place to work if you adapt well to a changing environment. The management staff is very helpful. I have gained great knowledge about financials.
good,company need more other ways to help customer with there financial goals. company need more time to explain the benefits of there product and services
good,Loan processing has moved to mass processing centers and there are no direct access to the processors or closers.  Everything is electronic.  This can make communication be an issue.
good,"Responsible for loans in CEO/ President office with Default Servicing Complaints (DSCR)"
good,An exciting company to work for with many different growth opportunities.  The volume was high along with dealing with a variety of customer related issues. The colleagues were the best!
good,"Sales goals are increasing every year. But one of our main jobs was to show customers how to do banking without coming into the banking center. You can't sell if their is nobody coming in to sell to. Unfortunately, banking at the branch level is a dying career."
good,"Great Place to work. I was here under a 1 year contract. Love the environment, wish I could have stayed here permanent.  I would recommend this job to everyone"
good,I enjoyed the interaction with the customers and my peers.  It's a fast pace environment which made the day go by quicker.
good,"Advisors naturally think they are the best thing on earth and all must listen to them.  At Edge, it's more humble with lots of online tech focus."
good,"It has been many years since I work at Bank of America.  I can remember enjoying my time there, however."
good,"Review pipeline of 35 loans, make outbound calls to customers requesting any documents needs to complete loan package. Make outbound calls for counter offers. Hardest part of my job was when I had to decline loans and give the bad news to my clients"
good,"Management is excellent, allowed to learn at own speed.Compensation is good as a contractor. Commuting is difficult, little public transportation."
good,"Audit default/liquidation process for all FHA/VA/CONV and PFS loans and REM transactions to ensure compliance with federal/state regulations."
good,A fast paced environment where I conversed with customers on a daily basis on which product we offered would make their financial lives easier.
good,Implement Merril Lynch's Goals Based Wealth Management process to help clients have the best chance at achieving their goals and passions during retirement.
good,"all management problems...lack of teller, personal banker...customers are always angry because of the long wait...if you are the banker with commission, you might be satisfy with that, but as a teller, it is such a terrible place to work at."
good,"We all know that in the banking industry the employee turn over rate can be quite high, I feel this is somewhat due to the constant competitive nature of generating more revenue. When dealing with those type of environments its difficult to maintain stability. Look at it like the stock exchange one day it can be up and the next day it can be down. However we have to put stock in something and with out the banking system I feel it would be like living with no life insurance. Its something that  we all need."
good,Very interesting not only learning about sustainable initiatives for the globe but the impact on green initiatives on the financial markets.
good,Not a great place to grow or try to be innovative.  Will not pay well until they pass their capital test.  toxic culture stemming from the failure to truly integrate Merrill with BofA.
good,"As the company of Bank of America, I believe in the principles that the founder had at the time he began the company."
good,While I have learned a great deal during my over five years at Bank of America (including contractor time) I would prefer to work much closer to home or be able to work from home.  I would also prefer to stay in one segment and progress within one aspect of the company instead of constantly being trained to do something new according to where the fire is and what area of the workforce needs to be cleaned up.
good,"I worked 7 years at Merrill Lynch. Working at a call center is a great job and I believe my experience there have helped my interact with individuals more efficiently in ever day life. I Took anywhere from 40 to 100 calls a day, it was always a busy day but the day always went by very fast. "
good,"As a technical lead, I Involved in writing the script to do the health check up on the data sending to SMARTS team."
good,Developed and expanded upon consumer relationships.  The working environment lacked proper leadership and development of employees.  I learned how to work with those that lacked basic banking skills and enjoyed teaching customers ways to achieve monetary goals.
good,Good Company to work for. Sales requirement as a Personal Banker are very steep and micromanaging is rampant to assure numbers are met
good,"Overall, decent job. Goals changed every 45-60 days Great co-workers. Gave good incentives to meet goals. Great benefits"
good,Other than being able to obtain series 7 and 66 the culture of the program is that of failure.  This area has only had 2 guys graduate the program in the past 10 years
good,"Working here, was a pretty bad experience. My manager was always setting me up for failure. Although I learned a lot, it was not worth it. I was always stressed. At times I didn't want to go to work."
good,"Some people are crazy in this company, they are irrational, people looks like very stressed out and unhappy with a lot of pressure, there is a lot of indian people, treating US citizen like nothing."
good,"BOA is pretty good company to work for, the company has great culture and provide ample opportunities for employees to grow."

good,I don't care I don't care I don't care blah blah blah co workers. working here and there. every day working. doing same thing every day. call calling and everything the same
good,"Typical day consisted of processing communications invoices. I supervised a team of 4 analysts. Monthly deadlines for invoice payment was part of my task. I was personally responsible for running a monthly accrual tape into billing system. The most challenging task was the office computer automation of the invoice payment process. The most pleasurable part of my job was having a genial, and competent staff."
good,"Bank of America is a very fast paced & demanding work place. The hours are very long and upper management expects those working under them to put in at least 50 hours a week. I learned a lot in terms of aggregating and presenting data to a large audience. My co workers were not very pleasant to be around due to the fact that everyone disliked their respective jobs. The pay was great, I have to say that, but the environment and pressures of deliverable was not conducive to a good home life as well."
good,You must have existing relationships in the area. DONT MOVE TO THE JOB WITHOUT CLIENTS IN THE BULL PEN. you need to get lucky in order to stay or be assigned to a team which is tough.
good,very high stressful job. take back to back calls and analyse to make sure im talking to the true card holder. how to give out new cards and new when to not go over any info on the account if they were not able to fully authenticate into the account. the hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. co workers would be helpful and very encouraging. the most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customer when I caught a perpetrator and was able to call the customer and let them know the account was frozen and sent out new cards to the customer.
good,"Great benefits, great place to work. There was not any room for growth. Managed a daily queue volume. Co workers were great, like family."
good,I was contracted at BOA. I loved that job but was a little challenging for me. New Area Mortgage. Training was virtual training which was week. plus half of the class did not understand how to function it. Training was to short for the amount of data given. Immediately placed on the phones. If and when you made an error it was generated on a report which was broadcast-ed all over the floor by email and the agency got a copy. They were not aloud to give feedback.
good,Not a lot of room for promotion. Always at risk for a lay off. Co-workers tend to be nice and supportive creating a positive team environment.
good,"The Management Team is  Great  , very friendly  there is  however  no room  for career advancement  it is virtually non existent"
good,loss of customer service with trying to keep pace with technological advances - out of touch with older clientele. good lower level managers & teamamtes.
good,"Focus needs to be on creating a better work environment, creating a positive job culture and on going training for employees as job titles change"
good,"Go in the afternoon and had to sweep, mop, and vacuum the entire building Monday through Friday, as well as, clean furniture, wash cleaning utensils, and remove stains from windows and mirrors.  Withdrew from job for personal purposes."
good,BOA offers exceptional benefits for its employees.  This is what keeps staff there.  The staff I have worked with are professional and dedicated to their job.
good,"Working at Bank of America for 5 years has been fun although sometimes challenging but it was worth it and will be a memorable experience. My job duties were pretty much repetitive, you come in everyday expecting to do the same thing as the day before . No complaints on management."
good,Great communication between employees and management. Management team was always willing to help. Very relaxed place to work.
good,"Busy workplace, with lots of layers. Focus on relationship management and teamwork."
good,"Just like any large company, it's easy to get lost in the shuffle.  You need to stay focused on your goals, and what's important to you."
good,"In operations, you have the freedom to listen to music and work independently which is what I liked most. Other than that, you are pretty limited and may have to work extended hours."
good,"I was able to grow in my position and was promoted in a short period of time. However, there was a lot of turnover. It's a new group so lots to figure out."
good,"Employees are trained with an in depth customer service, mortgage, insurance and sales knowledge.  Persons who enjoy a fast paced spontaneous customer service work environment would be in a perfect setting."
good,The most enjoyable part of being a Personal Banker was helping customer with their financial life.  The hardest part sales goals.  The direct manager I reported to was great.  I learned a great deal about banking products.  I learned a lot about problem solving.
good,Working at Bank of America teaches you core values of Client Management and hard work. It also teaches you integrity. If you don't know how to set yourself up for success working here will train you.
good,Bank of America has been good to me.  They took a chance on me and allowed my to flourish.  Over the past six years with the bank I've been able to start at the bottom and learn all about mortgage servicing.  I started working in operations and more recently in relationship management.  The relationship management portion of my experience allowed me to focus  and utilize my skills.  It was in the relationship management group where I received multiple promotions and really came to love my job.  I would love to stay with the bank but unfortunately the opportunities are going away and I am looking for a new journey.
good,This is a pretty laid back job.  No really brain power there but it is easy to get stuck and not advance.  There are no advance placement.
good,When you start working at Bank of America it was a bit overwhelming simply because of the size of the building. The senior employees  seam to be a bit unapproachable. My personal opinion is that you get the feeling that staff feels like you could be easily replaced.
good,"Easy environment to learn and develop. Strictly professional and fast paced company.Customer satisfaction is important as well as experience, understandable from a big company of financial institutions."
good,answer general customer service questions and helped customers complete purchases. It  was equip  with long hours and dealing with people who could barely speak english
good,This job is very physical so the short term is great because it kept me slim. However the long term it really can ruin your body with all the lifting of heavy canned foods
good,"This job could of had the potential to be awesome, however when I came aboard my mentor quit 2 weeks later, and we had a brand new managing director who never worked in private wealth management.  I believe ML is a great company, and the MD was a great person however the lack of guidance seriously affected my experience at ML."
good,"Management is good they have a lot to teach and are motivated to do so however, the bank always not competitive when it comes to comp.  Bank of America is way below market value for individual compensation below management levels."
good,"Working at Bank of America was an honor, but there were drawbacks such as the location, salary, and the limited growth potential if you aren't in the right clique."
good,"Though Bank of America is a major corporation, there are surprisingly few opportunities for upward mobility. As someone who wants to pursue a career in global finance and banking this was very disappointing for me because Bank of America seemed to have so much to offer when I first applied."
good,"Company is reactive, always catching up, rarely proactive.  The left hand doesn't know what the right hand does. A directive was right yesterday, it might be right currently, but it's wrong tomorrow! Flooded with useless conference calls, you are told to ask questions, but then ignored or belittled so who wants to contribute? "
good,Large company that is focused on loan goals. Teams are broken up into smaller sections for the benefit of processing loans in a faster turn time.
good,"This was a good place to learn and grow, but with multiple rounds of layoffs over many years, as well as the removal of the myWork (work from home) program for most individuals it is no longer the place it used to be to work."
good,"You can very easily get sucked into the labyrinth of corporate workplace here and spend years before realising you might want to do something different."
good,"Bank of America offered me experience while on the job as well as trained me in different aspects of the job. I learned a lot in Excel (writing formulas, creating Macros, etc) while working at Bank of America."
good,"Good work like balance, average pay, hard to advance in a virtual environment, guidelines hard to determine, poor training."
good,Being an employee you have to be adaptable to change. Eager to learn and prepared for any and everything to happen at any given day.
good,got a lot of accounts open and established professional relationships. Good experience because dealing with peoples money is always difficult.
good,Mostly reverse engineering of installation software to distribute over WAN.  Rebuilding Computers and installing appropriate OS for testing re-engineered installations.
good,"I love the customer service field that I am in and wish to grow further in my position, however I did not feel as if I had this opportunity afforded to me at BOA."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.  Like the bank holidays. just alot of layoffs you get transferred to another department alot of you dont get caught in the layoffs . But overall coworkers are good and feels like family when working with them.
good,"Haven't worked here long, But learning a lot so far. Getting good experience and get along with my peers and supervisors."
good,"Easy if you have customer service expirence but very demanding."
good,This company was shut down years ago with South Korea's economic reform back in the early 2000. It was a company with very nice co-workers in a warm environment.
good,"The whole working staff and employees are committed to help others even if they belong to different projects."
good,"Good company and managed ok for it's size.  Benefits are good and co-workers are great.  Very sales focused, growth through excellent customer service is a priority."
good,"Goal oriented work place, however there is constant pressure to sell company products (checking acct, credit cards, mortgages etc.)  Management can be biased at times.  It really is a who you know not what you know type of environment."
good,Great co workers. ever changing policies and lack of staff make it hard to provide great customer service and provide consistant customer service
good,The work environment was very pleasant to work in. The management staff was very understanding. Also the co workers were helpful when needed.
good,Worked at Previous banking center. Did not have a great experience at previous location. Bank of America in new location much better
good,"To utilize my professional experience as a Computer programmer, Programming department manager and Business/Operations Analyst in a challenging work environment."
good,"this company was good to me and i loved the work that i did but once i learned the job it became routine to me and there was never anything exciting about it after learning the job..the only thing that kept me excited was the customers and most of all my team that i worked with,. a typical day hear was send and receiving money, audits, problem solving, making sure tellers made there goal for the day/week"
good,Working at BOA taught me to expect the unexpected. The wide array of personalities seen in one day can be daunting to a new employee but the rhythm is quickly picked up. The best part about the job is getting to help customers better understand their financial options and seeing them happy.
good,I worked at Merrill Lynch for a brief time as a consultant before returning to Morgan Stanley. The hardest part of the job was constant short deadlines. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new procedures.
good,"Working for Bank of America was a wonderful opportunity and I enjoyed the opportunity to work within a corporate environment.  The level of professionalism, production exceptions and ever changing expectations kept you on your toes and ""loved it""."
good,"Production based position, minimal supervision, I learned quite a lot about mortgages and banking.  worked with great people."
good,"A few years ago, there was a lot of opportunity to advance. However, recent times have proven difficult to advance in the mortgage servicing area."
good,I worked for the Bank for several years. Very demanding at times and could be stressful but I loved the challenge. There was never a day that I did not learn something new and there was never a day that something didn't change within the my role at the bank. My supervisor was a wonderful woman to work for and I would go over and above for her because she would do the same for her employees. I loved that when I came back from leave they allowed me to work from home in order to stay home with my new baby girl. I made the decision a few years later to stay home with her full time.
good,corporate environment which is always changing. there is always a new strategy each month which becomes the new goals to attain.
good,"The best part of the job was the interaction with overseas clients.The working environment was really good and the management people are really supportive.However, we had to work for long hours and odd shift timings.This often disrupts the work life balance and your schedule."
good,I greatly enjoyed working with the team of associates I had. They had an amazing passion for taking care of clients and each other. I was able to grow in my position and learn an incredible amount in a fast paced and challenging environment. Advancement within the company was very political and not based on tangible achievements.
good,Supporting multiple LOBs while completing department deliverables was challenging and priorities changed very often.
good,I had a lot of career growth opportunity here and was with BOA for 10yrs. It was very enjoyable. Over time regional management changed. Job responsibility became overwhelming. Associates were being held accountable for stupid minor things and written up for stuff that didn't matter just to get rid of people that had been there for a long time. I decided to voice my opinion. To the regional manager through an email. I don't think he appreciated it. It was very professional but honest. I decided it was time for me to leave.
good,"This is a great job depending on what department you work in. Great hours, nice work environment and atmosphere. This job is very competitive and all about the numbers so you have to be definitely focus and driven."
good,The work balance here is not conducive to family life. At this company it is very difficult to have both. If you are single this is a ok place to be.
good,Bank of America evolved from a good bank to work for to a highly competative and stressful work environment that says they put the customer first but do not.
good,It's a nice place to work. it could utilize it's employees better they have domestic employees reporting to management over seas
good,"Great place to start a career but environment was stressful, bureaucratic and not as conducive to collaboration. Difficult to move up the ladder, all about connections. Corporate hierarchy and toxic culture for young professionals."
good,it is good company to work with and the environment was fun and workable. fun work place with supportive management good work culture good work culture good work culture good work culture
good,"When new contractor's started, I would be asked to assist them with their task because of many year's of experience within the lockbox environment. Management trusted me enough to allow me to assist. My co-worker's were great to work with. I would encourage them in every way."
good,answered over 100 calls a day from disgruntled clients who were charged fees for late or overdue balances.   need to record time away from desk

good,"Normal real Estate Office of listings and sales of DC, MD and VA residential and Commercial Properties."
good,"co workers are friendly, job is fast pace, and bosses only care about numbers. Not so much the employees. the pay is decent, not too bad with jus a high school diploma."
good,"- A typical work day was packed with multiple challenges. If aligned appropriately, projects were interesting but stretched ones abilities appropriately"
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Great experience in the mortgage industry, working with mortgage loan officers, processors, underwriters, and managers throughout the loan process. Inspecting the audit tasks operationally ensuring we have operations and sales excellence."
good,Great campus and close to my home.  As Countrywide Home Loans the company was more employee friendly.   Bank of America is not as employee motivated as Countrywide was.  Also salary increases are smaller with BOA.
good,There was always a high turn over and there was no teamwork which saddens me because I loved my job but it was a lack of structure.
good,"The company would be great without bank of america. Everything is about compliance and covering your butt, seemingly no proactive business efforts."
good,fast paced environment with quality people working with a number of fortune 500 companies. Highly completive environment
good,"The work culture was slightly more laid-back than what you would think of a finance company. Worked from home every Friday. As a contractor there were no benefits and very little room to move up. However, great experience and an overall enjoyable place to work."
good,"A typical day of work, was meeting downtown at the Independence building, gathering work orders for the day and completing them within the allotted time frame. There are 14 BoA buildings in downtown Charlotte, so fresh faces and challenges every day. Unfortunately it was a contract job or I would probably still be working there."
good,Was a fun workplace because the other salesman were positive and fun to work with. Went over different options with customers but wanted to make sure we got them in a car that wont put them in a financial bind either.
good,"Even though my daily commute was a ver ylong, long long, long one. I very much enjoyed working there! A great place to work!"
good,"The best part of working for Bank of America was their benefits. The gave part-time employees full benefits. They also match any money given to your favorite charity. The call center portion of Bank of America was stressful, but as with any call center that is to be expected."
good,"In any building that you visit, you run into someone who has worked for you, with you, or has been part of an organization that you are involved in.  "

good,"Location is now closed.  There was very little job security.  There was very little room for advancement.  The employees had a great work relationship."
good,"Overall enterprise offers a vast array of job areas.  The business has been severely tasked by regulatory activities since the mortgage crisis for the last four years, but future outlook looks promising as the business appears to be stabilizing."
good,This position introduced me to the mortgage banking industry. I was able to take what I learned in this positon and apply it to my next position with Chase.
good,"It is a typical bank. You help some people and some people you do not help. Your only job is to sell, sell, sell...and when you are no longer able to sell....you UPSELL. It does not matter what dept you are in. That is your only job at Bank of America. And if you do not like the position or dept that you are in...you can always post to another dept....if you don't not mind waiting 18 months to do so."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Bank of America and the frenetic pace of delivery. The challenge was something I savored. I was constantly encouraged to be better, more efficient, and turn around deliverables more quickly."
good,"After consistently reassuring employees there were no talks of layoffs and their positions were secure, they completely blindsided over 1000 employees and let everyone go with-in only a few months after notification."
good,"a typical day at work in the collections department involves high call volume of customers who are delinquent and it will be hit or miss for the payment. Majority of customer are past due, due to a financial hardship and your job is to figure out what solution is the best for the customer."
good,"Great company to work for.  Love client and helping them in their financial needs, "
good,"Good Benefits, set career path, and internal opportunities, however, they have created an environment of uncertainty with unpredictable layoffs"
good,"Many departments have preselected individuals for leadership roles. Many departments are going to the one stop shop method where you fulfill multiple requests for clients to reduce the amount of redirected calls or service requests. This provides employees with multiple skills on servicing clients with mortgage, banking, credit cards and investments however it reduces the ability to move to other departments to enter leadership because areas that service one type of client i.e Deposit Accounts are going away. Employees are required to multitask and utilize a max of 36 systems to fulfill the many systems that it takes to complete any job."
good,good utilize my earlier experience and knowledge in banking by contributing to the improvement as well as progress of the company. I will be putting my best efforts in terms of time and learning new banking techniques

good,"I loved my job, and the company I worked for. The benefits were fair, and there was room for growth. Management was great and so were the people."
good,"I worked as a temp for a few months at Bank of America. The company was very nice. They paid well and were very friendly. However, I was put in a small project that prevented me from progressing within the company. I was a part of the Retirement Account Exit Team - A group of 5 people who just closed accounts. My only job was to review the same 8 spreadsheets over and over again just to see if any changes were made. I told my supervisor several times that I was interested in learning more and being more involved, but she didn't want to do anything about it."

good,"Listening to the customer and getting the issue fixed right away."
good,"Prior to working at Bank of America I had no banking experience. Within a few months I had effectively learned how to become a teller as well as a banker. I underwent several weeks of training on the computer, but after that you learn from experience. Throughout the months I have self-taught and learned all I need to do to to perform my job to the best of my ability. Of course, every day I still learn something new. "
good,There is not much I would like to say about Bank of America. I wish there were more room to grow with in the company. Other than that I have learned many skill working at Bank of America.
good,"Good Work Life Balance. Co-workers are friendly and lively. However, salaries are very low compared to the market. Cab facility is the best."
good,"BOA was a good job, great co workers, it all depends on what type of person is managing you. If your upline is Knowledgeable and is all for you advancing within the company or just working to create a team oreinted community then you willl be fine, but if too many people are bringing personal issues to work and also using the job as a social gathering where they can play out there mental issues then your going to be in for a long ride. "
good,"While the time I was with Bank of America was minimal, I was able to see that they had a good structure to provide the best quality service to the clients. They pumped up employees with recognition rewards and they even had a GYM at the facility I was stationed at."
good,"Work day is very dependent on the needs of your financial advisor and his/her clients. Many small projects which can seem somewhat mundane, but there are plenty of opportunities to learn on your own or from an experienced financial advisor."
good,"This department was productivity driven. It was all about the numbers. Decent red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company"
good,"I love helping people but the fear of losing my job far outweighs any benefit. Benefits and perks used to be really great, but are declining with the market and then cheaper labor. Deciding it's not cost efficient for people to work from home so they layoff all of te good hard workers."
good,"My typical work day was accounting for at least $750,000 a day. I cautiously opened and closed the banking facility. I led morning meetings, ran reports, imported/exported U.S and foreign currency. I managed a team of 7 plus tellers, making sure they were trained and equipped with knowledge to perform their work duties and provide great customer service. I filled in as a teller, sales services specialist or banker as needed and created a safe, friendly and fun work environment  I scanned paperwork at the end of the day and ran reports. This was my first banking experience which was overwhelming to come in as management. This helped me expand my patience which is needed in a tedious work environment."
good,Enjoyed coming into work daily and our department was full of amazing managers and co-workers.Worked hard as a unit to ensure month over month growth in our production.

good,Each individual is responsible for setting there own agenda. It's important to be organized and focused and have a business plan that enables you to generate new leads.
good,"Bank of America bought out MBNA. MBNA was a phenomenal corporate experience where people worked hard and brought a positive attitude to work daily. MBNA generated a collaborative and creative work environment where employees were valued in numerous ways starting from date of hire and going forward until it's end. It was demanding, competitive and rewarding work."
good,"Great company and great benefits."
good,There are a lot of rules and regulations to follow as this is a highly regulated field. Freedom to work on other projects depending on your role.
good,Assist Pharmacist with filling prescriptions and also by assist customers that have any questions or need assistance finding something.
good,Too much pressure on tellers to carry the referrals.  Extreme Micro Managing.  Managers don't run their own centers anymore. Bankers answer to an alternate manager.  Standard P&L doesn't seem to be the model anymore.
good,"Love the company benefits especially the child care assistant program. The company also have other assistant program offered to the employees. However, inexperienced management leading the team. In some cases, the tech does the work and the management received all the credits. Sometimes, you can spend your time and effort in the department working beyond your work expectations but at the end, you get nothing in return. I think sometimes the department you are working can be so politic that you get recognized because who you know not how good you perform in your work."
good,"Very large global organization with plenty of room for career growth. However, because it is such a large global organization, at times you will feel like just a number."
good,working for Bank of America is good but there are times when you feel that the company is Too big of an organization to allow for effective communication.
good,One of the better banking company to learn about banking industry. There is stress on work life balance. There are regular fun events all round the year to keep everyone in good spirits.
good,"A typical day at work is processing customer transactions, inquiries, and adjustments. I've learned that everyone is different, and patience is a virtue. I management my time to make the work flow more manageable. My co-workers are like family because we all help each other to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the customer is satisfied."
good,"Fun environment, competitive in a not bad way. Options for work schedules. Great benefits. Room to move up and move around."
good,great company meet so many new an amazing people great hours great pay and parking was provided but for me it was a little too far but great experience none the less

good,A typical day in the office includes handling and dealing with complaints recieved by the bank from the customers with regards to their miss-sold PPI. A target driven enviroment which requires you to hit strict deadline.
good,"Overall, my experience with Bank of America was not enjoyable. The best part of the job for me was being able to help with training new employees. It allowed me to be off the phone for most of the day. I also enjoyed the chance to lead and educate new employees. The daily grind of being on the phone all day wore on me. The managers were good and most of them understood the job I was doing and would help."
good,"Comprehensive training is offered for employees to excel. The hardest part of the job is meeting quotas.A typical day includes reviewing loan data,communicating with other agencies and borrowers to ensure a speedy loan modification process."

good,"Answer phone calls at a call center regarding small business credit cards, management helped with answers, loved to help people with their issues"
good,"Learned several new aspects on the financial industry and the banking sector. The typical day will be conducting opening procedures, accounting for all currency and preparing for the days work. The end of the day would comprise of accounting for currency and accuracy on transactions, then conducting closing procedures. All co-workers were willing to help and engage with other co-workers. The entire staff worked as a team, especially when understaffed. The job consisted of engaging with costumers and businesses to improve their financial lives and complete their financial transactions."
good,"My job requires processing routine transaction, helping customers fill out deposit and withdrawal slips, disbursing money to customers, assisting customers at the drive-through window, promoting bank products, reporting suspicious activity to the police, and being able to maintain a balanced drawer."

good,"My experience with Bank of America was a very challenging, yet rewarding one. There was always something new to learn. The most challenging part was waiting for others to complete their portion of the assigned work before moving on."
good,The company does not pay well and the experienced workers are over looked. Too much work and not enough help. The company needs to reward their workers.
good,This bank of america is high volume and never had the employees nor the hours to maintain a high customer service. The management treated the employees very well.
good,Customer service answer questions referenced to auto loans. Goal oriented but very difficult management to deal with
good,"Bank of America is in the throes of new regulations and longtime hangovers from its acquisitions of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide.  Given the difficulties in generating topline growth, management is laser-focused on expense controls and in evaluating business lines for growth potential, or lack thereof."

good,"Overall BOA was an exciting company I learned a lot regarding the mortgage industry. To approve of BOA CEO, as far as my knowledge and the information i was privy to obtain, I cannot state a yes or no. As far as I am aware it was a business decision."
good,"All aspects of running a bank,  Ordering money, click to staff ICOMM audits filed wires, foreign currency.  Bank of America was an extremely great place to work for. I just wanted more."
good,"Data Center operations "
good,Bank of America provides good entry level business banker positions.  Training is limited and advancement is difficult.  You feel like just another number.
good,I like the position I was in but the thing with me is that I enjoy working with my hands and fixing things and even if I don't know how to fix something I'll do my best to try to learn how to fix.
good,"not to much more to say about the job, running the machines and dealing with a lot of noise on a regular basis. work basically by yourself"

good,"BofA is a great places to work if you are looking for career advancement however having worked in retail for 6 years then transitioning over to corporate I quickly learned the corporate associates are much more rewarded and valued compared to retail. Like most major corps BofA caters to the wealthy clients and leave the scraps for everyone else. It is a very cutthroat environment, the banking center's goals are outrageous, the bonuses in retail suck, they work those poor retail people like slaves (no breaks, lack of staff, etc) and the people working in corporate talk down about the retail workers. I've witnessed first hand a corporate banker telling a client that everyone in retail is stupid very disgusting. There is a serious disconnect between the banking center and the rest of the company. I truly feel bad for those stuck in retail although it is a great environment for learning BofA does not value them at all."
good,The only issues with this position is having to be on your feet all day long but other than that the hours were good and the pay was good.
good,Had fun work group while working there about almost eight years ago. There were lots of smarts people in this touch industry.

good,"Unbending work conditions, good culture and co-workers, management was sometimes unaware. System issues and equipment that was not even across the board for al employees made completing daily tasks difficult at times. Commute was too far for myself. Job security was an issue and not knowing if you would have a job from day to day based on constantly changing rules!"

good,I was not there long enough to rate this company. It was not for me so I had to move on. I needed something that was more up to beat and more active for my lifestyle.
good,"Typical day at work includes answering the phones and assisting with customer and associate requests.  I have learned more patience and gentility when assisting customers and associates.  Management and Co-workers are extremely helpful, kind, and knowledgeable.  The hardest part of the job is having to deliver hard new to the customers in regards to decisions on their applications.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the associates and when you are able to provide great news to customers."
good,"My time with Bank of America has taught me a great deal of new skills within the Banking industry.  From customer service, fraud for government and small business, collections, and now mortgage I can say that I'm qualified to handle this position as a loan processor.  My day is very busy with many different task that has to be completed before my work day ends.  I have to return high priority loans first.  Then call customers that require additional assistance to complete modifications, short sales, deed in lieu, and all other matters of retention.  Career Advancement is at a stand still for the moment."
good,I had two jobs there. I was a mail clerk and a billing processor. I was pregnant at the time and it was really hard staying up that late and coming up early. Co workers were okay to work with. I would get the mail and start filing by zip codes in the mail bin. Then I got promoted to a billing processor which was data entry with checks.
good,"Great job as far as the banking industry goes. Benefits were best "
good,"My typical day at work includes contacting bankruptcy and discharged customers/attorneys in regards to past due mortgage accounts to try and find a resolution to their current situation ( bringing the loan current, modification,short sale,or Deed and Lieu)  ...

I work with a great group of people who are always willing and ready to learn. The hardest part of my job is telling customers that I am unable to assist them in trying to save their home... The best part of my job is helping our customers find solutions that best fit there needs and financial situation."
good,"Bank of America is a good company.  However, depending on the career path you want to pursue, it can be difficult to move in one direction.  They encourage movement but most of the time it is laterally without much increase in pay.  The benefits are great though and some jobs like mine have the ability to work from home frequently."

good,"Job location: Jersey City, New Jersey."
good,the co workers were the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was to deal with all of the changes that happened on a daily basis.
good,"I was hired in a department that was disintegrating before my arrival.  After about nine weeks of ineffective training,  I was sent on to the floor where I would actually learn what I was supposed to do.  Everyday I struggled to get through at least five loans which  somedays was a lot easier than others.  I was put on a team with a lot of already experienced employees, and my manager was more focused on seeing me reach my numbers than actually helping me be the best employee I could be.  I received no help from the team, in fact when I couldn't reach my numbers the manager opened up my queue to everyone and they took all of my easiest loans making it impossible for me to make more than about two a day.  "
good,This was not a company to work for if you like structure. Things always changed and management did not stick to promises that where given.
good,"We took inbound calls from high end credit card customers to active, answer any questions regarding accounts and perform balance transfers. I learned how to interact more effectively with customer in regards to sales and trust. The hardest part of my job was gaining the trust of the customer to perform the balance transfer."
good,It is a past paced work place focused on customer service and sale.  Learn new things and work efficiently to provide excellent customer service in a timely fashion.  Co workers are helpful and friendly.The hardest part of this job is to accomplish assigned sales goals.  the most enjoyable part of the this job is providing and interaction with customers.

Assisted a senior financial advisor to create new business development initiatives such as cold-calling; warm-calling; seminars; and attending networking events."
good,"The work environment was very professional, but, during the mortgage crisis, it was purchased. I was first offered a position, but, somehow the promise was canceled after I skipped a week - I was unable to make it for the last week. I was told because I was not good at communication."
good,"decent opportunities, company under constant stress to reduce workforce expenses.  Constant reorgs and layoffs prove difficult to contend with."
good,"I handled everything to do with a customers account, I worked on a team of about 20 representatives. I learned how to de-escalate angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a team."
good,"A typical day included escrow, taxes and insurance issues.  Qualifying customers for lower payments, but very difficult to hear about foreclosures on their homes."
good,"Good, when you are allowed to work closely with others outside of your department.  Our work is so specialized that we have to create opportunity to do so."
good,"The individual who hired me left the bank before my start date along with 99% of the staff because of technical issues with a new application system that made it virtually impossible to get loans closed. I was stuck at this point because I'd already committed to the position. "
good,"Working alongside each and every one of my collegues has been an amazing experience.  We have had many stressful challenges that were overcome by our enjoyment in making a difference.   We are all team players that care about our work product, which is why we all are a growing success. We never stop caring and remember there is no “I” in team."
good,"I work for Bank of America Asian Blended Department. The department itself is not bad once you have a good understanding of the culture there. The pay is on par with most other similar positions, but the benefits and vacations puts it over the top. There is enough down time for you to not feel overwhelmed. This is a job that can make you so comfortable that you'll never want to leave. If you do want to move up in the company, however, you'll need to try to jump to another department or line of business and start over. Advancement can be a hit or miss, as it's not purely based on performance. At least in this department, it's more important to develop a good relationship with your many mangers and have a good image, than to perform your job well. It's a good place to learn banking knowledge and gain experience."
good,did not like part time hours. room for growth opportunities. employee favoritism. more hours would have been great. manager immature.
good,A typical financial company with lots ups and down during my stay. Lots of movement within the department and slow towards the change
good,"Lots of work from home opportunities outside of production. Lots of responsibilities when managing, all day conferencing calls that go into the evening."
good,"Though not exactly 9 to 5 job, I get enough time for family. Company offers compensation that is usually little less than market average. Frequent lay-offs is difficult to handle. Management is not so great. So intra-team issues are there."
good,"employe benefits are good , but culture seems to be lethargic."
good,"I had a blast working for this company because I learned how to use a proof operating machine, 10 key machine, proof reading and encoding a check, and finally balancing and reconciling the banks daily transactions."
good,"Bank of America was an enjoyable place to work. The salary was great and the team I worked with was great. Takes some time to move up the ladder at BOA, but when you finally do move up you're so ready for the role."
good,"The company treats it's employees fairly."
good,Trading floor is busy. Everything needs to be handled fast. It does not seem to have a lot of room to develop your career. The management is not good as well.

good,You are just a number at this company. Little room for advancement. The co-workers are good. Management was good. Feel like the company does not care about you.
good,"Typical day at work was coming in at midnight, processing checks, talking to co-workers, eating and sleeping when bored. My co-workers were on the older side, I was one of the youngest working there. They were very insightful! I loved working with them. The hardest part there was staying awake when bored. There was a lot of down time. I loved the environment and the people I worked with."
good,"Great opportunities, job securities and growth potential. Salary is not comparable to work required. Would like to see Bank of America become more organize. To big to fail compromises organization."
good,"nice environment, wonderful people.  Work is interesting.  Would be rewarding if so many customers did not feel they were being taken advantage of by the high overdraft.  It's sad!  This institution is for the rich, not for the blue collar."

That might not seem like that much, but when the other two to three tellers do the same, you get the idea how many people come in. I've learned a lot of things, but most importantly I've learned about confidence. When I was first starting I felt like it was every other day I had a customer angry at me because of something I said or did. It wasn't because I wasn't giving them the proper information or regulations but because I would say it in a way that sounded like I was unsure.

Each one had it's own work ethic; one more laid back,  the other more competitive, and one was one of the most micromanaged departments I've ever belonged to.

Currently, delinquencies have plummetted and the need for so many employees has dropped considerably. Change is something that you have to embrace to work here as new policies, procedures, templates, and guidelines are introduced almost daily.

I learnt how to handle tricky customers in a polite and professional manner, as well as using new systems and working as a team. sometimes the management wasn't as supportive as it could have been, as I had 3 different managers in the months I was there. I did enjoy working in my team with my team mates, I could always count on them and myself to make it a fun atmosphere. although the job itself can get very repetative as you get used to the calls, I did enjoy the monthly bonuses, and friendly team competition to liven up the place."

Clients with service needs would be transition into a relationship review in order to see  what other products would be helpful for them.  In addition I would walk the teller line to see if any clients just need a straight check deposit and help them with their deposit and see what other products the client would benefit from. I have goals to refer to our business partner(Merrill Edge, Mortgage, Small Business banker and Merchant) My Co Workers are nice but everyone is trying to make their numbers as best as possible.

Normally a day in the life includes sitting with my customers and making sure they are on the path to reaching their goals.  With a line of questioning I am able to uncover needs and goals that the customers' have in sight and even uncovering that one thing that keeps them up at night.

good,"No two days were alike and I never knew what to expect from day to day other than the typical required daily responsibilities.  With that said, each day brought new challenges of which i always succeeded in over coming and getting the required task completed efficiently and effectively.  The associates, for the most part, are like family and we always worked well together. I would say the hardest part of the job was never knowing what the day would bring.  Some days I would work 8 - 9 hours and others I would work 10-12 hours; often times involved in numerous meetings/calls."

good,the company is too tight on money at the moment. I can't recommend working for this organization and finding happiness in it.

good,Always go above and beyond to help clients in everyday needs.
good,I worked at Bank of America part time. I was a pretty good first job and the benefits were great.

During my time at Merrill Lynch, I learned a plethora about a variety of financial products, how to develop new business in a high net worth market, analyze financial markets, and build portfolios, while giving objective advise to clients and prospects.  My management is strong in many areas, and weak in others. My coworkers are helpful.  However, I am one of the youngest professionals in our office.

I learn that managing over 30 people is not just submitting time, vacation and sitting in an office. Its really about listening to your employees and being available. The hardest part of my job was waking up in the morning. The most enjoyable part of my job was having an awesome day of production and breaking production records all the time"
good,"Working for BOA was a great learning experience. A typical day was very demanding and busy, management was always available to answer questions regarding questions we could not answer for the customer.

good,"mediocre culture - was pretty fun place to work prior to 2008 - right now it's more of a CYA environment and leadership is weak.  Certainly, given Countrywide purchase and dealing with Legacy Asset Servicing - the organization is really just trying to weather the storm.  Not a lot of emphasis on growth ..much more focused on mitigating risk."
good,"Since the crisis of 2007+, BAC has become so extraordinarily risk averse that it cannot innovate."
good,"having the opportunity to meet new faces daily while providing customer service can be both rewarding and challenging.  However to have exposure to various aspects of the a job gave me an opportunity to gain more knowledge, experiences, and skills to advance my career."
good,employees do not stay to long in the department I worked.  You are on the phones and are not able to have anything to snack on or drink at your desk.  It was also very cold.
good,They were located at in Pittsburgh.  It was a very structured work environment doing the same task day in and day out.
good,"Typical day is getting to your workstation and getting your PC up and running.  Organization is the key!  Co-workers were great!  The hardest part of job some days was multitasking to the max!  Customers calling constantly and you want to give them as much time as possible to hear what they need and get them to where they want to be or need to be.  I learned how to multitask to the max!  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers who were looking for loans and were approved and in some situations it was a dire need to get the loan for a ""must have"" situation.  It was great being able to assist our customers."

good,"Great benefits.  The pay, unfortunately, does not match all the work that is done in my department.  I have learned a lot about short sale negotiations from a major bank's point of view.  In a typical day I manage a port of approximately 60 files.  I contact agents and homeowners in an effort to get them through the short sale process as quickly as possible, while still mitigating as much loss for the bank as possible.  My co-workers have a negative attitude for the most part, so that is tough, as I am normally a very happy go-lucky individual.  The hardest part of the job is handling the workload and keeping the customer engaged.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the distressed customers and meeting my many metrics each month."
good,The perks were great I refuse to talk negatively about a company. But the pay was good and the perks were great.
good,Working here shows me that there is a lot of input from different banking centers to customers and to people who suffer from unfortunate circumstances. Working here shows me the awareness of the several different communities where a helping hand was needed.

good,district managers routinely drop in to try to catch you doing something wrong.
good,"A typical workday would start with security procedures to ensure safety while opening branch and then getting the money drawers out and having daily group meetings. Customer service was the number one priority as well as speed and accuracy. There would be times when customers had difficulties and I myself, would advise and do what I could for them. If the problem was above my area of expertise, I would make sure that the customer received help from the appropriate associate. At the end of the day we would again secure all vaults and private information set all alarms and leave."

good,My day to day life at Bank of America consisted of a very fast paced environment. Bank of America makes a lot of changes in policies in a short time span so at this job I've had to learn a lot on the fly and prove that I'm up for a challenge. I learned to be on my toes and think outside of the box to help our customers. My co-workers were all very friendly and very customer service oriented. Upper Management was fine as well. There were a select few in the upper management role that took me under their wing to try and mentor and learn from to improve my skills. The hardest part of my job being in the mortgage industry is telling someone we can't offer them assistance and that they are going to lose their home.

good,Love their training programs which helped flex my leadership muscles

good,"Typical day at work consisted of our Opening Proceedures, daily huddles in the morning and everyone getting ready for our day. As in the banking business, my job consisted of a lot of one on one customer service and daily product opening as well as a lot of cross selling.  I have learned a lot at my job, I trained in Teller, Teller Operations and Sales and Service.  It was a rewarding experience.

The hardest part of the job at time is the learning curve that presents it self at times. I enjoy my co-workers very much we all share a common bond.
good,"The company has its benefits of being one of the largest banks in the country, however, the fact that the growth has not come organically comes at a price. The constant revolving door of leadership and direction does not give the company the opportunity to achieve the real benefit of the synergies of the various mergers. The uncertainty also leads to the anxiety of employees of the company because of the constant lay-offs that occur."
good,"I have been in the customer service industry for the past five years. My most recent experience has been handling incoming calls in the high tech industry. One reason I particularly enjoy this business, and the challenges that go along with it, is the opportunity to connect with people. In my last job, I formed some significant customer relationships resulting in a 30 percent increase in modification in a matter of months."""
good,"The hardest part of my job was being able to explain to customers how to troubleshoot the online banking. However, through the years I learned to let the customer take their time to allow the customer to feel like the control is theirs. I enjoyed my job because I was able to help people everyday"

We have to engage the customer in conversation to make a sale. Bank of America says we want to improve service, but continues to push sales. Our customers do not want to speak to representatives, and do not want to be sold anything. They state this in the customer surveys, but they continue to be routed to representatives."

good,It has been an overall pleasure to work for such a big company. They have allowed me to relocate due to the different departments and banking centers they have.
good,Some pros are the discounts we get and the paid vacation and sick time. If you do not mind working basically every Saturday then the hours are pretty good. They are very strict with us meeting referral numbers and are pretty much on our backs about them every minute. Customers can be pretty rude and out of hand when it comes to their money.

Open the main vault and night drop vault, order money for the banking center, take care of the ATM machines and make sure all of my tellers had enough money to begin the day.  I would also talk to my tellers about referrals that they needed.  Management loved referrals becuase of the sales. I supervied my tellers, made sure they and our customers were happy.  I would talk with the banking center manager to se if there was anything new that the bank wanted tellers to do - new products to talk about.  I would check supplies though out the day.

I work with a bunch hard working dedicated individuals that pride themselves on doing well at their job responsibilities. One of the hardest parts of my job would have to be knowing that balance and not taking the job home with me daily.

good,"I was a teller for Bank of America for almost two years. During the whole time I never received a raised. A raised is based on the performance of the banking center rather than the individual. I worked at two different banking centers and both were short of staff. It made it difficult to work and our banking centers always suffered some way because if it, since we were always pretty busy. The work culture is great though, for the most part. I got along with all of co workers at each center, it was like a little family."
good,Hard work dedication pays off and at this company. I only worked here for a short period of time but it was an enjoyable experience.
good,ok if you like the banking environment. Exposure to a lot of technology and large scale system solutions.  Downside: very regimented and too many controls. Again it depends on what type of work environments one likes.
good,Two years I was in bank of america as a top producer for a loan servicing position over the phone. Regardless of how much you try to apply to other areas of the bank it seems like there's no way of changing positions. It's also very important to mention that they're decreasing drastically their mortgage division so it's would probably be a bad call to join any position they have related to mortgage right now.
good,"6 years BOA claims process experience"
good,An excellent investment house which really focuses on the needs of its customers. 
good,This was an average job with average pay and benefits. Very political
good,"Working for Bank of America, gave me more business insight to keep my options open in my career and the employees was just like family, we done many things together."
good,"Supported Fees Due Mortgage Accounting group with ad hoc projects, monthly reporting, review of processes. "
good,its a good company to work but growth and salary increment is very low.
good,"This position allowed me the opportunity to learn the banking industry and its products. The most demanding part for me being in a call center environment was fielding calls in a cubicle 8 hours/day, 5 days/week. And, handling customer issues in the acceptable AHT set by the bank. The most satisfying part of this position, was turning an upset customer into a satisfied customer whose expectations I had exceeded by the end of the call."
good,"I worked there part time during my last years of college.  It was a great part time job, but I don't know if I would have wanted to work there full time.  My manager didn't treat us very well.  She was much for herself where as when you work in a small office it should be more like a team atmosphere."
good,"Dynamic group who's rapid growth came to a sudden halt when the market turned."
good,"Long days, but worth it when you are helping someone save their home which in turn will be their biggest investment."
good,"I did not work in regular retail banking so my story is a little different. I was promoted three times in a year - that's how much my manager believed in me and my skills. The hours were great, 2pm to around 9 or 10. Since I was a PT student, it was perfect!"
good,National bank with leading practices meeting mortgage banking and real estate needs.  
good,This was a great entry level position following college.  Got me into the industry.
good,"Good people in financial business. Shift patterns vary, very good training."
good,I usually get to work about 15-20 minutes early and get my computer running so i can start promptly at 8. Before i know it its break time and i am about half way to my self-created daily goal. When i get back from break lunch seems to have snuck on my even quicker than my first break did and i usually find i have hit my daily goals half way through my day. Once lunch is over i pass by my managers desk to see if there is anything in addition to my regular job function that he would like for me to do and if not i either get back to work or do some side by sides to help other on my team by sharing some of my best practices or maybe different methods of collecting. The day usually ends slow with lower than average call volume and i usually go home a little after 4:30 ready to start the next day.
good,"good pay, impossible to get incentive, hours take your whole day."
good,"Solid stipend 3-days/week internship during Summer."
good,"Great place to gain experience."
good,Position required excellent communications and administrative skills.
good,flexible hours and a great workplace for experienced executives
good,I would typically be in charge of a portfolio of customers that had credit cards that were past due.  I would have to try and negotiate payment programs with the customers in order to collect on them successfully every month.  I was given the appropriate tools in order to be able to obtain that goal but you had to have a certain level of people skills in order to really make it work for you.  My co-workers were fun and competitive and it kept things interesting in the workplace.  The hardest part of the job was making sure that you were able to keep the arrangements that you made with the customer so that you would prevent loan losses at the end of each month.  I enjoyed actually talking to the customers and making them feel like I wasn't pressuring them into doing something that they could or couldn't do and getting a big thank you at the end of the conversation.
good,Working environment is good. Good oppurtunies for growth and flexibilty in Work
good,It helped me to hone my computer skills and I learned to use Outlook. Kind of a high turnover rate. The company did a good job of trying to develop a team atmosphere. The work availability was inconsistent.

good,inbound & outband collections leader for 5+ thru 180 day delinquencies
good,"Telephone sales and support"
good,Ok to work for if you like routine work without challenges. Opportunities are broad. Must have good networking skills to get ahead. 
good,"Very fast-paced environment, must know how to be able to multi-task .  Co-workers were friendly and nice environment. "
good,"I like working for bank of America, but I feel that the pay is not what it should be especially for people like myself with advanced degrees. I also travel a total of 500 miles a week and if late due to trafiic I can still receive a occurrence which I feel is unfair. Also why give employees sick days if they are going to get penalized when they use one, that makes no sense. All in all it's a job."
good,"Great place to grow and florish."
good,"This is a great company to work for, I started in the early 80's.I enjoy the chance to grow and learn different challenges"
good,"Assisted customers with their mortgage and HELOC questions, gave clients a breakdown of their escrow payments. I learned a lot about the mortgage industry. Management was good. "
good,"BofA had a good way of making you feel unsure about your job on a regular basis.  Upper management changed constantly, and so did the way the branches were ran."
good,What I like most about the job is the challenge of having a new situation to help with every time that phone rang. It was like having a mystery to solve. And knowing that you can help a person really gives you a good feeling inside.
good,"to meet and talk to customer. A lot of training, Co-work very friendly,the hardest part of the job are to meet the goal,"
good,"Bank Of America was one of the companies I worked for a short period of time. My position at the Bank of America was as a Sales and Service Specialist. My duties were to handle customer service issues, and be able to provide customers with the newest services that Bank of America provides."
good,"Co workers and management are great.  However this job is dead end, and gets boring really fast."
good,"Great benefits, really good company to work for. I received plenty of experience"
good,This was my job while I was in college. Great for paying rent and college expensive but wasn't my career choice. 
good,"I was a Teller with BOA for one year. The pay was ok, the benefits also ok. The best part of the job was the M-F work hours. Mgt, was very easy to fire people for not meeting sales goal- ( 2 per shift) even after being with company 30 plus years. No raises, bonsues werent a lot for a billion dollar company. Better banking companies out there to work for.  "
good,"A typical day at work consists of reaching out to delinquent mortgage customers regarding there delinquency. Goal is to bring there account current however if that is not possible, I am required to do a detailed evaluation by looking over the account & asking questions regarding there current status to determine if assistance is available for them. I provide counseling as well. My co-workers are great & we all make a great team. Hardest part of work I think will be the constant changes. Most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that once you know what you are doing & you do your job correctly there is no hassle. "
good,"Was a fine corporation to work for, I just needed a full time position and none were available so I had to move on."
good,Co-workers were very nice. Trainers were helpful. Hardest part of the job was being confined at desk for such long periods of time. Co-workers were great and fun
good,"At first the Bank was fantastic to work with due to amazing benefits.  It was overall a great place to work.  It seemed like the bank truly valued their employees.  After a year, things changed. Due to the bank losing money, a lot of things were cut back.  Soon it seemed that the bank was no longer valuing their employees."
good,My typical day is processing checks in production environment. I work under time and quality goals. 
good,"The job itself is easy but the structure of the customer service is very inconsistent. In the mortgage world it is a rough time for people, but the company focuses more on selling customers products that are beneficial but the homeowners can barely pay their mortgage. And also they push customer service surveys which they say it represents the individual customer service rep but in reality the survey questions and answers from the customer is about the company, so any bad thing said goes against the rep."
good,It is an ok job and can open a lot of doors for future employment opportunities
good,"below are my pros and cons for working at bank of america. ive been a collector, customer relationship manager and a home servicing specialist."
good,overwork underpay no opportunity to learn any transferable skills
good,"Productive ok place to work. They offer great benefits and the pay is decent. However, other companies offer better competitive rates. Management needs some improvement."
good,Overall good work environment. The hardest part of job is learning the job once you get on the floor total different from what you learned in training. There was no hands on the system to much reliance on powerpoint and side by sides to understand how the system would work.
good,It's a very resourceful company.
good,"Fun ineteracetion with customers, employee interaction was awesome. Co-workers were great to work with, we worked as a team:)"
good,•Manage assigned portfolio of FHA residential loans from homeowners requesting modification assistance. Establish relationships and maintain effective interactions with internal and external business partners.
good,"This is a company where you can learn a great deal about home mortgages and the legalities associated with them. Also, there is great emphasis on compliance at this company. This is added knowledge for which I am grateful."
good,"In the beginning I could go to work & have the satisfaction of knowing I was able to resolved all of my customers needs, unfortunately, the recent rescession caused the management to change the work environment when they installed restrictions that allowed us to fully help the customer"
good,Good management and colleagues to work and a very good challenging Q A role played in the team made me work with enjoying in the job. It made me learn how to tackle with the employees who went wrong in their quality part of job. This made me analyze the root cause of the process where it is going wrong and implement training sessions on the process knowledge to the employees to improve quality. The hardest part of the job was informing the employees and giving feedback to them on their error part of the job. The most typical day at work for me was when I took the responsibility of the whole team on my supervisor was in leave and all the systems were down due to technical issue and need to send the quality report to Line Of Business(LOB) by next day as it was scheduled earlier and sent in time. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was recognized as the first person to knock the door of the JDI project(Just Do In Time which is Six Sigma project) which reduced the 5.4 man hours per day in the process.
good,Coordination of appraisals for loans processed through bank.
good,"Everything was too repetative. The goals were not always attainable. As long you placed an effort in achieving your goals, you would keep your job. For those going above and beyond their job duties, upper management did not properly compensate them."
good,"Completed customer requests submitted via email, phone, and mail. Typical requests were: opening/closing acounts, setting up/deleting services, reconciling accounts, making necessary account adjustments and/or corrections. The most important part of the job was the relationship with the client. My co-workers specifically (pod members) were a wealth of knowledge and a great support team due to their experience with various departments and years of service. Building relationships with new clients or clients with previous undesirable experiences can definitely be a challenge. However with time and dedication the relationship will develop. Each and every client was unique whom left lasting impressions. There were constant changes within the management team the last three and a half years which created an instability in the department."
good,"Forgettable job, with overworked employees who were often stressed and it showed in the high turnaround the company had for that department."
good,Great place to start a career.
good,Hired away from Kidder Peabody to join their institutional options department. Potential for advancement was certainly there but was coaxed away to join my former boss at his new firm.
good,Nice co-workers.
good,Working here is fine but there is uncertainty in the air with layoffs and site closures.
good,These were all one year assignments. All were satisfactory. Writing more would not help any reviewer. Thank you.

good,"working with machines all the time, diffirent machines and papers, consideration, teamwork, the end of the month work too many hours,"
good,"Great place to work for, lots of perks & incentives. Friendly co-workers with moral."
good,It's OK. Its not great but its a pay check. The workload is not too bad however there is a significant lack of direction when it comes to goals and scope.
good,Very challenging dealing with the new software. I had to find a way to avoid accounting errors due to knew software.

good,Did not see much advancement going on and pay was well below what they can spare but overall mediocre
good,Customer focused position requiring employees to advise wealthy Bank of America clients on financial and tax related matters.
good,- good benefits
good,The company is still facing a lot of changes. Typically what you do and who your managers are can change every 6 months. There isn't a lot of opportunity for growth at the moment either as the company is still reforming from the recession. The good part is there are opportunities to grow and learn new things. I expect the environment will eventually get better in the next few years.
good,answer calls assist customers with balances and inquiry. its a fun and productive work place management is very helpful. there to assist with all needs and questions.

good,the goals is very high but i enjoy working with the customers
good,the managers are poor and do not try to keep everyone happy. I have religious meetings every saturday and they are giving me a hard time about getting them off. Religious discrimination if you ask me.
good,received incoming calls from members that were calling to see if they were elgible for a modification.
good,"In a typical day at work, when I get in, I check my reports, answer any email issues, and then start to do quality control audits. I have a meeting every day, conference calls several times per week and I try to have a Team Huddle every week, but other than that, my time is spent doing audits. Checking loans that are ready for closing to be sure there was nothing missed, by either the processor or the underwriter. My manager is great! He's level-headed, easy to work for, and understands my plight, however he is just as helpless as I am to help my people streamline what has become a cumbersome process and tedious to do thanks to the number of tasks assigned for them to do with each transaction. We are working on an antiquated system that desperately needs to be moved to the 20th Century (it's DOS based) and yet production goals remain somewhat high in the hopes that one can do their job even despite systems constraints."
good,Grow Business porfolio through cross sell of existing customers and business acquistion.
good,oversaw vault operations. Processed Customer orders.Management was very helpful.
good,"decent benefits, strives to always do they right thing, gets a bad rap for the mortgage industry failure. Good policies and procedures in place."

Ready the desk for work, start work at 8.00 AM. which is my scheduled start time. After noon half hour lunch between 15 min x breaks and leave the desk at 5.00 PM, driving back home reached around 6.00 because of the traffic. Repeat the same thing in next day till Friday."
good,"the most enjoyable was being able to make the customers happy my cheerfulness was a nice change from the other banks, the hardest part was probly doing the night drop bags that we had to ship off with a armored currier, co workers were great very friendly and it can get hard working in such tight spaces, management was always there for you to help you they were always very encouraging to help you move up through the company, i learned alot more to elaberate from my last teller job, i learned to run a larger drive through more effeciently, i learned more about how to operate the vault, i learned how to operate the logs for the safty deposit boxes, i learned how to help with some of the training of new employees, they also taught me how to start cross selling to the customers, a typical day would be coming in doing the night drop opening the drive through then openeing the lobby and getting your drawers and work the transactions till it is time to balance and you have to make sure you are not leaving the area with no one to help the customers and then once you see you are balance put up your drawer but if you are not balanced then you have to look through the transactions from the day to find where you messed up and fix it, then close the branch"

good,"Bank of america is an overall good company to work for, my only complaint is lack of promotion opportunities, managment lacks the proper skills to develop their employees for higher positions."
good,"My work week is from 7-3:30 monday tru friday. The learning experience has been great. I love working with all of my co workers, even management. Lol it's been a good job to have but there is no job security in the banking field unless you are at the top of the ladder."
good,the training could be better and so could the pay. BOA requires more than other banks.
good,The most enjoyable part is working with people
good,this was a good job how ever the times that they needed their employees where very complicated since the work routine would change every week.
good,The hardest part of the job was listening to customer tell you about their situations.
good,"If you are looking for a position that does not require much mobility or physical activity and you enjoy speaking with people from diverse backgrounds as well as problem resolution, then Bank of America is a good fit."

good,"Making new business relationships, customer service, Outsource new business relationship and sustaining the current ones, sales and service. Learned, that I love Finance, accounting, and a lot about corporate environments. Well as a manager it was challenging and refreshing at the same time. I made great friends; I no longer call them just co-workers. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help someone who really needed it, do to my hands being tied. The most enjoyable part, overcoming obstacles."
good,Bank of America values their employees just like they value their customers. Always room for advancement.
good,"Each day was pretty typical although sometimes slow since most of our work would come from other employees, management was always pretty cool it was great having bosses that didn't hover. I learned tons about anti-money laundering and strengthened my administrative skills. The most annoying part was the redundancy and room to grow but the best part I have to say was my co-workers."
good,I truly enjoy the company of my coworkers and the family like atmosphere that is developed.
good,"Good starting place for many. Some can make careers here but with it being a midwest bank the branching out to other city, states becomes limited. They do make sure all laws and rules are followed and they do whatever they can to make employees feel safe and comfortable."
good,Great experience. Worked with some very intelligent people.
good,One thing learned is how working together as a team helps each individual co-worker reach his/her daily goals as well as team goals.
good,"A typical day is very fast paced and the day goes by quickly. My co-workers are very hard working and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is the work load, but with my team mates we all manage to get it all done."

good,"Good company to work for, good benefits, and competitive salary's."
good,great coworkers to work with and we always had a good time there
good,I love working for call centers and have done so for the last 20 years. This call center however does not allow you to reach your goals without moving the mark consistantly making you feel unsuccessful. There are too many regulations that are virtually impossible to know and yet you are help responsible for them.
good,Bank of America is a good place to start a career in the financial services industry. However due to the rapid growth and acquisition of multiple companies there is often confusion and lack of direction for its leaders and associates. The company has above average benefits and is committed to reinvesting in the communities it has brick and mortar locations. Work Life balance can be obtained through all the various positions the bank has to offer.
good,Great job for banking professionals. Get to spend time with good employees and customers.
good,"work was always busy. ive learned that epathy is a way in getting to know your customer and will determine how your call will end. i love customer service due to fact i treat customers as i would like to be treated. with respect. hardest part of my job was that i had to explain to customers their credit card has fraud and not being able to release funds when funds are available due to fraud protection. most enjoyable part of my job was not knowing what type a call i was about to receicve, lost or stolen credit card calls or the severity of situtation. all has to be treated with great customer satisfaction"

good,Excelente estrutura organizacional.
good,Managed options back office.
good,This company no longer exist it was merged with other financial companies. Great while it lasted
good,"A typical day at work is one that does not mirror another. Every day is different than the day before. With my position, we have to know the answers to anything the client wants, whether it's Treasury, Accounts, or Credit. We also need to know internal policies and procedures to educate the client team. In addition, risk/aml and compliance play a role in our day to day operations as we're always looking to minimize risk to the bank."
good,I learned a lot and enjoyed my co-workers. I enjoyed being able to help so many customers from different cultures and having relationships with them.
good,The company offers great benefits and depending on what department you work for within the company they really show their appreciation for you. However you must always cover yourself and know your stuff at all times otherwise you will be used and thrown under the bus when things get rough.

good,"BOA was a changing environment before I was released from the company. We went from a customer service environment to a collections and home retention environment. While under the customer service model a typical day consistent of managing my direct report performance objectives based on their previous day's or months performance. I coached them on their opportunity area's as well as commended them on their successes. Me and my peers consistently were in competition as far as metrics. I also was the site facilitor for updated or changing information as far as policies and procedures to which I really enjoyed. The most difficult part of my job was after we converted to the CRM, (customer relationship management) model, a lot of our tools were taken away and we were limited in what we could do for customers who were in pending modification status."
good,Lots of positions as the company has a global reach. There are many different paths to take all under the same roof.
good,"Along with government regulations, the scripts and procedures are always changing. Sometimes they change and you won't know until you're provided a homeowner with wrong information. The management always tries to stay on top of this but the corporate office isn't quick enough with updates."
good,"Still not working live cases and it's been a month. Business is slow. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Management is helpful and makes sure questions are being answered in a timely manner and are open to anything.

good,"I'm glad to have a job, have to always stay prepared for change"
good,"Inside banking center management of tellers and bankers. I started my day around 7:45 and was out most days by 5:00. I coached the team on sales, customer service, problem resolution.

I had a great group of people and customers that made my job so very enjoyable."

Learning that everyday is different so embrace your customers and help them in anyway possible. Understanding what management expects of me and carrying out any demands, while encouraging co-workers to do the same."
good,"Bank of America (BOA) was a great company to work for until the economy crash of 2008. The work environment became very intense and management began the process of cutting jobs without any clear justification other than new government regualations and so call risk factors. The opportunties to grow in the compnay was limited. I can't say I didn't enjoy working at BOA, but the company made a change that wasn't for the better."
good,"A typical day at work included taking 60-100 calls a day, some were irate callers, and others mostly in need of account/online assistance. Average call ranged from 1 min up to 5 mins. Some needing more in depth help took a bit longer. As an associate you are graded and reveiwed on your calls. I learned a lot about excellent customer service, and also, a lot of technical support and IT support. My co workers and direct manager were really very nice, fun people. I really enjoyed getting to know them and being part of a team with them."
good,Management did not respect associates with handicaps. Said they would work with you but did not. Loved the job in Lockbox and loved the communication with clients and other associates.
good,The environment is what is to be expected. It is very professional and quiet.
good,Typical day is helping customers with their transactions as well as meeting daily goals placed on your role as well as within the location. I learned how to help customers in a timely matter and make them feel valuable for the business as well understand what products (new or old) the company offered to the customers to present them to the customers.
good,•Ensured accurate cash reconciliation.
good,"Project Management Consulting services to customer, on-site."
good,worked there 7 years would go back if work came back to portland
good,"At Bank of America we work in groups, so I enjoy the team work environment; and all my co-works are easy to get along with. I do side-by-side with some of them to help raise there numbers on the score board."
good,"I learned 7 new systems, my coworkers are excellent team players which are a blessing and my manager is Great, but my job is only on contract and I need permanent job . I am seeking work and residence in the state of Georgia."
good,"Process bank deposits, in branch transfers and wire transfers, restock lobby and ATM, notarize documents, account inquires and research."
good,"Start work at 8:00am, take inbound customer calls and answered any questions regarding the customers account with the bank. If needed I would inform the customer of any product that would better benefit their banking needs."
good,It was a fun and exciting to work directly with customers to help with their banking needs. Co-workers were always helpful and management was flexible with school schedule.
good,"My current position is all work and I have not learned much because of the lack of training. The current management team I do not have much trust in them, The current group needs a lot of work and the hardest part of this is being trained properly. the most enjoyable part of this job is signing off. i enjoy working for the bank in previous positions."
good,Okay place to work. Not enough pay. bad managers rather work in just service than sales goals
good,• Processed credit applications for eligible customers
good,"It's very hard to move up in Bank of America. It is truly about who you know instead of what you know. There's lots of favoritism with no discretion. There's so much required for an associate but the pay does not match the work load. For instance; an associate is require to be a Customer Service Rep, a Detective for fraudulent accounts and a Claims Rep but is only paid $30,000 with very little chance of making incentive."
good,During the time I have spent at Bank of America I have been able to learn and grow personally and in my leadership skills. I began working as a part time teller and have grown through the ranks of the banking center. I enjoy the task oriented components of my job as well as the leadership role I perform. I find my job rewarding when I can teach an associate something new and see them succeed with the tools I have taught them.
good,"Managed and prepared evaluations for eight empolyees. Prepared annual department budget. Interviewed, hired, and trained new employees. Balancing and matching the workflow with the talents of my staff. We had many deadline to meet so working together to achieve that goal was very important. I had a great staff!"

good,opening up my (folder)portfolio and prioritizing my accounts.
good,"Provided support to a team of financial advisors. Responsible for marketing, correspondence, events, client concierge services, report generation, calendar management, multi-line phone management."
good,Great job for college students. Company offers great benefits and pay. Flexible schedules as well.
good,"A struggling culture, a lot of good people. Banking is changing and this company is swimming upstream."
good,Great company and compensation plan. Training program leaves something to be desired.
good,As a teller my job consist of depositing check and cash. doing change orders for business such as family dollar etc. also answering phones and transfering customers to the right departments.
good,"Customer service, inbound calls, coaching other teammates, toggling between multiple computer applications, problem solving, and maintaining customers accounts"
good,"Merrill Lynch is a great company with an incredible manager in Jupiter, FL."
good,Great work environment and long hours working for customer satisfations through bank operations and courtesies.
good,"I was the only teller there that had a hand full of customers that would only come to see me to do there transaction. I was proud of having these customer. They kept me with a smile on my face. I was always happy to go to work because of my customers. The Management and co-workers was okay but the always made my time there hard, Bank of America is a good company to work for if you were in your 20’s, it’s a good was to start of a career. In your 30’s not some much. I was working for LaSalle Bank before Bank of America too over and made it harder to work there. They never gave you a chance to prove yourself and would write you up for any reason. It could be for your performance down to being 2 minutes late. It was hard for me because I have a family that I hardly every see. In one event my husband had major surgery and I was told that I could not leave until after work hours and I was not able to leave early or take the day off. To me I felt that I was a personal target for that branch manager. I was never comfortable. Personally if I was to go back to the banking industries I would try to work in the back office. They work you hard and there goals was outrageous. They would make us push customers to open account they didn’t need. They are too much into there numbers then there customers. With I always wanted the best for my customers. With Bank of America you could forget about your personal life."
good,I did a lot of computer work
good,"Worked at the Operations Center, would make all the hourly employees work all the holidays like Thanksgiving for no holiday or time and a half pay"
good,Good company to work for. It provides good learning opportunity.
good,I happen to work at branch that was very busy but my co-workers and i work very well together to get done.
good,"I ran the payroll, then I would spend the rest of the day dealing with Clients accounts and any problems that would need adjusting. My Manager was a great guy he did not believe in micro managing so we were self motivated, I had good co-workers it was a good work environment. the hardest part of my job was being able to contact the IRS to help my clients with issues. the most enjoyable part of the job, working with my manager and co-workers"
good,"I love working for BofA when I worked there and always have said I would love to work for them again. Great benefits, pay, was able to promote from within. The down side is that I don't find they value their former employees (those of us laid-off) when it comes to rehiring. I was laid off from there for almost two years before finding a job elsewhere and in those two years I applied for Bank of America jobs for which I was qualified for on a weekly basis and got only two interviews out of the probabley 80 jobs I applied for over the two years. Very disappointed in that aspect of the company."
good,"Typical work day involves sales, service, and operations."
good,"I was there through, and a little before the financial meltdown, so my timing was poor."
good,"This site is closing June 29th. Working here was great, I made many firends. The work process was horrible, ridiculous expectations. More report satisfaction than customer satisfaction."
good,Difficult to progress within the company.
good,Really enjoy working for B of A. Learn alot of different avenues of banking. Co-workers are helpful and great team players.
good,Bank of America is a great company by far with some pretty amazing benefits. But it just so happends they do not like to hire from within for some apprant reason. So for this problem it really brings me dislike some of the managers around this area. I really believe they should promote from within before they hire from else where.
good,This company provided great benefits along with understanding work/life balance. At this time with acquisitions that turned out to be bad ones the company does not offer stability. I would recommend this company if someone was interested in working for them.
good,It was a challenging time for the company when I worked there as they were just going through the acquisition of Fleet Bank.
good,Bank of America does hire the best and they offer a variety of opportunities to grow and expan knowledge in their company. They had great benefits and worked with their employees.
good,Nice place to work always on going education and training a great place for full employment
good,While this company was not for me due to its sheer corporate nature it is hot a bad place to work if you thrive or enjoy much of what comes along with the type of company it has become.
good,- Support multiple operational process improvement and government compliance for national Loss Mitigation (Legacy Asset Services) operations.
good,"A typical day at work would be a team meeting on customer sevice, and how to service them and meet their needs. I learned how to overcome objectives, meet the customer needs, and to up sale. Im always a team player with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when I had to service the elderly with their credit cards and found out that the family members was the ones that was using their cards without their permission. the most enjoyable part of the job was when we were able to get incentives for our hard work."
good,Nice environment. I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot.
good,It was intern
good,"my day if i opened was to get the night deposts, deposted into the correct accounts."
good,"I became a bank of america employee thru a company merger. I would have to say that out of the 12 years I have been in the bank, this is the first area I have been in where after 6mths to a years time, I haven't had the opportunity to learn anything else or advance. I even went so far as to post for other job opportunities in other states (within the company) only to not get a response or be told that I didn't qualify for the job when clearly the list of ""REQUIRED"" skills fell in line with the skills I use on a daily basis with my current position. Its very frustrating at times because anyone who is willing to relocate for a chance at possible job growth (IN MY OPINION) says that this is a person who wants a career with the company and not just a job. To be in a department where there is no room for growth/advancement is very unfortunate."
good,Company looking to expand and move forward with customers who want to keep.their home.
good,work with very intelligent and competitive people. very supportive management team.
good,"Working for this company is a good experience. The company has flexible schedules, good benefits. The downside about working for this company would be their lack of opportunities to move up with the company, and their lack of acknowledgment."
good,handle cash transactions
good,"My day consists of processing financial transactions for Private Wealth Management clients of U.S.Trust clients. Transactions are communicated by email, phone, and in person. The work is always enjoyable for me, even when complex transactions are presented. My manager is very easy to work with, since we have confidence in each other. The clients we deal with are very enjoyable to serve. I have a very pleasant relationship with each and every one of them."
good,My day work starts with checking emails from from US counter part from New jersey. Then spend entire days working on the software bugs/enhancements/change requests. In the evening have call with my US counterpart and have discussion around the same which brings end to the day.
good,Great long term job. Great 401k
good,"My job was mostly in the mail room. I sorted the mail, processed the mail and drove vehicles for executives. I cannot recall anything of real interest except that it does not exist anymore."
good,"The customers were fantastic, the management was not what it should have been. My immediate supervisor was out of this world. I strive to model her expertise."
good,"Worked at BOA for 4 years as a Full-time teller. The job itself is very simple and everyone I worked with were enjoyable and made the job better, The only bad part was the stress thatd be placed on you to sell products (checking accounts, credit cards) even though you'd receive no compensation of any kind for doing so. As I was told once ""You have to sell because you need a job"". When i first started we had 12 tellers. When I left, we were down to 7 and had not hired any more in about 2 years. BOA, in my opinion, doesnt spend their money wisely and doesnt use their resources effectively. Most employees were unhappy so they'd underperform. Keep your employees happy and your customers and business as a whole will be happy as well."
good,BofA Merrill Investment Banking is a shadow of its former self. All the talent has left.
good,"I was only an intern at ML and it was before BoA bought them out, so culture has likely changed quite a bit."
good,"I was employed during the housing crisis and foreclosure frenzy, and this was not a good ""behind the scenes"" experience for me personally. Other than the nature of the work, my co-workers and team manager made my time there easier to get through."
good,"B of A was a employer that offered career growth and opportunities. The growth was limited to your specific field. It was a bit difficult to move between the departments. However, that environment may have changed through time."
good,Enjoyed co-workers but a large corporate organization. Joined organization via an acquisition and job responsibilities and advancement opportunities were limited.
good,"This job is very flexible, dealing with high profile customer information. Very fun environment. Just ready to grow career wise and seeking other advancments."
good,"I was with the bank for almost 7 years. What I liked most was the ability to work from home, internal job movement and the benefits that the bank offered."
good,It was Countrywide before B of A bought them out. When B of A took over it became very micro managed and regulated. The hours that we were required to put in were very stressfull. We had mandatory overtime for a lot of the time I worked for them. They paid well but I dont believe did what was in the best interest of their customers.
good,didn't mind working there. once in awhile felt as if i was under appreacted.
good,This once a great company to work for however over the years and after several mergers the company became more and more focused on the bottom line. Employees second class citizens to the company and which decreased moral within the organization.
good,No advancment opportunity .///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
good,Bank of America holds strong values regarding the way they conduct their business. They appreciate all of their clients and thrive to help them in any way they can. Bank of America holds their employees to a fiduciary standard. The compensation and room for growth is limited.
good,"1. Management has bureaucratic routines and secrecy appears to be part of the job if your not ""in this club""."
good,Helping customers with there accounts can be satisfying. In que calls can become overwhelming.
good,"Mortgage servicing, helping customer make payments, eal with tax and insurance issues"
good,good well know company but growth normally means relocating
good,"I think that Bank of America needs to create more growth for their staff, so they can continue to be challenge and focus on long term goals for the company."
good,"The benefits and pay are great. However, the overall demands for a CSR are insane. We're expected to have eight customers meet with a banker every day. Obviously the goal is to have them sign up for bank products, but because the goal is eight ""butts in the waiting room"" these leads are low quality. "
good,"Bank of America stresses volunteerism at work. Strong guidelines for doing one's job, but no thinking outside the box. Strong heavy handed management style."
good,"The company had great benefits for the employee and family. "
good,At the time I worked for BOA I thought I was happy and enjoyed the company. It wasn't until I left the company that I realized that I was overworked and underpaid by a long shot.
good,"I was a nice place to work. the people were nice. The work schedule was pretty good; 4 days a week, 10+ hours per day. Some of the policies I thought could be improved though"
good,Innovative company. Good benefits. Many career opportunities. Not always customer friendly. More focused on shareholder satisfaction. Technology leader.
good,The company has great benefits pay is good potential for bonus is OK overtime is great co workers are great team players very helpful when help is needed
good,"The benefits are great , but the pay structure and commission need work. Management needs work aswell , there’s no real leadership that you can get a clear cut answer from ."
good,"If you are not Russian, or Indian dont expect them to help you. They dont like white Americans.  Male or female. Upper management ignores this fact, shame!! Else it could be a great place."
good,"If you do the work, stay focused, you will get noticed by the people that you don't think are paid to watch what you do and that's a benefit. They do not shy away from recognizing talent at the executive levels. The management is hit or miss. If you get the right manager on the wrong ego trip, that's who you're going to be dealing with mostly so you have to remain diligent in both the face of valid and silly scrutiny."
good,"The stress of the work depends on the particular team a person will be part of. Considering it's a very big organization, IJP opportunities are plenty. The biggest shortfall is they do not have any variable payout."
good,"I had the distinct honor to work for Bank of America over 19 years. I, albeit too late, the key to a great working experience and life/work balance is find a manager you are a good fit with.  Manage up and take diligent notes."
good,"The place is not as diverse as one would think.  But, I think, you are respected for what you bring to the department.  The opportunity for advancement is very slim as there are so few departments at this location."
good,"Solid, hard-working people, but the culture fosters an environment of competition at the expense of collaboration.  Very little investment in training and development as seniors leaders are often under-prepared for developing their staff and making their teams better.  Very goals-driven culture with limited guidance around the strategies and best practices to achieve those goals.  Great work/life balance and respect for employees' lives outside of work.  Employee involvement in community service and volunteer activities is highly encouraged.  Compensation seems above average though opportunities for promotion and upward mobility are somewhat limited."
good,"It is a decent place with decent benefits. The hours were crazy giving us an hour and a half lunches to keep us all day. They cut down on people so there was almost no help for a heavy urban branch. Sales were required at the teller line and that influenced your minimal annual raise. In the end, there was no advancement outside of the retail market. Once you were a teller, there was a single line of advancement inside the branch all the way to manager. Despite any other qualifications or desires to move behind the retail branch, there was no support to do so. When you’re too good at something, you will stay there forever. Can be a good temporary job and that’s about it."
good,"Working for the company was a great experience. With the proper management and team coaches success, and opportunity for promotion within the company is endless."
good,"Bank of America hires good talent, although processes are overly complex and compensation is lower than in other industries for similar job responsibilities."
good,"I worked for Bank of America from 2015 to 2018 as a Lead Analyst, Performance testing. work load is hectic and not much employee benefits. No shift allowances but we need to work with overlap with Onsite team. particularly out project used to have new build every 2 days and the days we dont have much work can be counted on fingers in my 2 1/2 years with BofA. However there is huge delta in learning curve. other than that, no other employee benefits like NO MEDICAL EXPENSES, Cab Facility is thru Roster which is cumber some process. "
good,Manage your time effectively and you will be successful. Focus on completing your tasks on time and being effective while also building good relationships with those who you support.
good,"The company as a whole is a great company to work for. The benefits are good and the connections that can be created are endless. Advancement with the company are a little challenging, but can be achieved."
good,Good place to work for at entry level. Hard to advance work / life balance isn’t the greatest high stress level job has to make sales goals and sell bank product
good,If sales is a goal of yours I can recommend this postition to you. Ots a high sales enviroment that will pay you for your slaes. Just be ready to be yelled at on a regular basis by customers
good,The atmosphere is very customer oriented.  There are deadlines as well as weekly educational updates to comply with the bank and federal regulatory guidelines.
good,the job and management were great but the environment of weekly layoffs was stressful.  From the first day with the company to the last they were always having layoffs.
good,The work life balance at the Bank was the best. I had a great time interning with them. The people and culture caught my eye the most. My manager and colleagues were very supportive.
good,"My most enjoyable part of my day at work is helping customers. I review customers account information for possible Account Takeover. If needed I then reach out to customers to confirm any changes, transactions and request that have taken place on their accounts. After I confirm if there is fraud on their accounts, I provide them with the next steps to correct their accounts, provide steps to protect Identity outside of the company."
good,"Client satisfaction outside of my service affected my earnings directly. Even if it was another banker providing a unsatisfactory experience, I would personally be affected"
good,I appreciate Bank of America for giving me a chance. I worked there for 14 years and had many great experiences. I look forward to the next chapter in my career
good,It's a great place to get your foot in the door in the financial industry. The company has many benefits but the job is pretty time consuming. The work-life balance can suffer a bit since you can be expected to stay there after hours at least a few times a week.
good,working at Bank of America was good.  I love the Benefits but the pay did not fit some of the work.  Some areas are very demanding and stressful.  I like the supervisors I had at Bank of America.
good,Excellent benefits.  The training is on point.  Compliant with all Federal  and State law changes that affect our borrowers.  Customer satisfaction is one of the most important company goals.  There are set metrics by which employees performance is measured.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie among the team members.
good,"The general attitude of the bank is that people are replaceable. There is no inner culture of community. There is the occasional good manager who cares about the people in his or her charge, but that is the exception."
good,"A very high level of competence is expected and required from every team member at BOA. The overall learning curve is continuously advancing since the technology is constantly moving forward, and is consequently very difficult and stressful to keep up with. "
good,"Performance culture with opportunity for advancement worldwide."
good,"Work was fast pace, managers and work peers were good to work with, lots of learning opportunities. There is many cross train opportunities and be able to transfer to other departments"
good,Practice solution side of BOA is a difficult place. There are limited opportunities as the management never leaves and you feel stuck in one place. Not a bad place to work if you just focused on making money but the structure will stress you out.
good,"Fast paced environment, very competitive and a lot of regulations to be followed to do daily job. What I learned the most was being able to adapt to the ever changing requirements of underwriting loans based on guideline changes."
good,When I worked here there were no real advancement opportunities for growth. The pay was very low for the amount of work that was required of you. Outdated technology products provided for you to do your job.
good,"I don't have much to say about the bank, just beware!  This bank is huge and they run off a lot of good customers. The childcare assistance was great."
good,"Good people, good management, difficult first two years to make the cut.  Steep learning curve, lots of cold calling and prospecting.  Difficult path, but challenging and potentially rewarding."
good,"I loved the people I worked with and for, that kept me  coming to work. My positions throughout the years allowed me to gain knowledge of what I needed to know and what I was lacking"
good,Good team to work with. Good benefits after probation. Training period is confusing for people with no experience. Fast pace environment with high volume of calls.
good,If you are a COBOL mainframe programmer your days are numbered at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. They are not cross-training any of the team members that do not have the PC programming skills. They said it is up to you to get the training and then will try to fit you into a position. This is not a company that cares about it's long time employees unless you are in a highly desired position.
good,Starting off is good and easy. upper Management constantly changes so never get a good answer on how to advance. But High stress environment everyone under high pressure to make quotas.
good,Managers are not compassionate. Company make up sales techniques that are inefficient bc they are made up by people who are not in sales. You are pressured to sell products to the elderly and the college students.
good,"I started with MBNA before BOA bought them out. MBNA was a great company for employees. But obviously they are not here any longer, so... The training for different roles does not provide a real life feel. So, when you start you do not feel confident at first. There is a lot of misinformation and lack of communication between different departments. The company reorganizes often. There is favoritism here."
good,Typical day at was productive and fulfilling. Management was hands on and chosen carefully. Upper Management were engaged with daily operations but continually delivered the company's goals.
good,This was my first professional setting job. Worked from a teller up to a personal banker/relationship manager. I learned a lot of my skills in cash handling and great customer service.
good,"Bank of America offers onsite restaurant with a nice variety of meals on the Menu. The company cares about its employees in a way the hardly lay off. If a department happens to close, the company gives you the opportunity to transfer to another department first."
good,When taking a new role you embarks in a new adventure.  You learn to navigate on your role and learn your strength and weakness.  The work culture is fast passed and stressful since is sales goal oriented.
good,As a full-time employee and student there is not much flexibility or understanding from management. Poorly compensated for time with the company and not much room for growth.
good,Bank of America asks for its tellers to upset products and services to customers that either almost never qualify and/or which are not appealing for customers.
good,"call centers are stressing period. back to back calls, short breaks, and just people yelling at you all the time because you're dealing with people's real money."
good,"When working in certain positions, you are given support to learn and encouraged to grow as an employee.  Towards the end of my employment off shore contract employees were given more opportunities than the employees them selves."
good,"Great co workers, fun place to work and good benefits. Many opportunities for advancement and they offer training classes. It had a good recognition program but then they started with the cut backs."
good,"A typical day at work was organizing FHA loan documentation for potential mortgage loan modifications. Once the documentation was reviewed, we submitted them to an underwriter to review for approval."
good,"Bank of America purchased Balboa Insurance from Countrywide, and sold the company to QBE North America.  Good work environment, with very good benefits."
good,This was a contract job. I worked there several years ago. worked 5 hours a week as we were in the middle of a refi boom. Management was more reactive at the time due to the volume level
good,"NO Moral.. not a very motivating or positive work environment. Treats customer service reps like pions, yet we are the driving force for bank of america. without customer service reps they couldnt function.."
good,I was treated fair. Otherwise I would no have stayed that long.. I was planning on retiring from this company. Unfortunately the company closed the branch and outsourced my job to India.
good,"I have not worked here in years, so I don't have any input on how Bank of America treats their employees or how tha atmosphere is at Bank of America currently."
good,"Nice work life balance but relatively low learning to start the career. A nice place to learn team management and business processing."
good,Worked on sales side of business as FC at branch office on Miami Beach which no longer exists. Typical sales position- client acquisition solely dependent on individual effort
good,I enjoyed my time there. managment is a little iffy but other than that it was ok.would i ever refer anyone there probably not. they are very strict and this is why most cLL CENTERS HAVE A REVOLVING DOOR
good,"Bank of America is difficult place to work for if you seek advanced career placement but god for temporary work or part-time work.  Upward management positions are very limited, but company does it's best to help the customer. At the end of the day profitability is the bottom line for the company."
good,"My duties included: Taking inbound calls from clients and prospective customers in a call center environment. Sales of Products and Services, customer assistance and troubleshooting, while providing financial solutions, and great customer service."
good,Worked closely with underwriting to process and close loans.  They had their own closing department that scheduled the loans and prepared closing documents
good,Management was not very supportive of employees.  Some days could be very hectic and stressful.  Other employees were great to work with.  Pay was not very competitive.
good,The retail financial center at Bank of America is a very busy environment. The alternative of setting appointments does assist clients in getting their requests and services processed in a more organized fashion. Client accounts are reviewed to ensure the client is aware of all the products and services available to meet their short and long term financial goals. Relationship Managers are also expected to meet their Sales goals
good,"A typical day required opening procedures, night drop performance, getting everything ready as fast as possible before opening, utilizing one teller for everything to encourage customers to use the ATM, or online banking rather than see a teller."
good,Bank of America is great institutions to work for especially if you are new to the banking industry. The training is thorough and there is a lot people to help assist in your career development their.
good,Assisting customer to save their home.   Working with attorneys and the court in order to find solution to assist and all parties to agree if application to help the customer
good,"I did not enjoy the management culture at Bank of America. The culture is more worried about being viewed on the Cisco Telepresence monitor than one solving problems. Also, they don't consistently give bonuses to keep valued employees working at the bank."
good,"Steady work, learn all and follow the steps for security, Rules and regulations, do's and don'ts, know the opening and closing steps of the Branch, all the Teller transactions steps, open and closing steps for the safe, ATM,  safe deposits boxes, to know the other"
good,"Great training program, missions statement, and great benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was not micromanaged, and we were able to take lunch whenever we were at a stopping point."
good,"The call center is your typical call center environment.  This location does not offer the amenities other sites offered, with employees being able to engage in exercise, full cafeteria and multiple outside sitting areas to eat lunch or take breaks.  These area are only available for smoking employees.  Otherwise the team and immediate supervisor makes the job fun.  The actual job duties are very hard to execute without the proper tools."
good,"Bank of America is very results oriented. There is great management and work environment, but not a lot of communication amongst employees, especially regarding changes to policy or guidelines. Overall good company."
good,Great working environment and has productive managers although things are unorganized majority of the time. Room for improvement within the company and expanding you knowledge in the fied once you are hands on with job title.
good,Average place to work. Flexible Manager.  Many hours.  fjfjdkl ddjkdls jskl;s jskl;s sjo's jso;s jsooodod dfjdoa;a'. djla;adfjdoa'a. ajdkd;aajfkd;a.  fjdjd djdjd djd djd djddd jddjd .
good,"Although the bank provides excellent benefits and a great framework to succeed, the culture lacks in that management cares more about ""managing up"" and shows almost zero interest in the people below them"
good,"I loved working for Bank of America up till the market crashed and they were forced to reduce staff.  Many positions, mine included became redundant due tothe merger with MBNA, Merrill Lynch and CountryWide.  Prior to that, this job offered flexibility, continuous learning and a great environment of trust and collaboration."
good,In general majority of management there is great. A few are not willing to help and when you ask they get frustrated. I've always been one to ask questions so I don't make mistakes but I felt I was bothering my manager. In general people sho do work with the bank are amazing.
good,"love  to help customers and their needs  dealing with money is not a problem "
good,"Really good place to start your career in the mortgage industry. Too many bad decisions at the top for a nice company. Very nice and hard working people there, is sad that executives and managers don't  really care about that."
good,"Average office job, not much of promoting within the company. Most of the management is below average, very ineffective. Layoffs are very frequent. Thx"
good,Every branch is different.  Overall the leadership on a firm level seemed to focus on their numbers rather than client needs towards the end.  Sad to see things go this way after such a long mission on placing clients first.
good,"Typical bank culture,  usually good work life balance, good management and good training courses for employees to learn and develop skills, typical hierarchy structure"
good,I enjoyed my role and  Bank of America.  I held many positions while working there and it was always challenging and rewarding. Management was inconsistent at times but it wasn't all bad.
good,"The contact center culture is changing, and not for the better necessarily.  The overall organization is associate development centric and provide a lot of opportunity to grow skills and capabilities.  But the demands of the job seem to be ever changing with new expectations and little direction on how to achieve them."
good,My manager was excellent in communication and mentoring.(regional manager).  My local manager did not visit or spend any time with me for training purposes.
good,"excellent training, lots of opportunites. great perks as well as multiple discounts from companies outside of bofa. many locactions to work and training. friendly and helpful co workers."
good,"Overall this is a good company to work for.  However the compensation is not fairly giving to employees based upon their actual work.  This company used to have more of a work like balance, but somehow that has changed over the years, and the need to meet goals has taken over."
good,Fair company company to work for. Quick to layoff off then shift responsibilities to existing employees more and more. Environment was nice. Facility had workout room and cafeteria.
good,It was difficult to work in the financial world in the 80's.  It was a cut throat arena and there were many layoffs.  But the company was not too difficult to work for.  The supervisors for the most part were good.  I learned alot about stocks and other financial workings.  The benefits were very good.
good,Your average company where there are lots of teams and the organization has most of its jobs outsource to foreign country. Working is always a challenge due to employee turn around and dealing with different time zones.
good,Overall the day can be stressful. The banks need more than two tellers. But since the tellers are still completing the customers request management does see a need to hire additional staff. The tellers are being overworked and under paid.
good,"management is scarcely around to help, atmosphere is nice, building is nice. grounds are nice. training needs help. night time staff needs help, system needs help"
good,"Bank of America is the most advanced and evolved bank from technologies perspective on the wall street. However, it's still a bank with a lot of limitations. It's not a place for cutting edge technologies."
good,Running the day-to-day operations couldn't need a little bit more of training on management but overall it was a great experience working for them and the co workers.
good,Agile environment make thing chaotic. Management has no clue which group is very busy and which group has not enough work to do. You have to scramble to find next assignment.
good,"Bank Of America Was Not The Best place To Word Because Of The Attitude Of My Management.  They Did Not Appear To Be Very Helpful "
good,"Trying to control the lobby traffic in a banking center can be difficult.  That balance between having people stand around vs having no one at all is an art that the bank is still trying to succeed at.  "
good,"I fell into the middle of an attempt to change from waterfall to agile, from departmental hiring to hiring tech skills into a consultant pool, and trying to rationalize their software stack.  Too much change at once -- management is struggling, people are confused and demoralized, guidelines are unclear.  Once they clear it all up, it might be a nice place to work again."
good,"While I did enjoy working there, there was little to do to fill my work day. Mainly monitored backup tapes, sent off site and received tapes back from off site. Had daily meetings to discuss scratch tape quantities."
good,Bank of America is a very large organization.  I learned that you had to know people within the organization in order to be promoted to a management position.  The hardest part of working there was being placed in positions that you knew and management knew you were already qualified for.  I was looking for challenging positions.  I enjoyed working with my peers.
good,Bank of America provided good training for the position and helpful with training on teller line.  Nice managemnet wants you to make goals and helps you.
good,BofA is a good company and place to work for.  The only downfall is that they show favoritism.  It helps if you are willing to relocate.  I recommend it.
good,Bank of America was my first job out of college. I enjoyed working there because of the flexible hours and the fact that I was gaining essential skills needed for the future
good,Typical day consisted of working as a unit pulling loans from a pool. Following all rules and regulations to save home depending on eligibility. Team of about 8-10 employees being managed and setting personal goals to meet and exceed. Lots of proofreading can be sometime mentally exhausting. All lunches served in house. Discounts from the company websites and participation companies were good as well
good,Exciting work and competitive pay.  Good work/life balance.  A place that large is constantly in flux.  Always hiring yet always laying off.  Everyone is expendable
good,"Something that I've noticed working for this company is that there's some favoritism. If you aren't someone who's in good with certain persons in management, then the likelihood of you promoting or getting anywhere are lessened. Sometimes management holds the employees back. There aren't any mentors provided and it is hard seeking them out. I made it a point to observe and read about certain positions that interested me to understand what I needed to do to get there. Some associates get special treatment and when one speaks up about the unfair treatment, nothing seems to change and their experience becomes worse. I am currently in a position where I am supposed to act as a supervisor, but my managers do not allow me to act as such. Not because of my performance, but because they ""don't need it"". I am supposed to have override capabilities for certain things, but my manager has not given that authority to me. We have had several occasions arise where it was crucial for me to have override, and I've laid the groundwork for my managers so that they can at least provide me with the authority to do so in emergency situations like those that have already arisen, yet they refuse. I needed to take a medical leave and I received almost no support from my superiors who also showed no compassion upon my return. I was treated very much like I was burdening them, rather than support to get better so that can return at full capacity."
good,Bank of America was a great place to work but it was all about make sale and making money. The hardest part of my job was the being on the dialer all day.
good,"The firm offers numerous roles in a variety of functions.  If you're proactive and assertive, you can grow rapidly at BAML.  If not, you will drown.  I enjoyed my time there but am happy to have moved on."
good,"A typical day consists of reviewing new rules that must be followed regarding call procedures. This can change during a shift , and you are responsible for reviewing. Also you have to be mindful that there is no idle time, and 5 minute calls anything over that on a consistent basis , and you would be reprimanded. Did learn regulations regarding bank accounts. Bank of America will promote within , but if you are an older employee your chances are slim to none.  After 6 months of employment you could apply for another position. Many younger employees were promoted at the 4 month's , and many were written up for being tardy, and not showing up for work."
good,Depends on the location you work for.  Sometimes hard work does not pay off.  Brown noses and useless skills still advance more than hardworking individuals.
good,"A company in which you can maintain balance between your job work and life. . It also provides you job security. Salary might be your concern here, People are fun loving which makes the floor energetic."
good,"I feel that this is the company in which you can maintain balance between your job work and life. It also provides you job security. Salary might be your concern here, People are fun loving which makes the floor energetic."
good,Very stressful atmosphere a lot of pressure to sell products. Management was not available for supervisor calls. Busy phones with not enough help and big turn overs
good,"We were expected to do a lot with a little- A little training, no more money, but more work each time. Quick trained on 4 or 5 positions and expected to do these positions for the same amount of money we were doing one of the positions for. Managers would divulge your personal business without a second thought. Managers would also not accept ideas on how the job could be made easier, although they didn't have a clue how to do the job."
good,"Due to being at this corporation for over 30 years, Human Resources and Management will keep you at a certain pay rate so you want be able to post to an advancement. They hire new recruits to pay them less monies to do a particular high paying job."
good,BOA has a structured training and development program for new hires.  This allows you to build the required skills for job accuracy.The benefits are very good too.
good,I enjoyed my job. Loved what I was doing. I really do not have much to say. I loved my job. I was trained extensively and gained a wealth of knowledge.
good,be prepared to speak like a robot on the phone. every call needs to be recorded and you speak from a card loaded with pre written instructions. deviate from that card one bit and you get dinged. enough dings gets you in trouble.
good,"Decent place to work at ML Edge investments. They help you get licenses, and knowledgeable managers and coworkers can help you grasp concepts and regulations in the financial industry.  Did not prefer the call center capacity."
good,Being a intern here was a great experience they taught me so many things. I was able to learn things about banking and handling money that I didn't know and that was awesome.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the team I worked with. They made it fun to come to work. The work was not difficult, but analyzing data and files can be time consuming. The Team Managers I reported to were amazing!"
good,Great work experience. I gained a lot of knowledge on the dynamics of customer service. I was equipped on how to resolve issues as soon as they were presented to me.
good,"Human Resources continues to evolve. Every day is a new chance for things to change."
good,"Long days, while I like the work I was forced to do several of my manager’s responsibilities leading me to fall behind in my own work, I did enjoy being able to help the processors, but excpectations were set too unrealistic, but there was no saying no, but I would vocalize the facts and reality, the did not like that. I stuck up for my staff, bu in the long run it did not work, the catch is being on the right managment team you with make it as a great team or you don’t conect, closed now anyway."
good,I only worked at BAML for a summer internship but the work/life balance was not feasible for me from a long term perspective so I decided to pursue other opportunities.
good,Many opportunities to hold different positions and learn different skill sets. Sad to see the flexibility of being able to work from home eliminated in operational type jobs.
good,"A good company, but for technology jobs, it's difficult to excel unless in a stable geographic area of the company (e.g. North Carolina, Dallas TX, New York, etc.). Job cuts and outsourcing are ongoing, so work gets distributed around to those left after staff reductions, and that work either falls through (isn't addressed) or folks get busier over time. Still, in those areas where the business is stable, it's a good fit for many."
good,"They had great supervisor when I worked there. the supervisors were always fair. if they saw you potential and exceeding on what you was doing, they will choose you to participate in training classes or walk the floor for assistance if needed."
good,"Upper management does not care about being short staffed. They will always tell you what your doing wrong, never what you're doing right.Very stressful due to lack of help."
good,"I worked under two managing directors in Miami including the COO from the New York office. In addition, I was required to assist the rest of the office as well as associates throughout the regions with day to day tasks. As you can imagine, that created an un-balanced work load and became stressful from time to time. My direct managers did not take notice of how much was asked of me and expected more. There was poor miscommunication from my managers and often they broke compliance regulations then put on the blame on me. Which was very unfair since I had just a little over a year at the bank and they were between 15-20 years working for the bank. This is not in any way reflective on Bank of America as a company. Unfortunately, this particular office location just needs improvement with management."
good,"great benefits"
good,"Non stop calls. All day. If you can handle it without dying inside, then this is the job for you. I liked my supervisor, she was amazing. Aside from that, it wasn't that fun, but it paid well enough."
good,This job has great pay and benefits. But it is very stressful because of the quotas and deadlines you have to meet. They will tell you there aren't any quotas but there are. And if you don't meet them there is disciplinary action.  They will also cheat you or off your bonus.
good,Call centers aren't really my ideal work environment but the information learned for financial and personal investment were quite interesting. Proper training but management was a disappointment.
good,hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers and having to explain decisions that are made at a higher level and not given enough information to explains with policies have changed other than it was a business decision.
good,Great company to work for.  I worked with a great team and learned new application and sat in on training with offsite teams. The team was great on cross training and teaching me the new application and I was able to assist with testing for the new release which was amazing.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this bank and the growth that it allowed me to have, however things started to change. The voice of the employee was no longer heard and when we spoke up, it was taken more of a complaint than a call for help.  I used to be passionate about managing and helping people grow and creating relationships with my customers and coworkers. Unfortunately by the time I left, I was burnt out, and extremely stressed.  It became an environment of fear of being fired, instead of a healthy work environment."
good,"I worked at Merrill prior to the acquisition by BA, but found the bureaucracy to be heavy in head office.  Volatility in earnings led to volatility in compensation and in job security."
good,"This was a good place to work with average benefits and below average compensation.  The work environment was solid and very steady.  The company was also well funded, so we were actually able to accomplish what we set out to do most years.  The management structure here was extremely political.  It was a good ole boy driven type of environment, which didn't affect me much as long as I focused on things in operations at my management level."
good,"Following directions, making sure your team was well aware of proper procedures to avoid any losses or mistakes. BOA is a great work place if you have a positive team that is willing to put 100% in it."
good,"Working at BoA was okay... the managers expect too much! Depending on your bank location, most managers are a bit racist.  The customers were the one who made being at work easier."
good,"Expect to work in a fast paced environment, in which you are expected to out perform your management peers. Culture was decent and the compensation was fair"
good,Great company to jump start your career and acquire necessary skills needed. I feel working here allowed me to understand how a corporation is ran. It also helped me see what I can achieve.
good,Compensation great and training it awesome!  Work life balance was horrible.  Staffing was always short and members were always complaining.  I worked for this company for almost 18 years and it wasn't always that way.  It progressively got worse over the years thus causing me to leave the company.
good,Bank of America is not flexible in order for some work/life balance. The day to day operations duties can be become very stressful due to so many turnovers.
good,I enjoyed the job hated the rotating management. I enjoyed working together with the staff to create new sales strategies and providing interactive ideas to the customers
good,Being away from Merrill Lynch head Quarters and work in a very small office (50 employees) was a big plus.
good,"The time was very stressful because of sales, Always needed to make sales or your  points taking away. Doing  mortgage sales was very good job. Manager was not working for the employee."
good,The fc managers took out there feelingscom staff when they would get in trouble and blame staff for things that they did. Alot of favoritism amd unfairness.
good,"Great place to work as new graduate- management keeps the associates inform of upcoming strategy, focus on diversity, client  and employee.  Company has various opportunities and promotes mobility.  Encourage employee to volunteer within the community and welcome diverse group ."
good,"The management is made up of some people who truly want their employees to succeed and the others just don't really care. The workplace is very fast paced and stressful so if you are not good with managing stress then it would not be the place for you. The hardest part of my job is that I'm the end process and sometimes get blamed for what others did. It's the nature of the business unfortunately. The most enjoyable parts of my job are the people that i work because they are phenomenal and I enjoy making the homeowner's dreams come true. At the end of the day, it's all about the customer."
good,"Good oportunities for career growth and training. good programs, conferences, new job opportunities - including Global oportunities. Great benefit package."
good,Enjoyed attending and handling customer needs. Associates were very helpful in mentoring new employees. Banks have a lot of regulationsand rules that most be followed.
good,"Maintained a great client relationship with the bank by introducing the new and beneficial products."
good,"call center mentality, stressful and must stay on the phones all day. Took upwards of 100 calls a day and was not given time to study for certificates."
good,"Overall my job experience at Bank of America was really good, my co workers/teammates were awesome. The most enjoyable part was working together as a team in a friendly environment."
good,"Financials are strong but lack of advancement, and salary for internal candidates is limited.  Many don't feel they are compensated fairly and competitively with outside companies."
good,"Overall Bank of America Merrill Lynch is a good place to work with good benefits, but salaries are well below the median income in Jacksonville. The benefits and vacation time are good."
good,"Handling money transactions, check cashing, withdrawals, certified checks and money orders."
good,"The Bank of America project was a temporary project that I was assigned to. During my stay there, security was uncomfortably tight for the protection of personal information of their clients. This is understandable, as we all want our information protected. This was also during the time when many lending institutions were under a magnifying glass for their activities. Under the circumstances, many employees felt as though they too were under a magnifying glass. This was sometime back, therefore I would assume that things are now a more relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Opening opportunities are available for entry level. If you're looking to excel, be sure to check out other lines of business. Be sure to check for new projects to work on."
good,"Bank of America is a good company with good benefits.  However, economic ups and downs put long term employees at risk due to high salaries and the company's imminent need to down size.  Long term managers and employees are constantly under scrutiny and thus, the company will look for reasons to terminate employees at will in order to downsize.  This is particularly true with Call Center employees."
good,Working with staff from mergers were very difficult. It was a total different animal. It took years to iron out differences. Ofcourse the work was dome.
good,"Great opportunity within a new division at the time, however laid off after 5 years of service. As a project manager i was able to lead in areas and learn a lot about the business that allowed me transfer those skills to where I am today."
good,"company highly committed to children and families.  Warm interactions among staff members , and management that goes out of its way to support relationships between families and teachers."
good,"Although general company benefits are great, management is very unprofessional and disorganized. They do not look out for their employees and tend to make the job more difficult by adding unnecessary policies and procedures."
good,"While to technology available to the consumer is top of the line, the technology and policies for staff is outdated and redundant.  Focus is on getting all customers to use all of the products, despite what the customer believes is right for them."
good,OK place to work. Lots of changes were going on while I was there. Learned a lot about processes and Black Belt methods. People were nice and fun to work with. Good pay.
good,"Fast paced and stressful but the work is rewarding.  Teammates and partners work together to solve issues and implement.  Culture in some division are being radically changed to reflect the current, upcoming demographics of the workforce presenting a challenge at times when merging past/present cultural experiences."
good,"Bank of America provides great customer service that provides options that meet needs of customers and teaches many great qualities such as learning about all products and policies, building strong relationships and maintaining accuracy while working in a fast paces environment. management was very reliable and supportive."
good,"I had many different jobs while working for Bank of America and its predecessors. I was a Teller, Administrative Assistant in Commercial Loans, and Secretary for the Downtown Branch of the Bank."
good,I was the only teller most days the people that I worked with didn't like their job. Upper management put pressure on our managers and bad news and anger rolls down hill. Customers could be waiting up to twenty minutes in line and that would be ok because the bank wants them out so they could use ATMs and mobile banking. And they still expect you to have 40+ referrals but its hard to talk to people that are already upset. just be careful what you get yourself into they have no problem getting rid of good people.
good,"work at home benefit, as long as you do your work and finish your work no one to bother. Managers are very flexible, and systems are out dated. no good training material."
good,"Lots of work, pressure, and meeting selling standards. Decent room to make a living and to advance, however, there's a lot of competition in most markets. Not for those who enjoy freedom to contribute outside the scope of the every day. Not much attention to work/life balance, but there is opportunity to get involved in the community through BOA's outreach initiatives."
good,"Be on time, your teammates rely on you for opening. There is a lot of training to go thru but it is necessary in this line of work. You have to be a people person to work with the public, they can be friendly or want to rip you up if they are not happy, be empathetic and listen. Remember you are part of a team, you all work together. I am a people person, so a lot of customers enjoyed coming to see us. Patience is a virtue in this line of work."
good,"Great training, and excellent benefit but not fair bonuses."
good,The job is ok. Competitive as far as incentive quota. Great training depending on location. Also potential for  great bonuses based on location. Management asked unrealistic expectations at times.
good,"Excellent training, safety very important. Recognize employees for jobs well done. Awards given to recognize high performance. Daily work can be very repetitive."
good,There are many benefits to working for Bank of America. Employees are offered fantastic benefit packages that cater to your needs. Included as an option in the benefits is the ability to purchase an additional week of vacation. The office is a secure environment with a diverse population. The cafe serves breakfast and lunch to day shift workers for a competitive price. I learned several new skills while working for the bank that centered on my field of expertise. Management is professional and maintains attention to detail.
good,When I first started at the bank what an amazing place to work it was so fun until Corp office started switching managers around and some of them refused to let you take a break. As you know tellers are being replaced with ATM's
good,Manager was not helpful and would not address situations with employees or customers.  Audits are too strict and the auditors are out to fail every branch.  No training for new employees
good,Cutting Edge Technology in SDWAN using Cloudgenix pilot and Remote Financial Center broadband access via Teleworker remote solution - collaborated with Black Box vendor.
good,Merrill Lynch is a great company for the people that make it. The only problem is less than 10% make it as a FA. In that sense you are only just a number but if you succeed it's a great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed every year I worked at bank of America until they really started to trim down staff.  I have learned a lot through out my years, i was able to advance with out a degree to become a senior manager. I really enjoyed the days when you were able to move around and learn new things but not so much now"
good,"Fast paced environment where you earn what you put in. Work life balance is difficult. Great management team and good compensation. Strict culture, very competitive.."
good,"Productive, working here is great, the way management stresses that they dont need everyone is what makes people nervous about their job security. they do frequent lay offs and over work the ones that are still there.if you like to keep busy this is the place for you."
good,"Great Company to work for."
good,To Bank of America employees are just a number. Regardless of your contribution or your job rating if your number comes up you are gone. For instance employees have been given retention raises to not leave when getting a better offer only go be severed months later when it comes time for workforce reductions.
good,"Great benefits, opportunity to grow in a very diverse financial company. The bank offers solid benefits and gives ample opportunities to advance your career.  Good focus on educational programs designed to expand your skill sets."
good,"Good training, good co workers. Typical bank environment with focus on cross selling. Advancement pretty limited for certain roles. Pay is somewhat low."
good,"The manager's were always focused on achieving the department's goal."
good,"A decent place to work but,not a lot of support. I am a self starter who learns quickly so I figured it out but other people who were new struggled and pulled their hair out as they had almost all web training that did not cover the multitude of systems and processes that are not intuitive and do not make sense. The branch staff have it rough with poor staffing and sales pressure. The benefits are great and  if you are a branch sales partner(i.e mortgage, investment, merchant services) then you have some freedom and autonomy that others do not.  BOA is like a really big, old, slow moving, slightly leaky ship that will get you where you need to go but is neither the most efficient nor the most enjoyable mode of transportation."
good,I was layed off from Bank of America otherwise I would have probably left. It was a stressful environment. You had to train yourself on computer. it was sink or swim you on your own.
good,"Working at BOA was a great experience but with it's management flaws when it came to monitoring bathroom breaks, they were very strict about being away from your desk and some of the calls were just very stressful. I was not happy with sitting all the time at all. That is the reason I would love a career change to warehouse associate I love being on my toes and on the move at all times ."
good,Large company with common communication challenges.  Staff head counts ebbs and flows with profitability.  Good training and opportunities.  Cut-throat atmosphere.
good,I enjoyed my experience working for Bank of America.  I was able to learn and grow in experience within the banking institution.  Working for Bank of America will always benefit me in future job opportunities
good,no details to provide at this time. nothing to report. I do not wish to share any details. thanks for asking. I will provide specific details at a later time.
good,Great place to work. The only drawback or layoffs and unpaid parking. I would recommend as a resume builder and the chance to work in a finical environment.
good,"I am a developer.  Every couple of years, I was moved to a different group.  The second time this happened, I was in the process being promoted when I was suddenly pulled into a newly formed operations group under a new manager, responsible for performing tasks that I was poorly equipped to do.  This disregard for my professional career path killed my positive attitude toward the company and I never really got it back to what it had been.  "
good,"Signature and Bank of America, top pay from the Charlotte area. I would recommend. Nothing really bad to say. But it is a fast paced environment... so you have to be fast."
good,"Bank of America was a great place to work if you are looking to advance your career. The environment is fast paced and competitive."
good,"seems consumer side is well run"
good,It was blessed to work at this corporation A lot of work and very little cohesive management.  kept changing direction on how to do the job  needed better management
good,A typical day is busy and always eventful while working with multiple Financial Advisors. I enjoy the strong personal relationships with the clients that I have come to know over the years. I adapt well to learning new job skills and procedures on a daily basis. After the merger with Merrill Lynch from Banc of America Investments in 2009 I had to learn new processes and procedures quickly to accommodate our clients who were also dealing with the changes from the merger. Our direct management position for the Client Associates has been revolving over the past five years which has made it a bit difficult to constantly having to adapt to a new manager so frequently. The workplace culture in our particular office has become a bit negative over the last few years which is a reason why I am looking for a change of atmosphere and positiveness. I truly enjoy the camaraderie of most of the other Client Associates that I work with which will make it hard to leave but I look forward to making new relationships with a new company and in a different positive work environment
good,"nice environment to work in , very business professional and have fun way to show their appreciation towards their employees , overall its a nice company to work with but not so flexible with accommodation schedules for employees"
good,"Merrill Lynch was a wonderful company to work for until Bank of America purchased. Annual bonuses that ranged 10,000+ were eliminated with no substitute in pay. You can apply for other departments and be approved for hire, however if you work in a department with high turnover (which is why you want to change departments since high turnover equates to a less than desirable work environment) your upper management staff can deny the transfer. Had a number of coworkers leave the company altogether due to not being able to leave a lousy department."
good,Bank of America had acquired a great many financial and mortgage companies in the past decade. It is a tough challenge to integrate and standardize all computing technologies and work cultures to the BAC standard.
good,"Ample OTJ training provided for tellers; minimal OTJ for Sales, Management positions.  The expectation on upscale of banking products became very unrealistic; many local offices closed due to ""numbers"" and more work placed on employees that remain in local offices.  Often too busy for lunch."
good,"Much room for advancement, however very corporate based.  It was hard to believe this company cared about its employees and customers more than its profits.  Many cuts made at the customer and employees expense."
good,"The requirements of the call center were to resolve a customer's fraud issue in ten minutes or less which was very unrealistic given that as an associate, you had to file multiple fraud claims at the same time."
good,"Bank of America was a good place to work and the co-workers were some of the best I have ever worked with.  Management was good at the local level, but kind of up in the air for upper management.  I enjoyed working at Bank of America, while I was in their employ."
good,"I liked the company, but in this industry, the more effective and efficient they become, the more lay-offs are needed.  I basically worked myself out of a position."
good,Worked here too long ago to be valid review.  Mass exodus same time that I left.   It has been many years and I hope management has changed and corp integrity has improved
good,"Typical day would be making sure all task are done to make sure the next shift when smoothly.  Learned much about mainframe computing, and storage. Management was very stern and military like, expected 100%.  Hardest part of job was making sure all daily task where done correctly and completely. Early part of my career the company would pay for training."
good,"Was on the graveyard shift, Learned how to document procedures and process improvements. Management was laid back as long as you did your job. Workplace culture was very diverse, being that it is a global corporation. Hardest part of job was adapting to all the change that was taking place in our department. Enjoyable part of the job was finishing a project on time with goals met."
good,You are able to set up your own work schedule to better accommodate your life away from work. The manager are very understanding if you need to take some personal time for yourself.
good,Bank of America provided good benefits however the pay for performance was very low for all work projects being done that other companies could pay for more for what you learned
good,"Merrill Lynch was a tough place to work.  In 1989 before ""personal"" harassment ,measures were implemented, Financial Consultants in higher ranks would make lewd comments daily.  "
good,High stress environment.  Significant cost reduction efforts in place at this time.  Move away from remote work and preference to locating new hires when possible in North Carolina.
good,"I really loved my job at B of A. There are a lot of things to learn and keep up with, but once you learn them, it is a fun place to work. My favorite part was the face to face interaction with people. Hearing about their day and helping them with one of the most important parts of their life was very fulfilling."
good,hardest part of the job is pleasing the execs who sit in the office and look at data all day. There is a disconnect with execs and associates that can be quite irritating.
good,Fun job for college students looking for a part time job. The job schdule is flexible around school schedule. Opportunities to learn new tasks and learn interpersonal skills.
good,Large bank feel. Little work/life balance. Retail branch leadership is required to be in the bank from open to close regardless of outside factors. Decent compensation and bonus structure.
good,Great freedom and flexibility in your hours. Very demanding hurdles but great training and management is on your side. Must realize that most of the job is business development.
good,"BOA has its ups and downs. They stress tellers about making their numbers, but there is no compensation. They have good benefits, but I feel that they can treat their employees better."
good,I enjoyed Fleet bank before the merger w/ BOA it was more personal banking than big business. I think it lost a lot of the personal interaction with the customers. But back than it was a sign of the times.
good,"Pay is above average, however Bonuses are low and depending which department of IT you are in, the culture could be quite different."
good,One of the few that weathered the storm in 2008.  They have the resources to stay on top and bring solid products to market.  Typical big bank environment - sometimes too big but every once in awhile they surprise you.
good,"Isnt something you have when you have to work Sun, Mon, Tues , WED OFF Thursday work Friday  Off SAT back to work on Sun you go absolutely  no Work Life Balance with out two straight days off come on Friday and Sat I don't even mind the 1-10 schedule"
good,"	Create a connection and develop rapport with customers to provide outstanding, personalized service,"
good,Bank of America is a good place to be at when you want great benefits for you and your family with health care at day one and vacation paid for first year. Hours are steady if you are full time and will get your hours every week. It is a very stressful place to work for as corporate makes changes where it does not help its employee's or customers. Employees do not have much backing on anything as customers will do a survey to rate the branch and even though most scores are bad and can not be helped as the employees do not set the hours or services at the bank but corporate does not want to hear it.
good,"management good. team manager is professional. relationship between offshore and onsite team was not good. Release is on time."
good,"Great Work Life balance as I was a ""My Work"" employee, which meant that I worked from home for 9 years. Little to no warning about layoffs though. Management changed for the worse in the 9 years I was there."
good,working this job was really good in the beginning. The benefits were amazing and the people super friendly. But then came new management and everything went downhill.
good,"I am a contractor for the company. Salary is paid though Contracting Company. There are no vacation days, no advancement, and no job work/Life balance."
good,Poor Advancement Opportunities. Good health benefits. Been trying to advance for a couple of years but hard if you don't know anyone there. The raises are terrible
good,"This is generally a good company."
good,For being a bank the amount of money that is given per month is not enough. How does a bank run out of ink and paper to print legal documents? Luckily I had an amazing Branch Manager who I saw myself grow since she came to our location.
good,"In 17 years, I had a number of good managers.  Toward the end of my time there, the culture seemed to have shifted to one where winnin was the only goal.  It led to some bad behaviors."
good,"loved to helped customers with their banking needs"
good,"You have to be able to deal with change and quickly - the top line approach can be difficult to deal with day in and day out. The message is not always clear, communication can be lacking and you need to be able to get your direct report to change directions fast. You'll never be bored."
good,"B of A was a great place to work, management was great and the work environment was pleasant. There was always room to grow if you were willing to learn something new."
good,Stressful due to lack in productive computer programs.  16 programs necessary to preform a job that should have been no more than 3 programs. Could have been more efficient with better IT programs.
good,Bank of America is a lot like other banks when it comes to your normal work day and basic sales requirments. Pretty good systems to work with and base pay is pretty good. Only downfall in my opinion is quarterly pay out on incentives but a lot of financial institutions do that.
good,"You can set your own schedule as an Advisor, your day is what you make it. Still hard if you're a woman. Very competitive atmosphere, they offer plenty of training and lots of resources are available."
good,Ok place to work. Don't expect much. Its your standard 9-5 kind of place. The culture is fast paced and you can be replace fast if you aren't performing.
good,"Ok place to work you do your job and you go home. you was giving Christmas party and you did what you had to do. you got comp time when call in. This was a great place to work like any job you has problem but you do what you had to do. We work good together it was five of us we work some weekend to put code in. The  company brought in lunch and we was free worker. on weekend,  We also work with phone if we were on call."
good,Learned a lot about the retirement industry always new things to learn or that come up that you have not dealt with before. I love having the work from home option.
good,"Good Company to work for.  There was room for advancement.  Everyday was a new customer experience.  It was nice getting to know my customers, personally.  It can be an intense business and it is very critical to know follow all steps.  I enjoyed working in the environment."
good,I enjoyed my time with the bank. Had a very strong team work environment. A lot was virtual but everyone acted as if on the same team. Just had a log of re-organizations. I had a few great Managers. My last Manager only had me for a few month as a result of a re-organizie before I was laid off.
good,"As BOA is one of the largest bank in USA, it uses a lot of IT technologies. I worked as an SCCM Operations Engineer for 18 months. After working for 18 months I left the bank as I was a consultant."
good,"One thing that really stands out about BOA is there philosophy of Pay for Performance.  Do not expect to get a raise every year, or that your pay will change with seniority.  The more products you sell the better you will do."
good,"Very productive, busy, pleasant environment . Conservative work , slow closing, difficult processing. Very disappointing closing shift and funding. Not conducive for relationships with realtors"
good,"Working in night shifts is definitely a problem, but no other choice, cause i was into the US processing and no chance to see day light in whole tenure"
good,Getting to know the customers is great and you develop great relationships with the clients.  Start to feel like a used cars salesman   just to make them happy.  Have to make phone calls to secure new business from old customers and having to compete with competitor products that offer better value than what you had to sell.
good,"BofA is very competitive, but it is a very stressful place to work. They offer great benefits which include child care reimbursement. Not a typical benefit as you do not have to pay into it in order to be reimbursed."
good,Start of the day preparing for customers and meeting about the products and goals. Security is a must at all times. Work is work. Your personal life is almost none existing. Long hours and MANY rules and regulations to follow. The only bad part to banking is when it's being robbed. the best is when you know you have helped a customer and resolved their problems.
good,Great job experience and room for advancement. I sincerely enjoy working with my clients and coworkers. The team I work with is an extremely dedicated and talented group of diverse individuals.
good,Typical day is busy none stop phone calls. Training has a lot to be desired for the most part it is on the job training. Management could be more involved in regards to call feedback.
good,"A typical workday starts at 11 am with a few meetings in the morning to work progress and then you start working."
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed my experiences in banking.  I feel it is no longer my passion.  I love working with the elderly and giving them the attention they need and deserve.  The drive-thrus closed which made it very difficult for many clients.  Our clients got very upset and I did everything in my power reasonably to assist them in a timely manner.  There are many good products to assist the clients and was always in the top 10% regarding achieving my sales goals.  My goal was to get to know my clients and gain their trust.  With this philosophy I was very successful with sales and obtained referrals.
good,Good employer for Entry level positions. Good benefits. Low pay. Great Co workers. Mgmt is hit or miss by dept. They have alot of company events and will pay you to volunteer.
good,bank of America really cares for there people..very structured lots of room for growth....managers really willing to work with their people when emergencys occur
good,This was a great place to work. Loved all my colleagues and management staff. Would suggest to others. Very helpful staff from other depts as well as my own
good,"A good learning experience to handle sensitive corporate clients by engaging all business partners ."
good,"A typical day is making sure you start balanced, making sure if money is going to be needed. Making sure all matericals needed are available if not get materials needed. Management took care of what needed to be taken care of before we opened everyday with our help of course, The bank is gets from lonely to busy from one second to another."
good,"Typical day consists of: mentoring and coaching staff utilizing observations and role plays, managing operations, driving sales while providing exceptional customer service."
good,I enjoyed working here very much. It was challenging and fun. They encouraged you to do well and offered many options for education.
good,this job was productive and fun. most of the time very quiet and boring. not much excitement needed to complete the job. bank of america has exceptional benefits so thats a major plus. its a very professional environment.
good,You do the same thing every single day. Review documents to ensure that there are no errors and all conversations have taken place that are needed for funding a loan.
good,"Selling money to the rich. Challenging, however great perks for your hard work. Customers were quick to take the sell of more money for less interest."
good,Call center environment with very high expectations. This company is great for someone who only holds a high school diploma and not an actual degree being that with a degree you realize you have better opportunities with better life balance.
good,Decent job good benefits and work-life balance. A corporate environment so be prepared for the corporate lifestyle. Wear a lot of hats but do not get compensated for it.
good,"Not a lot of opportunity to promote and pay is low. Will take a long time to get up to a decent salary as opportunities take a while to come about, even if you are ready."
good,"The work environment may have been relaxed, but management showed little concern about employees. They show little or no concern for the employee. They however, seem to leave you be if you do a good job."
good,Handling transactions with attention to detail was of utmost importance.  The busiest days were the 1st and the 3rd; when disability checks were released.
good,"Good company to work for with good benefits. The company culture is good. Over my 20 year span at the bank I enjoyed working for and had a great rapport with all my peers and managers except the last one. Unfortunately that ended my career with the bank."
good,"Great place to get a foot in the financial industry door. They do educate new hires well but as far as promotion or advancement goes that is hard to come by unless there is some hardcore dedication to BoA."
good,"big  firm  and  gave you the ability to network  that was  the best part , but  everyone  was looking  for other opportunities   .thats  my review"
good,Morgan Stanley is a good company but be prepared to take a considerable amount of time to build up a substantial book of business. The training provided is very good.
good,"The hardest part of the job when you try to make the customer how credit card works and customer don't understands. "
good,Great opportunities to move up to upper management and other line of business. Bank of america cut a lot of tellers two years ago. The service has been very hard to maintain at a good level.
good,"Great benefits, great for working mothers. Not a lot of room for advancement. There is always something changing. Do not appreciate eployee feedback.."
good,"They require a high standard output which trained me to put my best at every project I handled."
good,"Merrill Lynch was an amazing company to work for. I loved going to work every day and had a great team and manager. Sadly, once BOA took over, things changed for my department. A lot of people were let go and many departments changed. I still enjoyed my job and had a great team and manager, but the overall atmosphere was very different."
good,"A typical day at work starts with a daily staff meeting where we are all caught up on company news, daily accounts, and our daily SLA's that have to be met for the day. A wake meeting so to speak."
good,"Most of the teammates are good. The Management is bureaucratic."
good,"A typical day is usually very busy and fast paced. I've learned how to be flexible as change in procedures occur daily. Management is usually fair. My co-workers are great, lots of team building. Hardest part of the job would be meeting the daily required numbers without diminishing the quality of the work. The most enjoyable part is that you are assisting and making sure that the customers financial needs are met as they go through the lost of a loved one."
good,"• sales quota are often difficult to obtain"
good,"Employment at Bank Of America was fast paced, productive, sometimes stressful and I worked with a team to accomplish getting the work completed. I dealt with highly confidential information, deals that were sometimes over a million dollars and a limited time to get the work completed so deadlines could be met."
good,"Good Place to learn."
good,Taking inbound call via call center. Learned how to multi-task. Good benefits and vacation. Worked 10 hour days 4 days a week. Room to advance. Flma benfits.
good,"Bank of America is a great place for technology opportunity but lacks employee motivation and promotional opportunity for right candidates.  Hence, several key technology leaders and engineers leave the company."
good,Good for benefits scary the way they did their downsizing. I worked here for 5.5 years. I dont believe at the time when they were downsizing they took into any consideration the dedication of some of the emloyees that were let go in the 1st and 2nd layoff.
good,"The management didn't train well, they just rushed the process. After a rushed trainig they would get upset if you didnt know your job well enough. Customers depending on location are very rude."
good,"Bank of America is disbanding their work from home program. In many cases, we're losing talent across the company in favor of people that live in Charlotte. "
good,Good company with great benefits. I learned a great deal while working there about small business and how to help small businesses be successful. Great teammate's helped to provide a great experience.
good,"A regular day at my current job  would consist of routine work however given the role is customer and financial assistance, there is always a chance for challenges. The workplace has a welcoming environment which is helpful when needed but also allows one to independently perform."
good,Good place to work. Associates are mostly friendly and helpful.  Management is generally exceptional.  My compensation plan could be more appealing if it was competitive with other companies.
good,"My role started out as a fairly well-paying position, then mgmt. made changes to comp plan as a way to get you to work harder and earn less.  My manager was very well-liked, but didn't take any vacation his first seven years on the job.  He told me he didn't have time for a girlfriend due to his work."
good,"Working with 50 to 60 customers to sell home loans."
good,"I like Starbucks Coffee which shop near to BOA office."
good,"Bank of America is a great company to work for if you are interested in advancement possibilities, decent pay, and great benefits. "
good,"Focused work environment, Performance Driven.  Focused on success and rebuilding the brand.  Work focused on reviewing data and problem solving."
good,"Leadership - inspire, motivate teams to achieve targets - hold accountable to results - continually work towards improving team's skillset and results"
good,Good company but dealing with people and their money can be difficult. Long hours at the first of the month.
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is my well known customers and my co-workers they are both great and make my days easy. The hardest part of my day would probably be trying to make my sales numbers although it is very rewarding to help with customers needs it can be very stressful at times. I have an incredible boss that is fully supportive and a team that is always behind me 100%
good,employees have a great relationship with each other even in the toughest situations. They make the best out of the hardest work given
good,"Pros"
good,"Great place to work but no advancement opportunities at the moment, flexible schedule but bad procedures to do job. Constant threat of layoffs"
good,"gained great experience working there, great leadership, benefits, good pay, need to work hard, but will be rewarded for your work."
good,"Enjoyed co workers, working with those from different departments, and the ability to work from home on occasion. A typical day consisted of many meetings."
good,I enjoyed my time at the company and the people. I will recommend Bank of America for employment. I learned a lot at the company. I will take the new found skill set I have obtain there and apply them to my future career.
good,"Full and Part time positions, some managers are not very involved or helpful."
good,"When you work for a very large company, there typically is a lot of opportunity to move around and advance.  Unfortunately, this company lays off frequently and it does not matter how good an employee you are, if you have the wrong job title, you'll get laid off.  The only upside is they do have an awesome severance package."
good,hardest part of my job is referring products to customers who hate bank of America. Customers make things easy but you have to stay above a 5 on your quarterly score. I've learned a lot about banking and about each product that we have for the customers. Most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. Everyday I look forward to seeing them because they make everyday easier for me.
good,Positive environment for banking professionals. Enjoyed working with banking co workers. Client service oriented with focus on very positive client experience scores.
good,"Due to recent economic situations working for Bank of America is not an option. Bank of America was great when it came to developing employees strengths and improving their weaknesses."
good,"Company has a strong team-oriented culture for change management, risk management, and quality management.  It values its volunteer activities and community relations, while also fostering strong diversity, personal development, and networking opportunities."
good,"Assisted customers with deposits, payments, etc. Loved my coworkers and boss. Make your referrals and management won't be all over you."
good,"Bank of America management is truly dedicated to excellent customer service and ethical processes. Suggestions for process improvement are honestly considered. Problems (e.g, well-known FC issues) were addressed in the best manner possible and everything was done to avoid repeating mistakes."
good,this is a great place to work if you like dealing with different people everyday and you into sale. This place do get stressful at time especially when it comes done to meeting your goal for sale. if you are not into sale this is not the job for you.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Bank of America.  While it grew through acquisitions while I was there, the trust services group kept its focus on providing a wide-range of services to its private client group."
good,"Always doing the same thing, very consistent type of work. Pushes you on making sales, you assist every type of people, management is okay."
good,"Management is cutting back on salary leaving a lot of work to pick up by employees."
good,"It was a great job culture.  There was a great push on incentive and compensation.  However, as time went on and company changes took place, less incentive was given, and overall changed occurred that made people's jobs more difficult, including role changes with little training."
good,"The financial business is very greedy, it is not for the faint of heart. Bank Of America got to the top by being greedy and after a=every penny."
good,"It was very stressful, However I loved working with customers and problem solving. I was happy when I was able to provide a resolution for a homeowner."
good,Good benefits;  Very structured with strict adherence to procedures a necessity;  Vacation and sick days are liberal;  Management maintains high expectations;
good,"Systems and networks Health checks. Daily Business issues resolve"
good,"driving sales.  you are expected to drive a certain amount of revenue per month and quarter.  if you are in a smaller branch it becomes difficult to do, plus if you do not meet these revenue goals the whole platform is effected by it."
good,"The location that I was employed in ended up getting a new manager a few months after my employment. This manager found any reason she could to write-up any and all employees in order to ""clean house"" of the people she did not want in her office. When she got wind that I was pregnant with my first child, she began writing me up for very minute things that the previous manager had taught me were acceptable. Before I knew it, she had found means to terminate me shortly after I'd made my announcement. I kept in touch with the other employees after leaving and come to find out, she eliminated or relocated almost every employee who worked there. "
good,"Bank of America was a great place for me to start as an immigrant. It gave me the opportunity to discover what I wanted to do and invested so much in my career over the last 10 years.  BOFA supports our service men and women and provides exceptional benefits, nice work place and life balance, flexible working schedules when applicable and fosters a great work culture. At this time in order for me to grow and move forward I must seek other areas outside of Bank of America."
good,"ML was a great place to work.  Many of  the good people are still there, but the BofA culture has crept in. boooo!  the decision to centralize many of the day to day tasks has taken power away from the branch offices and resulted in frustrating delays."
good,"Very fast paced, goal oriented position. Only the most dedicated need apply. Not very family friendly, very strict and demanding but worth all the hard work."
good,BofA is a good company to work for and are good to their employees   when it comes to benefits and the perks that come with it.
good,"Musical chairs of management can create inconsistent message and vision."
good,"Bank of America is a place where you can really learn a lot about the financial industry especially with hands on experience. During my 10 years with this company the most valuable thing I've learned was to trust in your team. There's a lot of things to get done to make the banking center run smoothly, such as background operations, customer delight and attaining sales so we may keep our branches open. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know our clients on a personal level. If you have a great relationship with the neighborhood and our customers, they will come back to you and that's how our business can grow. Creating a positive work environment with your teammates will cultivate this type of growth."
good,A great job for people who love sales and dealing with money.  You are able to grow and advance with the company. Must be willing to transfer at will.
good,I have worked 10 years with this company and have learned a lot. I worked from collections to foreclosure. My favorite job was working as a workout negotiator helping homeowners save there home by placing them on payment plans. That was very rewarding to me.
good,I would begin in the mornings pulling my bankruptcy accounts to complete for the day.  In the afternoons work all bankruptcy accounts assigned to me.  Also afternoon conference calls everyday
good,I have been working with Bank of America for 8 years now. It is a call center environment with incoming calls only. A typical day will be assisting customer with credit card inquires.
good,"This is not a bad place to work at all. However, if you do not have a career goal and a definitive direction then this could easily turn into a mundane experience. You have to enter this company with a clear and concise objective. Then you can make the most of your experience and enjoy your work because you'll know what your working ""for"" or ""towards"". With that being said, this company doesn't necessarily stand out from the rest, but it is far from the worst."
good,"It is definitely family oriented place to work, they offer great benefits, and levels of business is changing to fit the needs of the customer."
good,"As the banking environment evolves, so do the efforts of executive bias towards a stronger P&L ratio. This equates to customer migration, and thus customer dissatisfaction. The working environment is driven based on widget-based product selling, however they are trying to convert to a relationship based model. This, coupled with preference to the more convenient method of managing money-based transactions (mobile banking, customer migration), has been a challenge."
good,"I worked here for six years while in high school and throughout my undergraduate education. They had flexible work hours and there was very little turn over, so the job felt secure."
good,In my 19 yrs. at Bank of America I was fortunate to be able to learn a great deal.  If you were fortunate to be in an area that provided development opportunities it was great.
good,Call center IT job with great benefits. Hard to get hired on as an employee rather than a contractor. Very high pressure and metrics are very closely monitored.
good,"I worked the night shift at Bank of America which consisted of 5-10 Monday through Friday. The team here was good, they were definitely willing to help and provide their input whenever you felt you had to ask. The work was challenging and provided a lot of learning experiences that I really enjoyed. The training program here was also really great, when I finally had the chance to sit at my desk I felt ready and prepared to start working and taking on accounts."
good,"This position is stressful and at times when you want to transfer to a new position there can be a block for associates to leave department. 80% of the time you take escalated calls generally from very angry customers, you must have patients and good verbal communication skills to de-escalate. Rest of position you assist Financial Center Associates with Policy and Procedures and other internal departments for assistance."
good,"Worked as a part-time then as a full time teller, which is 37.5 hours and not 40. The job pays better than minimum wage, but it should pay at least $ 15 but doesn't for the amount of work that you have to do. Management depends on your location, but many managers try to keep things together. the company is starting to go downhill as it downsizes. You never have enough staff. The job is really all about getting people over to sit with a personal banker for a sale. Not really my thing."
good,Monitored and balanced General Ledgers for Debit card claims.  Resolved escalation emails from different lines of business on debit card claims.  All the co-workers I worked with on General Ledgers are knowledgeable and strived to produce accurate results in a timely manner.  The hardest part of the job was not being included in system upgrades where the end results had an adverse reaction on our area.  The most enjoyable part was the research and knowing I had resolved the issue
good,"Typical day at work expect non stop calls till the end of shift"
good,I spent a 5 hour shift on the phones with credit card customers. I have learned that not everyone is nice. The management at that time needed improvement. Everyone was so busy on the phones there really was not much time to interact with your co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being locked into the phones with no end in sight of the call volume going down. The most enjoyable part of the day was when you were able to help a customer who was truly in need of help.
good,If you are guided by the right people the possibilities are endless at Bank of America. Make sure your on time and on task.
good,Typical day at work is very fast pace and customer driven experience. Learned a lot in this job about customer service. Enjoyed working with customers and helping them with their financial needs. Hardest part is Bank of America expected us to meet unrealistic goals.
good,I really loved my last position at Bank of America. We provided a source of application infrastructure information that included guidance on complex processes that was not otherwise available to our internal business clients.
good,"Company is a decent place to work, but over time they are looking to always cut back.  This makes it less that enjoyable place to be when you are always in cost cutting mode."
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with.  After 10 years at that particular office I got to know a lot of customers very well.  I sent cards on many of their birthdays, but especially if  there was a loss.  I visited hospitals and funeral homes.  I found that customers really appreciated my heartfelt concern.  Bank of America itself has sized down the branches making it  very difficult at times to give the quality service that customers  had grown accustomed to.  It has also gone to very much of a sales environment for all employees.  To me that was probably the hardest part, finding it difficult to provide the same level of service and achieve the sales expectations and goals.  There is opportunity for growth within the company, if you so desire."
good,"-A typical day at work consists of helping customers with their accounts and sometimes helping the tellers.At my previous branch i only did teller work and was a teller supervisor."
good,Dealing with people's money is very stressful but the people you work with make it easier.  Very goals oriented but they do work with you to make sure you hit those goals.
good,"Somewhat productive, pressure on customers to get more services."
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with, however the work enviroment is not stable.  Great benefits and work sites.  However, there are too many layoffs."
good,"Consistently dynamic workflow, with limited ability to focus on any specific given task at a time. Co-worker's are like family, and strong connections are built while driving for similar successes. Leadership talent is strict, and sharpens opportunities to strive for best results."
good,"Good work culture being an MNC. Friendly atmosphere. "
good,"Responsible for leading multiple teams in Motion For Relief (MFR) validation’s, where the associate validates draft MFR from the attorney, and if applicable, makes changes to the MFR and returns it to the attorney for corrections."
good,"Started as a temp and moved up in rank to a specialist. I obtained years a useful experience, worked with great people and worked my way through different departments, learning different fields while growing in my field."
good,"it is an average place to work, they use most updated technology, the management style is not good, lot of lay off recently"
good,"It's a good organisation to work with, people are co-operative & humble with each other. I learned a lot from this organisation."
good,I had the best manager ever. She made it possible to deal with the ever changing environment of the field I was in. Bank of America has great benefits but the job security isn't great depending on the line of business you are in.
good,"I am New to banking and been a teller for six months and is one of the most challenging positions ever.Now, from what I heard banking was way different years ago but it is totally about selling things to people who dont want or need it.Emphasis on DO NOT WANT IT OR NEED IT.If they have an overdrafts three months old why would I tell them about a credit card and then they cuss you out.I do love what the company offers and just the best career advice you can get from all of those in differnt sectors of thee bbusiness. the tellers are the running machine behind the bank but I don't think we are compensated enough especially being we have to balance,make sure checks are valid, strap and sell money, get overrides, open and close, get unfit currency ready, make sure all operations are done perfectly, and smile while getting fussed at about a check that someone signed over but not present for a million dollars.Okay, the last was a little dramatic but the situation happens a lot.I speak to a lot of older tellers who come to the bank and they give me feet advice that I apply to my everyday work.Just comes to show whether you were a teller in 94' or 2015..it's hard work  but it's up to you what you want to do with it."
good,"Great benefits but not enough room for advancement."
good,BOA has completely changed their outlook on how to serve customers. It has completely changed to all about the company and has thrown employees and customers to the side.
good,"Bank of America is a great company to work for, the only bad thing I have to say is regarding job security. Up until about 3 years ago job security was great, after that you would worry every day that today would be your last day."
good,A typical day is to get to work and set our daily goals for the day. Most of the my Job title was based on sales and customer service.
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,"Started as a developer, curiosity to learn things. Understood the culture and perception of work tasks and molded accordingly. Had Highs and lows and nurtured myself into various working environments."
good,"I was acquired by BofA through the merger with Countrywide Home Loans. In addition, BofA had acquired our largest competitor and rolled under a single brand. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with a diverse group of internal and external clients. The hardest part of the job was the conflict resolution and maintaining customer relations. I supervised a group of 5 employees that exemplified service and was fortunate to have them in my ranks."
good,"It is a nice organization and learned new technologies ."
good,I would rather not write a detailed review on this company.  They pay well but the interim is that they ay off frequently and do not welcome employees with strong opinions.
good,"A typical work day includes interactions with a lot of different clients and the representatives must know how to help them with whatever issue they might be calling in regards to. I learned a lot in regards to the business world and how investment portfolios work. Management is easy to relate to and friendly. I would have to say the hardest part about the job sometimes is the non stop client interactions, but the most enjoyable part is the amount life in the office."

good,"Day to day you really didn't do the same thing twice in a week"
good,"Bank of America is a great company to work for , but there are a lot of changes going on and it is time to moving on. If you work hard you will be rewarded for your efforts.  Promotions and raises are given but not very high % wise.  The people you work for are great. Management are too busy and everything just falls on your shoulders.  They are understanding with family time and any family obligations."
good,"Bank of America is a very diverse company and i enjoyed working and learning about different cultures/ethnicities. I have always worked in busy branches and i enjoyed it. There was always something to do and I am very good at multitasking. Customers always came first. We always tried to keep our wait time down at the same time give each customer the opportunity to learn about new/changing products, deepen relationships based on financial needs, and demonstrating the different ways to bank. Bank of America also had great benefits such as child care reinbursementr, tuition reinbursement, and associate discounts"

good,BofA had great benefits. The hardest part of the job was mgmt. They kept changing everything. They weren't sure on how to handle our job. I enjoyed working with my co workers.
good,"A day in the life of a teller can be very stressful, people want their money and they want it fast. In one day at the bank I could see up to two hundred clients, sometimes more. I would hand out almost $70,000 in withdrawals and sometimes get deposits of more than that. I had to be very efficient and know how to be accurate with my counting and the computer. There is a lot of opportunity for mistakes. I learned how to multitask without a lot of error. The hardest part of my job was juggling all the tasks my position had at once."
good,"I enjoyed the professional setting of working for Bank of America. I had the opportunity to work independently and work with others and got to know many of my customers and looked forward to seeing them. This was a high stress environment where I learned to multi task and also gained a greater sense of responsibility, professionalism and attention to detail. I had great co workers, and for the most part great management."
good,"1-typical day on work when i feel ill."
good,"Numbers are the only thing that matters. 8 out of 10 customers are unhappy with the bank, but BofA cant seem to figure out why."
good,"The ""who-done-it"" job... Excellent for both independent achiever and team player. With the constant changes in digital world and financial management there is a wealth of knowledge to be learned and job security."
good,I would rather not say. I worked for this company for a long time and i am still employed by bank of america
good,"leave the company too long no comment."
good,A typical day at work is to first go over team goals then individual goals in a team meeting. Afer team meeting we are left to complete our required jobs.
good,"Currently Bank of America is attempting to repair it's image in terms of customer service. So there is a large emphasis on customer delight. The problem is that the company is so large it doesn't  always do a great job of taking care of it's employees, which has a direct impact on customer service."
good,"I have nothing negative to say about Bank of America even though I have received notification my role is being eliminated.  "
good,Long days because I closed each day and worked every Saturday. I learn how to be a teller that was my first banking job. we had nice employees
good,"Bank of America initially treated me well, with a high starting pay and great benefits, mixed with additional perks. Then, after a few years, all of this started getting taken away from the employees until we are left with absolutely nothing of which we started originally."
good,"your career path is in your hands, job networking is important"
good,A typical day at work I would start out looking to see how much I had to do and making a list to pritorize my day. Our team had meetings on a daily bases. I was with this company for 5 yrs and I had serveral different job titles. I learned so much in 5 yrs about homeloans. Managment were good to us. The hardest part of my job each day was letting a customer know I had to foreclosue on the property. The most enjoyable part of my job is the properties I could save from foreclosure and able to help the homowner till they get back on there fee and can pay regular mortgage payment.

good,"I worked in the KC/Overland Park/kansas area and LOVED it. The managers were professional and helped me any way they could to get promoted. working in KC missouri area was horrible, dont work on the Missouri side! Wichita, Ks was a alright market to work for. I moved to that market when BofA was going through a lot of financial difficulties so sales goals and pressure was way too much for me. Managers and employees were quiting everywhere at that time. I have heard from current employees that the goals are set way better now though."
good,Banking can be very challenging. Bank of America spends a great deal of attention on training and team building. Their goal is to create a successful environment for the employee and a great experience for the customer.

My day consited of processing loans, gathering documents, contacting clients, approving docs and final approving loans and getting loans to closing as soon as possible.  When company switched recently to Customer Service, my job now consists of sitting at my desk answering continuous calls from customers with questions or problems regarding their deposit accounts."

good,Offer customers assitance for their home loan delinquency.  Act as single point of contact to answer any questions and request all needed documentation for all review processes.  Assist in maintaining steady process flow to ensure customers receive a fair fast and final decision.
good,"Enjoyed my time at BOA, but extremely unprofessional management."
good,"I worked hard and I did not care about how much I had to work."
good,Too much autonomy at times. Felt that there was a lack of care around the branch at times and inconsistency. This led to poor customer service scores as the inconsistency is reflected by it. Customers were able to see the issues first hand in day to day transaction.
good,"Very much so a retail experience."
good,"Work was to siloed, lack of SMEs and lack of breadth of knowledge to delivery the very best,"
good,"Bank of America has a very strong sales culture, and it really helps prepare you for your next big role.  I managed an amazing and hard working team that believed in winning everyday.  I enjoyed my customers and helping them truly made me happy."

good,"Bank of America was a nice workplace"
good,"Merrill Lynch is a great company to work for and to learn or experience the most of the financial services industry.  The training is thorough and top notch.  I honed my corporate communication skills at Merrill Lynch because of the emphasis in professionalism and business culture.  They access to various brokers, wholesalers and partners provided the training and education to different investment products and vehicles."
good,"Merrill was great before Bank of America took over, everything changed. Not the place for me."
good,"Overall great place to work.  However Budget cuts are causing Management to be more picky about quality of performance. "
good,"This is a world where client associates are merely pawns in the game and financial advisers can do no wrong. A vast majority of client associates are absolutely miserable and made to feel disposable. I know a woman who has worked there for over 30 years and warned me to get out while I still can."
good,"There are pros and cons to working at Bank of America. The hours and benefits are the pros. Branch management, lack of necessary staff, and the nature of being in retail banking are the cons."
good,helping my customers through their financial situation and coming up with programs to keep them up to date with all of their accounts
good,In a state of flux with the financial industry at the moment.
good,Great for college students or individuals wanting to begin their careers.
good,"First we would have a morning meeting, giving recognitions to co-workers from the previous day. Once the doors were open then, we would assist ll customers transactions and needs. Customers that were originals were friendly and understanding. Most of the difficulty came from once in a while customers who did enter the bank on a weekly basis. My co-workers were great and I appreciated working with them all. There were things we helped one another understand and working side by side helped make our days go by faster. The management behind the teller line was top notch, as for the head bank manager, no comment. The most enjoyable part of work was helping each other translate for one another and learn a new language for the future. The hardest part of the job I found was when there wasn't someone to help translate, trying to get the transaction of the customer correct and in a timely fashion."
good,Enjoyed my time at Bank of America.  Excellent pay and benefits.  No room for advancement unless you work at one of the main corporate centers.
good,"I am a full time employee, my daily procedures include helping and finding ways to advance consumer and business banking. This job has help me with my communication skills as well as finding ways to better my customers  banking relationship. I work with an awesome team and we are all supportive of one another. I enjoy helping others and that is what my job is all about."
good,need good improvements for employees to grow and also need some good team building activites
good,"The bank I work for is one of the largest banks on the globe providing consumers with an array of finance, mortgage and investment programs. Technology puts them on the forefront leading the way for others to follow. "
good,Working for this company for many years helped me grow as and individual. I taught me many skills to take away for future jobs. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the challenging task at hand each day.
good,"becoming hard to move up within the company "
good,There are serious consitency gaps in leadership within the organzation
good,A smart group of young people usually tellering the windows.  Good work ethics and smart young adults working there.  They had quality products and co workers were friendly and competent
good,Everyday at work it is enjoyable to help customers with their finacial needs.
good,"BAC is a nice place to work. I was laid off due to my dept and was given a nice severance package, Business is Business.. overall nice place to work."
good,"I started working for CUETS when it was owned by bank of america."
good,Good place to work as long as you realize that you must prepare for your next job.  Restructuring occurs on a regular basis.  You will be reassigned to a new manager frequently and there is really no job security.
good,"challenges in workflows in ever-changing bank environment"
good,we have bank members with checking accounts fee and saving accounts and also help them get online to review there accts and make credit card payments
good,"Although opportunities do exists, retaining senior employees as career employees that reflect culture awareness."
good,Reviewed conditions all day.  Pulled conditions from queue in order in which they were received. Shared Queue with 4 other co-workers and worked together to clear difficult conditions.
good,"I handle all calendarizing, travel, off-sites, and am action Business Support Manager.  Constantly keeping team aware of deadlines to produce deliverables in a timely manner.  The hardest part would be calendar management.  My boss has a calendar that is booked 50 hours a week and it is difficult to manage and make room for things that come up.  This is in addition to his travel which is about 1 week a month.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the pace.  I am always busy and very rarely have down time."
good,To much Micromanagement to stricy on the seeling and no compensation for it.
good,"Bank of America has consistently been rated as one of the best places to work.  That has not been evidenced in the department where I work. Although the associates pull together and work as a cohesive unit and support one another, management has not. The hardest part about my job at Bank of America is the poor management.  Associate after associate has left the company due to management issues and the inability to promote within the corporation due to management. "
good,"It is a great starter job, but has become too corporate and concerned with sales instead of the actual people banking with the company."
good,"In banking you never know what is going to walk through the door, from the time you open till the time you close.  There is never a typical day.  Everyday there is an opportunity to help and serve your existing customer base and a chance for expansion of that base."
good,loved working for Bank of America during the first year than things started to change a bit and the environment was very stressful for our department.
good,"Adorei trabalhar no bank of america, mas infelizmente não era o que eu busco profissionalmente."
good,This job was ok but it wasn't something beneficial for me. I think working there at the bank really allowed me to see how worthy of an employee I was to them but I think it was time for me to move forward.
good,"At Bank of America, my job was to assist in resolving litigation. I would get a complaint listing BANA as the defendant. It was my job to hire outside counsel to litigate or resolve the issue. "
good,"Co workers were great, company was going through a lot of changes so high volume of layoff, awesome benefits though."
good,"I am glad  I had the opportunity to enhance my skills through"
good,"There is no opportunity for growth within the retail banking line of business. The company has began to downsize management opportunities as well. Locations have done away with Assistant Manager's with them being demoted to banker roles. If you're looking to go into another line of business it will be difficult as the typical response is that you need to already have experience in that department. They have no training for associates to allow them to be  hired into entry level positions.  The company also changes it's product focus on a weekly basis which makes it somewhat difficult to build relationships with customer when you are throwing something new in their face on a weekly basis. They also ask bankers to refer mortgage, SB and investments by phone! Those 3 things are very impotant to customers so why not have an actual person to speak with them instead of trying to put them on a phone (which most customers decline). Management WILL NOT protect you when it comes to goals regardless of the amount of traffic as more customers are utilizing online services, as they are looking to decrease the roles of bankers and prefer to have a Sales and Service Specialist (SSS) do a bankers job to reduce banking center salaries and not pay out incentives as SSS do not get bonuses regardless of what they sale."
good,Currently employed with company. A highly structured environment.
good,"A typical day at Bank of America for me as a Sales and Service Specialist would be arriving at work setting up my work station, call on voice mail. Once opened to the public I would assist customers by answering any questions or concerns about their accounts. Cross sell when I noticed an opportunity and also assist with non members by setting them up with our products and services."
good,Acquired a great deal of experience in default servicing and hope to take my experience to a financially stable with potential for growth company.
good,"Analyzes purchase requisitions for completeness and accuracy of information and ensures corporate policies and grants of authority or signatory powers are adhered to Enters and processes requisitions to purchase orders using JD Edwards ERP system. "
good,"Expectations change so rapidly it's hard to keep up with what is considered important and what is minutia. "
good,"Typical day was working on tickets throughout the company.  "
good,A typical work day during peek times for mortgage is usually at least 10 hours.  I have learned the customer always comes first and keeping them informed lessens their anxiety about all the information they will be reviewing and signing.  Management was awesome at trying to support were needed.  My co-workers were amazing people.  We were more like a family.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get settlement statement accurately prepared by outside title companies.  The most enjoyable part of my job was speaking to the customers that really appreciated how they were kept informed and had a smooth signing.  I also really enjoyed interacting with my co-workers daily.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of reviewing emails, answering inquires and resolving issues/concerns. The best part about this job would be the co-workers that make the day fly past with colors."
good,"Beginning day of loan processing, checking for new files and pulling oldest application to get file processed within 30 days of application date. I learned a lot about the mortgage industry. Mortgage rules and regulation of conventional, MHA, VA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans. Co-workers were very helpful in assisting with pipeline when able to as well as being open for advise and suggestion to move loans faster. The hardest part of the job was having to contact a customer in need to decline a loan due to payment history. One late payment in the past 12 months could possibly require the loan to be denied. The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was not a bored moment in the day. Most customers were relieved and very thankful to close with lower rates."
good,"Bank of America was a great company to work for. Within the year and a half that I have worked there I have taken inbound and outbound calls, also worked on the manual campaign. The managers that I have had apart of getting to know where all highly professional and dedicated to their associates. I have had the opportunity to meet a lot of great people and learn so much from them. Bank of America has taught me about the mortgage industry and also about customer service."
good,"This is a great company to work for, but change (whether good or bad) is frequent and quick. Employment metrics can be difficult to meet, but attainable for hard workers. Employee benefits are wonderful when compared to most companies and vacation time is generous."
good,"Initially this was a very progressive work environment that seemed to offer a number of promotional and advancement avenues.  However, conditions became more restrictive, less attainable and incentives were diminished as the home mortgage market was overtaken by sub prime loan issues and the escalating negative impact that had on the mortgage industry.  Perhaps it was a matter of uncertainty inherent within the mortgage industry that resulted in increased stress conditions and escalated voluntary employee turnover."
good,The location is currently no longer there and is closed but when it was there it was a stressful environment.
good,Started out with a low salary right out of college and was never able to move forward and make the money I wanted to.  I ended up having to jump corporate ladders to get paid what I was worth.
good,"Sales, Referrals, Moving the Line Swiftly. "
good,"I gained a slate of diverse specialized skills working here. I invested in the company and the company invested in my progressive growth and development. I am very proud to have worked for a company that cares about its people, and their work/ life balance and offers advancement opportunity to those that put in the work. I'm extremely grateful for a leadership team that pushed me to be the best I could be!"
good,"Very stressful environment, target driven, no stability - ie get moved around alot. Best part of the job was the people."
good,"I lo gin for 9 hours out of which 1 hour is fixed for break, we are expected to give minimum 6.8 hours of production and remaining 1.2 hours are dedicated for employee's grooming team huddles, update sharing etc. At bank of America i got the opportunity to learn a lot of things about corporate communication, event organizing, presentation skills, people management,handling queries,Data analysis and learning continues.The work environment is great where every individual is treated fairly and with respect, the best part about my work is i can make complete use of the skill set which i have developed over a period of time since my work involves critical analysis of present facts and data, toughest part is sometimes we are presented with tricky situations and it becomes difficult to reach to a decision since my work directly impacts customer and bank of America hence there is no room for errors.the management and leadership encourage and extend support for new learning and initiatives."
good,It is a good place to work. My management in particular ensured that they gave me work that directly tied into my career goals of being apart of management. That is something that is rare and I appreciated that greatly.
good,"My work involves a program that incorporate 16 projects identified to replace a major system. The focus of my position is on the business acceptance testing for all 16  projects. This requires coordination from a program perspective as well as a project perspective. Deliverables include a program WBS, program and project test plans, data management, scripting, and execution. Coordination between each projects LOB and SMEs is required as many of the project objectives cross over into other areas. The best part of this position is the ability so see how things come together and the excitement of the business end users."
good,BoFa is very good employer and Company which provide immense learning opportunity. In my past 4 yr tenure i learned a lot and worked on multiple project and technologies. I would say it was BIG GAIN for me to work with BoFA.
good,I enjoyed being with customers and helping them. That was the best part of the job. I didn't care for having to meet sales quotas. Working at the bank we went through different managers almost twice a year. Some of them I absolutely loved. My co-workers were great as well.
good,"Company has great benefit plans, however compansation is not as comparative as other financial institutions.  I have learned how to a leader and have confindence on myself.  I gained good customer service skills.  I have the opportunity to meed really good friends of different nationalities."
good,Great brand and great compensation.  Very diverse company with breadth of career opportunities for anyone beginning or well established.  Focus on balancing work/life.  Many demands and expectations for the compensation paid.
good,"Bank of America was a great place to work, but due to the economy they were starting to downsize the company and so there was no way to move around within the company to another department."
good,I've enjoyed working at BAC however due to realignments and organizational restructuring I'm exploring other options.
good,"While collections can be mundane and dreadful from time to time, the employees you interact with daily make it worth your while. You really learn from one another. Some have years of experience doing collections and some are just starting. It was easy making friends and learning from one another. Very diverse. Management on the other hand is very difficult to work with from time to time. When I was there, Most of management did not have a collections background and were not at all informative and helpful. They were there more to baby sit and give you a hard time with the daily goals that had to be met; some of which were impossible to meet given that there is no real grid on how each call is handled due to each call being different. Recognition is high but the incentives are pretty much a joke compared to other collections jobs I've held previously"
good,"Bank of America use to be the company to work for in the banking center, but utimatly the bank is a bus. and Sales are more important."
good,"Arrived at work, attend meetings, research data, pull data, meetings"
good,I learned really good customer service skills from this position.  I got awarded for being top in my team for january and august and got many complimentary calls to my manager from satisfied customers.
good,"Healthcare, especially if you have a family"
good,"The personnel part of Bank of America rocks, the corporate part, is a completely different story.  They say they care about their employees, they don't."
good,"bank of America offered a 4 month training program to learn all of the ins and outs of mortgage, each day I answer over 60 calls aday and help sometimes irate borrowers with there mortgages. the hardest part of the job was being yelled at by the customers but the most rewarding part of the job was helping those same upset borrowers with there problem and having them leave the call satisfied and happy."
good,We started out the day with a huddle. I worked diffrent branches and learned diffrent management styles.the hardest part of this job was the hours at that time in my life. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and taking care of my customers.
good,"* Review volume and develop strategy for Team to ensure all functions are covered, internal Service Level Agreements are achieved, and pursue cross training opportunities for associates when volume permits"
good,"A typical day at work would start with getting up to date on any leftover work from the previous day. That includes all follow ups with other departments or institutions. I would then begin taking calls and assisting customers and associates with new issues. I learned a great deal about time management as well as setting realistic expectations. I would often assist my manager with escalated issues from other associates. They would often have a large number of escalations come in and they would have to manage their time between escalations and other managerial duties. I was very happy to be asked to help with escalations and later was given the opportunity to fill in as manager whenever they were off.  The hardest part of the job was to often the right hand didn't know what the left was doing, and at times we had lengthy waits on responses or approvals from other departments which would affect the customer experience.  "
good,"I held many jobs at Bank of America as I advanced to Consumer Loan Officer and AVP - which was the highlight of my career with them and consumed the last 10 years of my career with BOA.  Prior to that I was a head teller, customer service representative, operations officer, collections expert, and then moved into lending."
good,"Good place to work.  People were nice. The location I was with was being sold and they were moving the branch, so I decided to leave."
good,"Bank of America is pretty much a textbook example of corporate America, and it can have all of the pros and cons as you would expect.  There is a great culture of diversity, which is refreshing.  However there can be challenges with office politics if you get on the wrong side.  But typically, if you work hard and have integrity, you can get ahead."
good,A typical day at work always started with finishing up tasks from the days prior that were not yet completed.  Management was not always available so we had to use our help line for assistance or request the help from a co-worker who was next ranked as supervisor.  Many times there were promises of receiving extra one on one help with the system by a co-worker but never happened because of the large flow of traffic.  The hardest part of the job was to complete all monthly training courses during the work day when the majority of the time there were customers waiting to be helped.  The customer always comes first so training was usually forced in after hours which was hard on your schedule outside of work if you had sports or children to pick up.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to make clients happy and see them time after time requesting for your assistance.
good,What I learned in this job is something I can defenitely use in the job market place.
good,I always enjoyed my time at Merrill and was given continued opportunities for advancements until recently.   Was recently placed under a poor leader and manager and decided to leave the firm when my role moved out of state.
good,"nothing special, typical bank environment, hard to apply for advancement"
good,"A fast-paced, changing environment is what to expect while working for Bank Of America."
good,Sales sales sales sales goals goals goals goals sales sales sales! Morning meetings about sales! Constant training about sales! Everything here is sales! GREAT BENEFITS! 
good,"Nothing great or bad, just neutral. Some might feel overworked and underpaid."
good,"Cash & Transportation services was a very demaning job that left very little family time, with exception to the weekends.  I learned that I am not always going to please everyone who works for me has I had accomplished in my previous roles.  Being very new to the cash vault enviorment of the Bank, leading a team of highly trained and tenured employees was a difficult task, everyone wanted to be chief, I needed everyone to be indins.  There was much confict due to this.  I learned that I can not please everyone that works for me and that trying to win everyone over was not possible.  I was open, honest and available for everyone, but they did not welcome that.  I enjoyed learing a totally new banking enviornment after have know only the customer service aspect fo banking.  I had very little training after accepting a higly demanding role that focused on risk, safety and security compliance.  I learned much and I am very greatful for that.  My day consisted of putting together progress reports, scheduling, driving efficiency and accuracy, driving deadlines, positive moral and overall accoutabiltiy for deposits made and change orders requested by banking centers and customers."
good,"A great place to start career with multiple opportunities to advance with several locations in the state. "
good,I enjoyed my position working for this company. I became very experienced with accounting responsibilities.
good,Great job for part-time employment if you are good at pushing individuals for sales.
good,Working with BAC was a great learning experiance.  The skills I learned there allow me to advance professionally.  The management staff was accessable to the associates which was a great but they were not always knowledgable and could not answer most questions.  Which made the job a little hard. The people I worked with were great and halpful.  I really enjoyed the people that I worked with.
good,"I worked for Bank of America for almost 9 years and gained a lot of valuable experience in several lines of business. The career opportunities, if you are willing to be flexible with job location are bountiful."
good,A typical day was very stressful with not much help from the immediate management. I learned a lot about banking policies and procedures. My co workers were fun to be around and enjoyable.
good,"Local management is excellent,"
good,"It is a call center. The managers do there best to make sure you suceed in you position. It is also a large company that has gone thru financial hardship so there is very little leeway when it comes to bank policies and being terminated or advanced to a new position. Moving up in the company is very difficult as they would rather rotate existing managers then move people up. If you are looking for a call center that doesn't expect more than you to come in, put in your hours, and leave with great benefits, this is a great fit."
good,"The position would be a great one if they implemented a training program. The job is very demanding but thats not the real issue, the real issue is lack of training but pressure to pass test and meet quotas that they do not prepare you for. The people there are great but if the pipelines are full of loans (which is a good thing) you are basically on your own . Finally, they are too many procedures for each file to NOT have a training program in place for new associates. That increases the chances for failure."
good,A typical day at work meant working as a team to meet goals and competing against others to reach metric goals. Providing excellent customer service was vital. I learned about finances and how to manage my own personal credit. My co-workers were like a close knit family. The hardest part of the job was trying to collect on accounts that fell past due over several months and customers going through financial stress. The positive side was that we were usually able to work with customers to give them a payment program or give them other options to get back on track with their finances.
good,"Hopewell campus is good to work for. Also, it matters which group you work . Current role is ex-termly busy. They do make you work more than the money and benefits they pay"
good,Great team environment. The type of work offered and amount of positions could improve.
good,The company gave me an opportunity to grow. They practice inclusiveness and other core values that makes it a better environment.
good,a typical day at work was very stressful. Bad enough when you have non-stop issues you are trying to resolve. But to have management micro-managing you too was a little too much. Enjoyed working with my co-workers. Everyone seemed to get along with one another and worked well to do the job.
good,I've learned the mortgage loan process from current to delinquency to loss mitigation pre-foreclosure and liquidation.
good,"I am available 24/7 to my teams as our's is a dynamic environment full of activity and Teams require me for guidance, support and approvals all the time. Management and the folks reporting to me are very supportive and take their roles seriously. Overall, A typical day at work is full of activity with tasks ranging from preparing reports, presentations, conducting/attending application review meetings. coaching team members, stats, SLAs, Global outages etc.."
good,"I have learned various duties working in the Cash Vault such as receiving,high speed machines, shipment for currency to the Federal Reserve bank and balancing of high volume of cash"
good,"I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems, be it Technology, Process or People related. My road usually begins where other road end. I always bring a out of the box thinking to the table, not afraid to challenge the status-quo."
good,"Bank of America has always been a pioneer for great benefits, compensation and advancement. In the past; (pre-2008), it has promoted a culture the embracing diversity, routine associate development, and progressive learning."
good,Overall an okay place to work. Expect to push a lot of products.
good,"conversate with appraisers, title companies, processors, management in order to complete full review of file. manage pipeline in order to meet expected production goals."
good,My day went fast because I was merchant vault teller who took care of the businesses. My co-workers were a hoot. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the 3+ referrals we had to get a day.
good,"It's a good company to work but the salary is bellow the industry, other benefits are good. Also limited possibility to grow."
good,Bank of america offered many opportunities to learn new skills.
good,"A typical workday is managing the line of operations for 30- 45 associate. You would be facing with a lot of different issues at any given moment so you would have to be prepared at any given time. Sometimes you would be auditing associates work, fixing any adjustments of transaction to client's account to make sure there is no customer impact, and training associates on proper techniques to maximize efficiency. Other times you may be taking on major projects which you get to learn more about the backbone of the operations through six sigma techniques. You may have the opportunity to fully take on full scale projects and run those projects on a national scale."
good,"Engaging team members through huddles and effective skill building activities, by Focusing on customer service, uncovering needs through high impact questions to deepen relationships. Developing Individual Development Plans to help out team members take the next step in their career."
good,"Management not very understanding, company and benefits were good."
good,"Account payable, receivable and a lot of customer service. I learned a lot about the accuracy of doing account Receivable and Account payable. My co-workers where great. The hardest part of the job was maintaining accurate balance and watching out for counterfeit money and fake checks."
good,This is a good company to work for and my Sr. Management team is great!!!! they promote opportunity to succeed.
good,"When I worked there, it had great benefits. Culture was okay. Work and Life balance was average. Management was not co-operative."
good,Great company and benefits. Opportunity to establish a career with long term potential. Most associates value team work and do their part to get the job done. The majority of employees are great to work with and value their jobs. Top management is progressive in positioning the company to be regarded as best in class by customers and thought of as a best place to work by employees.
good,"Being in management each day was different. Each day I could be working a teller window, opening new accounts, coaching employees, and taking care of customers. Harest part of the job was having to terminate employees. Most enjoyable was the working relationship I had with other departments, along with getting to know my customers"
good,"Overall culture and management of the sales division was excellent and supportive. Style of management was hands on and openly communicative. However, management had not clearly defined the rules of engagement and there were ongoing disputes between business units at BAMS and First Data."
good,"Just a part time job to pay the bills at school. People are great, but the corporation is all profits."
good,This company is not very caring about their employees at all.
good,"Fast paste environment, busy work all day. I gained knowledge on the FHA and CONVENTIONAL loans people go through everyday. Management was great easy to talk to and understand. Co-workers nice people that had the same work ethic i had, easy to work with in teams. The hardest part would have to be us having a meeting right before work and still having to reach our daily quota but a challenge made it even better. And of course learning something new everyday was great and getting to know my team members a little more on our down times."
good,The company is not a bad place to work however it is extremely difficult to try and advance within the company. I have tried numerous times to post for positions within other departments where I would be more than qualified however did not even get a phone call.
good,Working with excel most of the day. Reviewing assoicates work for accuracy and detail
good,Great place to work where career advancement is available.
good,Great people and lots of room to advance for those who work hard. Work environment is very comfortable and everyone gets along like family.
good,"A typical day at work would entail a morning meeting 2 hours prior to the market opening. After the meeting you would prospect for new business. One would use their niche to acquire new clients (cold calling, face to face meeting, and seminars). I learned various way to effectively deliver proprietary products (hard selling, cross selling, soft selling etc). My co workers were very friendly but management was very distant. The position is not hard but very time consuming. The most enjoyable part of the job was the competitive aspect of the position. Hurdling monthly challenges of bringing in new business and developing a continuos business plan to make your business successful."
good,Review status of active projects in the works. Follow up on Heat Map results. Attend daily status meetings.
good,"Bank of America is a good company to work for. They provide you with standard benefits and a good working environment. Because of all of the changes in the economy, the only thing that has been constant is change at the Bank. Some of the changes are necessary, but some of the changes are not. You will receive an average salary for the Banking industry that you will have to make up by exceeding your sales goals. Overall a good company with lots of change and average pay."
good,"On any given day I would go in early and prepare ATMs for deposit, organize and set goals for staff throughout the day, take conference calls at 8 am, have a team meeting before opening the branch to the public in order to boost morale and communicate important information, make cash or supply orders as needed, do routine observations on staff members and tellers for overall performance rating during coaching sessions, audit paperwork and enforce federal guidelines as well as fraud prevention measures, Work with upper management to ensure scheduling and personnel were properly appointed."
good,"I worked there for six years. I had room for advancement during that time but it depends on the team where you go. If you get a boss that is old-school, plays favorites and has bias against certain employees, you won't advance as fast. I was able to work from home as often as I wanted and balanced my work and life pretty well. I learned a lot of new things. Pay was decent but below average for the industry. Benefits are excellent. However being financial services job security is not great and layoffs are a constant threat."
good,"First, we need leadership by example. As a leader, it is part of your job to reinforce and propagate the culture and values of the enterprise, starting with integrity. Our leaders should be held to an even higher standard of integrity than the one to which we hold everyone else. And here I mean all our leaders, not just the folks at the very top. Leadership is part of the company culture, and regardless of where you are in the corporate hierarchy, being a leader means heightened responsibility. The only way to demonstrate integrity as a leader is to act with integrity in everything you do."
good,Has great benefits but very strict working environment. Bank of America can be very stressful
good,Bank of America does whatever it can to improve customer experience as they are the most important thing. Sometimes this means breaking policies or putting employees in a tough spot.
good,"This company is a good start for young professionals to get experience in corporate America. Pay is livable, and experiences are life lessons to hold on to."
good,Never a dull moment talking to Bank of America customers/borrowers.
good,Workflow could use some major improvements.
good,"Good co-workers, management wasn't the best. But not the worst place I've worked!"
good,I became expert in interest rate derivatives. And got good hands on DTCC and paper confirms.
good,"I didn't have a great experience working for a certain branch, but the company is a good place to work for."
good,A typical day at work would be taking phone calls and assisting each and every customer every wasy possible. With management the team wouldnt have succeeded the way that it did. Coworkers were amazing. I enjoyed being able to solve customer problems.
good,My position as an Options Sales Trading Specialist did not have a typical day in the conventional sense. A lot of my day was predicated on what the markets were doing. I worked on an electronic trade support desk and we would field client calls regarding the many aspects of electronic trading. Everything from resolving clearing issues to answering questions about the firms' front end trading application. I also had a small book of clients that I was responsible. I would reach out and make sure all their needs were being met and see how we can help improve their ability to trade.
good,"My position with Bank of America, although in the customer service the services provided were very specific and this was a very different structure of service for me."
good,"•Managing Pre-Sale Foreclosure processes on Loans for FHA, and Conventional Loan types Ensuring that Investor, Insurer, Government Agency and our client's guidelines are met"
good,Co-workers were friendly. A typical day at work high call volume with escalated calls for consumer credit cards. The hardest part of the job was getting laid off.
good,"The best part of this company is to learn many things from its training module. I learned many things from attending trainings like advance excel, mortgage basic and trainings related to organisational behaviour, motivational factors etc."
good,I had some issues with emplyees at time and it doesn't seem like things were handled properly. Because the behavior of the emplyees has gotton worst!
good,Productive and Fun work place. I've learned a lot about the mortgage loan industry and how to be sure the customer is always number one.
good,Serving as a Customer Service Associate; providing status of real estate loans to personal bankers and applying customer’s; correcting information on mortgage documents for banking officers to complete their loan closings with customers.
good,Log into your phone and computer and make calls or take inbound calls. Learned much about the mortgage industry and the housing industry. Management tended to push workers to sell loans to people that they would not help. Co-workers were helpful and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet the goals every month in this economy and with current home prices. The most enjoyable part was selling a mortgage to a person that it really benefitted.
good,"As a Bank of America account manager in CAS my responsibilities was assisting current bank customer on the phone who need account assistance and advice in credit cards,payments,collection,payments programs and mortgage."
good,Big organization with lots of opportunities and great benefits.
good,Extremely high turnover due to disorganized management and quality assurance.
good,"Shared work space (not good at all the day shift has no respect for night shift employee's), To many projects and system use given with no correct directions(lucky for me I have been in retention for over 5 years ); training is one key point that BOA has (excellent); mangement really has interesting methods; my co-workers are the best; the hardest part of my job is not being with my family the most important time (evenings); the most satifaction I get out of work to insure every borrower assign to me does not get losed in the process."
good,"I enjoyed working at Merrill Lynch for the opportunity to learn something about the financial world, and how to talk to customers in crisis."
good,"No management on site for division I worked with, no complete direction for my position. Worked on my own, for management that did not understand what my duties entailed."
good,"Now a global bank with many divisions, I enjoyed my time with Bank of America and have worked for them on two different assignments/roles."
good,We were able to work from home or in the office
good,BofA was an excellent place to establish a career if you had the right mentor and if you were an over-achiever!
good,"All work not much play, All about numbers. Great benefits awesome manager"
good,I entered into this job with high hopes for the new beginings this was offering me.
good,The company is very dedicated to a diverse corporate environment and embraces freedom of expression for all employees
good,You can move up in this company you just have to be willing to deal with changes all the time.
good,Great job security but there is too much slacking in form of no accountability.
good,"foreclosure sales, great benefits, pay could be better. Foreclosure department, completing sale reviews."
good,"Working at a busy banking center, I can say that the job as a full-time teller can be quite demanding at times. As soon as you arrive to work you are kept busy and expected to maintain near perfect cash handling, maintain the customers morale by moving as quickly as possible from one customer to the other, and referring (up-selling) customers and non-customers to the personal banker. Seeing the regular customers on a day to day basis makes the job fulfilling and fun. However, management can sometimes be overbearing and micromanage a little too much."
good,"Role consists of direct contact with ultra high net worth clientele. I help manage entire financial picture for our customers from a wholistic perspective, including estate planning, wealth strategy, and investment management."
good,"After teller training, I assumed the duties of Currency Control Teller. Responsibilities included providing for the cash needs of commercial accounts. I was responsible for a daily cash balance of approximately $1.5 million. This included providing for the cash needs of eight commercial tellers. I was responsible for taking in large cash deposits and cashing large checks for commercial accounts. Maintained the cash vault shipping and receiving."
good,I may not always agree with the way they do business or the policies and procedures but I will say that they embrace diversity (I'm covered in piercings and tattoos). They have GREAT benefits but I am underpaid for what I do.
good,My review is the company should have more advancement opportunities.
good,"Sales, operations, customer service intense."
good,"i have been working at BOA as a Processor Support for over 1 year, as a contractor- high volume of work but not making enough money for the kin of work I do. I don't like working evenings, that is why I would like to get a day job instead."
good,Worked for the gorilla bank BOA. Pretty much a very arrogant bank that has lost lots of customers and emloyees alike. Demand your full effort and pay you peanuts compared to other banks.
good,"The ability to work remotely improves work/life balance and the benefits provided are second to none (401k matching, 12 weeks maternity/paternity leave, etc.)."
good,The benefit and perks are good. In this economy the company is stable.
good,"There were many nice, professional managers who actively worked with employees at all levels."
good,"I worked at Bank of America as a teller for 2 1/2 years. I loved the company and it's benefits! Perfect if you are going to school. Working part time with full benefits is great. However, they do not have much incentives for tellers and if you get the wrong manager (like I did in my last year) it can be very difficult. My advice, if you get a lousy manager, transfer asap! Or else they can keep you from moving to another branch later."
good,Company has all Financial Products and locations throughout the country. Currently undergoing many changes and re-alignments as it works to build a stronger organization and improve both customer and employee satisfaction.
good,I worked there for many years and went through at least 3 mergers with other banks. It seemed each time we improved and could do so much more for the customers. They had great training programs and you could advance if you chose to do so.
good,"Although they were results-based monitoring and assessment during project supervision, it was also laid back at times"
good,"Overall it is a cool place to work, just getting in is a very difficult task."
good,"Bank of America is an okay company to work for. There have been many management changes over the years, therefore leaving the branches to do most of the work and not being compensated or even thanked for it."
good,"Decent company with strong fundamentals (contrary to news reports). Layoffs are rare (even though I got hit by one by being in the wrong place at the wrong time), and the severance package is generous. Pay is mediocre, but benefits are excellent. Biggest problem is centralization. You cannot move laterally within this company because any function that you do not already perform is probably centralized out of state. Don't join this company with the expectation that you will ever do anything significantly different that what you were originally hired for unless you are willing to relocate. Upward movement is much easier."
good,"At first the company was a great place to work for, but after their profit was reduced, they started monitoring everyone's work, and started laying off people, which caused more work for others."
good,"Great company, but in need of a different challenge and need to learn something new. Been here for 6 years now, and I feel I am not paid fairly for what I do"
good,Great bank to work for but challenging compensation structure for sales roles.  Hard work does not always pay off.  Excellent benefits for employees and their family.
good,"Standard contract position.  Remote working with Bank of America."
good,"The Contact center is all about number and metrics. they want you at your desk 99% of the time. I experienced managers questioning the amount of time I spent in the bathroom. Anytime you got up from your desk during a not scheduled break or lunch was a problem. Everything has an algorithm from your hold times talk times, breaks lunches"
good,"I've had multiple managers at my time in Bank of America, and my ability to perform my duties varied dramatically depending on the manager. As befitting any sufficiently large corporation, your experience is largely variable depending on where you land."
good,"Great Benefits and advancement opportunities outside the local area"
good,Great benefits structured business good pay very structured to giving back to the community alot of growth for dedicated employees alot of oppit;ejf huh fu
good,"Micromanagement really trickles down from senior managers. Four months paid maternity/paternity leave. If performance metrics aren't met, it becomes a little hostile to work."
good,I love being an independent worker. I probably work harder in my home environment than in an office with multiple interruptions. However  sometimes and in some cases there was a lack of support from management.
good,I started there entry level with no experience. They were willing to take a chance of me and I am grateful. I feel the opportunity for advancement is limited if you are older.
good,"It is an okay place to work. It is a good work life balance there. Very good benefits as well. Like with any job, stress may be involved deprnding on the type of department that you work in."
good,the bank is rapidly changing.  the IT area wants to be a tech company but still operates as a financial institution.  not doing a great job blending the 2
good,"The culture is very much based on who likes you. I specifically remember a supervisor telling me a new guy was cute. this kid was a high school drop out this was his first job except for a month as a barista at starbucks and within a month he was interviewing for a promotion that he got.  She wrote up his resume, told hm what he should wear to the interview and was present during his interview and hiring process.  He is ow a manager. I know this because I dated the guy so nt only did he tell me but the hiring manager told me as well that she wanted to help him out to see if he would date her!"
good,Bank of America is all about the numbers. Many management decisions are based strictly on the numbers regardless if the decision makes personal or business sense.
good,"With all the cutbacks it is not a good place to work. The management went from excellent to poor. When you have a manager who tells people to ""sweep"" a physical attack on someone under the rug it says a lot."
good,"I was recruited as a former employee to work in Del Mar Ca branch. Excited. "
good,"The management seem nice when you are first hired, but are non existent, through the study process. I stayed in a cubicle surrounded by loud people that had no regard for others. The licensing exams are no joke and if you miss by even one point below the company threshold, you get one month unpaid time to find another position within the company. I am not sure if that is to get out of paying unemployment, or if they are truly invested in helping people find other positions within the company. I guess I will find out. So far, I am not impressed, but I have not had the pleasure of actually working yet, just studying for exams, the first I passed, the second I missed by one point of the company threshold."
good,Was an employer for 7yrs with BOA they take more importance to upper management than they do their employees. Never was room to move up. Pay wasnt great.
good,"I enjoyed most of my time at Merrill Edge.  However, the opportunities for further personal development had been limited.  This was a purely phone based sales job, and other roles within the Merrill Edge call center were more of the same.  My direct manager was excellent.  He helped direct and to develop my improvement on the phones in-line with the expectations at Merrill Edge.  I was able to meet or exceed productions goals, and the compensation was great to start.  However, as time progressed, we had several compensation cuts and the goals in order to earn above target pay would have required close to $30,000,000 of new assets each quarter.  They eventually disbanded the team, and I felt it was time for a break."
good,"This isn't unique to BOA. Many big banks over promise to customers but keep a tight leash on what employees are capable of when helping customers. For example, when a customer has an overdraft fee, the computer decides whether or not to refund that person's fee. It will always automatically refund a wealthy person's fees because banks want to keep their business. When a working class or poor person needs a fee waived so they can eat a meal that day or get $5 in gas to make it home, the computer won't allow you to help them and you need a manager override. After being with the bank for a year, manager overrides were taken away. So when the customer is upset, there is little you can do to help them, and this leaves them frustrated. If they are called by the 3rd party survey company; they will be asked to rate their service received at the branch, and rate the employee who helped them. You will get negative scores due to this which will affect raises, promotions, and even job security. Some people give bad scores simply because they don't like the big banks, and there is nothing you can do about it."
good,"As a manager of a 24/7 production support team, I was escalation for all critical incidents. I learned how to look at the big picture and understand from the stakeholders perspective."
good,"A typical day is to come in check your emails and see how you are in your quarter goals. You have your days that it's busy and days when it is completely empty. Goals are somewhat high, but doable depending on your location and if management is capable of helping you out. Required to do calls, reach out to clients, and management will be on top of you if you're slacking in reaching your goals."
good,"Great benefits. Mostly enjoyed interacting with customers, they really care about the customers needs and supporting their goals. You will build great relationships with customers and teammates."
good,Working in their call center is much different than being inside the bank. I would have rather done that instead because taking calls back to back could be really stressful.
good,"Fast paced inbound call center environment.  Extensive training provided for the marketing department.  Required sales goals for all departments, along with limited talk and after call times."
good,"The culture is one of nurturing to the community.  There are many incentives to get involved in extracurricular activities.  Internal programs to nurture your skills. "
good,Not fun though not a bad place to work as the quality of their technology is the very best.  The benefits are very good and the opportunities are good.
good,"I last worked for BofA about 15 years ago so things may have changed.  It was a foot in the door for me at the time and I was able to move up quickly, though they did not seem to want to pay those moving up what they would pay someone from outside being hired.  That frustrated me and lead to my departure."
good,"Was at Bofa for a little under a year and it was hard to grow at the branch i was at, but i was willing to learn any new duties that were thrown my way"
good,"the company itself is awesome been working here and still an employee, you lean various things on the company inside and out and also the benefits are amazing dental medical, child reimbursement. However i wish the advancement process was much better and a better deserved position  than how i portray it to be"
good,"The project I was assigned was fairly straightforward but it was difficult to get a clear picture of the expectations. Most of the expectation-setting resulted from feedback in intermittent reviews instead of spending sufficient time upfront. The flip side is that I was given a high degree of autonomy and discretion in how I developed the project. The biggest downside was the commute which was on a series of crowded freeways from the Humble/Atascocita area to the Greenspoint area."
good,"I worked here when I was both in high school and when I started out in college."
good,Programs for students to obtain entry level positions;  The concept of the entry level is to obtain time and title with the company to achieve a flow of the work done and systems.
good,"I worked for BofA from 2007 to 2009 - not the best years for a financial institution. I worked in Credit Card Customer Service and Sales, in the Call Center.  The department was closed in the MD location, moved to DE, and most of the employees were laid off, including me."
good,"Bank of America went from first mortgages to Home Equity Loans.  If homes did not have equity, the pipelines were very low.  I was laid off two time from BOA.  I was rehired right after reviews and raises were issued.  I did not receive a raise for two years."
good,"Relationship Manager"
good,"This was a very stressful job for me. I was constantly asked to up sell products while trying to accurately balance a cash drawer. It came easy to some people but I struggled a lot. I did not enjoy how pushy they wanted me to be. I hated asking every single customer if they wanted to open a new account or sign up for a new card. From what I observed, people with outgoing personalities did great. Introverts like me struggled. My advise, do not become a teller at BOA if you're the honest and quiet type."
good,Bank of America is a good place to work.  The only drawback is they have very high goals to reach to maintain your good standing in the company. The managers were usually nice!
good,"Great Company to advance career, Not the appropriate culture, nor management for myself."
good,"There were many opportunities to help shape and manage new employees, unfortunately they wanted more work with no salary change.  I was in the same department for my entire tenure."
good,Bank of America from a benefits standpoint is a great company to work for. Just be cautious of the sales departments. They can be aggressive. Overall good company to work for though once you get your foot in the door. If you do the right things there is a ton of opportunity for growth.
good,"They have great benefits. Operation Hours aren't too bad either. Main complaint is that they expect way too much for the pay you get. Always expecting to sell, sell, sell. They also give you extra responsibilities without compensation. Also out of the years I've been working there is always favoritism. Even if you voice your concerns...problems never get solved. They just get swept under the rug. Not fair at all. Always understaffed and overworked."
good,I enjoyed working at BAC and learned a lot professionally and personally. I would recommend it as a place to work for those trying to find the balance of work and life.
good,"it was an okay place to work for.  I worked there for many years and things were always changing.  I learned a lot about the banking industry  and will be grateful for that.  The management was very helpful but everyone always had different answers for questions as things change so often.  the hardest part of the job in the department that I was in was all of the personalities both on the phone and off.  the most enjoyable part was that they tried to make sure that even though we were on the phone most of the time, they tried to make it fun during meetings and celebrations.  I have never had that at any other company."
good,"The job was just seasonal during tax season. there was no benefits, compensations, 401k's, and health benefits. The company could keep some employees, but did not."
good,The loan branch was very welcoming and tried to make everyone feel as one team. I was a temporary employee but was treated as a part of the team. I feel this is directly attributed to the immediate management.
good,The most enjoyable part of being a trainee was the free education directly from the money manager being offered. Not to mention the free lunches but more importantly the ability to ask questions that are directly associated to client concerns.
good,You don't know from one day to the next your job is going to be here or sent. off shore. It seems one hand does not know what the other is doing. It makes one feel very unsettled.
good,this job was hard and constantly arguing with customers just based off of pilocy and restrictions so in the end you were never advocating for them and that isnt what i had though i signed up for
good,"As a Relationship Banker you start your day with a team meeting lead by your manager. Discuss sales, appointments for the day, operational goals etc. After the meeting you check your appointments for the day and prepare for opening. You have monthly goals to meet in many different areas, including checking, savings, mortgage, credit card and so on. The goals are not very difficult to meet and you receive a quarterly bonus depending on your sales. Bank of America does not teach their bankers to just sell random accounts to customers or pressure them but they do want you to find the customers needs and fill it. Of course dealing in customer service you have a number of upset, irritate, confused customers, so it helps to have a cool attitude. Staffing is one area that Bank of America could really improve in. It is usually very under staffed which can make for a stressful work and customer experience. Along with sales you must prepare for bank audits that have a strong impact on your banking centers success. One of the biggest perks for me was the Maternity/Paternity leave. Bank of America pays the employee for 16 weeks after having a baby!!! There are many other perks working for Bank of America, just be prepared for some stressful experiences as well. Good luck!"
good,"constant changes in management and always trying to get more work out of less employees. Some departments had the authority to be flexible with it employees while others were held by the ""book"""
good,"As a temporary worker there, I always felt appreciated.  The management were always fair and unbiased.  The lead manager was hilarious and great to work with...even when he caught me the one time playing around and talking to a coworker instead of working...(I still regret that, even though he was so nice and nonchalant about it)."
good,"A financial center works together similar to a family for the sake of success. Though measured individually, everyone works together and is happy for each other's success."
good,It has been many years since I worked at Bank of America so it's hard to write anything that might be relevant today. There are many opportunities at such a large company and I was able to find a great job fit at the time that I worked there.
good,"Great place to work, lots of opportunities for professional growth. Fast paced environment where you never get bored and learn a lot. Great foundation for other career options."
good,"Bank of America was a very family place to work at we all would cook and eat lunch together, "
good,I worked for the best team and management staff. I can't say enough about how they helped me keep my work/life balance.  They were constantly giving me a new challenge which made the job interesting for many years.
good,"Overall, I've enjoyed my time with Bank of America, however, the culture no  longer matches my personal goals and beliefs.  Getting into senior level roles is extremely political"
good,"Bank of America does not properly prepare for the amount of business volume that it generates. With antiquated computer systems, and lack of a sizable enough staff, it cannot properly provide for the expected customer experience that it clients are looking for"
good,"if you enjoy call center environment, this may be for you. the call volume is pretty high. its a very monotonous job. stats are everything with this company"
good,"The people overall and work environment was very friendly and co-workers are great people. The only issue was in that direct management was not open to suggestions which in turn stifled our motivation. There was a lot of rotation in my position, and I came to find out that was the reason why. Upper level management in San Antonio was very friendly and available and the benefits were good. The pay was not competitive."
good,"it was and it is a good place to work , but very stressful, have goals that needs to be meet. management is ok , benefits are good. ok place to work at"
good,You always learned something new and informative to help make your job a bit easier. Management did provide you some tools to make your job less stressful. Coaching sessions were very helpful.
good,"Not impressed with the Morale, but they pay you enough to keep it low.  They have EAP program to help with the life balance, but they are by the book by write ups and don't use descripancy because managers are graded how they rate.  If your not in the top 80% of your group, your going to get fired even if all the guys in your group are overachievers"
good,Work culture depends on the department you are working in and your local management team - some great; some dreadful.  Promotions are limited to the chosen few. Difficult to work your way into becoming one of the chosen few.
good,For the length of time with company it was overall fair. Awesome medical benefits. Compensation was good. Vacation time based on length of service.  Great working conditions.
good,"Had to work many hours; however, it was known and a work/life balance was allowed. Benefits are great and the flexibility is a huge plus. Managers always supported when required."
good,Bank of America was more flexible and had better monetary bonuses years ago.  As time went on the dollars declined.  Bank Of America is a very large organization and upper managers do not know their employees .  treated as a number
good,It was a very educational experience working as a python developer. I worked in a team that supported the trading floor. BoA is good place to work to get some experience in fintech.
good,Good place to work but extremely strict  rules not unlike any other firm but must say that the people and folks who run it are the most caring people you will ever meet.
good,"Prior to Bank of America's purchase of several companies in 2006, I worked for MBNA America.  While at MBNA, there was a sense of pride about the company you worked for and hard work was often recognized and rewarded.  When Bank of America transitioned in, the culture shifted more to big corporate banking which led to less recognition and reward.  Working for both companies did teach me to become firmly entrenched on how to manage folks and get results."
good,"This is a great company to work for, there are a few ways you can have a successful carrier at BofA/ML."
good,"I loved the my manager and teammates.  Bank of America did offer fun team building and Employee Engagement activities."
good,A team enviorment is what is expected and I always felt comfortable expressing my views or concerns. Managements doors were always open and encouraging.
good,"The bank as a whole used to be amazing to work for until th epast 3 years becase extremely unrealistic to mees sales goals "
good,The company offers fair employment with a good work life balance.  They do their best for relocation to other departments in lieu of letting people go but offer a good severance package.
good,"I worked at Bank of America for years and had the opportunity to work in many different roles. Bank of America is a large company with many in-house networking events to help with career advancement; however, management at Merrill Lynch is overall unsupportive and most people end up either on stress leave or simply unhappy."
good,"A typical day at work consists of handling cash register, making referrals and selling products. It gets so busy at time that you have to skip lunches."
good,customer service orientated focus on accuracy and regulations. training big foucs weekly classes online. Provide client financial solutions through teamwork
good,The management team I worked with was excellent. The work itself was fine and there was excellent assistance around if needed. Other than this I have no comment.
good,Good management 
good,I took around 80 calls a day to assist customers with account related questions.  I handled electronic banking claims and assisted customers with online banking questions as well.
good,"Long, late hours and communication with vendors was a challenge.  I did enjoy working independently in a stress free environment.  However, the compensation for over time hours did not add up."
good,"Very structured organization but very little flexibility in how job functions are approached; most functions are very centralized. Job security is very lacking: routine layoffs with workers being replaced by cheaper contractors, especially overseas contractors."
good,"I’ve been with Bank of America for five years. This is a company that you will have many opportunities for advancement and as a company they offer many many resources to help you continue to grow. The benefits are great you pretty much get the whole package. Insurance, pto, 401k, reimbursement for child care and school etc."
good,Not the worst job I have ever worked. I do feel that job duties and what agents really go through should make boa consider a pay raise in the near future(especially for the customer service/deposits department) they are the cpu of the entire organization.
good,The benefits were great but pay wasn't. It was a very fast paced environment and became too much about sales and dropped its initial focus on customer service.
good,"Managed daily bank transactions for customers. I Mostly dealt with cashing checks, making deposits for both personal and business accounts. All cash had to be accounted for and balanced at the end of the day."
good,"I had made some mistakes that compliance couldn't overlook, the environment at Merrill Lynch was very toxic and what I mean by that the women working in Wichita were unwilling to train a new employee, I had to learn by making mistakes."
good,"A typical day at work is war room sessions with management and team, I found this to be an effective way in getting the task at hand accomplished efficiently and accurately. The workplace culture was good as far as my team and manager was concerned. The hardest part of the job is dependencies, relying on other groups to respond in the timeframe wanted and in some cases needed. The most enjoyable part was the war room session approach."
good,"Income is consistent, but won't increase much if you excel. they readjust compensation every quarter, so no matter how good or slow things are, it remains about the same."
good,Great place to work.  Need more advancement opportunities in mortgage to prevent layoffs.  Would like to be notified on a regular basis when you apply for positions if it is in review or not.  There is no way to follow up on an application submitted.
good,"It's been a great place to work. I've had the opportunity to learn and grow, personally and professionally. There are awesome programs in place to help employees provide the best service possible for our clients."
good,This was my first job in the USA. They gave me the opportunity to grow in the company and helped me to develop my capacities to work as a team in order to meet sales goals and also help clients to meet their financial priorities.
good,Working at BofA you know to come to work and do your job.  They keep the employee moral up as best as they can.  You see career advancement opportunities but don't let the haters know you're trying to move up.
good,"Great direct supervisors."
good,"A typical day providing financial advice to clients, cash transaction, navigate client to convenient banking, risk management, working as a team, assisting client with their financial."
good,You have to be able to drop your personal life at the door. You have to understand that you are handling personal information and be sensitive to that
good,"conference calls twice daily, meetings once a week. direct managers were not supportive. management support was not there. I took early because there was very little management support. customer care used to be important to Bank of America but now it is only about profit at the expense of the customer."
good,"Be cautious when changing jobs during the second half of the year due to possible negative impact to annual bonus incentive payout...you may not receive one.  Additionally, any raise received upon taking the new position could adversely impact your merit increase the following year in the new role."
good,Great opportunity to learn different banking rolls.  I started at an entry-level position and grew into a more responsibility as I went through my time there
good,"I like the diversity their are a lot of networking organizations to be apart of. changes take place daily if you do not like change it's not the company for you, great benefits package,"
good,"Good place to work. Fast paced environment, great if you're into that.  Opportunity for advancement most of the time.  Good workplace culture and management."
good,"I learned how to create a connection and develop rapport with customers to provide outstanding, personalized service. Also, I 	Listened carefully and connected with customers to understand their top financial priorities and to uncover products and solutions that will benefit them."
good,"My time at Bank of America was overall a positive experience."
good,Work pressure is zero.desent salary.not so good for freshers.learning is very good as they provide different certification program.salary structures are very clear.
good,Bank of America / Merrill Lynch is a great company with a competitive environment. There are some culture shifts taking place and navigating the political differences can be challenging.
good,"It was a great place to work, the associates were a pleasure to work with as well as then customer. I enjoyed making sure that every customer was had the appropriate account that suited there needs"
good,Bank of America gives many opportunities to its employees and many benefits. Management will always have your back and you have all the tools needed to succeed.
good,Good work life balance. Not many career advancement opportunities. Some of the office locations are not the best. Focused on cost cutting rather than growth. Work culture is good.
good,"Working for BOA was a great first ""real job"". It taught me many skills that I still use today while advancing my career. I loved working and building relationships with customers."
good,The pay varies but the benefits are great.  The company creates a fun workplace environment.  Not much stress but there are frequent changes company wide.
good,Bank of America is a good place to work. it has a lot of opportunity for carrer growth. But not the most secure when it comes to job security.I have seen entire calls centers get shut down along with select departments being walked out in a single file line.
good,First bank I ever worked for. Decent training program at the time. Plenty of opportunity for advancement with good benefits. The pay probably wasn't high enough but that is typical in certain areas of the bank. Overall a good experience for me
good,bank of america is a great place to work. however like any sales environment it can be very intense at times. work and life balance is not the best when working in such an place
good,"Great team culture. Promotion from within with endless possibilities for upward advancement. East access to and from work, and very good benefits, even with paternity leave."
good,"Bank of America was not a very good bank to many customers who called angry about the way they were treated. However, as an employee with West INC..BOA, I did receive decent treatment as an employee, and was compensated with holiday pay, and benefits."
good,"I was afforded many great opportunities for growth and experience.  After 21 years, I determined it was time for a change to a position that would make better use of my talents."
good,What really makes Bank of America worth working at is the management.  Without my managers I would have tried to leave soon but they have encouraged me to stick it out and try and advance my career there.
good,"Answer calls assists with client needs provides kind help ,get yelled at by a few mad clients but then later have them happy and issue resolved thats the best part"
good,"Financial Center is very fast paced environment my role included managing the teller line ensuring the operations piece ran smoothly"
good,"During my tenure with Bank of America, I learned time management and prioritizing my deliverables to ensure that each project was successfully completed and within the provided timeframe."
good,Bank Of America was a nice place to work until they change CEO and starting putting machines inside there centers to do all the work instead of a physical person helping you. There were a lot of laid offs and benefits start to change like health insurance and pensions.
good,"The overall bank isn't ok to work for, but certain departments are high stress environments. The banks culture is extremely positive, but some departments don't schedule and compensate properly."
good,"Sick of the strict daily reporting, phone scripts  and constant training. Under constant scrutiny. This is not natural.  I enjoy meeting with customers and helping them take care of their financial challenges. Wish I could focus on that instead of trying to meet or exceed their unrealistic monthly sales goals."
good,"I worked for BOA for almost 8 years. I left due to the lack of appreciation by upper management. In my career I had made many great accomplishments for them to be looked over time and time again (no way am I perfect). Due to it being such a large company it is easy to get lost and over looked for advancement. I had applied multiple times for promotions only to be turned away with no explanation. "
good,"Was learning so much and being promoted than getting laid off.  I made a lot of good friends and learned so much in regards to bank, mortgage and reporting."
good,"Very difficult environment, people are not friendly or helpful, Senior management are difficult to work with. Employees are working long hours including weekends."
good,A lot of the senior management is having a knee jerk reaction to external and internal events. The lack of sustained and strategic thinking is not helping the organization move out of quick sand it is stuck in.
good,"Awesome benefits ~ the best health plan ever! paid time off & sick paid time off, all major holidays off, great discounts on a lot of things, wide variety of jobs"
good,"Great people to work with. Multi-tasking is required. Shareholder driven. Opportunities for advancement exist if you work very hard. It is best if you are close to corporate HQ in Charlotte, NC."
good,"What I learned about the company is that it takes a lot of patience to work there. Especially, the tax seasons where they have a lot of different departments for processing the right catagories in the building areas."
good,"Bank of America is a great company that allows employees many opportunities to grow and promote throughout different departments. They offer great benefits, as well as school and child care reimbursement programs."
good,There were many management and position changes as they were constantly down sizing their teams. A typical day involved spending it on the computer without very much social interaction. The lack of interaction with teammates was The workplace culture was poor due to constant layoffs and title changes.  The most enjoyable part of my job entailed being involved with the spirit team since it helped boost morale.  The hardest part of the job was working in a constantly changing environment and adapting to new challenges. Management was great and they were very helpful with training. What I learned from my experience was to be adaptable and perform my job with few errors to protect the risk to the Bank.
good,"I worked for ML from 2002-2009. I was laid off 26 days after BofA took over, and I was so glad that they let me go, I never looked back. All that BofA did was get rid of any people at ML who made a decent salary, and replaced them with cheaper, less experienced people. What a sorry culture and existence."
good,"Bank of America has been a challenging environment, working to stay competitive in a risk adverse and conservative firm. The pay and benefits are above industry standards, and there is a career path designed to contribute to an associates overall success."
good,"I was displaced from Bank of America in 11/2016 due to the reduction of workforce. I am eligible for rehire, but would like to seek employment elsewhere"
good,"A customer service position, you are on the phones the majority of the day and in front of computer, providing an actual human interaction for the the customer is a priority and not just being transactional"
good,Typical work day to help customers with their accounts via phone. Customers would call in to hear about the benefits provided to them by opening a credit card.
good,Too focused on getting the sales and less on the customers. Not flexible enough with shifts even when top  performing customer service representative.
good,"From what I can remember the culture was inclusive. My manager was outstanding but has since retired. Her Manager however was a micro-manager and made things difficult for our unit to succeed with all of his interfering. "
good,"Worked with some incredible people, that was never the issue. In my role, I felt constantly forced to adapt to new issues that were created as a result of being part of a global bank. AI was always trying to address new issues that were created by BAML management to avoid risk and adhere from a compliance perspective."
good,"The division of Merrill Lynch was bought by BlackRock and this division no longer exists at Merrill. As a whole, Merrill Lynch was a good place to work. The people are very good at what they do and look after their clients."
good,"Pay was OK. I started at my home town location and I loved it "
good,"Working at Bank of America offered me several opportunities, however one of the greater concerns was  the lack of job security and stability as at any given point in time, departments were being discontinued and the work moved offshore."
good,"assistant manager was awful, pay was ok but i was getting paid less then my coworkers and was twice as efficient, instead of compensation for my work i got a pat on the back"
good,"great place to learn  and start buidling a banking career. learn a lot from great people with a los experience in the field, the most enjoyable part of the job for me is that work is is irectly related with news around the world."
good,The company has a good solid foundation.  The retail strategy needs to be rethought. It makes sense high level but does not take into account the workers on the ground level ever having life events.
good,It was an ok job. Very nice people and environment. They made it fun to work. Only thing I disliked was rhe fast paced calls. Too many calls coming in at one time.
good,"WHen i worked there, i did not have a great experience, I wanted to move up, and I wanted to advance in my carreer as a teller to a personal banker.  I did not get that experience due to favorites and lack of management."
good,worked with great people good benefits. Only thing I can say from my experience is that they are not very good at promoting with in the company. Other than that it can be a good company to work for
good,"I enjoyed working with the company.  During my time in employment, there was ample opportunity for advancement and movement.  I had to leave for personal reasons."
good,"I was a teller at Bank of America while I was in college. It's a good company to get financial experience at, but it's extremely focused on sales. New accounts and credit cards can mean keeping your job or getting fired. It's extremely corporate, but there are a few good managers floating around. They can be relocated in a heartbeat so keep your fingers crossed."
good,Higher ups lie only look out for themselves. No loyalty to associates. They don't the support and escalation department of digital service the right pay. Entry level makes .50 cents less. We service the job of 7 departments which escalate complex issues to us however most of them make more than we do.
good,Was an analyst for Bank of America.  Enjoyed working with numbers but the work was not challenging. No interaction socially either.  The work was mostly number crunching and report writing.  Didn't feel like much of a contribution was being made.
good,"Before Bank of America bought Countrywide it was a wonderful place to work for, the Employees were really appreciated for the work they did.  Once it became BofA things changed and the layoffs started happening, I was with the company for 17+ years and would have been very happy to retire from the company,  Once CoreLogic bought Bank of America everyone was laid off. "
good,"Typical call center environment. They like to scare people in training, telling them that they have a small chance of making it. Very negative. Great benefits, only a few good people there. People only  care about their call being shorter than 6 minutes and DO NOT resolve issues and that's what makes clients angry and call back repeatedly. Great pay for what you have to deal with. No wrap times or time to catch up on your work."
good,"Working at BAC is very much the typical, 'Corporate America' experience. There is good potential for advancement if you're the right candidate. However, there is also the typical corporate drudgery of too much training, management, etc."
good,I was part of a 4 person team working with implementing commercial cards in Latin America.  We were a bilingual team and worked with local issuing banks.  The majority of our clients were global.  It was a very busy job and most of the days I was on conference calls with the local bank and the client.
good,The most enjoyable part of working with bank of America are the relationships that are established with the customers and community! Its a nice place to work.
good,"Such a great experience. Thought me a lot about customer satisfaction, higher standards, and upscaling. Helped me getting adjust with different cultures while balancing a professional and a scholar life."
good,"The company offers great benefits and has all the resources to fulfill duties in current position. The training program is well organized and leadership is always looking to advance however, minimal chances for career opportunities if needing to move from one position to another."
good,"Assisting customers and establishing rapport to meet their needs, and explaining to customers the benefit of Bank of America products in achieving their financial goals;"
good,The company paid for 3 months maternity leave. When I came back to work they sent me to a location too far away that was expensive and extremely inconvenient. They wouldn't let me get a promotion because I was due to give birth soon. Then when I was in my new location they were not understanding about my right to pump milk for my child at work. Overall terrible experience in the last center I worked in.
good,"Great company, a lot of flexability with work life balance.  There are a lot of opportunities available and you truly have the chance to expand to other departments easily."
good,Highly sales driven company that expects same results out of all locations. Market leadership lacked knowledge of day-to-day operations within the branch.
good,"Call center environment and very fast pace. Lots of people turn around, but if you like the call center environment, it would be a great place to work."
good,"bank of america a good company but they are down sizing IT and need to move on to my next adventure.  Not sure about what you exactly want.  Enjoyed working with my developers, UAT and production environments"
good,"Work life balance was a big factor. Was top performer on the phones for Digital Services. The co-workers were great, they did try to feed you food like hey its national donut/pizza/cheesecake day etc. Those typical office things. However you will see that 90% of the employees go through the day beyond stressed out while looking for other positions. When stress continuously builds up inside of you from day to day rude customers that don't want to hear anything or allow you to help. BoA will give you a rather difficult time getting time away to recharge yourself."
good,"They used to value associate satisfaction, however last few years, it's been declining. Too much focus on expense reduction without investment in growth.  Constant reorganization resulting in fear of job security."
good,I was pleased working for the company but overall I never found it easy to find another position with the company. Multiple times I applied to a position and many times I would get the respond that I meet all requirements but not get a single interview. I just felt working for Bank of America that opportunity to move up in the company is very low.
good,I loved the clientele and the staff the activities we held were awesome and I'm greatdul to be a part of the team at Bank of America.. The location of my branch was convenient and the hours were great...being a teller was a great way to meet and greet people on a daily basis.
good,"Great Company to work for if you are seeking growth and advancement, would recommend better managers in the Brea location. Needs more to motivate and inspire people instead of overworking or giving promotions without proper pay."
good,"Competitive firm, not only for employment, but for personal advancement.  In addition, there was a great deal of competition among the firm's product area's for the firms sales force to sell your product.  So, you were always selling yourself and your product, in my case retirement plan investments."
good,Assisting customers with transactions and selling all day long.  Some days you take lunch 2 hours after you got to work because not enough staff to cover the clients.
good,"I work in a fast paced high expectation environment. Ours is a large system managed by 150 people in different streams. The work as a function is interesting, educative and heading towards innovation but the work-life balance as well as resource distribution balance needs to be adjusted."
good,"This was my first job out of college and it was an eye opener. I was looking for benefits and competitive pay. "
good,"Processed day to day transactions for clients."
good,"A slow paced environment with minimal advancement and less direction from management. The company as a whole is not a bad place to work, however pay and compensation will be lacking for certain positions. Career advancement is also limited as most promotions are lateral and vertical."
good,"The company did not seem to be all on the same page at the same time. One higher up would tell us one thing, and then we would be questioned by another higher up as to why we did it that way. Otherwise the job was well compensated and the work was usually fulfilling."
good,"While the company tried to have an approach to Private Wealth like other Banks, they are not ready to hire fresh MBAs. Te culture at US Trust is more suited to professionals who have been in Financial Services for a long period of time."
good,I have enjoyed climbing the ranks at this company but I started so low that after 7 years I am still not where I would like to be. I work with people who don't seem to actually care about their job and are just there to get a paycheck.
good,"A typical day at work consists of sales, sales, sales. You have to meet sales goals by the hour which can be very stressful especially if you are working at a location where there is very little income.  "
good,its a very fast paced job. fun at times. but a lot of customers . i worked saturdays and i would be so tired at the end of the week. benefits are great they pay for your child care which is awesome
good,"While one of my immediate supervisors gets top marks, the others I've had, leave much to be desired.The culture changed towards the end of my employment changed very much and not for the better. It's focused moved away from being customer focused and other changes would not allow me to continue with a clean conscience."
good,I learned the job of auditing a financial level and how to communicate the issues with the management staff.  I was responsible for 55 financial centers which were required to be reviewed 2 times a year.
good,"Excellent company, excellent benefits however, there's no sense of team work. I felt like an outcast most of the time and management makes promises they don't keep."
good,I managed a local banking center.  I was able to train the sales team in accordance with the companies' policies.  I performed multiple loan closings and account reviews.  I ran the day to day operations of the banking center and solved all customer complaints and needs.
good,the culture of bank of america keeps bankers honest with clients which I admire.  My experience with management is that it is too political.  Honestly not just here but it is who you know these days and definitely the same with bank of america
good,"BofA is a place for a person who likes micro-management as well as being pigeonholed in a retail business line. "
good,"The days can be stressful because it is a sales job and you deal with the public. You will learn how to adapt to a fast pace of working because things (rules, polices) change constantly. Management differs because there is always movement of associates. Most centers have a good home/work balance. The hardest part is the restructuring of staff. It's hard since you never know if you will be moved based on the need in your market. I do like that depending on what you are looking to do you have to opportunity for mobility and professional growth."
good,"I left this company because as a financial advisor we were always told to sell what is suitable to the customer.  In reality, BofA wanted you to sell Mortgage backed securities no matter what.  When I declined to sell their product they put someone in my place who would.  So I left."
good,Strong life balance with opportunity for advancement.  Harder to switch between industries / line of businesses.  Salary fair but less competitive than other banks on the street.
good,I was a trainer at first flying to a new city almost every week teaching loan officers about their products and how to use their software to originate loans.  Then I managed a team of 12 people at the corporate campus on how to help trouble shoot the IT infrastructure when people were having trouble with the systems.  The hardest part was that they used 20 different pieces of software and they were always changing it.  I loved the people that I worked with though.
good,"Bank of America was a good company to work for.  They had great benefits and the employees were very nice. The building and location was scenic and very nice.  In an ever changing work industry such as  there were constant changes, weekly and sometimes daily. I learned  how to adapt to constant change.  Daily meetings would sometimes happen twice a day if needed. The hardest part of the job was constantly being on a learning curve."
good,"A typical day involves getting logged in to the systems needed to perform daily activities. A team huddle to go over important information and updates may happen. Take inbound calls from clients for duration of shift. Service accounts by taking payments and servicing other needs of clientele. building conversation to identify the needs of each client whether it be ways to save money through promotional interest rates for balance transfers or cash, or selling the customer a new credit card to better serve needs based on client activity."
good,"Research & adjusting customer's accounts, sending out letters, data entry, calling other banks, answering phones calls, helping co-workers with their cases."
good,"There was no typical day. One day could be smooth and easy another can be the opposite."
good,Very fast-paced work environment. Long work days with high amounts of customer transactions. Team oriented work place. Little rewards for highest producing employees.
good,Bank of America is a good place to work. The bank has shrunk India operations and also its offshoring division. So adopt a cautious approach when applying
good,"When I first started at Bank of America I was so excited to learn all about rolling prime rates, credit lenders, debt collection, et cetera. I quickly climbed the ranks and began commuting an hour to-and-fro to work full-time at the largest facility they had in Maine at the time. In retrospect, I was too young to appreciate the high and increasing income, in exchange for a bit of freedom. Partially due to the commute and the demanding hours, I had very little time to myself and the work itself was a bit dark. I did very well, however, could not reconcile the tragic circumstances of many of my clients in my heart and mind. This was a truly great career opportunity, but not for me. I don't want to collect money from people in financial hardship for a large corporation."
good,BAML is an OK place to work. It really depends a lot on your manager. I have had good and bad managers in my time working for the company.
good,"I would work with homeowners whose loans were deliquent, some were in foreclosure. I would attempt to refinance their loan or set up a repayment plan to prevent the foreclosure if at all possible. Unfortunately, the housing market collapsed in 2009 and our services were no longer needed."
good,"very good job with a very good pay, but there is not that much time off to enjoy with yourself or family. always seems to be a problem to ask for a complete day off instead of a half day."
good,"I loved the drive-thru, the day would fly by and most customers were friendly. The only downfall was having to try to ""sell""."
good,"Biggest thing with Bank of America is having set hours that allow you to have a life outside of work. The compensation is okay. You do have goals to meet in order to get a commission check. Problem is, the goals are set way too high, so basically, you can just depend on your hourly"
good,I worked at Bank of America for more than 30 years.  However they ended the position that I was in for all those years and didn't offer me an opportunity to do a different job within the company.  Now I have to search for another job because I haven't reached my official retirement age yet.  Therefore I have to say that there is no job security in this organization.
good,"Bank of America stands by the core values set in place for the company. It values diversity and inclusion and teamwork. I have learned many skills from the various positions I have worked. One con about the job is the management. There are various lines of business throughout the company and each Senior executive pushes  their own culture. I feel that there should one culture throughout the company. Most of that stems from all of the acquisitions and the various cultures that have been absorbed into the company. Also, there seems to constant reduction and more work but the compensation does not reflect the workload. The greatest part of job are the benefits, they are excellent."
good,Great place to work the day are sometimes longer than usual due to higher stock values or trades management is always on the edge but overall they try to be understanding of the workers
good,"still waiting on the ""good ole days"" of working at Bank of America feeling. So far it's a matter of clocking in and out and being broken down emotionally by each and every manager you will come in contact with. It's all politics here."
good,Awesome team of managers. Friendly work environment. Team atmosphere. Only issue was lack of staff causing excessive work load.
good,"Workplace was very chaotic at times, work was simply and easy.  Managment needs to be monitored more. Co-workers were great a little on edge most of the time. hardest part about the job was walking on eggshells with management. I loved the workers and the oppuritunity to learn the trade.  Had very little training when it came to most things management would just give you a week with someone or a day then throw you out on your own."
good,"I was a teller for almost 3 years. My team was great but the company goals are stressful to be a motivated worker. The benefits are good because of paid vacations, maternity leave, and health insurance"
good,"Need new company policy's wish hired more African Americans, change is good, but warnings should be told, managers need to teat every the same regardless of color"
good,I believe that some policies should be reviewed and explained better. I was under the impression that if you had sick time then it made up for that tardy which would be maybe 5 or 6 minutes considering traffic and parking. Unfortunately it count afainst you regardless of you have sick time or not.
good,"I was hired to become a branch manager. After 2 months of training, I was put in a branch full time.  Not allowed to go into the filed to build relationships and recruit my team."
good,"A typical day consists of taking back to back calls from clients in regard to fraud and claims. The hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple irate customers due to hold times & card restrictions. The pay rate is decent and there is opportunity to bonus. However, bonuses are based off of a NPS system which means that its customer survey driven. If a customer gives you a rating of 8 or below it counts as a zero bare in mind customers are usually already upset before they ever speak to you because of the card restriction and extended hold time. So, a lot of times the survey score reflects that.  In addition, it takes 5 good surveys to cancel out 1 bad survey. And In order to bonus, an associate has to have an average survey culmination score of 80%, Pass quality monitoring assessments at 95%, and meet Average handle time metrics of 6 minutes per call. "
good,"Enjoyed working there, met a great mix of people. Was the longest job I had. Hardest part of the job is when they didn't know what to do with us for a little while. Enjoyable part of job was fun days."
good,"As a teller, I was on the front line in the banking center. I was usually the first line of communication customers and clients had when they first entered the facility. Some job responsibilities included helping customers with deposits and withdrawals, helping customers pay mortgages, HELOCs, credit cards, and car loans, and directing clients towards products that would be beneficial to them from a financial standpoint. As a teller, there are many internal responsibilities as well, i.e. pulling cash from ATM machines, helping manager balance bank vault, balancing teller cash can, and helping with internal compliance. Management specific to my branch was amazing; open door, positive attitude, always helpful, and pushed me to be a better associate. Hardest part of the job was dealing with volatile clients that were difficult to please. That was also the most enjoyable part too; helping to resolve issues and ensure that clients who came in upset left the branch happy with the solution we came to."
good,Busy fast based environment. I learned to multitask and stay on track no matter how busy I was. How to stay on track no matter the situation at hand. How to de-escalate unpleasant situations for costumers.
good,Typical day at BOA is like everyday. The Co-Workers are always easy to get along with the environment is okay. Management could use a little work. The benefits are wonderful.
good,"Bank of America was not a bad place to work. If they had focused more on the customer's overall satisfaction when visiting the branch, it would have made a great place to work."
good,"Big company in the process of making changes that are not client friendly which makes it taking care of clients a bit more difficult.  Loved my manager, didn't love company policy changes."
good,"The job consisted of multiple tasks which Is important to me.  Co-workers were very supportive and helpful."
good,"Go in at 6 non-stop call all days, only breaks where lunch and 2 15 minutes break. I learn a lot about different ways fraud happen and how to file claim and look in more detail at possible signs of fraud. Overall manager were good. co-worker were friendly always helping out. The hardest part was doing a job with not enough training and managers wanted no mistake on calls and hard to do everything right with not the proper training"
good,"Retention/Sales- Speak to high profile clients who want to close accounts. Identify root cause of the clients reasoning for severing financial relationship. Use root cause to taylor fit products or investments that will allow us to retain and increase the clients financial portfolio with your bank. "
good,Start with Huddles and then get ready to work to help our clients. Management is great but with they change it over and over then it becomes hard to have that consistency  with each other to help drive our scores. Hardest part is the workload we have to endure but if you have the right staff its fun (at times).
good,Bank of America is a good company. But you do not have job security. I work for them and through a third party. I also was laid off from both platforms. They are a production driven environment and not really big on family time and events. Over time was a must and that was not a good feeling.
good,"I worked for Bank of America for 2 years. The benefits you get from working with the company are great. Insurance is some of the best I've ever had and the cost is amazingly low. They match your 401k contributions and can even cover your school fees in a related field if you are interested in advancement. However, the pressure to make your sales goals is tremendous and the goal is ever increasing. When I onboarded I was required to make 2 referrals a day, then that number increased to 4, then 6. When I left Bank of America the referral goal was 1 for every 10 customers you serve. I worked at one of the busiest branches in the state and often helped upwards of 200 customers. Sometimes 20 referrals a day just isn't plausible, but the higher ups pressure you to make them constantly. If you are a very sales oriented go-getter, then this is a perfect job for you. But for those of us like me that are more of the bookish, accounting types, I don't recommend the ulcers."
good,"I was originally employed by Merrill Lynch, but then Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch and I was converted to Bank of America.  My benefits were good and I was very blessed to have been a part of the Work from Home Program for several years.  I also was very lucky to have had excellent immediate supervisors who taught me a great deal.  I truly believe, however, that the executives running the divisions of the bank are running it in a very poor direction.  They are cutting costs in the wrong areas and as a result, customer service suffers and our customers are very vocal about it."
good,"The benefits are very helpful, the training they provide is wonderful and often. The ability to advance seems to be impossible if you are not in the right click. They don't have a career plan for you and they will not have a career plan for you unless you initiate it."
good,causal work environment that allows for associate to control professional growth. great networking and mentor opportunities within the company.
good,I had a wonderful tenure growing through different positions and challenges of bank acquisitions. Management was shifted quite often  and new terms came into place more often. Great place to learn adaptability and teamwork.
good,Typical work day at Bank of America is exhausting yet satisfying knowing that you were able to make someone's financial life better. I learned in ins and outs of banking and how to manage money. My coworkers were absolutely the best and made work environment enjoyable. Benefits are endless and oh so awesome!
good,"Managed a team of associates in day-to-day operations for pre-sale foreclosures.  On a daily basis I reviewed, synchronized, and distributed workflows to team members.  Submitted and approved multimillion dollar bids on foreclosed properties.  Worked directly with attorneys while processing all loans and procedures within the foreclosure process.  Ensured team compliance with investor and company guidelines for foreclosure sales.  I built a great team around me and loved them.  The hardest part of the job was knowing the end result: a person didn't pay their mortgage, etc., and now they were going to lose their house."
good,Typical day on the job is hectic.  You have to be able to balance multiple files and activities at the same time while keeping a calm demeanor.  I balance my workload with helping/training new hires on BOA's closing practices.
good,"At  Bank of America, a day consisted of supervising 8 tellers, doing there time schedules, making sure they were doing there training monthly courses on time, reviewing the teller transaction for errors. I balanced the vault and ordered cash for the Bank. I balanced the ATM. I also cross sold banking products and services.I did outbound calls looking for new Business to grow our deposits. Conducted monthly surprise audits.reviewed negotiable items, to make sure they were accounted for. Assist clients in their needs and concerns. Took care of clients that were upset at times. Train new hire tellers in Branch."
good,A typical work day provided ample opportunity for growth and development in the credit card processing market. I enjoyed my position there until they pulled all of the Louisville operations.
good,Good for the laterals and freshers too.Very good job culture and management.Nice Place to work with People who are helping in nature.
good,A typical work day consists of assisting regular and new clients with banking needs.  I learned many banking compliance and regulations.  My co workers are a great group of individuals.  The hardes part of the job is meeting the sales goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the eclectic group of clients you meet.
good,I had a long tenure at this company that was unfortunately ended because of technology advances and a downsizing. I had great co workers that were also part of downsizing.
good,"During my time at this company I identified I wanted to exercise my leadership skills. I learned so much about myself while applying for various roles and opportunities that I believed would contribute to my development. My management team was a great asset to my development while encouraging me and allowing me to prove myself. Yes, I failed many times but I won so much more when I was able to overcome those obstacles!"
good,"Worked on automation of the Mortgage Loan Origination Processing system that performs all the business functions of the loan process. Primary responsibility was to develop functional specification documents for the appraisal and credit departments by gathering, analyzing and documenting requirements from various Business users associated to the system as well as by analyzing external factor, the third party data sources such as regulatory agencies and credit bureaus and documenting the constraints"
good,"I enjoy working at Bank of America. The benefits are good and my coworkers are awesome. I love my customers and take pride in serving them. However, management could be a lot better if taken in consideration."
good,If you want a structured environment then Banking is for you. Since Banks are so highly regulated and follow policies to the T don't expect to have any of you own thoughts or ideas. Good pay and amazing benefits.
good,I enjoyed the job. Goals were extremely  stressful. Manager was great really nice and not pushy. Pay was low. You have to watch your back at this job. If you train someone and that person gets into trouble most likely you are to blame.  Keep to  yourself
good,"I was okay with working for this company. The benefits are good. Because of the many branches, there was many opportunities to work at different offices. I had worked at 5 different offices over the course of 21 years and the one thing that stood out was that the office always seemed to be short handed either because of absenteeism or just not enough associates working there. This created a more stressful environment. It has been many years since I had worked there and even the last building that I had worked at is no longer in existence so this may not be the case anymore."
good,"I come in and get my drawer out of vault. Then I set up my window for the day. I handle cashing checks, issuing cashiers checks, taking loan and mortgage payments. I process deposits from personal and commercial customers. I cross sell additional products and services if the customer does not currently have it. I send them over to a customer service representative. I balance my teller window at the end of the day.Then I put my money back into vault and help with the closing procedures to close bank."
good,"Manage Operation, Sales and Service processes in the Financial Center "
good,"Good compensation , work place, exposure , learning, team fun, outings, free lunches, Stressed work. Excellent Management, certification reimbursement, Travel allowance"
good,"Pros: Good work life balance.  Leave early almost every Friday.  Can take shorter lunches and leave earlier every day.  "
good,I was lucky to work at a place where we truly cared about reaching our clients financial needs. It is retail based. Its a great customer service culture.
good,"Worked at BOA as an student-intern. While there I performed various duties such as: Greet costumers, assist with costumer referrals, assisted in opening/ closing accounts, attended branch meetings, close operations, etc."
good,"Traveling across the U.S. helping our customers with Modification assistance/Foreclosure Prevention was very rewarding. We grew rapidly as a team and we would travel together very often that we became ""Family"" not just co-workers. As time went by in the banking / mortgage business things got better and the need for assistance diminished."
good,"Great place to get cash handling experience. Great working environment. I loved my banking center in Downtown Hampton,Virginia the manager there is the best person I have ever worked for. Not enough pay."
good,HSBC s benefits and programmes for employees are great! In addition to that HSBC is a good paymaster and a fun place to work for
good,I enjoyed the managers as well as the other advisors in my office. The most frustrating part of my job was the class in cultures between merrill lynch and Bank of america. Policy was changed weekly in some cases and it made a difficult job even harder. The financial environment in San Diego is pretty difficult to penetrate because money does not move quickly as well.
good,"Fast paced work environment. Learned the importance of multi-tasking. The hardest part about working on the job would have to be the standing for long periods of time. Pretty easy, comprehendible work"
good,The repetition can get monotonous in the call center environment. The management staff makes effort to improve the overall experience but the day to day becomes a challenge for most of the line level associates. It is what you make of it. If you're one to explore your options within the bank and make use of the many resources available the time within the bank can be productive and fruitful.
good,"Faced Paced environment, high pressure and a great team to work with. They have good benefits and care about the employees."
good,Go to work deposit checks and money   cash checks give money to clients made sure I balanced everyday which I did. Then come back and do it all over again.
good,BofA/ML is a great place to work. It seems they are always growing and hiring as new positions become available quite frequently. Management is very supportive of career development and will do their best to help you find a career path you will be happy with. The benefits are great and I am happy to work for BofA/ML.
good,"productive and fast pace environment, loved my co workers. My day consist of handling cash transactions. In addition, i would refer customers to our financial products."
good,"The call center staff are all friendly and great to work with, management isn't all that bad either. Biggest headache is having to deal with how inefficient the company is as a whole."
good,"Highly organized and great team support. Great communication among management. Provide clear, simple, and scalable objectives."
good,"fast pace work environment"
good,"A lot of technical work opportunities and sometimes good teamwork situations. However, frequent management shakeups caused situations wherein my skills became under-utilized."
good,"The goals are Fair, Fast, and Final. This makes it very clear what you are there to accomplish daily. The organization is structured and as long as you ask the right questions there is always room for growth if you are willing to move or travel to achieve it."
good,"Good Enviorment, great people, department lacked in advancement. Not much effort in developing current talent. Great benefits but lack in compensation."
good,"Family life and work life is an equal balance.  When child issues arrive, management is very accommodating.  Parking was a bit of an issue, but the extra walk was nice (except in 100 degree days!)"
good,The pay and benefits are good and with effort and focus there is a clear career path. Recent downsizing has made career growth more difficult and sluggish.
good,"B of A has great benefits, but as their plan to downsize the company, it has greatly increased the amount of work to be performed, and without the benefit of overtime."
good,"BOA is a good place to work, decent chances for advancement, sometimes management isnt supportive."
good,"Hard-work"
good,i worked for this company for years. Lots of growth opportunity. Ever changing environment. co worker s were great. some managers were great if you worked hard and took initiative it did not go unnoticed.
good,Bank of America has excellent benefits. Overall its a great place to work but not so good for job security. The turn over rate in very constant.
good,"I learned an important part of the banking process.  I was trained on several different applications, which helped me to perform better and be more productive.  My co-workers were professional yet fun to work with."
good,"While working with Bank of America, it was during my college years, so they very in accordance with my schedule until I graduated.  I learn what is expected in the work force."
good,"Managers at many Banking Centers are a joke, many are unqualified to lead and motivate a team. Often existing high value customers who have service requests are bumped for new accounts. Other Personal Bankers cannibalize each others sales."
good,"I worked there for almost thirteen years. I loved the people who I worked with. Management was unpredictable. You didn't know who would be your manager next. The most enjoyable part about this job was on-site company events and my co-workers. I learned how to talk professionally, defuse an upset customer and establish job credibility. My typical day at work was a lot of calls waiting or taking. The hardest part of my job was making time for my family who needed me the most because most of the time I needed to be off to be with them. I mean I had weekends off but I needed to go part-time and they didn't have that available at all and it was not an option ever. I liked the money but it was too long of a day to be on the phone and away from my family all day when I was needed."
good,"I worked for Bank of America for almost fifteen years. I learned a lot about managing people and also servicing delinquent mortgage accounts for accuracy. I reviewed accounts for any available programs to bring their accounts back in good standing. I managed a team of approximately twelve to fifteen associates.  I handled escalated issues with homeowners, authorized third parties, and attorneys acting on the homeowners behalf. I handled bankruptcy loans, mediated files, and loans that were in litigation status. My team was highly motivated and also in the top tier for performance. I could depend on my staff to work diligently with little or no supervision. My manager was very interactive with our management team and also our associates. Since the mortgage industry started to decline a few years ago, we have experienced ongoing layoffs. Unfortunately, I was affected by the most recent deduction of employment."
good,The structure is set up so that you are actually competing with everyone in the office for the same group of clients.  Felt like I was hired to meet a quota and then not given the support necessary to succeed.  Less than 1% of Financial Advisors hired are with the company after 2 years.  That indicates a real problem.
good,"As part of the hiring flood after the mortgage disaster in America, I was able to advance at a fast pace.  By  being employed by one of the largest banking facilities in the world, I learned to compete within a large corporation.  Good teamwork abounded. Management was fair and compensations were adequate. However, communication within all the vast departments was minimal. Unfortunately, once the crisis issues were resolved, there was no room for repurposing the thousands that were hired, hence layoffs."
good,They seemed to value speed above accuracy. Every time I asked a manager a question they seemed to make up the answer; I'd get a different answer from every person I asked.
good,"It's a bank, so...there's not much to say. They are trying to move away from transaction banking but so many old-school customers just ""want more tellers!"" but wont take the time to let us show them how ATMs and online banking work."
good,"Bank of America is an amazing company to work at. The leadership and coworkers are always in high spirits. Working at this company will keep you current. relevant, and more competitive than your probably ready for."
good,"Bank of America allows you to chose your own schedule, depending on the division. They encourage team bonding, and leveraging colleagues for help."
good,"I had multiple positions at BAC so my typical day was always exciting. Helping co workers,training new employees, helping people save their homes. Management was ok they could be a little more hands on and getting to know their team. Not only when they have to bring something to their attention that the agent did wrong. wonderful coworkers can't complain. Not being able to help a client purchase, refi or save their home. When can do all the things that i could not do to help a customer."
good,Working at bank of america isn't bad but they do have a high turn over rate. The benefits are great as wells as pay. When working the hours provided during hire usually stay the same. The work environment is nice and clean. There is a lack of communication with upper management. Over all this is a good company to work for.
good,Overall day would include monitoring representatives productivity on a day to day basis as well as creating policy and procudure for department to ensure that the all policys and guidlines are being followed
good,I worked in ther servicing side of the Bank.  The job is very demanding and fast paced.  Great benefits but unfortunately there is a lot of fear of being let go since along of their CA operations are shutting down.
good,very sales oriented not customer service based at all. COmpany focuses a lot in sales and not enough in serving their customers.
good,It was a pleasure to work with my co-workers. Enjoyed going in to work every morning. Enjoyed meeting new and wonderful people.
good,"Review, verify and complete loan applications for processing."
good,Aggressive sales role.  Company culture is focused on the Affluent Market only.  Very conservative with all Lending products.
good,"Great place to get experience, but ultimately is turning more to retail.. You get some great experience and it is a large company so there tons of depts to branch out into."
good,"A typical day includes assisting clients with transactions, engaging them to offer benefits they may not be taking advantage of and getting them to a personal banker. Accuracy in transactions and cash handling is very important, but half the job is sales, even in the teller role. Management is restricted by the decisions made higher up. I truly don't feel that upper management makes decisions with the banking center associates in mind. Their focus is on revenue. Cutbacks in the banking center mean more work is required with fewer people, like most corporate jobs. Co-workers can be great friends or cause a lot of drama. It depends where you are working. Management can change your location on a whim, and roles are changing all the time. If you truly care about your customers, you will do well. If you are only there to get a paycheck, they will not keep you around."
good,"I learned that I wear many hats at my job, and delegation is a part of being successful.  It's difficult to work with a short staff, but we make it work."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,Exposed to wealthy and low income population. Working numbers constantly. You have the opportunity to work with different charities in your area. My experience with management was positive. Pay was low for the work so turnover rate was high. Time off was relatively easy to schedule so work/life was easy to manage.
good,"During my years of experience as an Operations Manager.  I have been responsible for performing duties such as, but not limited to, Primary assignments include management and training of associates, admin personnel, counseling of associates, which provided positive and corrective feedback on individual’s performance.  Distributing and monitoring work flow through operations to control unnecessary overtime, and employee expenses, as well maintaining optimum job quality and efficiency levels.

good,"Work with art director and handle all the new jobs."
good,"I did enjoy my time at Bank of America. I started as a Customer Service Rep in the Home Loans Department then transitioned to a Mortgage Servicing Specialist II in the Foreclosure Department. I was mostly satisfied but is was difficult to move around or up in the company. Management was helpful and knowledgeable. The overall work environment was nice,"
good,"Bank of America is a good place to work. The company has helped me to learn about the financial industry. My job is to help customers achieve their financial goals."
good,"I worked in various areas within the Mortgage Servicing side for a little under 10 years. The company encourages its associates to be comfortable with change so being able to adapt to that change is a plus."
good,"Learned a great deal. Quite a few new technologies. Excellent colleagues, most of whom were dedicated to successfully implementing projects on time and within budgets."
good,Bank of American was very good at building on your previous experience and allowing you to grow.
good,"Typical day •	Coordinate and facilitate the communication of new or changed regulatory requirements impacting Loss Mitigation Affidavit. Provides support to our attorney network.

good,"SQL, C#, Risk Management, Trading System reconciliation."
good,"Since Mortgage is my passion and I love what I do, I feel I make my life an enjoyable one. Therefore I loved my job and making my clients very happy so I enjoyed what I could control. I am a very positive people person and get along with everyone."
good,"Bank of America is one of the best job I've had up to this point. The pay is good, the benefits are awesome and the work is not difficult. On the other hand, the management styles that I've seen are not the best; they lack  organization and communication skills. It is sometimes difficult to feel like a 'team' at bank of america because most managers do not work to bring their employees together and encourage a team vibe."
good,"good work life balance, ability to work from home."
good,"Typical day starts with daily huddles to team motivation, serving and providing solutions for customers.  Having sound operational controls to minimize risk for the company.  "
good,"Great management, benefits and coworkers. It was a great working environment."
good,Co-workers were fun to work with. But work  was extremely stressful. A lot of goals for personal stats where hard to achieve month to month and departments had issues with communicating the correct information to customers.
good,"Worked at Bank of America briefly.  However, the work load and time allotment were not realistically compatible."
good,"When working for the company 5 years ago it was quite obvious that the company held their employees opinions high. However, over the past year it has become difficult as demands are raised to almost unattainable levels. Although the company offers many benefits such as good affordable health plans and awards for good performance; it seems to lack in listening to the voice of the employees."
good,It wasn't the best experience but the people there coworker wise were great
good,"productive enjoy interacting with cuustomers, co worker are team player."
good,my coworkers were great very helpful. Management was not supportive. the job is easy but the manager had a horrible attitude with her employees never praised anyone for their work and was rude to customers. the benefits are great and the work schedule.
good,"Work."
good,"A week starts with a list of problems to solve or questions to answer.  I schedule virtual meetings with SMEs and Developers around standing weekly updates and touch points.  These meetings often involve partners oversees and require extended work hours.  In between meetings I document and organize information, distilling it into a presentation that clearly communicates an actionable recommendation.  "
good,BAC Mortgage department was an interesting dept to work for.
good,"lots of people, fun environment "
good,"I've been fortunate enough to find a banking center where everyone is willing to work hard and help each other. The job is nothing spectacular, just a job. My only gripe is that I feel under utilized and even though I've been given greater and greater responsibilities I have not received any increase in pay."
good,"it's a busy branch in downtown, so it's very fast paced working place."
good,great place to get your foot in the door and gain knowledge on wealth management materials and options. you learned about the securities clients held and how to better assist them. most enjoyable part about the job was being able to communicate with the Advisors and associates.
good,"	Personal banker duties: open and close accounts, apply for home loans, credit cards, and auto loans."
good,A nice place to work with alot of chance for advancement. the hardest part of the job i would say assisting customers that were upset about fees and overdraft problems calming them with a smile and making sure they got the assiistince they desereved. had a very good witth my co-workers they would come to me for assistance for more difficult transactions
good,Great experience within the Retail Banking World. Productive day to day plans. Learned how to delegate tasks by distinguishing each persons ability. Diverse enviroment
good,"Building relationships with customers by making it more human and making interactions easier in the banking center. Established new accounts, sold existing products/upgrades, inform customers what they get with their current relationship. The most stressful part of the job was to maintain quota. The location over at Sevastopol, CA made it difficult. There were a lot of the same customers coming rather new customers to establish new accounts."
good,"The most important lesson learned at Bank of America is to take ownership of your own career.  Network, put your best foot forward.  If you do not let others know what you do, then they may never know your biggest achivements. Always be a champion of change and embrace the past and look forward to the future."
good,Bank of America is very competitive with benefits but not with salary or advancement.
good,"Typical day at work would be reviewing Underwriters pipeline, reviewing prior day files to audit prior to submission, holding daily meetings,  assigning files to staff, being availble to anwser any questions on issues that come up on files, doing daily reporting, Managing  Underwriters daily production & quality,  auditing files & reviewing for potential fraud on existing mortgage files for remodification purposes,  compiled reporting, reviewed title reports, appraisals, credit analysis. I have learned to adapt to change & structure, I can't identify any part of the job as hard, it is challenging at times to stay ahead of guidelines & roll out to staff to meet audit standard guidelines timeframes, but we always meet any challenges we are given by staying positive & sharing information with each other. most enjoyable part of the job isworking with the staff, I found it very rewarding to train and mentor them seeing them acomplish their goals & meet deadlines they thought werent unattainable."
good,"Typical place to start for finance and accounting students. Good flexibility to be tailored around school, GREAT benefits even for part timers."
good,"Was  with the company for  3 years  great place to work, really  enjoyed   being apart of the team"
good,"The people there weren't bad to work with it all. however compared to other banks, it wasn't very good. they were more focused on SELLING the customers products that they didn't always necessarily need. If you do not meet SPECIFIC goals there is a chance you may be written up. The teller training is horrible. Its all done on the computer within the branch, and its not always the same as how its actually conducted. The system is outdated. They still use Validators for receipts and cash in tickets. everything is manual, no scanners. BOA could definitely use some improvement"
good,"As a 25 year employee of Bank of America I can sincerely say that the employees that work for this company are the best!  The  camaraderie  between them and the willingness to assist each other are unsurpassed. There are many jobs at the bank that offer the employee to ""work from home"" which enables a great work/life balance with your career. "
good,"relaxed setting"
good,"Great co-workers but very regimental work environment."
good,I liked working here. Too much favoritism. Good benefits. Expect too much. I was working at the drive thru an was still expected to make my daily quotas of sales.
good,"Very busy, sales heavy, product pushing environment. Management is helpful but can be especially critical of unrealistic sales goals not being met. There is no real reward for being a top performer, no incremental or performance based raises."
good,"Industry leader in banking solutions for retail, commercial, and corporate banking services."
good,"I worked 8am - 5pm and I had my own pipe line that I worked on everyday. Some days it was pretty slow and had to find other things to work on or see if anyone needed any assistance with their loans. Towards the end of the month, it was pretty busy since the processors were sending over their loans to be worked on and closed that same month. I learned new skills such as the requirements for marriages in different states and who is required to sign. Also how to find the information I need to ensure the loan is ready to sign and fund. My co-workers were very helpful when we needed additional help and were also easy to talk to and confront. I enjoyed talking to the borrowers when I called to go over their final numbers with them previously to their signing for their new loan."
good,"It is ok i love my job. I just would like a better one!"
good,"At Bank of America I did learn a lot. They have great technology, this made assisting  clients easy. Helping clients with banking needs from balance inquiries to more complex transaction. The staff was delightful and pleasant. One of the hardest part was assisting clients that came in upset and blamed you for what ever problem they had. Most enjoyable was opening that first account checking, savings, credit card or mortgage."
good,Bank of America has great name recognition. I was also able to meet a lot of business owners.
good,My job was to review mortgages and all documents associated with them before going into litigation. The time I spend at Bank of America was rewarding and fun. My co-workers and managers were great people and made it fun to come to work everyday. This took your mind off of what you were actually doing. Kicking people out of there homes. That was the hardest part of job to deal with.
good,"Very high volume, computer driven systems. Escalation calls. Hardest part was not being able to do one call resolution. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting  my customers to have 100% satisfaction"
good,Everyone had the same work hours regardless of the position. I learned how work with other individual as one team. The management was very laid back which at time was a hassle when questions from the team needed answers. As for the co-workers we all got along very well as work great with one another. The hardest part of my job went back to management and not being able to have an answer when needed for a contractor. The best part of working at Bank of America was just being with a team.
good,C & E Level management want change and innovation but not everyone has bought in to the vision. So many layoffs you wonder if each week will be your last.
good,The bank provides a lot of training and hires from within. The people you work with day in and day out is what I enjoyed the most while working at the bank.
good,"Identify ongoing process improvements, operational gaps, and potential remediation steps. "
good,Great opportunity for growth and expansion. Good environment and good group of people.
good,I learned a lot from my time here.  Great benefits and great learning environment.
good,"The best part of my job is meeting new people everyday and assisting them with their financial needs. "
good,"I didn't mind being there. I had some great coworkers, but the goals to me were highly unrealistic. The amount of things they ask you to do is stressful. The job is for some people who do not mind working a little harder and feeling satisfied at the end."
good,"I worked in the mortgage department.  I was a loan processor and handled the duties of processing refinance transactions.  I would process a loan application from origination through closing while working closely with the customer and other business areas.  Bank of America is a good company to work for mostly.  I have had few complaints over the last couple of years; however, I am left with a bad taste in my mouth due to being laid off.  The office where I worked was closed down and over 700 people lost their job.  We did receive severance pay, but were not offered comparable positions in other areas of the bank."
good,"Typical day at Bank of America. We were required to pull out workflow report every morning. This will outline what you are responsible for working on for that day. It was very important that we met our individual monthly goals as well as the branch goal. We all worked as team players assisting other as needed. The hardest part of the job was informing borrowers  that there home mortgage loan was declined especially when there are no other options to offer the borrower."
good,"Bank of America has tought me many skills in collections, Servicing loans for diffrent Investors, Quality, and Managment skills."
good,"Overall its good place to work, just extremely high sales goals so if you aren't a seller this isn't the place for you."
good,one of the biggest and best financial institutions has taken major steps back in their corporate culture throughout the years. B of A could be a very promising career if they still exist in you state (they left the state that I was working in)
good,They called it Mother Merrill for a reason. Women got plenty of benefits...Good for them
good,"File review with processor, manage call backs, confirm appointments and follow through with business development plans.  Through formal training and experience I learned to originate residential loans and develop builder business. I learn to offer lower pricing for bulk business with Developments.  Conducted presentations, sat on various Banking associations and Community forums. Management was always supportive acknowledge me for promotion on (3) different occasions. I am still in contact with one of my co-workers today. Hardest part about this job was leaving it when B of A had to close the office due to Banking regulations. They did not have a Bank branch there at the time and was required to. I was pleased to have received a promotion to Community Loan Officer because that meant that I would be responsible for builder relationships."
good,I was a administrative assistant to a senior vice president and his direct reports. I also was the go to for associate support as well as the Associate and Engagement representative.
good,The company provides good benefits and opportunities for its employees in a relax comfortable atmosphere.
good,"1. work life balance good..better than Indian IT companies who squeeze each and every drop of your of life."
good,"There is no question that this industry pays better than most, but this is a huge firm and has all the organisational chaos that goes along with it. "
good,Medical benefits and other types of benefits are important to this company.
good,Bank of America is a great place to work for recent college graduates. A typical day at work includes helping customers meet their financial goals by uncovering their individual needs and providing them with the appropriate solutions. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with well known customers and seeing them achieve their financial goals.
good,"Mortgage collector for FHA & VA handling inbound, outbound, and dialer calls for past due accounts. Took financials for possible modifications, short sales, and foreclosures."

good,"While starting at Bank of America (formerly known as Arizona Bank), I learned bank operations from an entry level job to moving and learning the Trust Administration side. Starting at the bottom helped me understand the mechanics involved. "
good,The job was nice just don't get to comfortable working as a temp.
good,"Worked as a loan processing consultant in Hyderabad, India. A typical day would include sorting through many loan applications of bankrupt individuals and determining whether a housing loan should be sanctioned to these individuals or not. My Co-workers were great to get along with. The only thing that I dont like about this job are the timings - most often we had to work through the night to keep up with the timings in the US."
good,"Great place to learn to do just about any role you wish to pursue.  Having spent most of my working career here I can say that the opportunities are endless IF you are willing to seek them out.  "
good,Merrill Lynch is a fantastic company to work for but with a big move in my future the stability is hard to sustain.
good,"I enjoyed working at Bank of America, however I do not believe they are invested in the talents of each individual employee.  Upper management had an assembly line mentality which did not service the customer."
good,"I work from home with the exception of travel for Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and OIG Audits. I usually put in 50-70 hours a week. That is one of the benefits and downfalls of working from home."
good,"A great company to for work with emphasis on family values, customer satisfaction and doing the right thing"
good,"My typical day at work comprised of reviewing loan applications for completness and contating borrower to advise them of any outstanding or expired documents needed to complete the loan  application. Also worked with various departments within the bank to obtain payoff informations. Working within the policy and procedure sharepoint to move loans forward. Also was responsible for contacting other banks to obtain payoffs and subordination reqiurements. I learned the process of refinances , how appraisal figures were calculated , also how to calculate DTI, PTi ratios CLTV pecentages . Also learned  how to review a credit reports to determine the credit worthiness of our borrowers.We as employees worked with each other to move loans as a team. The hardest part of the job was the subordination process which could take 45days. I enjoyed being able to help customer save money by refinancing there homes"
good,"Log onto the system, study the forecast of the total days job and start with the analyzing and confirming the customers deposits from ATM image capture, bank branches deposits and there after posting them into the customers accounts."
good,"I loved working for B of A, i learned alot and earned some life long friends."
good,great company to work for if you dont like to stand out and go above and beyond.
good,"I learned time management, also did get introduced to leadership responsibility as a team lead, which taught me how to manage others and accountability."
good,"Job Security was at the lowest, co-workers had poor communication"
good,as a teller you have to make yourself be noticeable in order to earn a name and hopefully a promotion. Tellers have the hardest job in the branch if you ask me. as a teller i had to put up with rude and really disrespectful customers as well as make referrals to bankers who get paid more for those referrals while i got nothing. its a tough job but you learn a lot and in this company you have to start at the bottom.
good,"My typical day includes prioritizing my clients in SalesForce, checking and returning voicemails, callings my customers to keep them informed of what is needed to move the process forward or advising them of their status. Management and co-workers are a joy to work with. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I am able to call my customers to advised them of an approval."
good,Work with a great team that make the day enjoyable! Work is a fast paced environment & we have fun engaging the customers.
good,I am grateful for the experience I have gained. I loved working for my manager. The hardest part about my job is that I was away from my family too much due to overtime requirements.
good,"Decent work enviroment, team enviroment, Not a lot of room for growth at this time"
good,Bank of America was a learning experience for me in dealing with people on a daily basis. I allowed me to be professional but at the same time be more personal in connecting with those customers.
good,Good place to work learned alot gained a lot of experience. Made new friends 
good,"I learn to grow and adapt all changes in life, with all the conversation I was able to catch up with all aspect of life. I have a very good rapport with my co workers I get along with every body very positive attitude and most of all I can get along with everyone."
good,Great company to work for but the stereotypes of being a major bank and constant change to regulations and policies can make it a stressful environment with constant negative connotations from customers you have never dealt with before.
good,"Make and answer many calls a day. Document all conversation in 4 different programs. Search for documents in 3 different programs for every borrower call."
good,"Enjoyed the work I did, always challenging. Opportunities for improvement and advancement where available. Good working group of people within the overall organization."
good,"Our whole division was laid off when Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch, even though we were highly profitable."
good,"Poor Management, does not know how to run a Business.  Very sloppy work, presence, attire, language, and attitude.  NOT PROFESSIONAL at all.  "
good,"Bank of America is a huge corporation, so my review is solely based upon the most recent office in which I worked.  The facilities were fine (though the restrooms could have used much more upkeep).  Management was driven very hard by senior management, which left almost no human element to the work.  Team building was non-existent, interaction with upper management was non-existent, and there was a strong factory mentality.  The pay was above average and the benefits were good, but I'd gladly have sacrificed some of that for a healthier working environment."
good,A typical day was spent working after school.  The hours were reasonable and the compensation was high.  Overall a good place to work.  
good,"This was a position working with customers who were in jeopardy of loosing their homes to foreclosure.  Many times customers did not meet the criteria or guidelines of the Investors and could not offer a solution that the customer wanted/needed.  Customers would either be angry at the Bank or Cry and it was very difficult for me."
good,"Working at Bank of America is great if you would like to develop an understanding of the corporate world. There is very little individual opinion or say. Their values and policies on a large scale, as well as, day-to-day basis are very strong regarding customer satisfaction and adhering to policy. Unfortunately, a lot of their policies disable the workers to provide customers with satisfaction. The wages and compensation are lower than deserved, but the benefits that are offered to you are phenomenal. I would considered it a mediocre place to work for. "
good,Excellent. Management was great. Learned many things. Many opportunities for advancement.
good,"As project manager, I'm always interacting with people whether it's by email, over the phone, in meetings, or on communicator. There is never a set list of tasks I need to perform day to day which keeps my days exciting. "
good,Fast pace always changing environment. Must be well organize and detailed oriented.
good,Good place to get your feet wet with possible growth opportunity. You can learn a lot with this company. Seem to have a lot of layoffs though.
good,"A typical day at work is generally relaxed and comfortable. The best part of my job is interacting with my co-workers and finishing my work for the customer. Unfortunatly the only part of my job that can be frustrating is the lack of opportunity to advance, and the management (while friendly and honest) does not know the functions that our job entails, therefor are not able to make sound decisions under certain circumstances when it comes specific questions or actions."
good,"review potential fraudulent account activity with customers over the phone for the initiation of a fraud claim. Then take appropriate action based on transaction characteristics to file proper fraud claim. I also assist with account maintenance and other general questions, concerns and or updates account holders may have regarding their account. Working at Bank of America I have obtained a proficient knowledge in the bank systems as well as the banks policy and procedures"
good,The co-workers and the management is good. Best part of the job is the outings and the days when the entire team comes together to have help each other in the work. Hardest thing is working in night shifts especially when your health is getting effected badly.
good,"Every day is new and I have learnt a lot in terms of facing different people, attitude, work environment and team mates are very supportive. No hardest part as everything is possible its just that you have to be very much confident and smart enough to understand. Enjoyable part is to work with the good team mates and management is very interesting and funny when it comes to fun."
good,"good benefits, decent management, great co-workers, all very helpful and acted as a team. I loved traveling to various offices throughout the country to install and configure Cisco network gear."
good,1. A typical day at work: Prepared special statistical Call Center reports and files.
good,"I've learned a lot working at BoA. There have been many, many struggles presenting the company in a positive light since 2008, but through it all, we have been able to achieve our branch goals and build a solid customer base. They do offer tremendous products for both consumers and business with a lot of things you just can't get anywhere else. The best part of the job is getting to work with the customers one-on-one. THe key to our success comes from getting your customers to sit down and understand the value they're getting from you and your company. Once they see that and understand how it all works, they tend to be very happy. Unforunately, I am currently in the market because my branch is closing."
good,Most challenging part of my job was handling irate customers however with direction from management and experience I was able to meet the challenge.
good,Good place to work but can be disorganized at times. Training was a bit lacking sometimes we had no idea what we were doing because of a transitional period we department was going through but I did learn a lot and and it was a great and safe work environment.
good,"I have worked in 2 different markets for this company and there is a huge difference in the 2. Management takes advantage of their salary pay in almost every banking center I have worked in. The bank does not care about their customers and what would benefit the customers as much as how much products can they can con a customer to say yes to. They allow too much sick pay and most employees take advantage of that. There are never enough employees to cover the customer base that comes in. There is always someone on vacation, sick, maternity leave or medical leave in a center. Benefits and pay is what keeps the employee there though."
good,"I am an employee of the company for 8 years and although I have been generally happy in my years in the banking industry, I want to venture out of this industry. I have learned management skills, people skills, analytic and leadership skills, while becoming a part of a group that I can at times consider my friends and not just colleagues."
good,"Great team to work with and great place to work. Organized, friendly environment. Management excellent and team members all work together."
good,"I have enjoyed most of my time being employed by BAC. The tuition reimbursement, day care reimbursement, health and dental insurance, etc. are great benefits that other companies do not offer. The hardest part of the job is not being recognized and promoted for your hard work."
good,I recieved up to 70 or 100 calls a day assiting homeowners with there
good,"I like working at Tax department, nice people, and very busy, fun place."
good,"Bank of America has provided an extremely work/home life friendly environment. The current regulatory environment has unfortunately transformed the bank into one where mediocrity is rewarded and taking risks is not an option. Without the ability to grow revenue through lending, cutting costs is the only way for this corporation to make it, and that has created a very timid environment."
good,"A Typical day at work for me was looking forward to coming to work and be able to help (BOA) customers. I enjoy my time working with (BOA) and everyone there. What I learned was to always work together as a Team and leave know one behind. The hardest part of my job was the day we was told that Fort Lauderdale Site would be closing has 12/31/2012. My Management I cant say enought, about her she was always there if anyone needed help or just needed her to listen."
good,Lots of opportunity for growth
good,This company is fun to work for but seems stale when it comes to career advancements
good,High call volume and fast pace enviroment. Great job with great people.
good,• Coached and trained the teller team to process transactions accurately and efficiently.
good,Fantastic place to learn the Financial Services industry
good,"Over seeing teller line, assist customers with bank transactions."
good,"Former Countrywide Employee with about a year post merger with BofA, so most of this is directed towards Countrywide."
good,"Learned all the aspect of assets in the banking business, but was not given the opportunity nor the instruction of accidently tampering personal accounts for the banking business."
good,typical day was pretty easy. the hardest part was being in combat with customers who have been watching the news all day and received more info about bank changes than the actual employees.
good,Fast pace customer service but not enough time for training.
good,okay lots of ooportunites to work all over country with right education and background.
good,produtive and fun place to work you can grow with in the company good hours vacation ect.
good,my usual assignment to do was processing personal business checks. I learned how to deliver error free work to the costumers. my co-workers were kind and helpful. the most enjoyable thing at work is break time where I get to talk to my co-workers.
good,"The company overall was a nice company to work for, however due to the unfortunate circumstances behind me know longer working for the company they went above and beyond trying to place us in opened positions considering we were qualified and excellent employees. I've never expereinced this nor have I heard of a company doing this for their employees which I really appreciated."
good,"Checking voicemails,emails, faxes received from previous day and overnight. Completing loan activites and calling all customers once a week. Work daily assiged escalated complaints and monitor accounts. I have learned to be extremely organized, multi tasking, and make sure all deadlines are met. The hardest part of the job is advising customers that we have to foreclose on thier home because we have no options availible. The most enjoyable would be advising a customer that we can save them from foreclosure."
good,"We would process payments for customers all day. I learned how to do data entry and ten key a little bit faster. The managers were very friendly and fair. I got a chance to work with different nationalities. Sometimes it would be so much work at different times of the year that's when it was very challenging, because we had to make sure the customers payments were posted. Every Friday we would have a Town Hall with Rewards and Recognition with different activities with prizes."
good,Bank of America is a company that's committed to helping customers understand all their financial options.
good,Great place to work but responsibilities continue to grow but compensation does not. Daily management reacts to selling widgets rather than building true sales and service culture.
good,"Evening job, fun environment with co-workers and management. Hardest part was explaining history with customers."
good,"Culture at Merrill was highly driven, energetic and generally enthusiastic. Clients (traders) were demanding but reasonable and appreciative of effort,support and prompt response to inquires. Counter-productive policies were stubbornly adhered to by some aspects of management (not all) even when feedback from internal clients (traders) and institutional clients was negative and certain policies/procedures were deemed non compliant by internal compliance reps but insistently adhered to by mgmt nonetheless. Compensation and benefits were better than industry average. Overall a positive corporate culture."
good,"Depending on what channel in which you work, there can be many different pros and cons to working for Bank of America. A typical day at work in the Banking Center Channel is usually not typical at all, since you're constantly interacting with different people with different issues/situations. As a teller, then a teller manager, I dealt mostly with issues relating to teller transactions, though in my slower center, I was a very intergral part in overall Banking Center operations."
good,Co-workers were easy to work with while getting results for the group.
good,"In the beginning it was awesome...but when the bank merged with Fleet it started going downhill. My personal opinion is the bank is just too big. They have lost sight of the people that make the company run!! I am including customers in that statement. Customer service is virtually non existent. As far as job security I would rate a 5 but advancement is all on WHO you know NOT what you know or how well you do it. Love, love, love my coworkers we are like a family."
good,"Typical day would be helping customers cash their checks,deposit.Selling of other bank products.Co-workers were always friendly and helpful.The hardest part was being required to up-sell stuff or products that the customer did not necessarily need. Always trying to sell to customers who sometimes got frustrated with the pursuit. The structure and nature of the banking industry was one of comfort.Just knowing what to do,where to go,who to go and getting that support was very enjoyable."
good,It's a good company to work & build a career if you are driven.
good,They have great benefits but with this economy it was a little stressful
good,"Working with the staffs I did was a blast. Each branch is based around a team effort to fulfill the qaurterly goals. I have many co-workers and clients who are still friends from this experience. The down side was the size of the company. The employees call it the bank of change, because the company changes marketing and products so often their clients are always confused. This was the hardest part of the job."
good,Fun job! Very active and fast pace environment. Tons of customer service and talking with people.
good,"Overall, it was a great place to work; however, it was kind of like being in high school again dealing with the cliques when it came to being managed by females in charge!"
good,Management was like a stalker. I never felt peace because they would always be listening or standing behind you. It was crazy but I had good friends and co-workers. Great benefits although expensive.Pay is good but you have to sell like crazy... It's hard to make a customer feel comfortable speaking to you when you don't feel comfortable yourself because of management. Very stressful!
good,They have all products and services when I used to work for them. They have changed. But I learned averything about banking with them.
good,Good place to work for. The people are very friendly and work well as a team.
good,"Great Place to work, However the mortgage industry has a lot of rules and regulations that have been put under a microscope. This means that Bank of Ameicia is grown fast. So there a lot of organizational changes that are being put in place and training and process projects that need to be implemented and put into place."
good,"The benefits of the job are very good, the pay is ok, and cooworkers are different more educated people, it is really hard to go up in this business unless you are graduated from a college."
good,"This job did not bring on any challenges that were too hard to handle. There were new bank policies recently put into play which of course brought on a lot of angry customers which we were trained to handle. Management was great for the first year, but as we notice that the bank was trying to save money, we notice the vital workers with stable careers were starting to get fired for very simple reasons. Where stability was something well felt in the beginning, that began to change once the company needed to adjust their budget. Overall, I still enjoy working with customers and knowing that I can keep them satisfied at the end of the day."
good,"The bank has been forced to evolve to the current market environment following the Global Recession. The culture and associates is undergoing a radical shift toward risk aversion policies. With the annoucement of 35000 layoffs and more being annouced quarterly, needless to say the environment has changed to one of survival than upward mobility"
good,I produced credit cards for customers each day. Quality control was very important. I worked well with co-workers
good,Excellent company to work with. Good environment with ample learning opportunities.
good,"As a Business and consumer banking spcialist, I used my excellent communication skills and customer service knowledge to provide information about business accounts, business loans and lines of credit. I offered extensive consulting on banking services, product offerings, merchant services and resolving client inquiries. This role was on a lower managerial level and handles clients’ with business accounts as well as that of employees and consumer accounts."
good,"If you love standing on your feet all day with no breaks and for little too nothing an hour, Apply today."
good,"I was interning at Merrill Lynch and that's where I started my career. My team was really helpful in teaching me how the industry work. how to analyze clients portfolio, how to analyze market."
good,"Overall the company is a great place to work with many open doors there for your career growth. The company offers excellent benefits like childcare assistance, tution reimbursement and may more"
good,I had the chance to learn about the credit financial products. I was pormoted from the marketing department to the collection department.
good,"Great team players, always had functions going on for the co workers. Management would try and make it a great place to work."
good,WAY too much emphasis on call handle time! This is extremely counterintuitive to the message that's always being preached about providing the client with the best experience possible. They want you to complete every call in 6 minutes or less no matter what the situation may be or what the client needs.
good,"While thier year over year compensation is barely above inflation rates, the benefits are very nice. Working for iveradecade there was alot of turmoil due to recession, but has leveled off."
good,Work balance isn't always top priority and on the job training will usually not be complete so make sure in the interview you ask about their training.
good,"You will get out what you put in up to a point. This is a great place to work if you do not have an education, but dealing with public can be difficult."
good,Great place to work though much direction was not provided. Mostly worked with colleagues through web ex around the world. Technology is a little behind than other places I have worked.
good,Very Progressive Company. Great for working mothers and they are very involved in family work life balance. The benefits are great and vacation time is generous.
good,"Roles can sometimes be unclear, Very busy with little to no help as a teller, little to NO flexibility with time off, Roles/ responsibilities are constantly changing with unclear training. Hardest part of role is not having help to assist customers. Most enjoyable part of the role helping customers."
good,"Bank of America was a great place to work in the beginning. In the last 6 months I was there however they dissolved part of their mortgage department and moved us all to credit card customer service which was not a lateral move at all, however, they did let us keep our pay. This move was what prompted me to look for work elsewhere."
good,B of A was a good company to work for but the job was very stressful due to the fact that you had to sell products on every call to get your incentive which was hard to do especially on a consistent basis. My manager was overly critical and failed to get me the help I needed to improve and so in the end I fault B of A for my inevitably resignation after a year of jumping through hoops.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with.  The pay was top grade.  The managers wanted you to succeed.  Sometimes the goals were set high but as a team we always managed to reach them for ourselves and each team
good,Bank of America loses its ability to meeting and turn around high demand important objectives by introducing layers upon layers of governance and numerous ways to block progress to goals.
good,"Nice workplace culture, but stressful job environment. Everything is a rush!  Associates are very nice and helpful. I would be there from 9am to 6pm in the beginning, then it's gets later and later. I was so tired by the time I got home."
good,"Overall it is a good company, if you can get into the right line of business. I would never recommend any ""frontline"" position to anyone. The current business model for those employees (branch/call centers) is a cookie cutter design with high turnover biult in. They will burn you out in about 18 months, and then lather, rinse,repeat"
good,Call center job. On the phones all day. Typical call center environment. Various departments in the office so you can get an idea of what other opportunities there are if interested.
good,Work life balance could be better for people.working in branches. But bank of america has great benefits and management typically care for its people.
good,"Had a good experience. The staff was very nice, the facilities were great. They gave you a decent life/work balance but I could no longer do nights each week."
good,It provides a good steady job security. Offers many volunteer opportunities and group building activities. Great employee discounts and incentives. Overall a great place to work.
good,was a good place to work. mostly management left us alone to do our work production environment and off hours from normal banking. really enjoyed the work and loved my staff and co workers.
good,"Great place to work, lots of learning experience and exposure. This company has constantly changes.  It has great career advancement if you're willing to relocate."
good,"Assist customer's with their needs with goods and services, Act as scripted as possible. Not able to be original and sincere. felt like a robot for people. "" Fake it till you make it "" was the logo for us ."
good,"El ambiente laboral es complicado, luego del entrenamiento, rara vez encontrarás asistencia por parte de los superiores con situaciones que se salen de lo normal"
good,Great room for advancement and great benefits. Able to grow quickly. Works with management seamlessly. Benefits are very rewarding. A lot of recognition.
good,A typical day in my position is pulling daily reports to have drop in queues for the rest of the team to work. I also help education both seasoned and newer members of the team. Management helps drive the culture of the team. There's always an opportunity to learn a new process being as though my current team works over 70 processes for Quality Execution. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team who's always willing to learn and go the extra mile to be sure our team achieves monthly goals.
good,"The workplace culture is changing rapidly, especially in banking. Be ready for sales goals even as a teller. Need to be on top of technology and smart banking."
good,"As a teller at B of A, you're expected to get referrals as well as perform teller duties. Quotas were set for us and  we had to meet them. It was hard for me at first, but eventually, I found my niche."
good,"You might get a great team. You might get a terrible one. It varies branch to branch. As a teller, you absolutely have to present offers no matter what they are. They want you to not look at it like selling. They tell you they know you'll get 99 no's and just the one yes. They will tell you that you don't have the hard job. Your job is to get the customers to the bankers. But for every no, you have to practice how to get the yes. They will work with you to find a new way of presenting the offer so that you can entice and trick people into going to the bankers. Who are then given insentives to get the sale. You will never get an insentive. You will just be told it's your job."
good,"My day is a telephone customer service position so it is spent on the phone."
good,"I worked for Bank of America Merchant Services for 7 years. The company has a high powered sales infrastructure and joint venture styled partnership with First Data. "
good,Banking industry.  I learned the banking practices. The hardest part of working for BOA was the late hours on Friday and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customer relations.
good,I enjoyed my time at Bank of America. My only complaint was the parking arrangements. I enjoyed all my coworkers and have good memories of them. Working conditions were great.
good,I have had great experiences working with Insight Global..I did not have any interaction with Insight global unless something critical came about the position or performance.
good,"Size of company allows many opportunities to move around and do new and exciting things. There are many programs for employees to support them holistically, and to support the community."
good,none no woeds thanks for all the great years loved my co workrs as well  sprent 13 1/2 beautiful yeas with this company. ageain than you  I am sure other co workers feel the same way
good,I held multiple positions during my time at BOA. The company has many positions for you to explore. However cross training with work and time managment needed to balance more with your life balance.
good,"While I enjoyed my time at Bank of America, and the job I was placed in as an appeals underwriter, the job itself was not secure.  There were layoffs weekly the last 2 years, therefore there was always a sense of fear on the floor.  I appreciated the time I was there and the experience I gained in my position."
good,I try to my best work and my experience in the Bank and I achieve more experiences in this Bank I'm give full support my colleagues and my seniors I am help my all customers
good,This job was good to me because it gave me a chance to go back to school and offered us tuition reimbursement. I worked with some great ladies and we became a work family. The pay was fair every two weeks. We were given vacation time  and sick time if needed. The managers did have a open door policy and we could ask questions if we needed to.
good,"being able to help people and their finances was the best of this job, your co-workers are fun and always happy. if you are dedicated in customer service this is for you"
good,company was okay. was there for 5years  not much advancement in my dept  long hours room to grow only in some areas mainly if you know some one or manger gives a recommendation
good,"Bank of America did an outstanding job in keeping employees trained, and motivated. The company did go to great costs to educate employees so they could move on for advancement."
good,"The benefits are wonderful, but the managers are not always available when you need them, especially the Admin Managers. "
good,Worked as a contract employee for the typical 18 month contract and then had to leave for 3 months per contract policy.  If you are lucky to come back - I was not - it is in a different role.  The pay was above average for the job. Meeting were mundane and mostly unnecessary.  It takes too long to get you all access and hardware necessary to do your job.
good,"Is a corporate world, almost everything is already established; is a very professional ambient,  where the priority is the customer as well the Bank regulations"
good,A typical day as a teller is helping customer with their banking needs and informing them of the bank products they can take advantage of. Fast pace job.
good,"I love Bank Of America, but we are being laid off is the only reason I'm seeking for employment. I love to be in a stable place. Bank Of America have great benefits."
good,"Had a great corporate and local manager.  Worked with helping the public gain control of financial needs, Difficult to meet/exceed sales expectations.  Job performance rated on matrix scale not by personal contributions"
good,I enjoyed the coworkers the best. The job could get very stressful at times. Don't like the fact that they try for you to get as many customers to use mobile and atm banking vs. people interaction.
good,"Working in the call centers for Bank of America, the call flow is no joke. Queues were extremely long but because of the shift that I worked, the calls died down after about 6-7 pm. If you can handle getting yelled at over the phone about something you have no control over or don't mind not being able to go to the bathroom without getting time taken off from your break, then this is definitely the job for you. It pays very well and the benefits are absolutely amazing."
good,It’s okay. They want to do the very best job for the client.   They want you to sell them everything bank of America has to offer.  It’s a demanding job but great benefits.
good,"it was not all bad were at Bank Of America, just very stressful, and not much satisfaction after a days work. Management does not really take the take to understand their employees."
good,work load was meany and i like working as much as i can. over all work place was wonderful and great place to work for. ceo of the company  is great . employees were respectful of one anothers space to work.
good,typical day was busy but not slammed. I learned how to be patient and work hard to complete my work. most of management was awesome. workplace was pretty much laid back where I was. hardest part was having to report to a manager that was located in a different state and the most enjoyable part was my team we were like family.
good,"Most days were faced paced and demanding. I gained a wealth of knowledge about banking services and how to interact with customers and provide them with the best customer service. I learned how to schedule, train and evaluate tellers. I worked side by side with management to reach all banking center goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you had meet the needs of the customers. The hardest part was at times the lack of teamwork."
good,"I was in 3 different departments mortgage, practice solutions and deposit account services. I really liked and enjoyed the first 2 but DAS there is no room for growth, management is not good"
good,"Aprendi muito e adquiri grandes experiencias na empresa atual. A rotina é bastante pesada, mas estou buscando um novo desafio e uma chance de poder contribuir."
good,Productive workplace with great benefits and competitive salary and incentives. Great opportunity for advancement. Minority and gender friendly. Continuous on the job training keeps employees sharp and in compliance.
good,Bank of America was a relaxed work environment.  The pay was decent and the hours weren't too strenuous.  Would recommend to a friend for employment. Merrill Lynch within BOA is solid employer.
good,Great team!  We did the subprime loans.  This was big business in those days.  We didn't make the rules/guidelines... just followed them.  Sales contests were exciting.
good,"Don't work in claims. Try to do something you like, thats I have nothing else to say!. Just try not to work on the phones.Job is stressful and requires a lot of patience."
good,"Bank of America was a great place to work for many years. It offered great pay and benefits, and a chance to advance. "
good,"Very good place if you like to move up in the company. They use to have great benefits but haven't worked there in over 15 years. Be ready for change on any given day, very fast pace environment and opportunity for plenty of overtime."
good,"I love to learn new procedures, new ways to help others. I'm a responsible, honest  person, who is willing to learn fast and offer the best of me to the customers."
good,Bank of America offered their employees great benefits that included tuition reimbursement and a nice 401K match.  The also offered benefits to part time employees.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company when it was ML.  However it was not as enjoyable once BOA took over.  Benefits cost more, we had to work more hours a week and we lost bonus benefits from selling of products."
good,I worked at the Bank of America in 2001 till 2005. I worked as a teller. My favorite part about my job was the learning experience and the overall environment was excellent.
good,"Responsibilities :"
good,BACI is a more than average place to work. The company has stopped most of the perks it used to give previously. But it's a stable company and provides a good work life balance.
good,"If you find a position you really enjoy doing, you will be employed for a long time. Training is brings the new employees in as teammates and teaches teamwork, until you hit the floor. There is constant criticism of your job performance but you don't have control over the bank practices and customer reactions."
good,"Pay was below par compared to other firms for similar non front end roles. It was hard to advance career wise since head office was in Charlotte, NC and we were in the tri-state."
good,"There is a lack of proper hands on training before you're thrown into the job, which creates a lot of difficulty in the beginning. The expectation is high from your superiors, and there is a lot of micromanaging in the job."
good,Good personnel across the board. Work there right after the mortgage crisis and learn to work modifications. New way to handle the industry. Thankful for the experience.
good,It's a good company to work for employees are nice and friendly. Great benefits for permanent employees and support system. Just wish they had a better training.
good,Three weeks of paid vacation. Employees were valued and appreciated for the hard work they put in. Friendly co-workers and fun environment to work for.
good,"Management was lenient and had good discretion. I learned a lot about the mortgage industry while working there. the best this about the job was the culture and the people, it was professional"
good,Good company to work for if you want to work in slow paced environment. You get to work on different technologies and if you are willing you will get lot of challenging opportunities
good,great company as far as benefits go. very stressful as far as metrics and call volume. tough skin required. advancement is possible. great if you would like to know more about the banking industry and how it works.
good,"most enjoyable day at work is the people you work with"
good,Its my first break . And i learnt how 2 approach for sales n the technique. My boss always backed me and boost my confidence to take calls single handed....
good,"Great compensation and benefits, Management are great, just sometimes short staffed and hectic long lines. But overall pretty flexible with work schedule."
good,"enjoy working here, don't see a robust career or pay increase. Not a good fit for recent grads looking to advance their career. Employees and management are nice."
good,Working at Bank of America was great on the job training. I learned something new about finances and investments everyday. The best part was helping clients succeed financially. The workplace culture was positive and up beat most of the time.
good,"Great benefits and job sercurity but the job becomes very monotonous. Advancement is extremely slow even when looking for more work. I have a lot of energy and would love to learn more, but this is not anything the team can facilitate."
good,"My job was not easy, with training that lacked.  Management not so good, didnt know alot.  Lot of drama and lay offs after about a year of hiring us all for a new dept. Good benefits, good pay."
good,"I had a new manager so very inexperienced , never really got coached so did not know his potential . They were fixing things for the workplace though . They said they were going to add like a game room and a silent room ."
good,"Comfortable job just not very customer oriented. It's about quality not quantity. This should be a call center that does not prioritize stats, especially handling such a sensitive aspect of the customers life."
good,"Overall good place to work; positive relationships are critical throughout.  Some BUs difficult to matriculate to upward levels."
good,Bank of America is in the process of great change. The company has made great strides towards enhancing public opinion and the client experience. Great wok life balance..
good,Great work family balance. Great benefits. Many opportunities for career advancement. I have no more to say i am trying to filling this pace because the system won't let me go any further unless I do
good,"Due to cost savings, jobs are moving out of California to other states. Unfortunately, this is typical with all major banks and other similar institutions."
good,advancements are easy to achieve but the work can get boring really easy. also they keep adding MORE and MORE responsibilities and you don't get compensated for it
good,The pay and benefits are second to none.  Company does not value the input of opinions of employees.  The job is a very competitive sales atmosphere
good,I really liked working with them very understandable when emergencies but didnt like change of managment i liked the coworkers
good,bank of America was ok depending on the individual branches. its heard to get promoted and in referrals are mandatory its strict in that terms and there isn't any cash benefits per referral for tellers however its a good park time job.
good,Bank of America provides great benefits such as 401k match dollar for dollar in addition to childcare and tuition reimbursement. There are a lot of different training resources available to help you perform your daily job.
good,"The typical day includes arriving to work and balancing funds from all deposits from previous night. Once that's complete, it is then time to assist customers with their day to day banking needs."
good,"It is a great job to work at if you're interested in the sales/financial field. You have goals to meet every quarter and if not met it can definitely affect you. Be very good at convincing people to open bank accounts, credit cards, loans."
good,"You were to come in, do your assigned tasks and go home. The management didn't go out of their way to be extra helpful however my coworkers were great!"
good,A company that offers great benefits to its employees. You are able to advance If you strive to do so and go above and beyond the call of duty. Great benefits.
good,"Benefits and 401K contributions were great. 3 weeks of vacation per year, half days every other Saturday.  Work/life balance was pretty good since the bank usually closed around 4 on average.  "
good,"excellent company for work, great benefits, I work 10 years in this company and I  love it, but now I need more challenge in my life."
good,"Great work / life balance, great benefits. Terrible, pushy management style focused on driving profits at any costs. Huge territories makes ladder climbing on the retail banking side difficult without a full relocation."
good,Maintaining clients portfolios working with internal partners as well as external partners. Extremely competitive due to heavy competition but this created positive challenges for all employees. Teamwork was a must in order to complete tasks and achieve goals.
good,"Good place experience and build overall career profile. I enjoyed working with the associates and clients, and learned a lot about banking and lending."
good,"Great co -workers and benefits! Challenging job , but allows me to use my problem solving skills. One has to be adaptable to change, processes change daily. Must pay close attention to detail."
good,"I have never worked in a metrics system, and the pressure to keep high metrics is very difficult. However, the company has worked as well they could when I was struggling with severe illness. I am thankful for how much they did for me"
good,"Hired for Chat, trained for the phones about 4 months in the job. Then changed over to phones a few months after. Happened in less then a year."
good,"Bank of America has taught me a lot. Independence, leadership, teamwork yes but their way on teaching isn't traditional or necessarily the best. The training is thrown at you with a water hole so you’re forced to learn on your own. "
good,"Very busy environment. I have learned to work under a lot of pressure and always striving to give the best service possible. "
good,Change in direction on a monthly basis makes it challenging to build consistency and gain traction.  Associates are committed to success of the company and treatment of the customers.  Strong dedication to career development.
good,Long days hard to fit in lunches.  Never had enough staff lots of lines. Was not happy about them selling branches to another bank.  Micro managed.  Very stressful goals and lots of going outside to drive business.
good,"A standard day working at bank of america was always a learning experience. Although it was only a customer service position, to perform I needed to know a lot about banking. There were always ""web based trainings"" assigned to ensure that we were on top of and familiar with all the policies and procedures delegated by the bank. It was easy to excel in the environment. However, with this company for 10 hours a day I was fully consumed with my work. I was unable to fit in school and personal issues with my work schedule. Employers were not very empathetic with certain issues. I was not happy with the position, which made it all the more difficult for me to put this entry level position top priority in my life. As a student I need  more than an hour or two after work to study and finish assignments. It was a great position, just not suitable for me."
good,can complain about this company overall greta people gret discounts enjoyed very much working her had to leave company because of moving purposees. besica cashier work cleaing hanging fixing mechandise
good,"Big teams, but not very organized. Focus seems to be on delivering functionality rather than improving and maintaining quality of applications."
good,"This is a great company when it comes to moving up and positive attitudes!"
good,I would check for errors on tax returns and did a portion of the clerical work for the bank while I was there. When I did tax returns there was a large machine that we had t examine each tax return and see if there was any errors.
good,"Required complete knowledge of currency handling and company position for disputed issues.   Check and balance, security very strict and having camera completely viewing every moment once you enter working station."
good,"Strong MBNA culture, great leaders.  Philanthropic message sent to all employees.  Great flexibility."
good,"Good Company to work for if you work for the right department.  Good managers that help you with growth and make time for you. At least in my area. "
good,Entered the PMD program. Was asked to make cold calls all day to try and locate business. Management always preached that is was a numbers game but the success rate was limited.
good,"Excelente para o autoconhecimento, por ser uma empresa voltada em resultados, você esta o tempo todo sendo colocado à prova e para quem é voltado a resultados é excelente."
good,Bank America is a place where you have the potential to grow and learn. Always room for improvement. Often make room for advancement
good,"good work life balance and slow pace as many firms on the buy side,  many talents to learn from and have an opportunity to develop good career, but overall is underpaid compared to industry"
good,"My typical day at work was a rather busy one. The job I held included many duties. The list goes as this: teller transactions, money supply for tellers, vault management, greeter, ATM maintenance, cash shipments, supervisor overrides up to 50,000, personal banker, and account maintenance. This was a major amount of multitasking and time management. All of this includes the hardest part of the job, the level of work due to the lack of employees. Although it was a long time ago I still talk to my coworkers to this day. I learned that I am capable of many things. A little awkward at first however I learn and adapt fast. I only left due to relocation."
good,I would recommend experienced professionals to join this company. One the best place to work if you have joined the company as experienced professional. Technology and Management training to employees enhance their skill sets .
good,"My time at the bank was amazing. I learned so much and grew to the person I am today. With that said there is a lot of favoritism when it comes to manages, those willing to play the games would get ahead. If you didn't want to dwell in managements games you were just a normal employee and would get some of the special perks that other would get. The pay scale could be improved majorly. Overall Bank of America is a fun place to work that has its perks. I love that the bank is very much involved in volunteer work. As it has opened my eyes to volunteer, and put in as many hours as i can."
good,The people that you build relationships with like a family. You look forward to spending that time and growing together as a unit. I loved the people I met and still think about them today.
good,"The relationship banker job is remarkable exhausting. You do the sells of personal bankers without the bonuses. Very low pay compared to the job description. You need to tell customers to learn how to use self service options because they're low staffed. "
good,Bank of America gives many opportunities for advancement at the Banking Center level. If you work hard and take ownership of your work you are sure to advance to the position for which you are best suited and that best suits the organization. The Consumer Banking Channel is a great place to start a career in banking. There you will find many avenues and opportunities to advance inside and outside of the Banking Center.
good,"At times senior management seemed incapable of making decisions."
good,"Processed loans in high quantities."
good,very goal oriented company. if goals are not met then managers are breathing down your neck to push you to making goals. unrealistic expectations for associates. difficult to advance unless you have beyond impressive numbers. extremely hectic when busy.
good,"As with my current job, the best part of my day was being able to turn a negative customer experience into a positive one. "
good,"In the time I worked at Bank of America I worked with a great group of people.  I learned from them, as well as I hoped they learned from me.  The most enjoyable part of my day was getting to know my customers and help them.  We became very attached to each other at times  The repour developed made it easier to meet my customers needs.   The hardest part of my job was learning that we were closing the branch and having to help them move away from us.  Saying good bye is always hard."
good,"very difficult to re-apply."
good,My positions within Bank of America were all challenging where I had an opportunity to utilize and challenge my analytical skills.If not for reduction in staff I would still be employed with Bank of America.
good,"Working for Bank of America gave me so much knowledge in the banking industry. Unfortunately I am not a very good sales person, and to be employed at B of A you much sell there product, and many of them a day. I am a people person and wanted to help my customers, but they just wanted me to sell them products they did not need to just make my quota. I can sell anything I feel someone needs but I can not sell/refer something just to make a quota."
good,"The most I enjoyed at BOA as a Mortgage lender, was getting to know new people, and building relationships that after so many years I still have, some of them have become my friends, and I still give them Financial/Mortgage/Real Estate advise."
good,"I think like all management jobs it reinforces the challenges of having to effectively communicate with different people with different personalities. The way a person understands an objective can be at times completely different than another. Managements goal is to make a group of people come together for a common goal. But for me that was also the most rewarding, yet in truth, at times most frustrating. Taking a group of people and maximizing them as a team, making the goals collective. A cliché as it sounds, the phrase """"your only as strong as your weakest player,"" holds very true. Through my past 2 experiences, both at Enterprise and Bank of America, that's what I would wake up and get me going. To beat other stores, and strive to be the best. "
good,"Although a very strong company at the time, the sales goals were based on what has proven to be unethical practices.  Pushing mortgage products on people that should not have had the products was one of the contributing factors to the company having lost over half of its value since I was there."
good,There is good job security. Little direction on company policies until associates are hit with quality errors.  I believe the companies ability to redeploy there workforce is a good thing for job security but they praise seniority versus efficiency or knowledge.
good,"Excellent leadership and management."
good,Good benefits but get your college degree in case they lay you off. Good for starting out as a young career person however never keep your eggs in just one basket.
good,"Management loves to give out write-ups which will kill your opportunity for internal advancement. This would not be a problem if the write-ups were reasonable or preceded by an actual verbal warning... but when managers and employees are not given any time to review their progress regularly and work on plans to improve, it seems like a write-up is the simple answer for managers to avoid blaming themselves for under-performance. This is my single biggest complaint about BofA."
good,"My overall experience was great, pay and benefits were excellent, and I worked for the best management as the corporate culture cultivated trust, open door policy, supported growth, and learning opportunities."
good,"PROs - The atmosphere around the office is great, not at all stiff, very social, relaxed. The work can be interesting, in that you are often learning new material; its task-oriented nature can be very satisfying. Decent amount of client communication - helps me hone my interpersonal skills. Lots of internal communication, as part of a team-based approach - I enjoy both those aspects."
good,Great place to work with depending on the department you work for. Loan modifications and home retention jobs are being eliminated left and right.
good,"As a relationship manager in the mortgage industry you see people from all backgrounds mainly those struggling with their livelihood. This position concentrated on assisting borrower’s reach a final resolution with their property. Being the single point of contact consisted of many components. The customer service aspect of  meeting face to face with the customer involved discussing hardship, responsible for analyzing private documents and setting expecting for the final solution of the process. The functional side of processing the application required implementation of procedures to meet production deadlines. The whole process could have a file in the working pipeline anywhere from 120 days or longer. In that time period you continued to manage a working relationship with the borrower. Act as a liaison between departments, with business partners and vendors. It was not always a smooth transition in the department since it was an ever-changing environment. Management had a difficult time relating technical operations to meet reporting requirements. Constantly faced challenges in communicating procedure updates. I believe any experience is an opportunity to learn something new. I have admiration for team work. You learn to respect and help one another. At the end of the day we all have the same goal and having a support system within your group is crucial."
good,It is a place where you love to go to work since it brings a lot of challenges everyday. People are friendly and co-operative
good,"I had the pleasure of being employed with Bank of America for 7 years. Within those 7years I worked in several Line of Business, which provided me the opportunity to learn several aspects of Mortgage.   I had a great relationship with my manager, and my peers. The most enjoyable aspect of my job, was the interactions with the consumers.  The hardest part of my job, was losing my co-workers due to downsizing."
good,I really learned a lot about ISDA negotiating while working at BOA. The management is really great about providing training materials to become an ISDA negotiator. I was involved in ISDA negotiating with the hedge fund clients.
good,"Great place to work, but not to grow. "
good,"A typical work day meant me being at my desk for 9-12hours, taking a few trips to the coffee machine a day and maybe a 20minute lunch.  The targets are tight working PPI complaints and the job security incredibly low, with a monthly churn rate at one point atleast, sitting at 5% for consecutive months."
good,"Bank of America offers good benefits but they do not pay enough. Unfortunately, as one of the biggest corporation in America, the do the same as the others: just care about stockholders. Annual raise are 2 or 3 % and I guess you should be happy that ""at least you got that"" The job security is good, and depending on the area of work, a normal day can be busy but pretty much enjoyable. Coworkers are good or bad as anywhere. I been lucky and I work with awesome people. They should pay more to people how got the education for the job and works hard."
good,A typical day at work consisted of meeting the needs of the customer and resolving issues and concerns. The most enjoyable part of the job was expanding the customers relationships by helping them use their assets appropriately.
good,"Before leaving Bank of America, I will admit, despite their reputation in the banking industry, My manager in particular was awesome. He cares about his employees well being and was a great cheerleader for the company, though I personally felt he was overworked under appreciated. He went above and beyond and trained his employees to do the same."
good,I enjoy the flexibility of working from home.  I have very good managers who truly want to help me advance my career.  I have learned how to build reports in excel by pulling data from SQL.
good,"There really is not a typical day. There are certainly expectations and goals set for the day but things can happen throughout the day to throw you of course.  I learned a lot at this company about sales, service, management, multi tasking, planning and so much more.  The hardest part of the job is probably time management because there are just so many things to manage you have to make sure you can set priorities, delegate and make a plan for each day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers/clients achieve their goals and showing them how to make things easier."
good,"Enjoyed the professional atmosphere and co-workers."
good,More pay is all I wish would've taken place.. I loved going to work it was a friendly fun involvement
good,"Work here as an intern. It was pretty much what I expected, long hours staring at a computer screen."
good,"Company offers a variety of options for obtaining positions on many states in the United States, also offers many benefits to employees and a great diverse environment."
good,Able to conform and meet my schedule to create most desirable work and life balance.  Provides tools needed to perform my job. Continues to put cusomters first while meeting federal and company guidelines.
good,"The work/life balance is good, but the work is not particularly fulfilling. Like most large companies, they are slow to adapt to changing trends in web development, which makes it a somewhat less optimal place to grow as a developer."
good,"Flexible schedules, business casual environment. This is a good company to work for however the benefits and employee perks have decreased little by little every year."
good,"A typical day at work starts with the scrum standup where tasks are discussed, updated and etc etc...."
good,Good company for learning and growth. Pushes its employees to their full potential. Work environment was supportive and helpful.
good,"typical day at work: Very productive, very busy, a lot to learn"
good,Handled calls from Customer that was 1-3 months behind on the house mortgage payments. I would do work out plans for the customer to help them save their house and if they didn't qualify for the hardship programs I would add an advisor  to help them.
good,"Awesome job, loved taking care of people, great teammates, bat part: the pay."
good,I absolutely loved the company's benefits. I would still be working for this company but the downsizing and the managing style that I had from a young new manager made work life difficult. Loved my job and helping people.
good,"I like to work at bank of america."
good,Had to cross-sell with the threat of losing your job if referral quota was not met. Long hours and had to work on the week-end.
good,Typical work environment on average but you don't get trained for the different responsibilities added on a regular basis.  It's a sink or swim place to work.
good,"Assigned daily tasks to the processors I supervised, completed reports for upper management daily.  Excellent co-workers but management was not in tune with employees."
good,"I enjoyed a lot of the company with exception of the extreme politics. On an up note, the customers really do love you and are there because of your loyal service. Your co-workers are like a second family and the people in your branch are generally good people. On the downside, because of their downsizing you never know when someone even yourself is going to be let go in a moments notice without warning. The closing of branches, and the sale of so many, is worrisome. People who have worked for the company for so many years, figured no one is bigger then Bank of America, it's discomforting when such a large company turns it's back on you and sells you despite meeting branch goals."
good,"	Service customer enquiries, determine customer needs and provide solutions with regards to their banking requirements"
good,"Start my day reviewing sales statistics for the previous business day, build meeting materials for daily meeting and introduce the new strategies on client engagement, and how to identify business sales opportunities "
good,"A software professional with 3.3 years of experience in the software industry, I have worked on banking, financial products. I have a proven track record of supporting associated applications which deals with finance tools by using technical skills which include Shell Scripting, Oracle 9i, TOAD, SQL Developer, Nagios , Ganglia, Bugzilla, PuTTY, UNIX, Apache"
good,The environment is great. Co workers are always friendly and very helpful.
good,Very busy and often stressful. I worked for the company before they bought Merrill and CountryWide. Those were good days to work there then when we bought out those other companies we got to big to fast.
good,"Due to my position, my day was usually jam-packed. I worked in the mailroom, sorted and extracted work, did data entry, document scanned, and encoded, all the while keeping up with deadlines and quality checked my team's work."
good,The work life balance and the benefits are the best in the industry at Bank of America.
good,"The company itself was ok it went into a transition from another company, and management was horrible the jobs became different and the training was not the best."
good,Working for Bank of America I started out at the front desk as a receptionist/admin asst. I was quickly given other duties and was taught the steps to become a loan processor. There was also was opportunity for growth and I was always able to learn new job duties.
good,Very productive environment with focus on meeting quotas.  Able to learn much.  Challenges occurs but only to keep my skills sharpened.  Everyday you will hit the ground running.
good,I like to come to work knowing I have to use a great deal of concentration to make sure all of the facts are correct in each document before proceeding.  The management works well with us and I have met some nice people.
good,"The entire financial sector is undergoing rapid and constant change.  Along with that you have growing pains of trying to stay abreast of the change.  With that you have areas of opportunity to grow your skill set and learn new things but also you have the stresses of unrealistic deliverables, chaos, unorganized management and my huge discontentment with BOA is under compensation."
good,"Seasonal job, family oriented and with flexible hours. Friendly environment, great group of employees, including management. I find the hardest part of the job that it has a very small potential for a permanent position or growth, and the salary is in the low pay scale. "
good,"Has the potential to be a great work environment but they keep reducing the staff to the point where I am conducting over 300 teller transactions a day (I am actually supposed to be more sales oriented per my position and am only supposed to be working as a teller 25% of the time) and expected to transfer sales over from 10% of those customers while we only have ONE personal banker! Between my referrals and those of the actual tellers, there would not be enough time in the day for our one personal banker to close all of those sales.This is the reason I am seeking other employment, I am a good salesperson but I cannot convince someone to sit and wait for two and a half hours for our one personal banker to get to them. I've had hot leads walk out the door after waiting 45 minutes; it's ridiculous."
good,"This location was very busy with a lot of customers, stayed busy most of the time. Poor manangement."
good,"This company is made for people who need the structure of corporate in their lives. You are required to take/breaks at a certain. They have great benefits with schooling and day care. They make it difficult to advance and will not work with you on your career path. They would prefer for each employee to do it on their own, "
good,I enjoyed my time working at Bank of America. I learned a lot and was able to increase my skillset while working there.
good,"This was a call center for Bank of America.  We spent our days taking customer banking calls. When I started out it wasn't that bad.  Managers were good at helping you and giving you feedback.  If you needed a break, you're manager would let you.  They used to have a lot of fun parties, games, and events for the staff but as time went on, it got more restrictive.  Fun events were eliminated and eventually it got the point where you couldn't go to the bathroom when you needed to.  I had tried for years to move up with the company and despite being told I was a good employee, I kept getting passed up for promotions without any real explanation while less experienced folks were getting promoted."
good,Great benefits with the company and many resources available to become successful.
good,Good growth opportunities but very low pay.Takes care of employees nicely and provides a very good work/life balance to its employees.
good,Bank of America provided the opportunity for continuing education. It also provides coaching and support for employees. working for bank of america was a good learning experience but did not give room to meet clients demands to provide a good customer experience
good,Very Strick policy that seem to change alot without notice. Great benefits and incentives for hard work. Diversity and open-mindedness
good,"It was allways a learning day in my carrier in the organisation where I worked, doesnt matter whether it was on my routine life or for my carrier part."
good,"I originally started my employment with Countrywide Home Loans, however, BAC acquired CHL in 2007 and by default we all became employees of the bank.  "

good,"Assisted customers in financial matters"
good,"I love my co-workers and manager, dealing with people a plus."
good,"Although, there has been a lot of bad publicity, the culture is great. Constant discussion about the culture and vision of the business."
good,In my current position I process and underwrite conditions on MHA refinances. Once I receive loans I am responsible for collecting documents to meet conditions as well as reviewing them to clear the condition. I work closley with the Loan originators and closers as a team to ensure loans close quickly.
good,"flexible hours, supportive management and peers. alot of work but alot of trainings to help you enhance"
good,"Typical day starts very early and ends very late due to time zone differences, however provides flexibility of working from home. Most co-workers are nice, have learned a lot due to opportunities to reside in many different areas. Most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things and the hardest is the red tape due to the size of the company."
good,I learned a lot about servicing loans and the foreclosure process. My co-workers are amazing.  the hardest part of the job is the changing requirements and reporting.
good,This is the company I began my career. Had the best manager/supervisor.  Taught me all I needed to know to Advance.
good,"All about the customers, if you are a people person, then this job is for you."
good,"Organizationally, a wonderful, corporate setting.  The benefits and compensation are tremendous.  However, while they preach work, life balance - the company will not back the employee over the department heads to actually hold this value."
good,"A typical day at work consists of working with network law firms to mitigate risk and ensure that litigation is going smoothly. I also review documents for execution and provide advice and approval on how to proceed with cases. "
good,"Many challenges in a fast paced call center environment"
good,"Answer calls from home owners and assist with all the mortgage issues, such as escrow, taxes, insurance and so on. I think the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help callers resolve their issues, when they can't make their payments. Right now the hardest part of my job is not knowing if we are going to have a job. And also being tied down to a computer for all day. I really enjoy my immediate supervisor she is helping me broaden my position by giving me many management tasks, such as submitting escalation follow ups, approving tasks associates cannot complete and also coach those that are not meeting the company expectations."
good,"i have learnt a lot in bank or america, in professional as well as behavioral point of view ,"
good,"A typical day at bank of America it was a very busies bank, what i learn how to open account safe deposit box  and became a notaries and so much more, wonderful person. my co-workers we all go along my, seeing customer leave unhappy see my customer leave happy and laughing."
good,great company to work for and amazing benefits. Able to help customer see success in their financial goal and realizing you were in small ways apart of the success. Receiving complements from the recommendation and advice you provided.
good,A typical day at work is to go in and process tax paperwork. I learned the different tax forms and what each form meant and also how to separate all of the different tax forms. The management were very productive in how they trained and what they taught you. My co-workers were very respectable and independent people. The hardest part of the job in my opinion was how fast you had to learn all of the tax forms and how you couldn't make no mistakes because it affected everybody who works there and also slows down the process tremendously. The most enjoyable part about the job was learning how taxes work and hat it takes to process everybody taxes each year. 
good,My review on Bank of America is very simple. The facility was very comfortable as well as the professional setting. Everyone worked productively with the mind set of getting the job done in a timely manner with happy faces.
good,"Open center and assist customer with banking needs. Worked with staff to increase relationships and sales. Manage team, attend meetings, schedule teammates, lobby lead, manage risk. "
good,A typical day at work involves being behind the teller line assisting customers in numerous types of transactions. There are multiple reports to be done everyday that involves looking up information on the computer. Assisting customers in my office with any problems they may have on their accounts. My co-workers are very helpful to each other on a day-to-day basis. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers that I have gotten to know over the years. The hardest part of the job is when you really can't help the person sitting in front of you as much as you would like to. 
good,"The pay is very good for a first job, but the raises are so low and not given very often. I'm talking about 39 cent raises a year...Regardless of how good a worker you are. (At least that is how my department worked) Wow..."
good,The most enjoyable part was managment understood and could relate to certain situations
good,"Worklife varies contingent upon the Line of Business you support; and that also can affect the ladder to advancement. The company seeks to breed a work culture that is engaged and fulfilling for it's employee's; but at times that can be difficult to properly execute. I've been able to move up the ranks relatively quickly; however, now that I'm trying to branch into other lines of businesses it has become quite difficult due to experience level.  "
good,"I was assigned a wonderful person that gave me on the job training for my position.  My primary qualifier was my typing skills and excellent tone and manner in speaking with people.  Unfortunately, I was not employed with this company to give it much of a review."
good,"I worked partially from home, I handled all escalation from the office of the president. I researched escalation from the Attorney General office. I handled file research for court cases. I handled system issue from reviewing file that were declined in error to checklist system errors. "
good,Its a great place to learn to do many things. It prepares you for many opportunities.

good,Enjoyed working there. learned many things related to work
good,Distressed Asset Recovery Team
good,"Bank of America is a good company to work for. I've been with the company for four years and working there have allowed me to form a career path. I have bonded with great co-workers, and the moral and community involvement Bank of America have is awesome."
good,"The Small Business Relationship Specialist is a very fast paced sales environment. Because it's the banking industry, federal regulation is very strict and the job is ultimately like telemarketing. This causes management to change policies, procedures and your incentive pay often."
good,Work requirements and balance in personal life was easy to seperate.
good,I started this company as a fresher so can't explain how i like the Bank so much
good,"I have had an enormous amount of opportunity at Bank of America. The demand of the job is very time intensive, & I work approx. 70-80 hrs each week. It is a constantly changing environment that requires one to be able to multi task & shift priorities quickly. My co-workers & I collaborate frequently & work together as much as possible to come up with solutions. My associates are the most enjoyable part of the job. Their dedication & drive are inspiring."
good,"easy going job, company is currently going through culture/value changes."

good,Work is very productive. Managers communicate effectively to employees regarding queue strategies.
good,A typical day began each day at 9.00 PM. My responsibility was to make nighly deposits into assigned accounts from healthcare providers and members. Management was consistent and my coworkers were great people. The hardest part of this job was the production which was 130 checks per hour. The most enjoyable part of this job was the friend and coworkers I gained.
good,The hardest part of the job was the large settlements.
good,"Going to work with plenty of work to do and no time to waist,i learn at a very fast past the know how to first do all i can to help loving families keep there home with modifing there mortgage loan,and then i was promoted to the title review project in which the work load is great and learning the different skill set is amazing,my management team is wonderful always on top of the changes that we get on a daily base keeping all informed of the quility we give and praise we get for our dedicated work.I have the most talented co-workers willing to go the extra mile for us all and the clients,the hardest part of the job is leaving for the day knowing that there are still work in our ques that we haven't gotten to yet for another family thats waiting.The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing at that particular time that i have done a great job when i send in my work and realizing that with the work i'm doing is helping someone in need."
good,The pay and benefits are very competitive. Small Business Sales and Services Relationship Specialist
good,"Call center environment, team environment. Hardest part was schedules"
good,The job was pretty decent and you learn many communication and computer skills. The job was mentally stressfull.
good,A typical day is spent dealing with both livid and extreamly happy customers. It's their money literaly at my finger tips. I've learned to take each call a call at a time. I've also learned to not wear my feelings on my sholders and how to work under stress.
good,"At Bank of America the main focus of the job is taking calls. In an average day you will normally take anywhere from 70-100 phone calls and our handle time and quality is monitored very closely. The environment in the building is very good always having contests and decorations for different things. The hardest part about the job is sitting at a desk for 10+ hours taking the same phone calls over and over, but being able to joke around with others is the best part."
good,I worked for the company for 8 years. Great company to work for.
good,A good place to work if you have a family. Good place to retire-
good,I would surely work here again but it has to be in the right department with the right group of people.
good,All around not a bad place to work or grow. The pay and advancement opportunities are good. Sales goals are hard.
good,learned to leave problems at home work hard to secceed and do your job right the first time ask questions and strive for better
good,A typical day at work includes a fast paced sales environment. Development is laid out on the table. Management varies from banking center to banking center. Co-Workers are usually fun and honest. Hardest part of the job is adapting to constant change and an adjustment to automation. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and having every sunday and every possible holiday off.
good,Very good Benefits along with work/life programs. Large company where you can transfer and or advance your career.
good,Worked in banking industry for over 30 years. Had the opportunity to work in several different areas of Item Processing. Always had the chance to learn any different job function in any department that related to the production side of Item Processing.Had a great time and make great friends over the past several years.
good,Customer and Associate centric company with opportunity for advancement.
good,Co-worker work together and we share to learn some new thing or training some new thing to learn.
good,bank of america (mbna) is a good company to work for but need more of a career advancement
good,"It was a fun place too work. Job security can be tied to the stock price. The culture was ok, and depends on the actual group you work in. Some groups are great and others not so much."
good,"Great customers and great co workers. I loved that part of my job, the breaks were spread out evenly so it broke the day up pretty well. I was unfairly let go. But did not want to stay anyways. I liked helping with transactions and such but they also have sales quotas that you must meet and at my store we had only older people and field workers  who just wanted their checks cashed out."
good,Very structure day on what it takes to run a branch. They have stripped down staff which puts more and more stress on branch employees. You do have to very good at multi task. If you are looking to get recongnized it is hard press to get it however the benefits are by far the best of any company. If you are looking for great benefits then this is best place.
good,"Bank of America is a nice place to work, but not happy for not encouraging the employees for further technology update. They did not even reimburse my SAS certification fees even though I cleared the exam and it is related to my job responsibilities."
good,After working for this company I'm not a position to right a good review.  Im angry at the moment with the way things are done in my particular market.
good,They take care of there employees. They provided job security. The compensation was good. They worked with you and around your schedules. They did not micro manage. Management was nice and helpful.
good,"There are many opportunities for advancement with Bank of America.  Bank of America is all over the world.  If you are in the right department, you can see the world. I would still work for them if they didn't move my department to Southern California."
good,"My internship was an okay experience. The bank is very burueacratic, slow-moving, and disorganized in many ways. I only had enough work to fill about 25% of my time, despite working very hard to create projects for myself. It is very difficult to get connected to resources as an intern. You have to figure everything out for yourself. By the time you do, your internship is over and you accomplished very little. However, the BoA name on the resume looks good despite that fact that the internship was kind of a joke. Compensation for full time was not competitive in my MBA program. I declined my offer and received another offer a couple months later from another company that was literally twice what I was offered at BoA. Overall, people are very nice and want to be helpful. People are just very siloed. There are few people that understand enough of the institution to connect all the dots for someone new."
good,"keeping balanced with your monthly metrics, assessments, weekly meetings. Help organize monthly events. Workplace culture smiling through it all.  The hardest being judge on the survey the customer answer on your customer service. The most enjoyable part is being awarded and knowledge for your hard work."
good,B of A is a great company when it comes to benefits but at the local level the branch managers seem to always forget their mission and make the job about themselves and push the employees beyond their breaking point. Calls to corporate go unanswered as managers will cover themselves and throw us under the bus. Great managers are rare but they do exist.
good,Great working there I learned alot with the people and staff hard job bur I did it no regrets it was a good exporience working here if I would recommend.
good,"Loved all my customers even the ones having a bad day or slightly rude. Customers are people and we all have bad days, a smile and polite attention helps weather all types of storms."
good,Bank of America is a great place to work. Their benefits are good. Management provided with great work feedback. A fun place to work with flexible hours.
good,Benefits included uncapped bonuses and great hours. Hardest part of the job were the customers constantly screaming at you. A typical day consisted of speaking to consumer and small business customers about their financial needs
good,"A typical day at work is based on productivity and customer satisfaction.  While this can be conflicting at times, the goal is to "
good,"Very demanding job at times do to everyone being short staff but at the same time implementing more work. Big on behavior such as follow up appt, sending emails and recording client interaction, which is great with the right tools. The tools are not the best currently but can see great strives with the company if processes were simplified and tools became more efficient."
good,"There is not enough acknowledgement for tellers. I started off as a teller and it was okay for maybe two years. I am aware many companies expect A LOT from the ""little guys"" but this company drains you by wanting everything and providing nothing. You have to know someone to get somewhere in most cases. However, I did enjoy my time with other associates. In addition, they had awesome benefits."
good,"The pay is low for the responsibility involved. $15.81 isn't consistent with a job of this nature. We had access to people's financial records. The potential for identity theft and fraud is always present. "
good,"This is a great place to work however you'll run into hurdles every now and again. They offer various different perks; traveling to different sites, ability to work on different teams, aligning to a line of business. A lot of opportunity to move around and experience a number of different departments based off of your preference."
good,Not sure that I can even give this a rating.  It's been that long.  From what I remember it was very competitive and the hours were very long.  Not a bad place to work
good,Bank of America has changed since I was employed there in 2005. I am not sure of the current work environment. I did however enjoy my time there and would return if asked.
good,"I enjoyed my time at this company, but found that I had difficulty maintaining work/life balance as I had to care for elderly parents at the time.  I would have loved to be able to do both."
good,"Working for the bank is good, but it is slowly becoming obsolete. Job security isn't the best because they are slowly phasing out financial centers. But, pay and benefits were great."
good,Pay isn’t great for the stressful environment. Not much room for advancement as they tend to not promote from within. Generous 401k program as well as generous vacation and sick time.
good,"night shift, speed and accuracy is the real deal to accomplish my daily job.  hard part of it was if the courier stuck in Northern part of AZ due to snow.  The TEAM are forced to stay to wait for the courier so we can key all the job."
good,My manager was great as well as the team . It was to big guys above us that were not great . So many responsibilities while being short staffed. Was overwhelming because of so many customer complaints about not being effeicitent due to shortage of staff .
good,"I left because of the pay rate. It was very low and I was looking for something more. An average day there you just cash peoples checks, ask if they would like to open a checking/savings or credit card account. You handle a large amount of money so you have to be very careful when counting. At the end of the night you count your drawer to make sure you are at 0. If you are over/under $20, you first have to figure out why and go through all of your deposits and cashed checks and if you still can't find it, you go on a warning (if I can remember) but second time you get written up for sure. My coworkers were awesome, however, clientele were a bit up tight. And it was the kind of environment that the ""customer is always right"" even if they were wrong. Great benefits, for both full and part time. With time you can get a career advancement from within the company. At the location I worked at they were understaffed so there would be long lines in the bank. Fridays are the longest and most needed day of the week since everyone is there to cash their checks, etc. And Saturdays since people who couldn't make it Friday, make it in on Saturday."
good,"I loved working at Bank of America. "
good,Banco de america me ofrecio oportunidedess de aprender y de entrenamiento
good,"Working at Bank of America in the years that I did was a good time. My manager was one of the kindest, objective, understanding, and fair person I have ever met. You were able to go to her with any questions or concerns you had whether it was personal or work related. She was always there to help you improve in your work."
good,"Coordinated team efforts to meet end-to-end product handoffs ensuring zero defects while meeting established internal and external deadlines.  This position required new hire development/ training covering the deposit processing platform, operational procedures based on product and meeting high performance standards."
good,"It's a good place to work.  It has a nice working environment,-numerous meeting rooms and quite areas to work.  They have very knowledgeable teams and employees that are a pleasure to work with..  Managers and teammates always willing to help."
good,Bank of America was a fair place to work. They paid fairly and provided ample education and advancement opportunities. I worked there for over ten years and was able to gain a lot of knowledge from my time there.
good,"Bank of America was a great place to work to develop new experiences, with a rewarding compensation, and the benefits were nice. Fast paced, not a lot of support from management at the time I was there."
good,"I enjoyed the job, despised the pay. Hours could sometime be 50+ a week depending on pipeline. A lot of management favoritism. "
good,"Bank of America is a very diverse company to work for which is great. For the most part people were nice (i.e. the managers), some of them smiled in your face and talked behind your back but thats the corporate world period, rather, the world for that matter. For the most part we were all there to get a job done, everyone was very helpful, training was great and prepared me very well for taking the real calls."
good,"Great opportunity for growth"
good,"I worked for this company for almost 7 years, paid by dues to Bank of America to work my way up to Merrill.  Once I got to Merrill, I worked for 6 months and was let go for personal reasons (there was no problems with my performance and I truly thought highly of my manager) and was given no warning.  I personally think it was because I was on FMLA and therefore practically had the ability to make my own schedule that I was let go."
good,Values in talent management and retention is lacking.  Some of the leaders consistently say one thing and act contradictory.  My team and LOB is open and collaborative.
good,"My day consisted of mostly customer service calls, opening new bank accounts and home loans.  "
good,"Opening Branch and Drive up Teller window."
good,Management and team spirit was great but banking overall is becoming unstable and a revolving door.  The metrics are more important than simply doing your job well and be okay.
good,"It's been so long since I have worked here.  But I have good memories here.  I also have bad ones, as it was often stressful.  Living 30 minutes away helped clear my head on the drive home.  I really did not care for my last manager but I really liked my first one that hired me.  He is a good person and is a great manager.  I learned a lot from him."
good,I was only auditing the rental deposit contract boxes..i didnt interact much with the customers only the staff. Which in some places were more welcoming then in other places
good,"Workplace culture is good. "
good,Boa has been a large part of my life and what I am today. My growing and development. Boa has taught me a lot and I’ve enjoyed being part of a diverse team and opportunities thank you
good,"Sticklers for time, surveys determine your job, unknowledgeable management.  Up to each individual manager to determine how much bereavement time they want to give, not necessarily what's in the handbook.  Manager has the say if you want to post out."
good,"Eyes opened job, make sure you pay attention to everything you do. When working with the customer's money. It's job you can advance in, the job is very informative."
good,"Workload is unrealistic,  especially when NOOOO overtime is allowed.  Market managers tend to be understanding and as helpful as possible but are also held accountable to several metrics which trickles down."
good,Bank of America has wonderful benefits. they compensate well and are really into making employees feel happy. There is always an activity or something available
good,"A difficult place to work at, yet there is a reason for every procedure in place.  A very compliant and forward thinking institution however.  "
good,"While it is a fast paced and stressful job, it also has very long hours to accomplish. A typical day at work starts right as you log in and it does not end before you leave, it is resumed the day after. Some weekends are expected, must be flexible and be able to remain calm during stressful scenarios."
good,While the wages and benefits were competitive for the time that I worked for the company. Working in a sales oriented field with may goals and metrics in place became a stressful environment to work in.
good,"depending on the time and day you work the atmosphere could be great or stressful. being  organized will help a lot. most enjoyable part of the job is incentive, try to hit your mark or above each month and you'll get rewarded."
good,Have room for advancement. Management is okay depending on which department you work for. Good benefits when I worked there don't know about now. Overall okay company
good,"I normally start my day by holding a daily strategy meeting which details the previous days performance, I then process all of the customers agreements.."
good,Coming into the office early and going early is most enjoyable if you can get from sleep to work as fast as possible. Some puzzles were hard to solve having no references. Management is really what you struggle within yourself and most times it is the echoing of your words praising and bantering forth as you ascend the Mount Everest. I learned many new skills or if not complemented many known skills with experience. I also learned a statistic I derived which was that this company as most other companies have little ability to have a constancy in job security and advancement for my case.
good,The work is very stressful now due to the drastic cut in staff. You are so overwhelmed with the amount of work your are doing and the continuous lines out of the door. The hardest part for me was to see the Customer waiting 15 to 20 minutes in line to be serviced but that is what the company wants. That is what the strategy is now. The most enjoyable part of the job is your ability to make a difference in someones life financially. The joy is brought to them. Priceless!!!!
good,"good company, no work pressure good work culture.employee will get good exposer on banking domain"
good,Asked to sell multiple products but not necessarily rewarded enough to be motivated to do so. Commission scale is high compared to competitors but low compared to banking years before.
good,"have knowledge in all kind of skills to develop inter relationship professionally"
good,Benefits and pay are great. was hired as full time but they later decided to restructure and make me part time. not what i signed up for. customer can be hard to deal with. They really strict with procedures and guidelines. Training is not so great could be improved.
good,"I've been with BAC for over 15 years now. Like anyone that has been with a company that long, there are good and bad days. Lately, the great perks we get are starting not to outweigh the stress level branch associates are put under. They're staffing model only works in ideal situations (i.e. no vacation, no LOA, no sick) - which is rarely the case. So, managers struggle to have enough staff to open the doors much less take care of all the clients in a satisfactory way. This all trickles down to the managers' performance. It's hard to feel like we're being set up for success when you don't have enough resources to get the job done."
good,Tough job but with the right person can be accomplished. Must be a people person with a tenatios attitude and a strong will to succeed. Must be very independent and able to adapt to multiple situations.
good,Stressful as most of the jobs in California are being outsourced back east and to India. The people who I worked with over the years were all wonderful people.
good,I enjoyed my time at BOA.  Opportunity for growth and the company invested in their employees.  The management team was structured and allowed employees to voice their opinions to promote better service.
good,"If you go to management, be prepared for the politics. Great people to work within the Teams. Frequent changes, reorgs and layoffs. Overall a great place to work."
good,The best part of this company is the benefits! There is also lots of opportunity for growth within. Bank of America really is a stable work environment with lots of opportunities.
good,"Great experience working for BofA in San Francisco, before the company merged with NationsBank. During that time, most of the bank's key functions were relocated to Charlotte, NC."
good,I would take in bound calls on credit cards. The customers usually called for some type of fraud on their card. I would review their account and see if there was actual fraud on the card.
good,"A lot of opportunities within the company to advancing your career. Overall, good corporate. This is a company that promotes being engaged in the community and this makes Bank of America an excellent place to work. Almost everyone at this company is very friendly. It is not an unbearable place to be, even with some of the less qualifies management."
good,"The day a Bank of America would begin, with a high volume of calls waiting in Que prior to start. The typical day consisted of helping customers open and close lines of credit, open new accounts, handle account disputes and escalated calls. The management staff was very professional, resourceful, and available to assist if needed. The workplace culture was very busy and stressful at times, highly productive, but full of great people. The hardest part of the job would be for someone to keep pace if they are not used to intense situations at times. The most enjoyable part of job, was helping a customer leave satisfied with my service."
good,Working for Bank of America was the most difficult job I have held. Not because of the actual work-but you have to have a high stress tolerance. I was a part time teller but was scheduled as a full time teller. It can be a very busy branch working both the drive through and a teller window. Bank protocol and security procedures have to be done in a timely matter.
good,It's a good place to work for. great management great benefit However it's limited opportunities for grow.....................................................
good,From my experience working for Bank of America they are a pretty good company. They really care about there customers safety and make sure there employees are well trained.
good,"Worked at the IRS Lockbox facility.  Many income tax returns are sent here to be sorted and entered onto their databases.  I was a data entry clerk there.  Management wants you to type as fast as you can.  Management is cool and the co-workers are quiet.  The hardest part of the job was only working for five months during the year.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ""easy going atmosphere""."
good,"Hours are great. Paid time off for holidays. Many opportunities to learn about finances, process of the banking industry, and improve oneself. Due to recession, hours were (might still be) limited and opportunities for advancement were rare. Upper management was very critical of ""the numbers"" but was unwilling to address internal concerns to assist in resolving issues/customer's needs."
good,"Bank of America N.A./ Calibara ​– ​Post Closer / Service Release Specialist  04/15-03/2016 -Tampa, FL  *Prove post closing service release duties  *Investigate and validate the abstract and chain of title for service released accounts. * Correct chain of title by creating applicable assignment of mortgage.   * Managing the shipping of all incoming and outgoing documents applicable to the procurement and service release process.  *Interacting with all lines of  businesses , county  recorders and state representatives to insure accuracy  and procession in the execution process of all assignment of mortgages."
good,its a nice environment but management isnt that great. I wish they would add incentives for the sales that tellers are required to sell.
good,I learn a lot from this company was able to help a lot of people on their financial needs gained a lot of trust from my customer was able to sale the product of the bank if the customer needed them this really was nice to do cause the customer I got to help were really happy about my service and would recommend me there friend and family when they needed help financially.
good,"When I interned there, my typical day included slicing up reports and identify accounts that were failing on their personal program onto excel. Identifying accounts failed on our end, making amendments, so that when client comes to us on failed account, its not on our end. "
good,A lot of referrals needed daily. Short staff all the time. They pay very little for what they expect of you. Benefits are good.
good,"When I was hired, I was told the only constant at the company was change and they were correct. The organization is constantly striving to become leaner and meaner - Best in Class in the market."
good,I had pride in working for bank of america but many of the employees are over worked and unappreciated. Benefits are amazing and hours are not too bad either. Meeting and getting to know new people every day is a great way to enhance our communication skills which did help me grow as an individual.
good,"Had longevity with the company but with the constant lay offs and lack of job security. I'm no longer with the company. Excellent company benefits, time off , salary was great and promotion/company advancement was a plus"
good,"foundation of the company is solid, job security I give it a 10 but all the different focus and changes makes a challenging to excel. Management is really unstable."

good,"good staff, management was lacking. benefits were amazing!! room to learn and excel in current role was a great benefit."

good,"The job offers great benefits, paid vacation, sick time, 401k, and much more. You have the ability to move up in the company you just have to work hard and perform on the job tasks effectively. You also have the ability to travel and see new places while working. Wonderful teamwork atmosphere. The job is not for the faint of heart as much of the work is for escalated accounts, or homeowners that are in financial need/crisis."
good,"Bank of America, although a great place to work, would not be my top choice for employment again. I'd highly advise anyone to apply for a mortgage specialist position within this company unless you need a job."
good,"I started out as a teller when i was fresh out of high school, at 18 years of age. Bank of America has given me lots of advancement opportunities but I feel it is now time to move on. I have been there for over 13 years and although I love the job security and benefits, I am not willing to work in a hostile environment for the rest of my life. I work in a call center and we used to have so much fun. Now, under new management, I dread going to work and it is not a good feeling. I am grateful for these many years of great benefits, paid vacation and job stability, but I am ready for something different."

good,"I loved the hours, I loved my co-workers, but I hated the overall atmosphere of sell-sell-sell and try to make it look like we were NOT selling.  I understood the nature of the business, but after four years it was enough for me to pack my bags and find another job."
good,"Have great tuition reimbursement benefits, 401k, health benefits"
good,"I can not discuss that company, I do believe that bank of america as a company is great however management is tear-able and they allow they to take control to much"
good,"I was one for the fortunate few who was able to work from home.  I was involved with a very interesting group that was created shortly before my arrival and I enjoyed being involved with its development.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the new manager that came in and changed everything, then began the reduction of the group.  The best part of my day was dealing with my immediate team."

good,"It was a great experience, just wasn't something i wanted to do for the rest of my life. Wanted a friendlier work environment with room to grow and learn."
good,"Dry - boring atmosphere. Not a visionary company. Bound by too many rules and regulations. Overall a good company for conservative, non-creative people."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in reading customer complaints and addressing their issues and sending letters to them capturing their concerns, request and treatments.  Then I would assign an Negotiator to be their single point of contact.  "
good,"A typical day consisted of compiling data, reviewing pertinent data to ascertain loan approval. Co-workers were pleasant and easy to work with, enjoyed the team environment."
good,"Loved my customers and co workers."
good,Great place to work. But very difficult to maintain productivity and full time class schedule.
good,"Work is always interesting. Calls come in back to back on some days and range from processing payments, updating tax or escrow information to more challenging tasks such as trying to get lien release information to a homeowner to beat deadlines for a refinance."
good,Handled escalated inquires and disputes for modification
good,"My day at work is micromanaged all day long. Its a high volume processing center with a quota for the end of the day out of this world. You come in, someone brings you your supplies and you start processing checks all day. Management is uptight because they rely on us to make the quota without any errors so they can look good in meetings. Co-workers are okay. Try no get too close to anyone. The best thing would be to come in, do your job and go home. The hardest part of the job would be trying to reach your quota for whatever hours you work without making any errors. The most enjoyable part of the job are the breaks. Everyone needs a break from pushing over a 100 checks an hours.I have learned that if you don't want to get stuck with something that you know is not for you, get a good education so you have the power over your future and career. I have also learned that production jobs are the hardest jobs in the market."
good,It was great working at Bank of America. The best part of it was the security it provided to all the employees. The management was really good.
good,"A typical day is going to work from 8-5pm and also working weekend on Saturday 8-5pm, that was  very difficult to do because all your day is spent working. This is a very challenging position and scedule were not flexible either was getting a day off."
good,"*Most recently I managed a team of customer relationship managers who worked with customers experiencing financial hardships.  My team worked with customers to determine what workout option would work best with their financial situation.  "
good,working at bank of America is a realy good experience everyone is so polite and respectful I realy enjoy working there . I learned a lot from bank of America.
good,"I am responsible for leading, managing and coaching a team of sales and service professionals to meet and exceed sales targets, ensure the operational excellence of the banking center and create an excellent customer experience. I act as “general manager” and responsible for ensuring collaboration between banking center teammates and on-site specialists. "
good,"Bank of America is renovating itself in various ways while still focusing on ensuring that it places its customers on center stage. The goals and expectations have been raised to ensure the company keeps the best talent in each and every department. There are different opinions in regards to the changes the company is making and some feel their morale going down. Personally, I don't find the changes too troubling."
good,Most of the team mangers were easy to get along with and very knowledgable.
good,"Depending on your position at B of A you will either love it or not like it as much. Tellers (like me) make more than minimum wage... but expectations are a lot higher than compensation not to mention there are no incentives for referrals that are mandatory. Over all they offer good benefits, and the relationships you build as a team and with customers are great! I actually really enjoy my job."
good,"Our departments changed roles every 3 months and after 2 years of being employed by them, my entire site was laid off."
good,"there were a lot of good qualities about the bank. The customer was always first, whether internal or external.  As a manager, I learned people and their work habits."
good,Great Company to work for. Great Benefits. Nice atmonsphere
good,"I was fresh out of graduate school when Bank of america openedly accepted me as a full time employee i have overcome some of the diffcult things in life when devasting news arrive,stay calm listen and offer assistance if i am unable to help, stay focused there are plenty other options avaiable. i have learned to open up to my team as a family i connected with physically and emotionally, but most of all i learned it feel good to actually help someone save a home."
good,"great place to work , get customer service experience. very repetitive."
good,"Advancement opportunity based off of seniority, not necessarily performance or skills."
good,Over all this company offers good benefits to their employees and they do have a decent community development program and they offer services to the employees that many other companies do not offer.
good,"Working in an inbound call center, to uncover clues in order to be able to offer the right products to the customer."
good,"This is a great place to work, I would say especially for Single mothers. There is lots of room for growth and opportunities for advancement: Great benefits and an overall good job."
good,Great company to work for. They did a lot to produce moral. I process annuities transfers for the company
good,Job was easy and relaxed.
good,"BofA is a highly stressful environment and there really is no joy in working there. The benefits are great and salaries pretty comparable to the outside market, however, a lot of my co-workers have either quit or gone out on stress disability due to the fact that all management cares about is the job. Employees are definitely second-class citizens with BofA. Over the past 20 years BofA has become a global entity and has forgotten that the worker-bees are who helped to make it that way."
good,Meeting and helping people make the job enjoyable. I have learned a lot about sales and public speaking
good,"A typical day at bank of america involves, talking customer service calls regarding credit cards of high value clients. Servicing their calls and selling them additional products. I learned alot about a call center in the short time being employed with bank of america. Management is ok, some better than others. Hardest part of this job would have to be dealing with some unsatisfied customers, the most enjoyable part is knowing that i have helped someone with any issues that they called about."
good,"I was responsible for Sales and Customer Service. I offered checking, savings, CD's, Line of Credit, Auto Loans and IRA's. I was responsible for seeing that the consumer and business clients were receiving the product and or services suited for their financial needs."
good,Not a bad place to work. Management up to executives are generally open door policy and willing to work with your needs/schedule. People here are what keep each other here (staff is awesome and fun).
good,"I actually really enjoyed being a Teller at Bank of America. I started out Full Time and once I joined Active Duty U.S. Army I started working Part Time (only on Saturdays because Mon-Fri I was on base). I loved getting to really know the customers that came to us, there really wasn't a bad experience for me."
good,Awesome place to work
good,"A typical day is meeting with co-worker virtually. Delegate work balance when someout out sick. Review all policies and procedure for updating, timesheet, approve high dollar transcations. read email and answer them, received or call back to customer or other business partners, scheduling one on one meeting. The hardest part of the job was training other business partner our line of business for the tax season. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowledging the assoicate when they have a WOW moment we would provide bart tickets, gift cards and just candy. Incentive to the associate at the end of the year was so full filling for me."
good,I learned about different types of mortgage loans and home loan modifications. Our job was to only provide home loan modification status updates for home owners. We took inbound calls from customers and lawyers. We would provide the management team with customer complaints in order to improve our services.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was that I could work from home.
good,The SVP was a great mentor and really appreciated her employees. She went out of her way to make you happy.
good,Overall it was a good experience. Learned some new technologies. Management was very helpful and had a good exposure to the project output. Though it was a small journey had much to learn.
good,"The work culture depends on your branch . There are some centers where employees work well together and others not so much as a team. Overall, the bank has policies you must follow and there’s no room for creativity.  There are departments within banking that does allow room for growth.  It all depends on an employee’s motive. The job security is there."
good,"I enjoyed working at Bank of America ,just sad that Mortgage no longer big department like it was 10 years ago "
good,"A typical day at work was very interactive. Had enough assignment to accomplish. Spent break time with colleagues exchanging ideas on work issues. Quite often, we usually assist each other in solving challenging issues."
good,If you like selling things then Bank of America is the place for you. Selling was the main focus of this job. You're treated pretty good if you're good at it but can stress you out if you're not.
good,"Overall experience was a delight. I loved working for bank of America. My banking center crew was the best in the region. But after my manager retired, everything down hill. The new management was poor and unprofessional. All the employees from my banking center were fired one after the other. Clearly politics came into play."
good,"Working for Bank of America was easy, you would take calls regarding accounts or if they were trying to get on to there online account you would help them out as well ask if there was anything else would be helpful for them."
good,"I'm a client service specialist II and I've been with BOA for almost six months. The training is first in a classroom setting for almost 4-6 weeks. On the floor for 2-3 weeks. I've worked in a call center environment for over 5 years. BOA has impressive training material and top-notch technology. The staff is patient and friendly with a strong will to help you achieve your goals. You will have to take assessments before you graduate but it won't be hard to pass if you're willing to pay attention and learn. I work in a positive work place where managenent are willing to work with you if you have the drive to succeed. "
good,It has been a very long time ago that I had worked there.. Since that time the branch i worked at closed. Our office was called the country club..lol There was only 5 to 6 people working there  and we were like family instead of  employees and manager.. We had a great bunch of ladies in that office.
good,Bank of America is a great company to work for. Benefits are great and work environment is casual and fast paced. Hardest part of the job is staying focused when the call volume is high and aggressive. I have learned to treat each person as an individual and not as a collective group in order to maintain a consistent positive performance.
good,Too much turn over. The managers have no say in day to day items. DO NOT get an account at BofA while working there!! Also you can not work remotely either.
good,The benefits are great but they want you to work for pennies. The environment is great. They have employee engagement events and the people are personable for the most part.
good,"We worked fast and I was multitask, training new employees, the management was really ok, multicultural and love to worked, the best part of the job is when we had to mail all the work."
good,The work environment is ever changing. In order to advance into higher positions within the Global Financial Crimes Unit you must know someone. Resume alone will not get you an interview.
good,Training is 3 months long which is not enough time to be comfortable doing the job. They more or less want you to dive into and ask questions as you go.
good,Good team but management was awful. Seemed like the branch was on its own with everything when it came to needs/issues but were still reminded about unrealistic sales goals daily
good,Learned a great deal of banking information and how to give best customer service over phone. People there were always nice and lunches and breaks were always fair.
good,"The job was very stressful due to not enough training also, every quantity driven, It should be quality not quantity. I feel that they should also, promote from within."
good,"Productive, fast paced, and fun place to work.  A typical day is answering inbound calls, assisting clients to help resolve all issues.  It's a constant learning position covering federal regulations. "
good,"Good pay, focused on individual goals more than group"
good,My role consisted of leading sales huddles a couple times a week. Managing sales reports and assisting branch manager with the daily business operations. Deepening relationships by connecting customers to sales specialists and offering appropriate financial solutions and services to both individual and small business clients.
good,the job itself as a teller is great just the sales part can be stressful but if you have a good team then it won't matter because they will want to help you. its just stressful trying to have 1 referral per hour especially since were understaffed.
good,"I enjoyed my ten years at Bank of America, the culture and the diversity is what kept me with the company. I enjoyed the culture until this year with the lack of career advancment."
good,"Fast Paced specially Friday, Saturday & end of the month. "
good,"Faced Paced/Multi tasking."
good,"If you have a family, don't bother. BOA does not pay employees what they're worth. This is a good job for a single person with no commitments or bills. The benefits are really good but it does not make up for such low pay"
good,"Overall a good place to work. They have great employee benefits and discounts. You also get paid holidays so that's a bonus. Scheduling can get hectic, but overall  nothing unbearable."
good,"Starting off young as a Client Associate after college is definitely a safe place to be and a well paying job, but it is almost too safe. What I mean by that is, that there is not a lot of challenge to be had. You go to work, do the job, and go home. If you are a real worker and a doer, than you probably wouldn't do well at ML as a Client Associate. Management, in my experience is alright. They hound you to get things done or when you do something slightly different from how they would, but god forbid you need them. The culture is good, but can definitely be better. Very male and primarily white; as most financial institutions are these days."
good,"BoA has numerous opportunities for a person to grow technically and on the business side. However, this would be a complete opposite of what may be considered a Start-Up culture."
good,"Working environment was great. Co-workers were really helpful and excellent team working ethics. The cons well, Management was asking for miracles when branches are located in a small town. Trying to sell products to clients that can barely make a credit card payment is outrageous."
good,Its a good company to work for as they care for the employees. I liked it when I could sit with a customer and listen to what their financial goals. Then as time goes by watching them achieve those goals knowing I was able to help them on their way.
good,"This place has so many different aspects to it. So does the business. There are a lot of moving parts so things feel so busy and never ending. Serious work environment, not fun. Boring. If you are an creative soul you wouldnt like it. Its strictly business and its all about the money nothing else. Its slightly one dimensional."
good,"I gained most of my experiences from this institution. Many days were hectic and worked under a lot of pressure. Now, pressure is a skill that I learned to manage by experience. I over looked many employees to maintain an environment that is calm and running smoothly. Work place was very professional as were all the employees that worked with me. Hardest part of the job was getting a hold of the proper management to address customer concerns. This is why I learned to resolve issues and handle them to the best of my knowledge and authority. The most enjoyable part of my job was working among people that had the same goal as me. It was to get the production we had out as fast and efficient as possible and always stayed on top of satisfaction."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, servicio al cliente, el site no era lo ideal pero el trabajo no era complicado"
good,"I would start work early because I am a morning person and love to get to work early because I always got a lot of work done. I was a data entry specialist and was able to be very productive. I started off at Bank of America in the Bankruptcy department, then a different assignment brought me to the Credit Reporting department. My third assignment at Bank of America was for Lien Release specialist"
good,"Bank Of America is a great place to work, depending on the job/ position most are great work life balance. "
good,"A typical day at this bank would be about 200 transactions.What I learned at Bank of America are the services they offer, and real sales experiences. The environment of my job as a teller was very team oriented also management was very helpful always. The hardest part of the job was when there were very few tellers and a line going out the door. This job can be very stressful when there was very few tellers on line. What I most enjoyed about being a teller  was I had fixed hours and the amount of support everybody had within each other."
good,No comments i have no words to say about Bank of america.Even I worked for so many years they could not take care of my account.Blamed me for someones hacking.
good,"it's ok. Company needs to learn to engage their employees more. Nothing bad to say. "
good,"I would say its a good place to work however they practice""doing more w/less"" meaning most times you're expected to do several jobs while only receiving one pay. And the raises aren't that great. But atmosphere is great and the management is very helpful and trains well. You will definitely learn alot and the benefits are great."
good,"Work can be pretty hectic, attention to detail is very necessary. doesn't work if you're a single parent. 20 hours isn't going to cut it. Great boss and coworkers!!!"
good,"As a small team It was great workplace,however the back up related to solving problems(customer) wasn't great."
good,"Typical day; get coffee, look for emails that have come in and get started on calls.  Learned; you can really help someone who is need by being proactive.  Management; was helpful and would listen to other ideas.  Co-workers; were fun to work with.  Hardest;  when couldn't help someone. Enjoyable; hanging up the phone with having accomplished helping the customer with their needs and educating the customer on other things as well."
good,I loved working for BOA. All of my co workers were wonderful. The environment was happy & my customers made it for a great day at work.
good,"it's a chilled to work for but not much learning for a fresher. it's good"
good,not a bad company to work although most of the perks have vanished since being sold to bank of america but overall a good company to work for.
good,Fun work place with a variety of managers making it easier to learn from different styles of collecting. Benefits were pretty good and the bonuses were great prior to the company doing cutbacks and new rules coming into play preventing employees from getting their bonus.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job were the customers. I enjoyed being the change in someone's day, changing someone's bad/negative mood into a positive one."
good,"This was a call center that I worked for so it was a lot of dealing with the exact same problem again and again, just with a different person involved each time. It takes a lot of patience."
good,"I learned everything I know about banking, mortgage, credit, underwriting."
good,Great company if you get in to a good department. Oppourtunity for advancement everywhere. Layoff's often. Get a good starting salary annual increase is very small
good,"Great company! Bank of America had plenty of room for advancement. However it's whom you know. Everything is based on Productivity, vacation and seniority."
good,"Great place to work but once you get promoted to higher position like manager.  Be careful..you might not last long in that job.  Also, manager does not get paid for overtime or extra days worked."
good,"Bank of America is a good work place in a great location (95 Wall St)."
good,"review customer accounts, make daily deposits, withdrawals, check cashing and intreating daily face to face with customers."
good,"you learn new things everyday, a good enviroment to work in, very proffesional and best management"
good,When Training it's nothing similar to on the floor materials and hardware resources.
good,"Cleaning was the key factor of this job."
good,"My first 5 years with the company were great, I started part time while going to college and they were very flexible with my scheduling and have great benefits such as tuition and day care reimbursement and paid time off. I enjoyed most of my co-workers and management. I was adequately trained and promoted quickly. And even though it can be difficult working for a company with a wavering reputation I felt it challenged me to be even better at my job. When we transferred to this area I was forced to take a demotion, was passed over for promotions several times, and received minimal pay increases. To my surprise, I was dismissed for violating an ""attendance policy"" that I had never been made aware of while taking care of my sick child while my husband was deployed overseas. Subsequently my position was eliminated at the banking center."
good,It is a team environment and every day is a learning experience.
good,"Politics always get on the way, but overall Bank of America has a well establish business structure. Excellent benefits but the pay could be definitively improved."
good,I am working there in Bank of America for more than an year. I never get stressed at work. Awesome work culture. Lot to learn at work. Flexible deadlines at work
good,"Processed all stock market purchases for stock brokers. Interacted with customers on a daily basis.  Maintained customer's records.  Processed stock certificates, stock bond and treasury notes."
good,"The typical day on this banker job , opening banking center and closing , preparing customers entry to their accounts "
good,I like BoA as they implemented cutting edge technologies when it looks promising to deliver their needs
good,"This was a fast-paced Mortgage and Bank environment. The focus was the customer's satisfaction. A typical day was communicating and advising customer's about home retention solutions. It was important to advise and communicate effectively about options available. First we must determine if their hardship was long-term or short-term. This was done by finding our their ""reason for delinquency."" Was their a: Job loss, death, divorce, or loss of hours on their job? Once this is determined we must request financials and supported documents such as: a hardship letter, paystubs, bank statements, income tax returns, pension etc. this information would be faxed or sent in through express mail within a specified time frame. I used several bank applications and surveys to update current information on each account. Each call made inbound or Outbound was monitored by a ""Quality Monitoring Specialist."" The hardest part of the job was making what we called the ""hard conversation"" of advising the customer they are ""not qualified"" for a particular program. Management encouraged breaks to allow employees to detox or unwind after a difficult phone call. My co-workers and I encouraged each other after a hard call or a successful quality score. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding out a customer qualified for a modification and was able to keep their home!"
good,Was a great place to work at. Very busy enviorment. I loved working there
good,"They paid me to relocate to Jacksonville, then 3+ months later laid me off. It was 2008, so end of job and career."
good,"I assisted customers that have defaulted on their mortgage loans, take payments, refer for modifications, data processing on company applications which was up to 5+ including MS Outlook, etc."
good,Review accounts buy understanding a typical spending patterns.

good,"Bank of America is a good plave to work for, good for a young person looking for a career in the financial world. Great place to make a career"
good,"One of the largest financial institutions in the U.S. A typical day at work was always fairly fast paced. Some of management were positive, helpful and always looking to help employees further their career within the company, others not so helpful. Must be dedicated and organized, mistakes are easy to make. Most enjoyable part was customer interaction."
good,"Worked as a tech person inside a line of business that helped me learn the business and how it meshed with technology. Responsible for entire BI application  - i.e. Business Objects. Worked on ETL modifications. Team management was the best I have ever had at this point - that is, before moving out of the line of business, Most difficult? Learning a very complex business and fast as possible."
good,"A typical day at work was to run my morning Pipeline and see who needed to be call during the day to supply customer with status on their loan applications. I would then see what loans came out of underwriting and what emails that I received that contained conditions. "
good,"Check my office pipeline work on loans in which are in the position to close . also keep clients informed thorughout the process by calling them once every 5 days. i have learned the skill of customer service as well as keeping my files neat for review.Submitting completed applications and confer with underwriters to aid in resolving mortgage application concerns. "
good,"Very good company to work with, especially for students just leaving their undergraduate programs."
good,Take all incoming calls to better the customers service experience and troubleshoot online issue with the customer.  Very structured enviroment with little interaction with co-workers.  Rewarding at times but can be very mundane as well.
good,"Overall, working here was a great learning experience. I would say there was a severe lack of communication when it came to training and just day to day information as well. My manager was great though and genuinely showed cared for us as his team."

good,Learn main controls of processes in the bank and ensure they meet bank and regulatory requirements
good,"I felt appreciated, I felt my opinions did not go unnoticed, and my co-workers are all wonderful to work with, Hardest part if the job was making quota at time because at time management would assume that numbers they received from other states from the company would have to be the same.."
good,"A positive experience, in terms of felxibilty"
good,Enjoyed the work hours and mamagement.. Compensation and benefits is a work in process.. Bank of America was new to the mortgage modifacation process when I started in 2010
good,company has great benefits...love the working environment

good,The most enjoyable part of my job is providing excellent client service.
good,Work at home program is great if your position allows for it.
good,"- Worked most of my days in a cubical, able to work from home at time which provided a flexible schedule."
good,"Typical day is routinely opening branch, counting money, balancing, balancing; I learned people and money are not my favorite combination. Management has its ups and downs they attempt to create a great culture but the work ethic is slave-mentality type. You could be vomitting at the desk and you'll still have to beg to go home sick! Co-workers were very helpful, involved with helping others succeed. Hardest part of the job is the pressure to count a bucket full of ones with 15 minutes to close and you know you've got a mess to balance before going home. Most enjoyable part of the day seeing a customer that you enjoy interacting"
good,As a large corporation Bank of America is a great company. They do take pride in providing amazing benefits to associates as well as creating a good work-life balance.
good,Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a great work/life balance program that allows employees with children to divide their work schedules and maintain a home life.
good,"Bank of America has awesome benefits with flexible work schedules, but if you're not interested in or strong at sales, you need not apply."

good,There is potential for career advancement if interested. Benefits are great. They have so many services and discounts available for employees. Flexible shifts are available making it easier to for those who have kids.
good,"I had the best job. The pay was very good , I wish the company was still open. It was a good job to get I liked the team building is great. Im not sure what else."
good,"Some days were slow and some very busy. Management was good to work under, very hands-on to their employees.They would recognize employees for doing a good job Good health benefits"
good,Bank goes through different changes. great opportunity to grow and learn in the dept. take advantage of the changes to learn and gain more knowledge to become successful.
good,"Bank of America was a wonderful company to work for over my 25 year career with them.  They provided their employees with great benefits, opportunity to grow, compensation, etc.  However in the last 2 years of employment there, senior management changed and the culture shifted away from the customer and employees to sales, sales, sales.  Morale had dropped and jobs were being eliminated.  employees were leaving.  A very noticeable culture shift for sure."
good,"Great managers, great place overall. Can be challenging at all levels. Learned a great deal in regard to the meaning of what it takes to not only survive on Wall Street, but to also succeed."
good,"Good company and great co workers ..i have advanced quickly just looking for something closer to home and a new start. Paid time off, vacations, and holiday pay all great!"
good,"Bank of America was a very big company.  The company in general is great.  They provide great benefits and compensation was fair.  The only issue I had with Bank of America, wasn't really an issue.  The company was just so big.  There were 7 sites across the country that performed the same job function that my department did.  That being said, it was easy to do things differently than the other sites, and trying to agree on a process with 7 other sites, was sometimes challenging.  Making a difference there was hard for those reasons. Overall, the place was great.  The company did a great job with trying to make a happy culture."
good,It is a great company to work for but there are not many opportunities outside of the Financial Center. It is challenging as we have high goals but I love the relationship we create with customers by helping them with their financial needs.
good,Helping out customers with their needs. You will learned a lot of things. Management is OK. A very busy environment at all times no matter what time of day it is.
good,"I worked for Bank of America from 2005-2007.  At the time, they set you up with very good training and give you the tools to succeed."
good,"Nice office environment, don't have a lot of supervision if you do what you are supposed to do."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance- very stressful-under staff- "
good,"I have been dependable and really reliable, have been willing to work on various projects that were provided within the years with Bank of America.    Have liked the people I worked with and am a team player"
good,I enjoy working more in business transactions. Maintain friendly and professional costumer service. Real nice co-workers.
good,"Very productive, Sometimes stressful, Management very helpful, Current job role very informational and challenging but I've learned a lot. I appreciate being picked for this job."
good,"Very busy, processing and answering and making call to customers, Management went above and beyond, Co-workers where very nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was when I got the opportunity to get a new position with very little training. The most enjoyable part of the job was I got the opportunity to help customers."
good,A great company to work for. Well helped customers stay current on their credit card accounts by offering new options and cross-selling new products to balance their debt and life benefits.
good,"I worked on large teams for each project.  Over the course of 5 years, I worked with hundreds of different people.  That's a lot of personalities to deal with.  Sometimes it wasn't easy dealing with certain people who were difficult to work with.  Half I could see face to face and the other half worked in another state or India.  You were expected to work 9-5 M-F which was nice so not a lot of overtime which left time for a life outside of work.  I was constantly learning while there.  You could make a difference if you wanted by going above and beyond what was asked of you.  They were open to new technologies so my skills did not stagnate.  Co-workers would feed off and learn from each other.  There were a lot of meetings and often I had to multitask which lowered my productivity."
good,Bank of America is technically a great company to work for and they have a lot of great programs to help out. There are a few managers who are significantly under-qualified for their positions and that is what began to make certain things difficult within the company.
good,"There are endless opportunities here to grow. However, as a company BOA tends to treat employes as seat holders not valued employees. There are managers here NOT leaders and  a mass of other little concerns I have for the company."
good,"Highly experienced customer service professional . Able to handle a high volume of customer calls in a fast paced environment, within minimum supervision , while maintaining emphasis on the highest quality of consumer service . Excellent listening skills , oral and written communications . Comfortable in interacting with all levels of organization and public ."
good,I have been working for Bank Of America for 8 years and I have learned so much in Customer Service and now in Sales.  Bank Of America  is a very stable company and I would recommend anyone to work there.  My job requires excellent customer service and sales to BOA credit card holders.  I enjoy my co-workers and enjoy treating people over the phone how I would like to be treated.
good,A typical day is having our morning sales meeting then getting our day started. Observations are made weekly to give best demonstrated practices
good,"Great job, challenging work, great environment, constant change, needs improvement on the work/life balance for managers."
good,I enjoy working with people and helping them meet their financial needs.
good,"A typical day at work at Bank of America Peabody is very fast paced. We are placed in the middle of two big shopping malls as well as many other shopping plazas. My position allows me to bounce between being a banker and teller, so I'm always wearing my ""roller blades"". Some significant qualities I've learned at BoA is the importance of communicating with your teammates, especially since I bounce back and forth it is essential to the success of the branch that everyone is working towards the same goal. "
good,"great pay and benefits "
good,Take calls and try to educate the population as to how the world runs and aid in filling a claim.
good,"Fast paced working environment that made you stay on your toes, fun at times when the line was not out the door. Co workers were amazing, everyone stuck to themselves and got their job done. Had few responsibilities such as, opening and closing the bank, counting the vault, opening new accounts for clients and over looking some staff members."
good,A typical day was when we walked in the door and logged on to computer we pulled up our work assignments. After that we sorted them  and began to process one by one .
good,Bank of America call center was an excelent place to work I learned to sale and be positive and modivated.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to land the sale when you work so hard for it but you offer come that by trying different things and doing it on each call. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and especially the customers wowing the customers and having excelent customer service.
good,"Responsible for handling customer transactions at banks, including taking deposits, disbursing cash, opening accounts, and investigating fees."
good,"Bank of America was a great experience, it was my first call center job however I did adjust very quickly to the demand of the call volume. "
good,Deadline driven environment. I processed work on KXT  and  Opex  machine operating experience as well. I worked in our whole-sale  billing for the company clients which required great attention  to repetitive detailed information. I have over  13 years banking experience. We had an awesome team work environment working together to accomplish our daily deadline to meet company expectations. Management was informative and fair with all associates concerns and was able to adapt to change. The most enjoyable experience was rewards and recognition for outstanding performances of each associate.
good,I helped my manager get ready for audits quite often and was their go-to person when that time came around because I knew the banking center and the audit requirements in and out. 
good,Go in at 5 am look to new Loans that are assign to each employee every day. Look up whick State there in and start calling New loans. I learn that every Bwrr has a different senario that I have to help the property owner understand what is in there best intrest. I work in a call center envirment that I can ask the Co-worker that has been on the job longer than I have any questions about certain proceedures that I don't understand and they will assist me. The most hardest thing about my Job at BofA is trying to advise the homeowner to sell his or her property due to the fact that they just can not afford the property any longer
good,Learned how to respond and reslove client's queries ontime and with given TAT
good,"I am a teller in a bank of america branch in Metro Atlanta. Overall, I think my compensation is pretty proportionate to the work that I do. This job is not for someone that does not pay close attention to details. One small detail could turn into a MAJOR mistake in the following days. Because of this, I was often stressed in my first year as a part time teller. Also, as a part time teller, I am NEVER AFFORDED A WEEKEND OFF! I have to work extended hours on Fridays and come right back to work from 8am to 1pm on Saturdays. While I was made aware of Saturdays when interviewing I was not informed of the 10 hour Fridays before. Other than that, I like my job. However, as a soon to be college graduate, I am looking for opportunities where I have more freedom with my weekends."
good,BOA was a fine employer. Will most definitely work for them again if the chance presents itself.
good,"A great company with great benefits, I was able to learned the importance of balance company requirements and customer satisfaction through the day. The hardest part of my job was no able to help the customer as I wish I code. The most enjoyable part of the job was to have the trust relationship with the customer."
good,"My schedule was set from 9-5 Monday through Friday which I loved. I worked in a branch of about 9 employees. I opened new checking, savings, IRAs, mortgage and credit card accounts for existing and potential clients. I also supervised the tellers since there was no teller supervisor at the time. Most enjoyable part about my job was the location which was downtown and meeting all kind of people as well as celebrities. The hardest part was getting customers to open new accounts. I got a lot of referrals from working at that branch and people would always compliment me on my business attire. I thought that was pleasant."
good,It is a seasonal position where I work like every other month.
good,"It was a relaxed, yet fast paced environment.  The branch I worked for was an amazing branch, great people. They were understanding and very patient.  The management at the branch I worked for was wonderful."
good,typical day at  work 2 tellers and more than 600 transactions a day no brakes and if  is necessary we cut the lunch time to help the customers. and some times we need to find the time to go to the restroom
good,The harderest part of my job is to not be able to see the clients relationship as a whole.  Build a trusted relation with the client and not being able to sustain it.
good,"I worked in the vault, it was in a very discreet location. We handled all of the commercial transactions. It was a fun, but very dirty work environment."
good,"Co workers like me most had been laid off from previous job. Good upbeat personality and very helpful. My area I was in there is no advancement or to expand with job growth to move one to.. "
good,"* Fast past "
good,"this is an ok place to work.  they take care of their employees but the management is just as lost as the employees,  I liked the job but the amount of calls they receive is ridiculous!"
good,"I have worked with Mortgage and ATM-debit fraud. I enjoy customer service with Bank of America and I enjoy the volunteer activities we can sign up for.  The atmosphere in the call center is great. A company of many changes, you just have to be ready for the changes."
good,Great company to work if looking for full range of benefits. Great team environment and constant unnecessary job reviews that hardly ever lead to any promotions or raises. There seems to always be an urgent meeting to attend.
good,"I had great times at bank of America, the work life balance. It is a great company to work for! I appreciated working for a great company. Everyone should apply!"
good,The company was big on providing good customer satisfaction but with change in interest rates because of customer behavior changes   and customer complaints with our mandatory cross selling of products we had to do. Made this very challenging to please each and every customer i did well but company focused more on making money than really helping the company
good,"In order to bring better service to Bank of America, we must have better communication. I took a 6 week class on how to be a Representative for the Call Center, but when I got on the floor, the Floor team member told me to forget everything I just learned and just stick to the book. I understood everything in that class, but then I completely went blank after that Team Member said that. I again felt in the way and of no use, I did my job to the best of my ability remembered what the class told me and forgot what that Floor Team Member said. I think if you are going to be on the phone there has to be more Team leaders to be available for the Representatives in order to provide fast and efficient service. Most of the customers I dealt with were angry and anxious to get off the phone. The Automated system is going crazy and driving the customers crazy that they are leaving BOA when it should be a direct line to the Call Center Office. After All you are Representing America Because it is called Bank of America. Peace is what we bring. That is why it is important to make sure every call and every person is satisfied with our service. There should be a survey after every call, and if unsatisfied, direct call to the Manager. Not enough managers on the floor brings unhappy Customers. We are the land of the free, we must bring service with a smile."
good,excellent benefits great work life balance as well excellent growth opportunities for employees within the company.
good,"Answered incoming calls regarding credit card accounts, also promoted balance transfers and direct deposit offers as well as offered products to card holders. The hardest part of the position was meeting the metrics. BofA would like for us to keep customers on the phone as long as possible, so the less calls we took, the better our metrics were."
good,I was with the bank for years and I enjoyed the work. I really loved the overtime!!!
good,"Get into work, get coffee, read and or reply to emails, and begin my daily task of quality checking affidavits and or attending meeting if scheduled."
good,Great job.  Worked high end assistant to many corporate executives in addition to my manager.
good,I gain a great amount of knowledge in real estate. Everyday I look forward going to work just to learn something new...
good,Led a team of 10 employees on day to day functions in regards to account reconcilement. I learned how to manage. I work with great team players. I enjoyed working with committed and dedicated people.
good,"Work with great people in a positive environment. A typical day for me is making phone calls for 8 hours a day, attempting to collect on delinquent credit card accounts. I learned to manage my day more efficiently during my time at Bank of America. The management and my coworkers are all great."
good,"Exploring new opportunities; implenting new standards, complementary transportation"
good,"Bank of America is a well driven , goal orientated with productivity at its core value . Being a former associate at Bank of America I have leaned that time management is essential and customer quality is important to deliver good customer services experience."
good,Bank of America is a good place to work. Management is average. The call center in Tempe that I worked at had a good environmnent for the people that I worked with.
good,"Very nice company to work for, was the biggest! Was striving to be the Best!"
good,"I've gained great experience here at Bank of America. Especially in the fraud field. You learn a lot about protecting not just customers, but your own information. Great people to work with and managers that will push you."
good,Bank of America gave me many opportunities in different positions within the company. It had great growth potential. Management was great and very flexible with hours. Lots of Overtime as well
good,"This job is fast paced, but I was privileged to work with some excellent teammates. We worked together, and everything was a team effort. Good pay, good benefits. One of the best management teams."
good,The daily task was very fast but easy it required that you be very prompt and fast at completing each account but it was a pattering you could adapt to daily
good,"The micro  management is insane. They are always moving people around so it causes customers to get angry (they don't like change), and take it out on you. You have to be willing to deal with the ""change"" when they come up with a new way of doing things. Nothing last forever. They want you to do this, they stress it then let it go a year later. Some of the managers they had were a joke. I don't even know how they became managers."
good,"The teller line team very helpful and productive. Stressful paydays and almost the time regular days too. It is really hard to work but with the right help from your team, their is nothing impossible."
good,This was a great job. Bank of America had great benefits and great pay. This company also had daycare for their employees. You could also open an account with them as well. I worked at a campus
good,"I was the Teller Supervisor for a very large bank and I was responsible for all of the tellers and making sure they meet the required business goals set forth by the bank.  I was responsible for wire transfers, all armored truck cash intake and also transferring out of large sums of money.  I was responsible for maintaining all bank records and making sure policy was followed and all records were properly maintained for yearly audits that I was held accountable for.  I also maintained the ATM machine and do a daily audit on it and was responsible for recording and forwarding all deposits that came through the machine and filling it daily with cash.  I worked very closely with the Branch Manager to make sure all policies were being followed not only by staff but required training that staff was responsible to be up to date on.  The hardest part of the job was meeting goals that the bank had set forth as there was a very high demand for selling products and if those goals were not met, it reflected in bonuses and possible loss of job."
good,"Environment is awesome.  Support is awesome.  Traini g is excellent.  Goals are continuously increased by a sizeable amount.  Policies are ridiculous.  understandable strict fed regs.  But compensation for excellent customer service is lacking unless you Are well over 100% of your qtrly goal.  In this case there are qtrly bonuses.  These bonuses are based on many factors.  They also have decreased over time.  So reaching 130% goal you might get 3000. 00 before taxes.  Now you might get 1500.  Constant changes in policy and procedures also hinders you from keeping on top of everything.  Very easy to get confused or mistate something when change is so constant and inevitable.  .  every mistake is written up and fired after 3. No room to be human. Its very frustrating when you love what you do. Finally,  you are critiqued very closely.  Big brother is always listening.  Time off phones is extremely closely monitored.  Feel guilty for going to bathroom.  "
good,my manager was awesome i loved working there i even offered doing over time
good,"Its really a good company ""Bank of America"" is... I got a lots of idea and many opportunities apart from my process.. we are co-operate in any fields structures etc..."
good,Fun environment and great pay....They have strict guidelines such as code of ethics but for the most part fun
good,Bank of America' s core values include working as a team. Every employee worked as a team including the highest level of management.
good,"Typical day starts at 8AM. I would begin my job duties and process paperwork and continue with that until my day was over at 4:30PM. The majority of my work revolved around legal paperwork ensuring accuracy from the company's attorney's office before the documents were used in court. I would also coorespond with said attorney's office to drive the population and reconcile the pipeline of paperwork. Management there is great- very friendly, personable, easy to work with/for. The co-workers are also very similar to management. It's a young atmosphere there- I'd say the adverage worker there is between 25-40. The hardest part of the job is the monotony. The oppertunity for advancement is lacking and the doldrums of the foreclosure business wear on you. Having to pay to park was also fairly rotten. The most enjoyable part of the job was the consistancy of the hours, people, and dependability of your looming day."
good,"IF your committed to the Bofa, Bofa will be committed to you."
good,Good place to work and build a career.  Hardest part is moving on to get experience in a different part of the company than where you were hired and getting raises
good,Best job I have ever have in years this place train you to be the best image for their company. Would recommend it to anyone that is willing to gain experience.
good,"Well, I would say we used to face hardest part every day we start the work but I used to enjoy too. Doing something which has never been done before Or I would rather say, Doing something which other say "" No it is not possible I can't do that. Doing such things was a really piece of daily job and I really used to enjoy that doing. I did fail doing such things couple of times but then after I never turned back soon after it became like a daily habit."
good,A typical day consist of processing incoming mail and verify the information is correct and deposited to the correct account.
good,"I love working there."
good,"I love the work place at BAC in Addison Texas."
good,"My overall review of this company would be that it was a very fast past enviroment and rewarding. Positive and passionate, it was a quick learning process, efficiency, management was timely and organized. A great team enviroment. There was many departments to change over to with open door policies and guidelines."
good,fast paste environment with lack of room for growth. Bank of America didn't offer bonus. The managers I work with didn't take the time to help you grow at Bank of America.
good,I happened to have a really nasty manager who does not work for the company any more. She and the pay were what ultimately made me leave. Believe it or not very stressful job.
good,There is no advancement in careers with the bank unless you want to play office policies. The management sucks. The CEO doesn't care about the underdogs.
good,The management you end up with as you change roles and climb in your career is a literal roll of the dice. Just like in any massive company you have great managers and absolutely horrible ones. The balance is in making sure the horrible ones don't run off the talent.
good,Over all Bank of America is a great place to work. The department I currently work in is a very high stressed environment. It makes you work harder to gain knowledge and post out after a year.
good,"Nice environment, because professional staff looks out for each other.  Not compensated, when asked to take on other roles that you weren't hired for."
good,". Filling tax returns into the system"
good,Working in a call center change is constant. The easiest  part of the job is requesting documentation of the customers financial situation. The most difficult part is telling a customer when they can no longer afford to reside in their home and must consider liquidation options.
good,Management  did not manage checks were always wrong aot of gossip but not from co-works alone but MANAGEMENT themselves
good,"Very cookie cutter approach to customer specific issues, so most customers leave unfulfilled."
good,Busy. Constant communications with clients to care for their needs The important thing to learn was to follow through on the work and try to anticipate the needs of the client. Work culture of the personal was very good. A team for all.
good,"greet customer, provide great customer service to anyone who approached teller station. Cashed, deposited, checks throughout the day. I learned a great deal of providing customer service, learning different systems to conduct transactions. the hardest part of the job was safety. The most enjoyable part was working with a great team."
good,Really didnt enjoy the culture.  Very sales oriented job but the potential is unlimited.  Joined the wrong team and due to my inexperience lost a lot of my book to them.
good,"Bank of America is a global corporation that is very well known and reputable, but as an employer they are cold and faceless. Each employee is a number. In the mortgage division, I did not have a supervisor or manager I could speak with face to face. If a customer needed to speak to my supervisor, I transferred their call to a group of people I had never met. The insurance covered quite a bit, but my salary was much less than desirable."
good,Get to the centre have a sit and start encoding every transaction the bank received from the customers.Co-workers are very nice we did not have time to speak. Easy job. The most enjoyable part of these job is that the co-workers get a long with each other.
good,"the management and VP are ok, departments are great, you have to pick and choose co workers, however that's anywhere."
good,"Overall, Bank of America needs to see the value of the employees especially those with completed degrees. They constantly dismissed the suggestions and would put down the employees"
good,"Work as a contractor for SkillStorn, Work week was 40 hours per week maximum, 10 days PTO per year.  The only thing I didn't like was the force unannounced 80 hours furlough each year, a little rough if you budget your expenses."
good,"Fast paced work environment that was more focused on production than employees.  Unfriendly management.  Did not include temporary staff in company events.  No talking, just production focused."
good,The bank was very nice but I want to growth my carrier so that's why I am searching for new job...  And one more thing the bank is very useful to my personal and professional life...
good,Through my corporate experience I have learned how to develop mutually beneficial networking relationships.  I learned how to overcome challenges and achieve my business goals.
good,"Bank of America does not value their employees. In addition, there is a lack of structure and expertise in certain business areas."
good,"I was working when they won the award to the best company 5 years in the roll. They spend alot of money on security and development of new strategy and design, However when the development and design is implemented there is no place to go."
good,Working with bank of america gave me a lot of oppertunity to learn about different line of business. work under different leadership and help to grow in to your career.
good,review loans for work completed and monies paid 0 balance out the claims by researching invoices jobs completed and ensuring they were in compliance with all investors contracts.  Management and contracts updated information per service agreement.
good,A very fast paced office.  Had a variety of loans and management who was willing to help
good,Great job in the project management field 100% travel was great.
good,A good place to work but job is stressful.. during my time at this company i was  moved  to other position  that I did not apply for and the position i applied for  was told not qualified for.
good,"Bank of America gives great opportunities for advancement but fail to recognize the hard work of their staff. It is all about the numbers, not about the people."
good,"I left Bank of America due to me relocating to New Orleans, La.  It was a stressful job but I enjoyed the people i worked with and they have become my family."
good,"Not much promoting from within.   Execs and mgmt coming from other banks are bringing a different culture that is different."
good,Work there on a temporary contract assignment. setting people up for mortgages under the new Obama mortgage program that was rolled out at the time...
good,"Good place to work as long as you are producing.  If you are salraied, expect to work over 60 hours a week.  If you achieve your goals and make a decent bonus, expect it to change so they do not have to pay it ourt in the future.  Look for them to change the rules in mid-year to their benefit."
good,"There was no typical day, as it all depended on the stock market.  I could either be slammed, or not have a lot to do.  "
good,"This is one of the best places, one can learn about typical banking solutions and terms. Vast curriculum for training on various banking products. Great learning place."
good,Long hours. The culture is to work non-stop. Most people are friendly. Management is very supportive and try to create opportunities for people to interact more. Expectations are high.
good,i feel like the brakes should have been 15 mins not 10 the reason being is having to clock in for brake and locking computer and then having to walk to the rest room. you would barely make it on time back.
good,"I loved working at Bank of America for a long time. They changed. It became more about sales and staying short staffed. It was more important to get sales than balancing your drawer. The last Christmas week, I was the only teller working at a busy banking center.It was difficult to give great service to a long line of people."
good,"Competitive, aggressive, with minimal interest from management into career development and advancement. No job security. Pays very well. Highly motivated and ambitious coworkers."
good,"Company strives for excellent customer service and has placed a strong focus on client relationships."
good,"Great Entry level position, learned management skills and got the experience I needed to move on to bigger and better company."
good,"60-70 calls per day Incoming calls in a call center environment for a variety of services including payments, statement explanations, and rewards redemption.  Evaluated on calls and customer feedback surveys."
good,The financial benefits are rewarding. However the job stability is not great especially when the market slows down. The bank has an excellent training system for new employees.
good,"My typical day is handling my accounts, interviewing and servicing customers for both mortgage needs and cross selling other bank products.  Soliciting for new business outside the organization to build referral sources and manage pipeline.  "
good,I was a temp worker there but learned a great deal about accounting and data entry while employed at this company. I was a fast learner and was even promoted on a quality management project to oversee other Mortgage Specialist Assisgnments.
good,"This was a nonpaid internship that is why I rated the company so low on compensation/benefits and job security/advancement because I do not know about its compensation plan."
good,good benefit but low pay with no room for grow if you don't know anyone
good,"Poor Management"
good,I love the benefits but no opportunity to advance. I am looking for opportunies for advancement
good,"I like the position and being part of the Indepedent Foreclosure Review process which is mandated by the OCC. Bank of America has many perks and is a good and solid company to work at. There was a very intelligent group of people picked for this review and I find the job to be interesting and a huge learning experience, especially since this was my first job with a bank rather than a private law firm."
good,"The firm has come a long way from its dark days. However, it has a ways to go before it can truly compete with JPM and even Wells who has its own issues. It is clearly burdened with multi cultures and the management does not seem interested in creating a familiar culture. I find that a shame for the firm is doing well, but could be doing significantly better. "
good,It's a good company to work but now it become like a consultancy where you only work work and work. Management also become robots who dont care their employees and their growth.
good,"They are pushy with sales. They have good technology, but lack the support from management. I learned a lot about banking from them. I also learned that I do not prefer to work for big banks again."
good,"The environment is a production based environment that is based on how much work is processed daily. The best benefits a person could ask for, several options to choose from."
good,"Back then, it was a nice company to work with because they give me an opportunity to obtain a good experience working in a financial institution. I'm not sure now, if they still offer that kind of opportunity i  appreciate everything that Bank of America for giving that good experienced in Banking Industry overall i don't mind recommending this financial institution. This is all i could say."
good,A very high pressured work environment and was paid fairly until recent years. We are working too many hours with no proper incentives in return. Enjoyed working with my direct reports but not with my manager.
good,Its a good company to start up with. The company provides good opportunity to learn a lot about banking. The hardest part of the job was the night shifts. The most enjoyable part is the learning that we get to know about foreclosure process (property).
good,Working here was very good. however the management was very terrible. I have heard that they have gotten new management since i left the work place so it may be different.
good,I enjoyed working for them. I received a lot of training on mortgages Supervisor wasn't attentive. It was a very relaxed work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about mortgages and closing them.
good,This company has provided me with my entire career. I believe in its future and executive leadership. There are great positives and only minor negatives.
good,"Arrive to work, secure banking center with routine check of all rooms, open all books and binders preparing them for the entries of the day, open the bank, assist customers with all transactions necessary and meanwhile push revenue for the bank by sales pitch of bank products, at the end of the day file all paper work necessary, do routine check once again, set alarm, and close the banking center."
good,The job consisted of assisting home owners with paying bill and seeing what  programs they Qualified for . They  have a heavy turnover rate.
good,"I have learned more about fraud strategies and behind the scenes with Credit card fraud, and I find it exciting to sop perps"
good,A typical day was receiving incoming calls from clients and resolving their issues regarding their mortgage.  I learned so much about mortgages and escrow.  I had several managers and was on different teams and they were each great.
good,"BOA was a good company starting out I worked there for, learned alot along the way. However the unexpected layoffs played an over all role on how I feel about BOA. Especially when we were consistanly told that we had a job up until the next."
good,"it was when we came to know that there will not be any inflow of work for next three months. I had to decide to cross train myself in some other project to be productive."
good,"Great Corporation, "
good,"Nice balance between work and family."
good,Demanding role with limited support to succeed.  Great life and knowledge experience but extremely difficult business model to be successful in.
good,the hours are great but you can never get a day off without using vacation time
good,"good people and environment; continual learning; enjoyed my tasks"
good,Best co-workers and willingness to share info and help each other.  Micro management
good,"Managing teller line as well as platform. I learned to lead and being a wise leader as well as, being fair. Management was terrible. I had to do my branch managers job because she was doing her church administrative work at work. So it put a strain on me. My co-workers were a good bunch but everyone felt the tension in the workplace and because of that sometimes it could be a bit rough. Hardest part of the job was getting my work done and my bosses work done as well. Especially when we both had deadlines and their was never really enough time. But as always i got it done 98% of the time. Enjoyable part of the job was bonuses and clock out time."
good,"My experience at Bank of America was mixed, the company it self was good to work for but the pay left much to be desired. The department I worked for did a lot to boost employee morale, until the head of the group retired."
good,"My employment at Bank of America was through a tempary service.  The work days were not staggered.  It was interesting work whereas I learned about how they processed the IRS tax payments.  The work was based on production.  The management expected you to learn the duties within two hours and not make any errors.  It was different, yet good."
good,"Within three years I have gained a lot of knowledge in different areas within Legacy Asset Servicing. The work flow fluctuates depending upon the assignments that are provided. Because of the economic downturn it is volatile in terms of layoffs and they are becoming ""mean and lean"" to become more competitive."
good,"You work 12 to 14 hour shifts; and you are assigned multiple systems to monitor at one time, and teamwork was lacking"
good,"Great work place, likeable management, learning different task with special projects. The hardest thing about the job is things can change everyday,have to be very open minded to change.Best part of working there is relax work environment"
good,"Great internship working in the Small Business Investment, focused on privately-held middle market companies. Great introduction into the world of sales."
good,I enjoyed being a teller and always seek ways to advance.Bank of America had alot of advancement opportunities.
good,"Great work enviorment, however can be difficult when it comes to life challenges to get off or to work around management."
good,A typical day at Bank of America was coming to work....going straight to your computer and starting your shift...during your shift you were able to chat with your team mates depending on your manager and who was around...you could snack at your desk if need be and NO CELL PHONES were allowed on the floor. The co-workers were great and very helpful if any help was needed. You also have a team meeting each week for a hour to discuss any issues or anything that was new going on with Bank of America IF they decided to tell you.
good,"Mediator between Bank of America, N.A and the buying party of real estate. Main responsibility: ensured that local, state and federal requirements are met and that all paperwork is in order to close a transaction. Managed a portfolio of approximately 200 files."
good,Great place for learning and developing new skill sets but management is not consist. Leaders do not have the skills to provide direction to the company.
good,"BACI was nice company to work for. There is a bit of bureacracy existence here however you will flourish if it is ignored."
good,Bank of America is a fast paced environment. A person has to learn how to be comfortable or already be comfortable with being in a customer service based environment. Being able to know how to hold a respectful and professional conversation is valued. Being able to manage stress and emotions is also necessary in this work place.
good,Good luck and try to advance because the pay is good in the dept if you can sale but turnover rate is high. Great benefits especially if you have a family.
good,"Management is not as helpful as they seem. Good benefits and average salary. Had to only submit 37.5 hours even if you worked longer. It was a very odd interaction when I was not told about the hour limitation my first week working there. Over time, when the office gives up on helping you advance, it turns into a dead end and endless amount of pettiness ensues."
good,Worked in several departments had really awesome managers and really awful ones. Pay was mainly competitive I realized once being out of there. Great benefits. Hard to move up.
good,"All said and done, they do try to keep employees happy.  There seems to be a bit of disorganization,  and even people responsible for putting new procedures into place and it is clear they consulted with no one from underwriting.  Big picture, they pay well and I am left alone as long as I am meeting production."
good,"Great place for new Grads,the company does a great job attracting the new Graduate students and compensation is pretty good.I belive the compensation is the best compared to it's competitors"
good,Great benefits but extremely faced past with minimum staffing. Tons of daily tasked but extremely goal focused. Vacation provided but limited to when you can use it.
good,"This was a great job because there was lots of opportunities, unfortunately my last position was terrible because of poor judgement and training from management."
good,"I am a contractor at BOA, so I have no access to benefits; BOA hires only from within and considers contractors outside vendors, therefore  job advancement is not possible as a contractor."
good,"Dealing with money all day long, learning how to process the currency exchange and what are everyday rates. learning a lot a bout security system and procedures."
good,"Working at Bank of America is more of a political job than a technology job. While the Bank regularly looks at the most cutting edge technology to implement into everyday work life, actually implementing that is basically an act of Congress. It is very frustrating to be inspired by creativity and then when you follow the path towards your solution, you are met with dozens of bureaucratic red tape steps. Then, something that you could have solved in an afternoon turns into a month-long affair."
good,"B of A provides a road map to success for every associate in every job family.  They have a ""play"" for every type of interaction leaving very little, if any, room for individuality and/or personality in their associates.  They divide their customer base into two segments; those they want and those they don't. All associates are expected to follow this segmentation and unfortunately, many of the hourly employees are left feeling that the very bank they work for, wouldn't want them as customers."
good,"I learned a lot from Bank of America.  However, they did layoff quite a bit.   I went from Collections to Bankruptcy Specialist 11.  I would consider working there again."
good,"Very difficult hurdles.  Can be challenging to get support."
good,"A huge amount of pressure on agents as well as poor work life balance, with yearly schedules and a lot of micro managing. Overall a very stressful work environment."
good,"The Financial Advisor Development Program (FADP) gives extremely connected individuals the chance to succeed, yet you have little to no chance of success without connections or being on a team."
good,"Good workplace environment and people. Poor promotional paths due to lack of clarity on ""band ""levels. Example includes ""Band 4s"" with indistinguishable qualifications as compared to ""Band 5s"". "
good,"A reasonably professional work environment. Tends to hire people with well developed professional level of skill and demeanor. The downside are a minority of employees who have been with the company for a long time and who have become immune from the pressure to be productive, helpful to others, and at times even civil and professional in their interactions with fellow workers."
good,"They are a good Company to work for, as long as you're ok with constant change in procedure and learning new tasks.  Very stressful, lots of goals, highly detailed, it was difficult job and they should be paying more for all the required tasks."
good,A typical work day consisted of processing mortgage loans and working over 40+ hrs a week.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that management allowed the employees to have flexible working hours.
good,"Good bank, but leadership was struggling with new strategic focus as they were very big bank.  The culture was one that was supportive at he SVP and EVP levels but it was hard to get initiatives through the bank President levels."
good,"Working at Bank of America is a little like working at a grocery store.  You help one client do something that they could easily do themselves, then move on to the next customer.  When you do discover a need, then it's time to refer them to a specialist.  I like that I really don't have to think, but it kind of takes the human touch out of the job when I'm never actually allowed to help customers with their needs."
good,Flexible work hours. Many benefits for employees.  Not a lot of advancement unless you have been there many years.  7 sick days a year.  2 weeks of PTO
good,"Being an employee at bank of America is great when the proper management team is behind that employee. There is advancement available, but experience in the position applied for means nothing if you are not associated and like by the hiring team."
good,It isn’t all that bad however I was not very happy here. Management did not managed the right way. It is not easy dealing with money 24/7. You must have your eyes open at all times. At the end of the day when you close register if you over it bad and if short it’s very mad.
good,"Typical day includes checking emails, answering all requests in a quick and correct manner. I enjoy the job and management. I love teaching our clients about the liens they have on their homes, how to have them removed and exceeding their expectations."
good,"OK pay and good benefits, but then you get the impression there is no where else to go.  Was promoted and then told I would not get the raise for the promotion for about 3 months.  Was denied a monthly performance bonus because the first 3 days of month was OJT.  3 days cost me 865 dollars.  Then in December I was top 3 of frontline collections and was told December does not count towards your yearly review, its just ignored, so all that hard work ignored.  And to top it all off they do not offer prorated raises for end of year if you started ""too late"" in the year."
good,The job was fun. The customers were interesting. Rank and file employees were supportive and interesting.  An immediate manager had few people skills.
good,"Great place to work, but lack of opportunities for advancement. I enjoyed working on the Foreclosure project which was initiated by the United Justice Department.  Eventually, the banks that were involved including Bank of America settled the lawsuit against them. Unfortunately, I had to leave because there was no alternatives on job placement at Bank of America."
good,"A lot of running around and also a lot of sitting down."
good,"When i first started I was a loan funder for the Mortgage Modifications. I loved it for 6 years but then the bank no longer need me so I was re deployed to Anti Money Laundry. It sounded like a great job but it was not.After 90 days over half the group quit or found something else.  We are now in a call center and the micro management is too much and my health was affected. I worked great for over 5 years but once I lost my mom to cancer in 2015 and they then transferred to the other dept was just to much. Cancer is awful and I was with mom my through the entire process.  I promise I will always work hard or let you know if I have concerns,"
good,"Bank of America is a large and dynamic company that is rapidly changing. Market, technology, and regulatory forces are driving much of the change. "
good,"Working with the bank was the best of my life. I woke up everyday with the city on my mind, and how I could listen to the people and what they had to say."
good,"this was long ago, but I have good memories.  mostly about the people I worked with.  very caring.   I enjoyed the customers and they liked me.  it was a fun job."
good,"Lerned several things from Bank of America, they gave me the push I needed to pursue a career in banking, it is a company that requires high expectation goals with-out proper resources and major cut backs on having staff on site."
good,Great place to work the people and environment was easy to feel part of a great team here.  The job work life balance was great and compensation was fantastic.
good,Who does not like to work with money all day long.  The only bad thing about that is that money is actually pretty dirty. Interesting people coming in everyday.
good,"the job actually taught me alot, oppurtunity to work on differnt projects and move around the company. no micro mange. set your own schedule. lots of fun events for employees"
good,"Another place that I would have loved to stay at.  I made great friends there.  "
good,"The CEO is getting rid of thousands of jobs, Bank of America employees are being squeezed from head to toe to do the same job with less resources (less employees) and the culture of the financial centers is not very motivating. The automation is taking over more quickly than it should and the customers complain about it every day. It is very difficult to deal with unhappy customers day in and day out when you are in a client facing position. In addition, it seems to be that the contact centers are also low staffed because clients are experiencing ridiculous hold times to speak with an associate to file a simple claim. "
good,"As a subsidiary of BB&T, we did financing for commercial loans in outdoor power equipment, and power sports.  I had great coworkers around me and a good atmosphere."
good,great pay and very secure but vision of the company and values have gone out the door. I would like to work with a smaller more intimate bank that cares about its customers on all levels.
good,chance to learn about retail bank product. High pressure sales. Some leaders lack professionalism. Can be a sexiest atmosphere.
good,Great place to work.  Good benefits and very team oriented in achieving goals.  I have enjoyed all my time working for this company.
good,this is a contract job which is why the review was very low. There is no job security no the option for benefits. those are two things that I am looking for with a company
good,"Comfortable environment were teamwork is highly emphasized and a must in order to be promoted further, if that opportunity ever arrives."
good,At Bank of America I have learned to be more efficient with time and management as it is a high-paced workplace. Many changes implemented that will definitely lead to more advancements in the near future.
good,Great bank but difficult to originate loans with hard guidelines and rates not competitive. Other aspects o Bank of America are really good
good,Could have done better with compensation and job security. The concept of meritocracy should be implemented. Too much unnecessary company politics.
good,"The company has many standards/policies/procedures in place that make refinancing difficult for customers and the process difficult for the employees. Great company, compensation adequate, however the turn cycle can be 12 mos or less."
good,"great ground work to start your own business! learned that working with and a $150,000 client can be more difficult than going after the $1MM client."
good,I loved the job i did and the people that i worked with. Can be a very busy enviorment. you can advance with hard work and determination. as long as you stay to yourself you will be fine.
good,"you dont mind having US citizens pushed out for then to import indians from India "
good,"Con: Manager lacks technical competence and management efficiency. "
good,"Reviewing loans, and processing them according to governement and Bank of America rules."
good,BAML has embarked on a global technology overhaul building out a proprietary set of tools to which all lines of business are moving onto.  This is an aggressive program of work that offers opportunity for individuals while also challenging the best resources due to the complexity.
good,"Financial Advising is incredible for those who can be productive without supervision.  You work your own hours and you don't have to be strapped to your desk at the office, but the bulk of your earnings come from commissions, which for some, is stressful.  The attrition rate is high, but those that are successful are greatly rewarded and are filled with intrepreneurial spirit."
good,"I love assisting our clients and providing a high level of customer service.  However, this is not what is valued in this department.  While the department is known as a ""service"" department, it is sales that are pushed for, sometimes to the point of badgering clients."
good,"My idea of a Manager is one that leads people and handles problems. My manager at BOA led problems and handled people."
good,"Never a dull moment, my co-workers make the day less stressful, the hardest part of my job is the work itself"
good,"Every good but not secured, I learn a lot and my co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of this job is the beginning of the month for statements and the Brokerage statement of Merrill Lynch."
good,"I love working for BOA, but I have never had a more miserable job than in the Consumer Marketing department. A typical day includes being on the phone being yelled at by angry customers for ten hours a day. While I am allowed breaks, even three hours at a time of being on the phones is enough to turn my brain to mush. The hardest part of the job is the repetitiveness and the fact that other than a paycheck, it is not rewarding whatsoever. There are bonuses, but they (like many other companies) do everything in their power to nit pick so you don't get a bonus. I have been working there 6 months, have met the sales goals all but one month, but due to reasons outside of sales goals have only seen one bonus. "
good,Had a really bad experience at the collection spanish group other deparments were fine to work for. Bofa has down sized a lot in the past year so job security right now is uncertain.
good,BOA is all about CHANGE!!!!! Alot of layoffs for both temps and permanent employees! A great income comining inbut not at all great stability for a homemaker!
good,Great company however due to the large size of the organization it was difficult to be noticed by senior management.
good,"A typical day of my work day is having direct customer contact and providing a great customer experience and offering of products and services."
good,"Overall the company was well rounded and you never knew what each group was doing."
good,"functional test, regressional test submit defect."
good,"A typical day at work for me is coming in pulling up all the systems that I need to work my files and take a look at my eamils. I review escalated files and urgent files and working them to find a resolution for both the company and the borrower. I learn many things about the real estate world and also life lessons from borrowers. The management is very production driven, the management has an open door policy and is there when needed. The hardest part of the job would be to listen to some of the stories that the customer provides as they are difficult and heart felt situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that i am in a role to where I am assisting people around the United States keep their homes."
good,"overall its a good comapny, the work is very easy to do and the people are nice"
good,Working with homeowners you get to see a different side of people. The hardest part was being the person that held the mirror for them. Forcing them to examine their lifestyle and to rearrange it. I enjoyed helping them find solutions that would help them.
good,a typical day will start i come in and check messages from the vocie mail and also check my email and processed new brokerage applications addressed clients complaints and orders answered phones made new appointments and confirmed appointments and also assisted broker with all clerical needs
good,No problems with the company love working for Bank of America!
good,"A typical day a work is very busy which I like, my co workers are awesome, the hardest part of the job is dealing with management, I have learned so much and truly grateful. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I am able to help someone reach a resolution."
good,"This was a very good job, that I worked in high school. I learned a lot about the loan process,and payoff methods."
good,Great place to work but no increase in pay. Wonderful parents and students. Communication level outstanding.
good,The company has a lot to offer but you have to get to know people in order stay around or they will throw you out...  Middle managers are to much out to prove and stomp on others while high management for the most part is great..
good,Bank of America is a great place to work for with branches all over. Most departments have flexible shifts and hours to accomadate employees with families.
good,A regular day at Bank of America is fast pace from the moment you set foot in to the branch to the moment you leave for the day. The company is great.
good,"This job was a temporary position for loan modifications. The purpose was to assist everyone that was losing their home by default due to the housing crash. This was painful, stressful and most of all not successful for the customers. But we did the job as requested. I worked overtime mostly every day. The pay was good at the time."
good,"I would rather not discuss , as any information regarding a day to day within in my function could be considered confidential. Thank you for understanding."
good,"Bank of America is a good place to work, if you want to advance your career you have options. Just perform at a high standard and participate in team activities and you can advance your career within Bank of America. Really the hardest part of the job is expecting great surveys from all customers."
good,It's a nice place to work but just unorganized.   I didn't have a permanent sit so everyday I was to look and stand and find a supervisor to find me a sit and head to look for work.
good,"With diverse operations, Bank of America holds numerous roles in need of filling within the company. Entry-level job candidates may work in customer service functions in call centers or work at branch locations as tellers and personal bankers. Interested applicants may apply online after utilizing the company website career search. Most entry-level positions carry very little in the way of employment requirements, as the jobs necessitate candidates stand at 18 years of age and possess a high school diploma or equivalent. Prior experience may prove beneficial, though not necessary to secure employment."
good,Enjoyed my time with Bank of America.  I am thankful for the skills I learned throughout my time there.  I appreciated they included the time I worked in Connecticut even though there was a couple of months between leaving CT and starting work in TX
good,Company is great. Employees are a little suspect though. They like to hire without mortgage experience but dont take the time to properly train the people to do the gmjob the right way.
good,Management was constantly changing which caused a rip in our teams effectiveness. The direction of the caompany is constantly changing as many jobs are being outsourced or elimintaed without warning. There are townhall meetings held that lack purpose.
good,"•	Assisted loan approval and processing with Underwriter or automated decision system. "
good,"The hours were really consistent within the call-center. The pay was good, with room for incentives based on add-on products. There were a LOT of new financial affiliations taken on at once without proper transitions, which caused a lot of stress on all employees."
good,the money that you could make here is great but the catch to it is that you have to meet unrealistic sale goal that youll see turn over happen often and dont let you be in a area where there is no traffic cause you will only last as long as it take to find someone to replace you.
good,"learning new policies and procedures, developing written documentation and training, teaching new and existing employees, learning computer systems and languages and using them to provide feedback to management, but constant travel while single parenting was too difficult for me and my daughter"
good,Good company to work for.  The projects they take on allow many different leadership styles to flourish.  The environment helps people relax as the jobs can be stressful.
good,"This is a good job to learn the banking industry. Make sure upper management has your back, if not employees can do whatever they want. Very high turnover manager left picking up slack. Managers be prepared to work i6 days a week open to close."
good,"In my departments, it was a promising interview session, and many promises made. As an employee gets into an agreed upon assignment / position, the situation was sometimes very different than promised. Inexperienced Managers and Trainers. Very good Wellness benefits, but career advancement and salary distribution was very selective to a  select group."
good,"As a company, it is a great place to work for, offering good benefits. and good training."
good,"I was there for 12 years even with all the layoffs they based it on numbers place was fair I did enjoy working there the benefits were worth "
good,Its been some time since I worked at BOA but I do remember it was a great place to gain top notch experience. Tasks were challenging but rewarding making it earlier in my career great training ground. During my time I unfortunately had a not so great manager. To counter that I had more good managers than the one that was not. You can learn a lot and be one of the best by learning resources and training provided.
good,Large company that could be much more efficient with less regulatory requirements for vendors. Improvement could be made by focusing on the end result and performance vs. checking to box for sometimes useless requirements. Too little value is placed on people - both employees and vendors.
good,I believe Bank of America is a perfect company to work for in order to learn about the banking industry. The management for the most part attempts to set you up for success.
good,"Most days were very busy and productive. Doing Collections you were always learn something new regarding procedures for different State Laws. "
good,A typical day at work allowed me to polish my qualifications and take part in opportunities to build my resume. This is an empowered atmosphere for driven and motivated people who will take the initiative on activities out of their role to grow and develop their business acumen.
good,"My self and many good people were laid off when MBNA was bought out by B of A.   Most people had been at MBNA for years and were paid much better than BofA employees for the most part.  THen, it was a financial decision to let the more expensive, but best performing employess go."
good,"Typical day starts with a huddle at the Banking Center. Then you do an hour call block to set apts for the following week. Meet with 2-3 clients per day. In between this you have a conference call with a partner, leader or your boss to go over pipeline (lending) and activities. Then you log your activities into Salesforce."
good,"From the top, leadership is poor and there is no focus on motivating employees to exceed.  The review process is flawed as you exceed at top 10%, or you are told you cannot possibly be exceeding expectations.  The process is built for mediocracy."
good,"Close place to work, nice co-workers,  stress regarding the volume of work,the supervisor helped a lot with jokes and lunches, good relations with all personal of department"
good,Bank of America was a productive and fast pace place to work. A typical day at work would be running different jobs and running and reconciling audits.
good,Companies today are diluting the workforce with contractors. it is important to allow contractors growth and similar workspace as every employee. Any employee at any company normally should accomodate the cultural needs of the company.
good,it is a very productive. The people there was very nice and the busisness was great.I wouldn't mind going back there. I met alot of great people there.
good,"The work life balance is great but everything else is subpar. Job security is lacking, there are few opportunities for advancement, and benefits are not great. Management is OK."
good,As this is a bank the compensation is low for many mortgage positions.  Not much of a gungho company.  Comfortable doing easy slow processes.  Very bureaucratic when trying to get things accomplished.
good,"They assisted me when I relocated to Texas to help find me temporary work until I could find full time employment. Management was excellent, I would highly recommend"
good,Quality work and good wok life balance. It provides a good domain knowledge thru various training sessions. It focuses more on increasing the functional knowledge of the associates
good,Working at in store branch was what made it unique. Working closely allowed us to get to know each other better. Assisting our clients was great and I got to know a lot of people in an individual basis.
good,"Not the position that was advertised/promoted. Not able to enjoy vacations due to sales pressures. Took a position as a small business banker, however, was forced to more over to customer service as a pilot team member. Not allowed to return to the role that I signed up for"
good,typical work day included networking for clients going to firm meetings. learned about wealth management process and culture of merrill lynch. hardest part of the job was client acquisition
good,Great place to work for the most part.  I was the only one laid off in my department in Jacksonville Fl with No prior notice.   Still have no understanding to why.
good,Great opportunity - Competitive and cut throat. During this day and age it is a tough industry to be in. Very competitive with other firms as well as poor training.
good,Very high turnover philosophy in a lot of departments and compensation is barely average for the position. Overall would not recommend this as a place to work unless you get into a sales position.
good,The job was very easy to learn. Some of the managers would send you mix messages either they want quantity or they want quality. They can be a great company to grow with.
good,"Do not wish to include this information "
good,"Overall the company is great to work for long term. The company is known for embracing different backgrounds and cultures. The day to day is fun and fast paced. However due to a constantly changing leadership, business strategies and goals communicated are not always communicated well."
good,ok place to work except late/sick policy. they have a exception policy that if you are sick two days in a row you get two exception. after third you are formally written up.
good,"great place to work, but the salary is not so good. Very wellknown company and lot of employees in that company is working over years. Heard its great company to work for."
good,Company did not pay all that well. The environment was fast paced and you get to meet lots of people. Must be good at up selling. Being very talkative is a plus.
good,The inconsistencies with layoffs and not knowing from one day to the next when you will be tapped has made it difficult to want to stay employed there and the Constant change in management with inconsistencies in leadership.
good,I worked graveyard so that was really hard the pay was good but honestly not worth it. Management was constantly on top of us to remind us we had to meet our daily goals.
good,"Great atmosphere, everything on one large campus. Management well organized and approachable. Unfortunately this was a short term opportunity. Overall a nice place to work."
good,"Work place culture: Professional/ maybe a casual day"
good,I loved being an insurance agent. I would go back to it today if it had regular pay and benefits. This is a great company to work for but your hard work is all you have as far as money goes.
good,"Workflow was there at times busy, however, managment need more training in order to know how to obtain resolutions for escalated incidents.  Co workers at times were friendly.  The hardest part of the job is having a lack of back up support from the management team."
good,"Excellent training, great co-workers. Managers were hard to communicate with. No opportunity to service customers.  A well-defined corporate structure."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of coming and having a fire up huddle with my team to get them ready and fired up for the day, share any organizational changes, answer any of my teams questions. Sending out the daily report of the team numbers. Side by side call listening and coaching. Daily leadership meetings to discuss current and future best practices and sales goals. One on one engagement with my associates. I learned a great deal about financial services, deposit accounts, credit accounts, home loans, 401k etc.. as part of management team i can say that we had great leaders with tons of experience, we all helped each other and lead the floor as a team and not as individuals. The hardest part about the job was the work/life balance. Most enjoyable was the benefits and the coworkers you got to work side by side with everyday."
good,"Accenture has a good multi culture work environment. When it comes to benefits and compensation, it entirely depends on the level, not everyone are equally paid. Job security is not so good. Management could have been better. Still I would consider accenture a decent place to work"
good,"Being on PST time our days started at 6:30 a.m. and went to 3:00 p.m."
good,Coworkers were very helpful and fun to work with.  The company has a lot of internal problems and is mismanaged.  Turn over was rampant.
good,"Bank of America is a great company to work for because the company treats its employee fair. All though promotional opportunities are extremely limited. So, If you're looking to advance your career, my advise will be look somewhere else."
good,my pay was sent to another account 4 times I won commissions I didn't get the managers were not helpful and the training was great 60 days is a tough postion
good,Working here was difficult due to management issues and a constantly chaotic environment. Decisions to change processing were made randomly and were never tested before implementation.  This resulted in constant changes and reorganizations.

good,A days work at the bank would consist of overviewing peoples files and verifying if any foul activity had conspired. This meant reviewing customers history as well as sometimes verifying with vendors to provide more information. I had the opportunity to learn various techniques that are used to take someone identity as well as the product available to prevent such things from happening.

I would also say that it all depends on the management. I love working as a teller. I get it and it is a job for me. I enjoy interacting with customers and helping them to my best ability.
good,Strong collaboration with team members and management. We all work as a team to ensure loans are serviced in a timely manner. A typical day at work is supporting a porfolio of loans in default focusing on loan modifications while researching and preparing documentation.

Management was supportive as I met my quotas, and my co-workers at my level helped each other to overcome the learning curve.The hardest part was learning the information system on the computer network. Also, very little support from the CMA's as they were spread thin and required to devote almost all their time to helping the top Senoir Financial Advisor. the most enjoyable part of this job was helping people plan their retirement and legacy."
good,"a normal 8 hour work day at BOA, you would come in get on the phone make call to customers for 2 hours take your 15 minute break once you finish with your break get back on the phone for an hour and 45 minutes then you would take an hour lunch then get back on the phone taking calls for an 2 hours then take your last 15 minute break and come back to finish your shift. we met with our section manger twice per week for about 30 minutes to discuss any new information or updates and we had weekly floor our unit manger to update's on the company and all the different line's of business. we also had quarterly unit meeting to show us how the unit is doing compared to other regions in the same line of business and they also honored the top preforming associate's for their performance throughout that quarter. the hardest part about the job is when a customer wants to pay their bills but can't financially afford to maintain their normal standard of life. working for BOA I really l how credit work & how manage my money alot better than before I worked there. the best and most enjoyable part of the job when we had team outting for the top performing team and BOA picked up the tab we got 2 hours of paid time off."

I enjoyed learning the in's and out's of the finanacial world and have obtained a great deal of knowledge regarding banking and brokerage matters. I enjoyed working with and learning from my co-workers but feel that the management could have been stronger. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experiance and appreciation of gratified clients. The hardest part of the job was being physically inactive for the majority of the day.
good,Bank of America offers fantastic benefits. They cover just about anything. They also pay better than some of their competitors.
good,"as  a loan officer, this is a tough company to work for. Expectations are conflicting. delivering digital experience to the customers while goals rely on people walking into the branches"
good,"Depending on who your manager is, it is a great place to work. There is some room for growth but company often only looks at ""numbers"" on scorecard rather than personality and work ethic."
good,I had a great Sale's Manager but the monthly goals were extremely aggressive. Really enjoyed the technology and people I worked with but BOA runs a bit of a churn and burn operation.
good,The company and benefits are great.  Work life balance is up to the employee and how much revenue they are bringing in.  The nature of the job is stressful because it is sales and fulfillment can be frustrating.
good,Good one place where you can work many hours to understand the banking applications. Company is really good it's really good working environment which helps employee to balance their work and family both.

good,"Culturally not so great,  Rest are ok. Benefit are ok .Definitely need God father , if you want to survive in long curves.More of process oriented rather than knowledge based."
good,"Bank of America is a great place to work but does need some retooling of its systems and senior management. They need to listen to their employee's and take into consideration the enhancements that would help every day work. With older management mentalities higher up, this causes for older views to still be in place where the world has changed and adapted"
good,A day at work would be lil stressfull at time because when you would get escaleted calls and you needed an sca there where no where to be found or they would be helping someone eals they need more ppl as well make it more gun as well need better systems they have some onld old i mean old computers. As well as 95%of all the computer at work never worked
good,"Good culture but very long hours. It really depends on the groups that you support on what your work/life balance will be like. Good benefits especially for families, but pay could be higher."
good,"Great company with excellent benefits, but management is very unprofessional in operations area. During my eleven years with this company, I've only worked with two highly professional managers."
good,"I’ve been working for Bank of America for 5+ yrs now"
good,"If you have a good manager your work life is so much better however if you have a bad one, which is not uncommon your life can be challenging for a year or more.   Due to the reshuffling of management constantly luckily a bad manager will be repositioned with ideally you no longer being a direct report."
good,"To be fair BOA offers great benefits,it's just the stuff you have to put up with to get it. It's production driven. No extra personal break when it gets hard. Management styles differ as well"
good,Worked primarily in the same position for two years and was constantly asking for opportunities to advance or try new options.  Nothing really came of it.
good,I have a like/dislike relationship with this position at BOA. I believe there needs to be more opportunity to advance and there needs to be way less sales pressure.
good,"As part of a large marketing group, I learned a lot about the various ways the bank uses to get its messages across platforms from digital content to newsletters to podcasts."
good,"I had the opportunity to learn new skills and push my own boundaries.  Pay was adequate and benefits were good.  The job was challenging at times, good place to start."
good,Great company to work for except for the hours which frequently exceeded a normal work week.  Management was knowledgeable and able to assist with unusual situations.  Advancement opportunities were limited and based on internal contacts.
good,The company has become very sales goal focus. They are at this moment losing site of looking after the best interest of the customers. I believe the company means well but is very scared to take chances for such a big company like boa. If your not sales goal oriented then this might not be the job for you.
good,I wouldn't recommend bofa to anyone.. They are disorganized and does not treat you very nice at all. They want you work more hours but don't want to pay you
good,The center/department is an outsourced company that works and services on the premises of Bank of America building.  If you become a permanent employee its for Williams Lea not Bank of America.
good,"I do not know internal, i worked all the time as a contractor, My last boss was very nice and helping to learn PBD's these are the Prob builders using in CA wily A monitoring tools I used in BOA. Overall i spend good time at BOA and TCS."

good,"I no longer work for the company."
good,"	Implemented product referral strategy to improve marketing and sales goals"
good,Not a bad place to work for benefits The retail branches are consistently getting shafted with the lack of support in staffing and management. It has become tiresome after many years of being short handed. Recently with changes in leadership and structure it has become extremely micro managed. Spend most drives home on conference calls to explain how our day went. Reached a tipping point with it all.
good,"Normal IT working environment.  Management was good to work with.  As with most regulated industries, it can be challenging to obtain the tools necessary to do a high-quality, thorough job."
good,"In my current role, I typically worked 8-10 hours per day.  A lot of time was spent addressing escalated issues, assigning work and ensuring the operation was running smoothly and that the associates on my team had the resources and support they needed to get their jobs done. With the number of hours I was required to work, sometimes finding work life balance was difficult. "
good,The expectations not realistic. They give you goals so high if you reach them they will make them higher the next time around and unattainable.The objective is to get is much out of you in as little period as possible. As long as you are good at kissing up to people you will be fine.
good,The company's mission statement/core values are the drivers with which all the divisions use as the operational foundation to drive success within functional areas.
