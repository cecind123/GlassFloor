bad,Ita alla bout customers who are nice but then stab you in the back and wanting compensation from company its a shame people act the way they do and ruin a good career
bad,This place is full of ignorant rednecks especially in the Technical Departments. This is not a good place to work.
bad,Advancement is very hard and most of management is very set-in-there ways
bad,"The work environment was  very hostile.  Too much work expected in the time frame allowed."
bad,"The unhappiest time of my life. No work life balance. Micromanager who talks the talk. Constantly speaking about ""company's culture"" yet stabs you in the back. Inept but a master in making sure no one stands out in order for her not to look incompetent. The team of managers and director are all from the inside and have to real knowledge of how to be leaders or managers and have no other experience other than what they have learned within the walls of the company. They have built their own little world (hiring friends and family) and want a bunch a followers as incompetent as themselves. Unfortunately there are many minions that are willing to stroke egos to merely keep their job."
bad,Possibly the worst company I have ever worked for. Micromanagement is all over the company. Most good reviews here are from the Atlanta division and are just happy to have a job.Did they mention how much comes out of their paycheck for those mediocre benefits? Don't work here for over 5 years because they won't let you. They will fire you for say taking 1 of your 5 sick days so they can hire someone new for starting rate.  Don't waste your time here! If you do plan to work here make it temporary until you find a better job which won't be hard
bad,I was a temp at this company which took over NiSource Retail Services. At several meetings we were told that there were no plans to make changes to the NH office. This lie was maintained through a meeting on April 5th. Yesterday HR came in and told everyone but IT and Marketing they will no longer have a job after May 17th and now I see advertisements for open positions in a company that is closing. Not professional at all.
bad,"When i first started with this company, i loved it. I loved what i did and most the people i worked with. They were even understanding, somewhat, when i got pregnant. But then things started to change. Once my mamger quit, and she quit bc the company was going downhill and warned us all about it, things did start going downhill. And when the new manager took over, i was one of the first one's to be let go. I had a brand new baby at home and i ws let go bc i took the sick days the company gave me. She said the comapny gives you those days to take but your not really supposed to take them. THat makes no sense. I coudn't help being sick. So, I just went and packed my stuff and left. The company went downhill so fast after that. They were starting to not care about their employees either."
bad,"by far this was the worst company to work for, I was working at VNG as Sr. Analyst, and from day one I felt something was not wright about this place, I am from an Arab background, so I had enemy's all over the place, where can I start, every day I had something going on with the employees, they use to talk bad about me all day and I can hear them, I told HR, And she said I can't make people like you, and I said to her I don't want them to like me, I just want them to respect me at the place of work, any how to make a long story short, I was let go last year, March 2012, which was a good thing to happen since I was planning to leave on April any way, when my Manager sat down with HR to tell me I had to leave to company, I felt how this place was, they escorted me to my car door to make sure that I am not going to do something stupid, never defended me or took my side, I don't know really why I was offered the position."
bad,"My day is busy, I get to meet a lot of new faces and my work is sometimes challenging. It is a fun place to work.  My co-workers are great.  The location is even greater because it's not too far from my home."
bad," Training course was thorough but only taught about 60% of my actual job. The energy products I had to sell day in and day out were terrible and are a rip off for the consumer it was hard to sleep at night knowing what I was doing. Management is unorganized, negative, and unprofessional. If you have ever seen the movie ""Boiler Room"" that's what their sales enviornment feels like. Does not develop employees. Co-workers were pleasent and very helpful, very generous and caring people. "
bad,"long hard days, outside work. hard work sometime dangerous"
good,"I worked there in 2013 and it was very cliquish, if you weren’t in the clique you were going to not advance as fast. "
good,"If you enjoy Micro-Managment, Zero Job Security, and 24/7 devotion to your employer, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!"
good,I only had a short term role so I did not get to experience much of the company culture. My direct manager was not the easiest person to work for but he was definitely focused on the job.
good,AGL is a great company to work for.  You have an opportunity to advance pretty quickly if you keep your numbers high. People find security at AGL and very little turnover.
good,This is really making me rethink using this platform. Why is this necessary? I’m obly writing sentences to meet your character requirements. This is annoying.
good,"AGL Resources base out of Atlanta, GA. Did not feel like the company was looking out for the employee best interest. Later the company was purchase by Southern Company."
good,A typical Fortune 500 company acquired by Southern Company. I would have liked to see AGL stand up for long time employees negatively impacted by the merger.
good,"Not the best place to work, Mandatory over time 12 hours a day"
good,"A typical day of work for me is contract negotiation, sourcing purchase orders, and invoice reconciliation. I have learned a lot about the supply chain field in my three years in this role. The management and coworker environment consists of a very relaxed casual environment. The hardest part of my job would be contacting a contractor to advise they were not awarded a bid. The most enjoyable part of my job is conversing with others throughout the organization and being apart of teams seeing the project through from its initiation to its completion."
good,The company overall is great and it is a great place to advance your career when you have the chance too. I recommend to learn as much as you can and continue to move up it the company
good,"HVAC dispatcher/Customer Service. Good team of people, but the pay sucks. Good entry level, not for anyone who's trying to make real money. This position is 12-830 M-Saturday. 16 hourly. OT is available."
good,"AGL Resources was acquired by Southern Company. Prior to acquisition, it was a great place to work. There was great potential and opportunity for growth and advancement."
good,This company is great unless you go to the resource management  department. The managers are cut throat and evil. They don't care about your personal life and its all about what can you produce today.
good,AGL Resources or Southern Company Gas is a good place to work. It could improve on the advancement of employees. I have nothing else to say.
good,The employees in Customer Service are constantly being taught new things to learn.  There are constraints to working in the Customer Service Center compared to other parts of the company.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, it was a challenging environment, a few bad apples but that occurs everywhere, the pace could get hectic, but management made sure everyone was given breaks."
good,A typical day in the life as an employee of AGL was laid back.  There was not a lot of misro-managing.  The leadership from Director and up was superb.  It is very easy to stay there for awhile without knowing.  The tenure there was amazing.  I learned the utilities industry and worked in the billing department to ensure that there were accurate bills going out and maintaining the integrity of the gas meters to ensure proper usage and billing.  My co-workers were awesome.  A great bunch to work with.  There job itself was not very difficult.  When we were in our peak season adapting to taking calls if needed had it challenges to maintain service level and daily job functions.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the push for excellence.  Knowing that I was doing work that ensured accurately reported usage and troubleshooting any issues to rectify any discrepancies made it a joy.
good,"This is a good company to work for, there is job security, however there is no advancement. the company is going through changes which in turn affected the employees.  The job consistently makes the employees do mandatory overtime, overworked the employees until they would burn out.  The company did pay well, a base salary plus overtime pay.  Management was overall good, they did care about their employees and tried to help as much as possible, but could only do as much as allowed. The hardest part of the job is the consistent overtime and constant back to back calls while being understaffed, They did bring in food for the employees and the co workers are good people as well. The job needs to work on career advancement, they would rather hire outside employees than promote from within."
good,Agl is one of the best conpanys out there good benefits and lots of work! Only thing was i had no good communication with super intendent other than that conpany was well maintain and very good on safety
good,Awesome opportunities.  Management is concerned about your growth. Be prepared to hit the ground running day 1.  Work life balance is practiced here.  Employees own their work contributions.
good,Great place to work and the pay is average.  the benefits are the best Ive had.  I wish career advancement were more obtainable by the call center agents.  Overall this culture is friendly and inviting so it a great place for me.
good,I like to do challenging job. I learned how to analyze a problem and try find the best solution. I learned to think about safety as a first priority.
good,AGL is a great company to work your way up and retire.  There are some very good employees that support your goals.  That will help you focus on positive development within the company.
good,A typical work day entailed auditing and processing invoices to ensure proper coding and authorization.  I learned that accuracy and completeness are essential in any accounting process.  Management was very knowledgeable and adhered to an open-door policy. My co-workers were very professional which allowed us to develop and maintain a great working relationship.
good,"As a plant operator I stay busy either loading LNG tankers or watching and controling the plant process. With LNG being stored at -250 degrees fahrenheit along with cylinders of pressurized gases, I am always having to monitor the facility."
good,"Monitors “AM”, “PM” and priority appointments, routes filler work to field service personnel by dispatching work orders by compliance and deadline, evaluates filed service routes; provides optimized routes for service personnel based on quantity, severity of workload, and available resources, monitors field service efficiency throughout the day, assigns, dispatches, and tracks emergency orders to ensure compliance to standards are met, redirect field service resources to Service Centers based on need, investigate and take action on incomplete orders, assist area managers and supervisors by reviewing daily staffing and scheduling field service personnel accordingly"
good,"AGL-Nicor is a well-known Gas company, and growing each day. The work environment is nice. Friendly employees, I recommend anyone who is looking for a new opportunity coming out of college Agl-Nicor will be a good place to start."
good,"The Call Center is typically a very busy workplace and depending on the time of season it can be extremely stressful.  Management makes the workplace an enjoyable environment during schedule leisure events.  The co-workers are extremely resourceful, energetic, devoted, loving, caring, responsible and accountable employees/individuals.  I appreciate the knowledge this utility gas company has provided.  I will benefit as a consumer and as a previous employee.  This company provides the utmost professionalism, pride and knowledge in its product."
good,"There is no typical day here at AGL in the IT Department. You never know what's going to happen or breakdown. I have learned so much here while on my internship to the point that I carry on as if I am a full-time employee. Management is amazing, and my co-workers? They are a mess, a good mess, but a mess. I can have so much fun with them because they are approachable and so down to earth. The hardest part about my job is dealing with customers who want help but do not know how to recieve help when it presents iitself. Meaning, they put a ticket in regarding their problem, myself or a team member go out to check it out, the customer is unruly, defensive, or just has a horrible attitude, and we do not have a pleasent experience. I know how to deal with customers like this but I do not like it. The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to see the smile on someones face after I have resolved their issue. All I love to do is help people!"
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits with annual bonus.
good,AGL is a highly professional workplace and a pleasant place to work. Management is wonderful and people seem genuinely happy to work there.
good,"log in by your schedule time ready for customers to call and assist with any complaints on account, process payments, process orders turn-ons, turn-offs and new service for natural gas"
good,Overall the company is a great organization to work for. Unfortunately I left before the major management changes went into effect. If given another opportunity I would definitely work there again.
good,"AGL Resources is a large company with plenty of career advancements. While working with AGL my multi tasking and organizational skills were sharpened due to the many different roles I played in the customer service sales department. Meeting a lot of people from various different backgrounds was great experience. Dealing with irate customers at times can be stressful, but coming to a result at the end and the customer being thankful is well worth it."
good,"Great Place to work, Great benefits, would recommend AGL to work at."
good,"Worked with accounting team of 10-12 individuals, reported to a single Accounting Manager. Performed general ledger account reconciliations, analyzed and researched outstanding items and issues. Worked with customers (internal and external) to resolve problems, answer questions and provide recommendations. Facilitated benefit plan audits for various operating segments. Conducted review of financial information, analyzed variances and performed estimates and complex calculations. Reviewed workflow processes to formulate suggestions on continuous process improvements. Worked directly with Treasury to maintain debt covenant requirements."
good,AGL Resources is a top of its class natural gas distribution company. It has strong financials and has been growing both financially and geographically. This company has a great work/life balance and culture. The management is very engaging and down to earth. The most enjoyable part of my job is the variety of problems I have to solve every day. Not one day is the same in the natural gas industry.
good,"Train stop is right beside the building, gym is on the first floor."
good,"Working at AGL Resources is a great place to be at the atmosphere there is amazing, it makes you want to really get down to work all the managers, supervisors as well as the fellow agents make it a fun workplace."
good,"Fast Pasted environment, excellent benefits. Staff and co-workers were very enthusiastic about their jobs. Everyone was motivated to assist beyond their job description."
good,I really enjoyed interning at AGL. I was able to experience both the good and bad of corporate America. I learned so much about myself and how to manage time better.
good,I love working with this company.  Sadly the cost of living is too high to continue to enjoy. lots of typing and hardly no days off unless you use vacation.
good,the nature of the business sometimes difficult as natural gas can be necessary for many people but company has many programs to help its customers and really encourages employees in community outreach programs
good,"Great Culture and since the merger with Southern Company it has been seamless and Southern Company has changed very little.  s time goes on I am sure there will be changes, but our voices have been valued."
good,"Since I am retired  this does not relate to the job that I am applying for. I have retired after 24,years of excellent customer service."
good,"My work day would begin a review of my TOD list which would allow me to prioritize according to management to be completed by date. I learned to prepare employees who reached retirement age for their exit from AGL providing them with AGL's Retirement Checklist. Providing information regarding their benefits package at time of retirement. My manager was extremely knowledgeable and provided her team with the necessary tools to successfully complete our tasks. My co-workers provided all information to get the job done well. My co-workers thoroughly understood the term ""team player."" The hardest part of my job is when I was told my assignment was ending. My most enjoyable work experience was to get the job done well. Problem-solving."
