rating,review
bad,"Was overwhelming and had a lack of support for workers going through hard times. The management would rather dismiss an employee rather than talking to them about issues in life that were influencing their performance."
bad,"The Apple I left is not the same Apple I started at. Many people seemingly failed up while the hardest worker bees are kept slaving away at the bottom. There is culture that makes you think, ""this job is the best I can get"". This keeps many people slaving at their jobs in belief nothing better is out there. This is not the same company I started working for in 2008. The values are different and not for the better. It's about sales and numbers and it used to be about enrichment and thinking different. Don't think different here or you'll be punished by challenging ideas and not embracing the ""culture"". Also, if you don't constantly ""toot"" your own horn you will be lost in the mix. If you do toot your own horn your co-workers will complain about you. The backstabbing will also ensue on you for being forward about your accomplishments. Don't share your ideas with others, they will steal them and use them to help themselves advance. You can't win. You'll be passed up for promotions but still be required to help train the person who DID get the job. You'll be good enough to do skill sets from the jobs above yours but when the time comes for advancement, suddenly all your shortcomings will be apparent. My manager even personally told me she failed me because of her communication skills. Run away from being at this company unless you are good at playing games and being a thoughtless drone."
bad,"they allow the mangers to sexually harass and bully others. Be cautious of the interactions! "
bad,If you're good with brown nosing then this is the place for you. The company culture at Apple has fallen at the waist side. I would say that they only care about your performance but thats not even true. They only promote people that they like on a personal level even if they're not good at their job.
bad,Apple is THE worst company I have ever worked for.  Anyone can tell you. They keep moving you around and jerking you around that you will be doomed to fail. If you yry to improve yourself they will challenge you at every step and deny you. The company is run by a cadre of elite snobs who are trying to be Steve Jobs.
bad,"J’y ai travaillé 5 ans, cette entreprise est là pour casser de l’employé et particulièrement le magasin de Dijon où les managers et directeurs sont des psychopathes. Ils sont là pour vous casser, vous fliquer et vous faire souffrir. On vous fait miroiter de belles choses à l’embauche, puis vous découvrez la vérité sur le management toxique de cette boîte."
bad,Compensation is below industry standards. Management refuses to compensate fairly and often allows an IC's work to be stolen and credit given to themselves or other people in organization.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.  The minimal upsides of it are far outweighed by the constant downsides.  Culture is really demanding, they don't treat you like a person and the standards were pretty unreasonable."
bad,"I was one of the dummies that thought by being fully Apple certified would make a difference when it came to the application process. Grant it not expecting a vip clearance or anything but at-least recognition for the ability to be certified on their products, but still cant land a job."
bad,"I’ll never work for this company again. Apple says they care about employees but in reality, they want you to be a slave but won’t pay you, and won’t get you to be full time. They will use you & then try to get you to quit"
bad,"Your job depends on customer surveys which are out of your control when a customer is upset about an update or a product no longer powering on, you will receive a dissatisfied survey  "
bad,Employee abuse!!!Employee abuse!!!Employee abuse!!!Employee abuse!!!Employee abuse!!! DO NOT WORK HERE!!! They will make you work even when you are sick. If you need hospitalization they will not get you it. Had a whole medical emergency and no ambulance was called. Then they still had me work even after the medical emergency. Then terminated me a week later.
bad,"I was a contractor at Apple, so may be my experience is irrelevant. But I didn't like work as a contractor there. We were treated as slaves, there was no transparency and we were losing our contracts for no reason."
bad,"Apple itself is a decent company, however they let Kelly Services manage their online contracted help.   Kelly Services ruined my experience, Kelly Services is horrible."
bad,"Cliquey, fake, minimal training, very poor salary."
bad,"Bully of a manager, constantly changing goalposts, second guessing your every move and then telling you were wrong at EVERY opportunity. Culture is that of Cover your...... Hated the place."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"I worked at Apple for 3 years, in AppleCare Training. It was competitive, political, and extremely siloed. A rough environment. I don't recommend it, even though it's Apple and it's cool."
bad,Illegal horrible company to be employed with. They won’t pay you correctly and when you try to retrieve your message money they will threaten to Calk the police .
bad,If your looking for job security or advancement opportunities then this is not the place. 3 1/2 years with the company and all it took was 2 weeks of under performance to get the boot. At the beginning it was all great but once their vision shifted to being all about $$$ and not the customer then it was all downhill from there.
bad,"I worked at Apple as a contractor 2 different times, with 2 different contractor companies, in 2 different cities, in 2018 and 2019, 3 months each. So I was able to make an objective observation that is not specific to location or contractor company. This is what really happens in Apple."
bad,Ga er nooit werken. Ze denken alleen maar aan zichzelf.
bad,My supervisor made my job miserable to go to and miserable the whole time I worked.   It was a work at home job so I should love getting out of bed and getting to work.  Working here that never happened.  MISERABLE people make everything miserable for everyone they around.
bad,"An applicant was discriminated based on religion. Apple is an EEO, this is unlawful. Please investigate. This is woefully sad and cost someone an opportunity for gainful employment."
bad,I would never work for Apple through Volt again. They are the worst & they don’t care about their employees. They all racist and if you are not from their particular background they will lie and spy on you to get you fired.
bad,"I worked for an outsourced company of Apple Called Concetrix. The only good thing I can say about the company is the training to start the job is extensive and semi beneficial. The management was horrible, the job security was nonexistent, there was no room for improvement and the turnover was astronomical. I would only recommend applying for this company as a temporary job to make ends meet until something better comes along."
bad,"Not a very good place to work. Noisy. Aggressive environment."
bad,"The majority of Apple's employees at the Austin campus are contractors. They're thrown into helpdesk positions with little to no protection from the departmental politics above them. Workflows, rules and enforcement all change with alarming regularity, and workers caught out of line for any reason are treated as disposable. Your entire experience is dictated by the mood of your manager and their manager. Few, if any of those hired as contractors are hired on full-time."
bad,I moved up quickly but too many changes constantly. After the make so many changes and you mess up they write you up. And as a Senior advisor submitting tickets to the enginners who waste our time asking questions i already told them the answer too many times with a angry customer on the line. Most of my customers weren't mad at me it was the policy and the engineers. Then I got bad surveys that weren't about me but about Apple in general and then they fired me for that.
bad,Part time workers are treated like scum. They are not given enough hours and benefits for working there. They do the same as full time workers. The System is completely unfair and unjust.
bad,Good company only if you work at the corporate office.  No career advancement and the managing staff may be managers from recent jobs just not you current roles
bad,good people to work with but very un organized shop disapointed customers and alot of the blame was put on the employees instead of management!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Apple has amazing products they sell but the  IT management is not up to the par and has no vision on how to accomplish the goals "
bad,"They claim to be into people with ""passion"", well my musician friend who actually uses their products to make music was looked over, he had an A+ Certification, bilingual, sales experience and an avid mac user. Overlooked for prettier, lighter skin candidate."
bad,"vous etes un chiffre et rien qu'un chiffre..."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"The ideals and values the company publicizes are not present in the retail sector of the company. "
bad,"Management hire experts but don't listen to any necessary changes which need to be made to keep their products/service quality as high as possible. They do not care about you, the work you can provide or their products."
bad,Fair warning. This company very much puts their bottom line above all else. There are very good benefits on offer but you'll have to decide if they're worth the poor management that comes with them
bad,I do apologize that my experience working for Apple is thru a call center. The Apple technical project was cancelled 2 years early. I want to say that the issue was poor management. If the proper people were put into place it may have lasted longer. The issue began in recruiting hiring anyone off the street....literally anyone with a pulse. The next issue being “title” chasers & what I mean is young people with no experience excited to be “the boss”.  There were only a handful of people wanting to do their job & do it well.
bad,"Shady shady dealings: 2 words govern apple culinary: "
bad,"A typical day with Apple will consist you working 8 hours (w/ mandatory overtime) hardly any restroom breaks, 2nd/3rd shift hours only, & working weekends, no paid time off, mandatory holidays (and I stress, every holiday) etc."
bad,"This is for Csat Solutions not apple."
bad,"The leads are grace stealing from the processors. They switch up on their SOP and do not train you correctly. Then blame you for all of the mistakes.  ROR was the worst. One minute it's ok to consolidate and ship units one way. Then the next minutes they say you are doing it wrong. They bring in trainers who can't speak English well. So, they half train new employees. Then, when you are evaluated you get negative check marks."
bad,Would not work with this company with the management team I had to deal with.   If you are not an apple religious zealot then they will not look to you for any further employment.  I never looked to gadgets to run my life but that is the religion at Apple.
bad,"They didn’t care about work life balance when I tried getting days off for things happening around my life. A typical day would be clocking in, doing my job and going home exhausted. The pay gets you by, but for the amount of work it requires mentally it explains why people tend to gain a lot of weight during their time there. "
bad,"Apple is a company where programming is done by developers without Computer Science education. Such employees without proper education think that those who have Computer Science education, do not know how to program."
bad,not a good place to work bad management no advancement pay is low for the work short lunch breaks the the parking is to far from buliding no overtime paid
bad,customer service for apple products and all customers were made because they were understaffed and there was a huge turn over rate. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Everyone is rude from staff to customers. Human Resources are never around to talk to about needs for their employees. Supervisors are two-faced and had favorite advisors.
bad,"Was very unprofessional "
bad,"Discrimination and retaliation are rampant and although brought to corporate's attention, they refuse to acknowledge the toxic environment built and maintained by AppleCare Enterprise/EDU leadership. In contrast to the ""fearless feedback"" manta, team managers are allowed to carry out petty vendettas and pet employees are allowed to bully advisors with no consequences.  If you are in the ""good 'ol boys club"" you are safe.  If you are not in the club, which most aren't, then you are treated like property, not people.  In spite of multiple claims from dozens of employees, human resources refuses to address or acknowledge the problem."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,Apple treats its contract workers like second class citizens. There is an air of secrecy and exclusivity about everything. Workers are discouraged from socializing with people from other teams and there are no opportunities for career development or mentorship.
bad,"I see Apple hiring Apple care adviser paying under $15 /hour?  Common, you're a giant company why not pay fair hourly rate?  You're not in China.  And their minimum requirements are just equivalent to BS degree."
bad,"Not a fun place to work at. Lots of discrimination between FTE and contractors"
bad,"Exceptional benefits are not worth the trade off for work/life balance they claim to care about. Despite what management says, you are pressured to sell or life at work becomes very difficult and stressful. There are ‘cliques’ between those who play the game and those who truly challenge or ask why."
bad,"Apple doesn't seem to hire people over the age of 45, no matter how perfect attendance or quality of work. I've nothing else to add about the company."
bad,didn't like management or pay scale. both were very confusing to understand which is why no one understood what they were going to be paid at payday. Ironic
bad,"The supervisors here are ruthless and lousy I was completely locked out of my work computer, from no error of mine, and denied 2 1/2 days work. They could not fix it so could not do my job so I wasn’t paid either.  They said it was voluntary but it’s not my job to fix computers"
bad,Unless you were in a small group of friends it was impossible to advance. The other is the disabled are not treated accordingly.   work environment was terrible
bad,"My manager was a disorganized lecher that hired college girls to do jobs and gave them professional advancement over male/older employees. No matter how early I showed up or how hard I tried, this horrible man was always trying to sabotage me. Working for Apple was one of the worst experiences of my life."
bad,"Management is a joke, all they care about is metrics with no respect as a human. Very hard to get a job at apple. So what they do is hire trough a temp service under contracts. Keep you for some time. When you get top up on salary, They let you go and get fresh hires. They even fight unemployment so you don't even get that. Be careful."
bad,This company is slowly becoming a cancer that kills each and every one of its employees slowly from the inside out. Turn over here is very high because people don't want to deal with the constant politics and BS of retail. Very little opportunity for growth and the corporate environment is very separated from retail.
bad,bad hours at least my department was but still an okay job I was in but definetly gave good hours perfect for someone who doesn't mind sitting in a desk all day.
bad,"Go in, go through Metal Detector, go to break room, go through second metal detector, get yelled at if you are 5 minutes late clocking in, go to work where they show favoritism to other ethnicities, go for lunch, barely anything to eat there, go back to clock in, get yelled at again for being 5 minutes late,go back to being yelled at for being slow, deal with the emotional abuse from the supervisors, then leave for home."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend, stressful, they do not care about your health or safety the area managers are very condescending. Not going to say much more just filling up the space because it's required."
bad,"Make sure you record everything, from what any person is telling you so you can always have it for your reference and stand up for yourself. For if you don't then you may find yourself fighting for your time."
bad,"No eres más que un número para ellos."
bad,"This job was a mistake for me to take up. Not only did it not suit me personally, staff aren't treat well and a great deal is expected in a high pressure environment for minimum wage"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,This is the worst job I have ever had. This place made you work a difference schedule every month and they made you work really hard to end calls ASAP just to get the ability to choose your schedule the next quarter. This was a terrible idea as it made everyone not want to work as a team. I hate this company!
bad,"This is one of the worst jobs i have ever had. the management and staff are awful, it's a constant competition, and nobody is willing to help one another."
bad,"Horrible work culture - team meetings at 7:00 AM, you need to show up in person; Crazy deadlines, stress, lots of red tape - there are a few  pockets that is good."
bad,"The company has shifted focus from it's employees to it's customers in a huge way. Forget about time off or any work-life balance. Plus, the yearly pay increases are stock options, not salary increases."
bad,"This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc."
bad,i don't like the GBI environment it is of waste. too many vendor collaboration will slowdown the work. for a single task it has to go through tooooo many peoples hand. its a big headache
bad,"Apple may have one of the most streamlined product suites in the market, but their in house research and development process is not what I expected it to be. Instead what I experienced was a General Motors style heads down cubical style approach to software development that really burst my bubble. Where were all these creative people collaborating?"
bad,Employed as a customer service agent in. Cork. Like beinf chained to the phone and desk  for ten hours. No breaks sometimes. Managers didn't listen. I come from the health service executive in cork for a job here and the HSE were bad enough useless idiots. A holes
bad,"No Job security, not that much job growth. its a good job for a High School Graduate or someone who is interested in how to repair an IPhone."
bad,"Ive never worked for a company that makes you give so much and gives so little."
bad,here you can work for maximum of one year. then they lay you off. then six months later you can come back. i cannot do that . no medical eye or dental coverage.
bad,Its good if u permanent employee..else no good. Technical aspects are good but poor work life balance. Extended hours on daily basis. Unrealistic dead lines.
bad,"My experience with this company is that the do not maintain high integrity relationships with their vendors. It was evident when I worked over time (in order to get the project done) and was informed that I was classified as exempt (no over time). It's interesting how other staffing companies can classify the same type of position as non-exempt yet this company believes that project managers are compensated enough on an hourly basis so they pay straight hours instead of time and a half even though the vendor has approved over time payment."
bad,"lack of permanent roles due to lack of support"
bad,"People were very rude at job events. Arrogant people. Employees insulting job applicants at recruiting events."
bad,"Responded to and resolved customer issues with iPhone usability (dropped calls, email and text message problems) – provided troubleshooting support to determine if issues were network-based and needed to be routed to AT&T, or higher tier at Apple."
bad,"They outsource the call center help to a company that does respect its employees. "
bad,"Working for this Company not recommended. They hire anyone from other countries on contract with Volt Workforce Solutions, you don't need any computer skills at all."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"worst job ever don't get me started. management is straight out of the dark ages target or kmart. not at all progressive or open door. i9n fact that door waqs literally kept shut add locked at all times."
bad,"Line meeting to organise what amt. had to be produced for that day."
bad,"Worst job of my life. Sub-living wage. If you want to work for Apple expect to live with your parents because the pay is not enough to rent an apartment, make a car payment and buy food."
bad,"I had to commute to work, and carpool with a group of 5 other employees.  All of us agreed that this job was just a stepping stone in order to find us a better opportunity.  My shift was swing shift.  I chose that shift because of the higher pay, but I would have preferred working mornings.  Swing shift in any job I don't suggest doing unless you're single with no kids and a girlfriend/wife. This was a contract job, where you were promised to have work for 1 year. Every 3 months if you were good with attendance and work, they would extend you.  After 6 months passed from the time your contract ended for 1 year. You were allowed to come back, but I was extended twice, then while working my 2nd extension was laid off along with several other hundred employees. Was called back a few weeks later to come back, but they wanted me to work mornings and my 1 year wouldn't have started over. It would have carried on.  I've learned a lot of things being there, only learning during our break times and lunch times because that's when we can talk, but a lot of employees talked to me about life in general and how they went from having a career to getting laid off and ending up in this job. The only enjoyable part was getting off work and meeting your co-workers. Management was not existent, they were more like security to you."
bad,Friendly work enviroment and pay was good. Little or no help in the support system. Hardly any help when needed.
bad,"While I thoroughly enjoyed my job and the people I worked with, the management team is by far the worst I have ever encountered in my entire time working. Extreme amounts of favoritism and hypocrisy are all this store is built on. Apple is an amazing place to work and hopefully other stores out there are far better and do not treat their employees they way I have watched the staff be treated there."
bad,liked this job meeting new people everyday from all over the places
bad,Typical day you seat in a chair all day
bad,"Typical day at work for me is simply following protocol and making sure customers are more than satisfied. I have excelled in communicating and working with customers to help them with their needs. The management that I have learned from trained me to be a employee that makes a difference. The co-workers that I have worked with has helped me to work with others more efficiently and productively. The hardest part of a job is making sure that multiple tasks are done correctly. The most enjoyable part of a job is making a positive difference in a customers life, everyday."
bad,"Dead end, be prepared to give too much of yourself and expect nothing in return."
bad,dont work for a temp place. waste of time. i'll never do it again in my life if i have a choice.
bad,"Monitored down to a tee, all your calls are being judged and reviewed by your manager, there is no trust built no matter how long you've been working there or how good your surveys are."
bad,"More of a big-brother corporate vibe than the Apple advertised in the 80s-90s. Says its eco-friendly, but discourages remote work, runs buses that are sometimes only half full of passengers."
bad,"de belles valeurs et de beaux discours .. un credo...limite ""bourrage de crane""  on sent le coté ""secte"" Apple .. tout cela se veut être fun .. mais la competition est là et le management ""à la française"" ne met pas en avant les qualités  votre évolution ne sera pas basée sur vos competences ni sur vos chiffres .. vous serez déçu .. très déçu ..  car on vous en demandera toujours plus .. et puis vous perdrez patience car les belles promesses la belle evolution ne vient pas ..   APPLE c'était bien ..  au debut ..  maintenant c'est devenu une machine à broyer l'humain .. employés qui craquent  se mettent en arrêt maladie "
bad,"At the beginning it was great, awesome pay and benefits.  Recently the quality of life at Apple has gone downhill.  The benefits have been cut down over the years and you will cap out in pay if you stay too long.  There is no interest to retain any technical talent by corporate or retail and it does show with products being released with issues or finding issues later on that impact customers.  It also shows that the technician quality has gone down in the retail side with poor training and lack of focus to protect the employee experience from abusive customers, retail = company punching bag.  There are very short paths to promote to and very little ability to get promoted without the politics.  Leadership seems to be afraid to hold themselves or anyone else, any degree of accountability, unless you stand out/up for yourself, and you will be chastised by leadership.  Not a place to work if you have a family if you are full-time, work/life balance does not exist.  Okay if you are young and single, not very inclusive as Apple tries to imply with internal/external blogs and media releases."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"Im tired of being at apple and being micro managed. Cant wait to leave ! Everything is tracked, they can even watch what your doing on your monitor in real time. Ive never been so micro managed in my life. I hate working for apple its literally been 2 yrs of the worst experience in my life. I have valuable experience that i would do really well with in other depts at apple but they wont even consider me."
bad,"Do not work for Apple! They are such a fast-paced, snobbish company to work for, and you never get the opportunity to rise up in the ranks! If you are offered a job, run a mile!"
bad,Need to have more permanent staff for better quality work. Days are dragged on and work is very simple . Managers and leads are very understanding but temp agency on site seems to get in the way of work getting done . Agency needs to be walking on floor more to get rid of employees  that don’t work.
bad,They don't care about women. Diversity only matters when they need you to sell things to diverse consumers but the upper heads don't care about diversity or inclusivity. Management is always biased. Only 1 person running the HR department. Seriously horrible.
bad,Don’t be blinded by lies. I have worked for companies that are nothing compared to the size of this place and have been treated with respect. Discount is the only thing good about working here. Management are a disgrace. Brown noses and favorites that all get ahead. Having to beg for time off. 8 minutes to use the loo all day and micromanaged on stats is enough to make you sick. Apple is now a complaints dept since Steve Jobs died as the releases of buggy software every year and unreliable devices created AppleCare.
bad,Not a great experience with Applebees so would rather not rate them. If you have nothing nice to say its better to say nothing. The upper management set very poor examples for the new managers and the lack of training was another issue i had a huge problem with.
bad,"This is a work from home position that Apple has outsourced to cheapen their costs.  That means there are no benefits... NO benefits for a year and the pay is $14 / hour.  So Apple is the new Walmart, driving the people that work (in)directly for them to government assistance."
bad,"The payroll team in Apple, Cork is one of the worst places i have ever worked. They treat the employees like slaves and there is a lot of favouritism going on. There is a blame-shifting technique that managers and team leads master and follow without a pinch of guilty. "
bad,"Its a haphazard mess. Management doesnt know what they're  doing half the time. Very dog eat dog culture overall. More than half a decade  there and never felt job security, your job is left up to how your manager is feeling at any given moment. Needs a total organization restructuring, more employee protections."
bad,"But I wouldn't be in a rush to do it again, especially now. When I first started at apple it was struggling with its identity as a massive corporation trying to remain true to values big corporations don't always have. These days its less about the products and the people that use them. In my last year I just felt like a number."
bad,"Apple contracts out to smaller customer service companies, this way they can pay less to the customer service reps who take the brunt of the companies failures and complaints. Instead they mostly work to make a sale, even if you are just calling for a repair they will make us try to sell you something first, if we don't we get docked for it. Management will always berate you if you do not make the sale or ""attempt the sale"". They also force you to ask fact finding questions, which is just a long way of being nosy and trying to recommend something someone doesn't need.  Not only was Apple awful to work for, but their customer base was even worse. It may be due to the hefty bloated price tag they pay. Apples 'goal"" was all about sales and meeting metrics, they didn't care how you made the sale. Just that you got the sale on almost every call. Even if it meant lying and talking up features or payments, that were in all honesty just minor scams on pricing with marked up interest (Smarter customers always caught onto the difference in price, and unfortunately you have to deal with that even if there's nothing you can do about it.). If you did not meet their sales quota even in the off season, you would get fired. It truly made me loathe the brand more than I did prior to having to learn about their shady ways. Glad to not be apart of that ""culture' any longer."
bad,"Even steve jobs got fired from his own company. That tells you everything. cut throat , unreasonable expections and in pursuit of perfection forgets we are all just human beings."
bad,"It's just a retail store that sells electronic products and accessories. Managers are horrible. They hound on you to sell accessories and assign salesperson in one area of the store to stand in for HOURS, they forbid any employee to employee interactions from time to time and managers do this all the time. They were not pretty consistent in what they dictate in terms of operating a store and when it's busy. The way I see it, it was not sustainable way of making a living if you want to do this full time. There are irate customers coming in the store to get their phone repaired and sometimes they get over booked causing customers to wait for hours. You end up having to deal with them and become verbally abused but to take it. In retail business, you always have to think the customer is right and kiss their feet. Management at this store was not really good and planned out. They rely on HS part timers to do the sales and operations of the store. It gets quite monotonous and how cliques are in the working environment is pretty strong band because they date each other, go out after work together and all that (most of them went to the same high school). After all I give this store a one star because they lacked accessibility solutions. As a deaf person I was discriminated at this job. I was passed on over by high schoolers for other positions of the store. I was discriminated by not being able to participate team meetings, I need an American Sign Language interpreter which I have dictated through out the course of training and onsite job placement. During work meetings they often"
bad,"Apple used to be a good company to work for, now they are mostly just ""cool"" with very little substance to back up the hype. Speaking from my experience in my department specifically, it was not a good place to work day-to-day, let alone try to build a career. They preached innovation, creativity, and ambition, but only encouraged it from certain people/certain personality types. A lot of blatant nepotism regarding promotions and career-building opportunities as well. Tons of micromanagement regarding basic functions like bathroom breaks or stepping away from the desk to provide peer coaching, etc, as it pertained to productivity metrics. When confronted point-blank about the discrepancy between annual review/raises and the abrupt cost of living increases (in a fast-growing metro area where they no doubt got tons of tax breaks for building their ""second HQ""), management was forced to admit that the cost of living here is not taken into consideration at all, the pay scale is tied to the average salary for the job title in question. So it's not as competitive as they'd like you to believe. This probably didn't impact executive & more specialized employees very heavily, but for the call-center oriented departments it became challenging to make bills and still feel a part of the quality of life & culture that Apple is so proud of. I started out super enthusiastic about being part of the company but grew disillusioned over time due to poor management at many levels & general ""replaceable cog in the machine"" attitude toward customer-facing staff."
bad,people love to backstab people constantly here. They also use alot of drugs just to cope with reality. Very few people ever advance without  sleeping with the manager and HR will fire you for reporting problems to them. Don't do it just don't.
bad,The pay was very low for the amount of the work they make you do. However they do have great training programs. I have learned alot from the training.
bad,"I would not recommend  this company. Training was rushed through and not very detailed. We were encouraged to ask questions, but they were never answered. The trainers claim was that there wasn't any time to do so."
bad,"management is an absolute joke, all they know how to do is to tell you what your numbers are and they think they are doing a great job by micromanaging people, and they will harass you about spending 1 minute (yes 1 minute) over the course of a month too long in break. Managers are incompetent, and all career advancements are all based on your numbers and personal favourites .....it is completely irrelevant if you are actually good at your job or not, and the people who gets promoted are all the bad eggs"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,Not a place to maintain sanity. It is fast paced and political. There is a lot of talk about development and structure but easily forgotten. This is at all levels of the company.
bad,"I was a female on a team of 25+ males and it was like living in a frat house. The management of this team and store were some of the worst people I have ever met in my life. Years ago, I worked with at-risk youth who had spent time in prison for killing people with their knives, they had stolen things, and were in violent gangs. These guys had more empathy and humanity than the people I worked under at Apple. The levels of hypocrisy are off the charts."
bad,Manager harassed co-workers. Corporate approved by allowing it to happen. Drug use was rampant at this location and management knew about it and did nothing.
bad,"Working here was great........the first month then reality strikes. Its high school all over again. Managers tracking you down while with customers to inform you of your break. You get paid vacation days but whats the use if you can't use them when you like. Pay compared to duties is a joke. Also when your sales are above a million a year and your compensation is 5% of that. They make you think that your work makes a difference lol. It's retail the guys in Cupertino are the ones creating the stuff. To put it simply OVER GLORIFIED RETAIL GIG. btw your paid a decent amount compared to other retail gigs but if you enroll in healthcare, the mandatory 401k plan and stock options your deductions are about 25% biweekly. So enjoy the benefits ;)"
bad,Apple as a company is a great company but the Newcastle branch has a terrible management team. The HR department at apple is centralised and not in-store and this means that the management team is rarely held accountable for their failures. A culture of bullying exists in the store and career progression is extremely limited and not based on hard work or even talent.
bad,This is a typical retail store with retail hours. Advancement is dependent upon who you know vs your work ethic. Management is not supportive. Communication is non existent. I do not recommend anyone who wishes to have a career to work here.
bad,Apple used to me the best place to work but it has gone down hill in recent years due to high pressure and no support. I stayed because of my coworkers only.
bad,"Dont do it, they change schedules. They'll tell you it's a set schedule but it's not. They give you false hope and if you dont past two test at the end of the crapp.y 3 week training they have you get terminated! HR or anyone higher than the trainer is IMPOSSIBLE to reach! They also do not care about your schedule or life at all!"
bad,"When you go to the first few days of training, all they talk about is how you don’t have a sales goal, we’re not supposed to push sales, and how they treat all their employees fairly. That is all false, sales are a big big part of the job and they want you to push every product and service however you don’t get commission at all. Managers will have their favorites and won’t care about anyone else. The atmosphere feels like you’re back in high school, a lot of drama and a lot of gossiping. I’ve had several things stolen from me by other coworker while on the job but the managers never cared. I was also sexually harassed several times by other coworkers."
bad,"Apple isn’t an honest company & is all about the money. Definitely didn’t have a work life balance. The managers never did anything and if you needed their help they made you deal with the customer yourself, so there was no point of managers."
bad,You are micromanaged down to the second and unfairly criticized for not meeting absurd goals across a varsities of products with hundreds of support articles to quote verbatim. Better buy in to the culture at Apple or you’ll quickly be recognized as an outcast and pushed out by management. They immediately pick favorites.
bad,"The job is too stressful for the pay. It’s not how the say it is. Management don’t stick up for the employees even when it’s not their fault They blame you if your internet not working properly, if they’re stuff not working properly and you will not get paid for it. It’s your fault no matter what. I didn’t like it and would not ever want to work for them again"
bad,"Working here is an actual torture. You will get no paid time off, only 24 hours of paid sick hours. They would not provide you a good salary... "
bad,Discriminatory company against minorities and people with handicaps or disabilities worse company ever work for in my 20 year career hope the go broke and fade to non existence like blackberry .
bad,They do not stand behind their employees and regardless of the situation it is always your fault. Horrible path for any progression and make tons of false promises.
bad,If you like your life and happiness don’t work here.  The management was a joke!  They will take all you have an ask you for more. Apple makes good products but when you work as a retail employee you are the infantry of the company a.k.a. disposable!
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"They use the shot gun approach to hiring and projects always hoping to land a winner. No employee development."
bad,"Them 95% of contractors are brought here with H1 visa from India. 3-4 People are squeezed into a single cubicle. No ergonomically set up work stations, they don't even have monitors. "
bad,"It started out at the technical support role and while we would get irate customers from time to time, it was still pretty good. Once they decided to call us ""customer support"" it went downhill from there. We literally got degraded to customer service, and so did the level of respect from both the customers and the company. It's sad to say that out of the 34 team members from my starting training class, I was the last to leave from the company. The reset moved onto better things and so have I."
bad,"There were Inappropriate advances made  toward me by one of the partner employees of Best Buy, and Apple never back me up on anything, in fact they offered me my same position back with the same guy that made the inappropriate advances."
bad,"On paper the Culture is Great, but in the stores it all a lie they only care about money. Once inside you stop being a person and become a cog in the machine that keeps the top people rich."
bad,"De los peores trabajos que he tenido, no es Apple, es una empresa que revende sus productos, cero atención al cliente y al empleado... Decepción total."
bad,"This company is horrible to work for they pay $10.50 as a supervisor. They treat everyone like they are stealing, when passing through a metal detector, getting waived and beeped by the scanner adds points to your behavior and determination for termination in the future. No future progress of incentive to stay and work for long time, no raises, no evaluation, no fairness of employee, and no respect from upper-management. I feel very bad when i worked at this company."
bad,"professional enviroment, friendly people , modern office and modern and up to date office computers , pay is low and no employee discounts."
bad,Answering inbound calls and learning about apple products.
bad,Unrewarding experience. Pay is terrible. Development is terrible. Management is never on the same page. Work life balance is non existent. HUGE turn over with staffing due to the fact that many leave the company because you can get paid better else where for the same sort of job.
bad,"If you have a backbone and want to bring something fresh to the table (talents, energy, ideas, innovation), look somewhere else. They Do discriminate against people who have a backbone and drive, regardless of how much of a team player you are. They punish you for their poor leadership and others lack of consistency, and prevent any mobility inside the company until you are re-educated and conform to their people-pleaser mentality. In my opinion, this company is as close to a closet-communist company as you can get."
bad,Useful for students and people in between jobs. I wouldn't recommend making this a full-time permanent job. It is very stressful and emotionally exhausting. I would often cry at work after having difficult customers yell at me.
bad,"Teams work in silos, there is very little collaboration because of competitiveness. Inexperienced managers who do nothing to guide their teams, and in fact make the hostile work environment worse. Its like trying to run a business in a junior high school. Definitely NOT a professional or positive place to work."
bad,"in apple all are good but lead and trainer behavior are not good. but, co-worker are to good .I like to work in apple because I learn a lot of things ."
bad,"Fiercely isolated company without any appreciation for commonly acceptable software development practices."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,Apple Retail is not Apple no matter how much they say it.  Retail is retail.  Advancement from the manager level is a joke.  If you don’t drink the Kool Aid for 5+ years you aren’t moving up.
bad,Chez Apple il n'y'a que l'argent qui compte. Les clients et employés ne sont qu'une formalité.
bad,Transcom is the worst at home company I have worked for. The pay is not comparable to the other work from home jobs that do the same technical support job - transcom pays less and charges more for health insurance. I made it through the training and my trainer was so uninformed and disorganized getting on the phones was a mess because no one was prepared and had no idea what they were doing.
bad,"I did not have a great time at Apple, there were to many PhD's so everyone was right and could not agree on anything which only compounded the problem of operating in a silo with everything being so Top Secret it was not secret at all."
bad,"Working at Apple is not wonderful. The benefits and campus are great, but the people are pretty terrible. The climate is extremely political and you must be in the office clique to get ahead."
bad,"This place will suck you dry of all your talent and youth and discard you with a fresh crew when they feel like it. Leadership treats everyone like children. Major lack of empathy or care for who you are as a person. They just want to see numbers and productivity at any cost, including your happiness."
bad,"I worked with people that I wouldn't have met anywhere else. The management is toxic, and very irresponsible. You meet people from around the world which adds perspective."
bad,Stressful and scary. You can one day go into work and then receive a call later that day telling you that there is a lay-off... Plan to not stay there unless they like you....
bad,"This app is the new essential way to clothes shop for kids when you do not have them with you. In fact it has been a huge success when used for adults too."
bad,"Typical day includes reporting for teams and meeting with managers, sales teams, and executives.  I've learned that it's more important to keep up appearances rather than produce.  It's better to look busy and panic with every escalation while working extremely late than it is to work smartly and calmly through your day with focused attention.  That is all."
bad,"pay was great, working there was like slave labor.hated it managers barked at you, people are disposable"
bad,"-Predictable work load throughout the day."
bad,"People in many departments at Apple seem generally unhappy. HR is unwilling to listen to real, true concerns about and problems with management. Instead you are told to ""play the game"". There is the typical corporate bureaucracy, except at Apple, it is worse than other companies. Salaries are about average or possibly slightly below average, but the above average benefits do help a bit."
bad,Managers are soulless for the most part and only care about numbers. They will lie to you and hurt your growth if they don't agree with your style of work. Typical retail environment and high stress despite not offering commission.
bad,Not all the stores are trash but some are! If you want to transfer to another location good luck! They would rather fire you than to see you prosper somewhere else
bad,"The hours that one works here are nice. Its a 40 hour work week and the pay is alright. I made $12.50 an hour while working there in 2016."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"The job started as a challenging and rewarding environment but I learned that to succeed, I needed to change and adapt and not to do as I was taught but to make up my own rules to make the customer happy. Apple plays tricks on their employees like stating that they will have to work Thanksgiving Day but then giving the employees the day off on the day before; leaving me without plans, alone, at home, and the disappointment of not getting holiday pay. Also, an team member committed suicide so Apple disbanded the team without much of an explanation or support, even though their claims are different."
bad,The department I worked in did not foster an environment of racial inclusion.  There were significant instances of off-putting racial jokes.  Management showed favoritism bias and did not support me.
bad,"Think long and hard about it. Theres a reason you never see the same employee twice. Over priced products, not worth the price. Mediocre work life balance, and worst part is that you barely make enough to survive. I especially on a single income. Forget trying to go to school, church and working here you'll be too tired and stressed to find the time. Honestly not sure why no-one has blown the whistle? Oh yeah we all signed non-disclosure."
bad,"My day was never really pleasant. It almost seemed like the company did not care for there employees. I was able to tolerate it there because despite how pressured it is to work there, I was paid a good amount of money."
bad,"Steve Jobs would not be happy with the way new employees are treated. Culture in AHA is unbearable"
bad,"Pays well, be prepared to be thrown under the bus by anyone, including your own team and manager. The janitors have PhDs, do you really think you'll get in?"
bad,"Ambiente di lavoro pessimo, sembra di lavorare in un regime, la compagnia che periodicamente controlla la vita personale dei dipendenti compreso instagram, whatsapp e Facebook."
bad,"The customers are brutal. Part time hours can be 39.95 hours a week, but don't you dare work 40. Just my experience. Maybe it's different now. Some people there really loved it, so I can only speak for myself."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Not many women in management roles in their retail channel.  No room for advance with very few career opportunities in the Retail Channel.  "
bad,"Its a giant open floor with small spaces to work, all computers you work on are not updated, multiple system crashes, unable to effectively perform job"
bad,"If you have recently graduated High School this is the job for you."
bad,"If you like talking about unethical and speaking about your personal life and race, this is the place for you. Management is the worst I have experienced.  Management curses at your job performance   Super micromanagement.  If I was to do it again, I would not."
bad,"This is blessing and a curse, as it gives the person with little previous experience the chance to gain top notch management experience. With so many unqualified managers running around though, it turns into a culture that fosters favoritism, and promotes based on networking, rather than actual job experience and talent."
bad,"work work work work"
bad,"Working at Apple is very difficult and emotionally draining."
bad,"I think it depends on your goals, values and intelligence to determine whether or not you'd like working here.  Theres a lot of compromise when it comes to their ethical standards, they talk big, but the general culture there is like their products…really expensive and don't actually add much value to the world.  They pay well if you're in it for the money, but also load on the work and really take advantage of the employees if they're able to."
bad,Hours varied. Worked very hard for very little money.  Customers are extremely difficult to help and talk down to you.
bad,a typical day was hard yet the company did walk you through the process appl;e is a temp service
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"3 - Three bad experiences as a contractor. I already said all the rest earlier. Competitive people, cold, poor management, no grow, underpaid contractors."
bad,"The management team is ridiculous!  Every female on that team is a power hungry twatwaffle!  They’re mean, they don’t care what your CSAT is like (measures the customers satisfaction) your metrics have to be 100 or you’re on an action plan right away!  I’ve never had a job stress me out as much as this company did! One of the managers told me to get an officers badge # when my neighbor was robbed and he was asking me question !"
bad,"The work there was very easy but they do not care about you and don't listen to any of your problems. Since it is a temp job, they will push you aside and will get new people to replace you. You get no paid vacation time and only 24 hours of sick leave."
bad,"Spent over 6 years of my life here.  Over-worked without benefits.  Revolving door of management.  Continually passed over for promotion to full-time, despite working full-time hours.  Cult-like work environment."
bad,"This company does not care about your actual job performance at all. Everything revolves around"" their culture"". The managers are really inexperienced and juvenile. Management likes to look for problems and gossip about staff to other staff and management. This is the worst company I have ever worked for. The pay is good. But it is not worth the harassment."
bad,I worked for the company a long time ago and the experience was not at all what i expected. The room for advancement was very slow to move forward. The location and environment were of a very poor quality. I was given promises for time off and was still reprimanded. My wife had our second child and i was soon fired after taking 4 days off the company felt this was a violation to the attendance policy and i was terminated and advised not to return to the location.
bad,"You get to work with great like minded and energetic people and the technology is amazing, however their is a big culture of favouritism with managers and co-workers. When a new role or position opens up they will hold “interviews” but the managers will already have their favourites picked to fill the roles. "
bad,"For physical issues because of manufacturing faults, Apple does not take responsibility whereas any other company feels it necessary to take it upon themselves to provide customers with a working device as promised. In cases like ambient light faultiness, Apple decides to create repair reductions for specific cases such as these causing customers to pay out of pocket for a repair that they were not responsible for"
bad,My area manager and manager were white trash and fired me for nothing. Ruined my life just to satisfy a power trip. I never had a write up nor a reprimand and they fired me for nothing
bad,"I started working here as a foot in the door, and I heard it was a great place to work. "
bad,Working at Apple has good and bad points. The benefits are great but it's hard work with little support and lots of moving around and changes.
bad,Clocked in. Went to the electronics department. Helped customers all day and ran the cash register. Got games and systems out of cabinets. Helped customers make good choices on tv's cameras and other electronic devices
bad,I help with day care sometime. Im still in school . I learned you need to be helpful Im many ways.
bad,"First of, pay is good."
bad,"I'm told where to stand, told to reapproach customers I just spoke with.  Never given complete training and had to learn on the fly.  No matter what I did, someone had to tell me I did it wrong.  I was given instructions on doing it right and another co-worker would say THAT was wrong and gave new instructions that were opposite of the first. Everyday I walked in there it felt like they were hazing the pledge."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"I was a seasonal employee at Apple at the Saddle Creek location. Before I get started with my review I want to say that my ratings is based off my job being there as seasonal and not as a full time employee. If things weren’t handled poorly like they were my review would be completely different. I hope this store actually reads this so they can make better improvement in the future. I enjoyed working there and it was a very dynamic yet fun work environment however many of us seasonals don’t appreciate how they waited last minute to let us know who can stay on permanent or who can leave. Also, when we got hired they kept putting emphasis on us being seasonal and to me it felt as if they were kinda downplaying our role there. Some of the workers there are cocky but not all. The hiring process is VERY selective and if you get in don’t mess it up for yourself, but the pay is ABOVE average than most jobs. IT IS NOT A COMMISSION BASED JOB but you can get paid between $16-$18+ depending on experience. Many people came into the store and saw how fun it seemed to us and expressed them wanting to work there. We ALWAYS had a line at the door before we opened but the customers and enviroment was fun. They made us feel like we were doing too much by grilling them for answers like our livelihoods and bills weren’t at stake and I feel as if they handled the entire process poorly. They weren’t taking it serious to me and it seemed like they didn’t care because it didn’t personally affect them. Don’t hire all these seasonals and sell a dream that we can stay on permanent just to not even keep"
bad,If you weren't besties with the manager you didn't feel like you belonged and you're and outsider. You have to make sure you have the newest shoes and are super hip. I felt like I was in High school again.
bad,"If your first and only jobs have been at Apple, you will likely have a fruitful career. If you come into Apple with significant external experience, you will have to overcome obstacle after obstacle, be questioned as to your strange and alien ideas, and be constantly on guard for people undermining your every move. It's a toxic environment on the best of days, and an absolute nightmare on the worst of days. People are placed into senior leadership roles who have no qualifications to be in those roles. "
bad,I was hired by apple and moved to Ireland with the possibility to become a Team Leader / Team Manager within one year do to my previous experience. How ever after my relocation and start at Apple i was told that the policies changed and i would not be eligible to move up to an TM so fast and i have to move step by step which will take at least 2 - 3 years. It seams a common practice at Apple to promise anything and everything to get people to move to Ireland and work here. Sadly many other employees are treated the same way and leaving again within the first year.
bad,"There is no work life balance, the expectation is that you will work any schedule with split days off. You are required to work holidays and there is very little room for advancement."
bad,"The only good thing about Apple's new hire experience is that they provide all the training, although the training is crammed into 4 weeks I think. I felt It was more like a high tech sweat shop.  You work long hours for minimal pay. You have to deal with irate customers and are required to get them off the phone within 12 to 15 minutes when it could take twice as long.  I just didn't feel it was worth the hassle and the lack of care from the administration.  I won't work for apple again!"
bad,"This company bought New Bell.  I worked there almost 19 years prior to this sale.  They gave me a raise and then out of the blue, let me go.  No explanation was given for my dismissal. I think it was so they could bring in their own people.  They did however give me severance pay.  The loyalty  was there on my part, not on theirs."
bad,I loved the people I worked with except management.  They do not know how to develop you and have barely any knowledge.  You could have your masters and they still won't promote you even if your numbers are great and have a ton of knowledge.  We don't get paid enough for the amount of work that we do.  Great for a college job but anything after that no way.  You have a store leader who cares more about shopping.  You have managers who treat their employees like they are five.  Also the management team freak out if you aren't working with a ton of customers but customers hate how we multi task.  The employees that are new are not nearly as qualified as they had to be when I started.  Also Apple doesn't care about training as much as they used to yet want us to know it and doesn't allow time for the employees to learn.
bad,A typical day at work was always stressful it was like walking on egg shells every day. And the management was never organized throughout the day. But I did learn a lot while working with the company which I would take them skills thought-out life. Hardest part is just the call center environment just need to stay away from the rest of the advisor and managers.
bad,"Apple is fairly relaxed which I like but there is no real possibility of advancement here, you may aspire to go up to maybe a lowly manager but there is really very little opportunity here."
bad,"The place started out as an interesting place to work, it was amazing to meet new people each day and help them with their products. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that Apple is not a place to start a career, when there is so much corruption when it comes to advancing. This place relies on sucking up to management to advance, there is no professional atmosphere. I seen and heard many unprofessional conduct from managers getting away with switching out their beaten products with new ones to managers harassing other employees. I find it disgusting that a place that strives for equality in a workplace is so discriminating to employees when they want to advance, if you want to pursue any career in apple, you quickly learn it's whose butt you can kiss and that managers are useless and do what they want; there is no supportive structure, the managers will gang up you, if you speak out against them. They will put their favorites in newly opened positions, while employees that been working their butt off for years are left in the dust. Coworkers can not be trusted, they will smile with you then go behind your back to management to tell them lies so they can get the heads up to the newly opened positions. The only reason I'm still there is it's difficult to find work. I recommend any individual who is trying to built a career and wants to treated with respect and appreciated for their work, should stay clear of apple retail. The place will break you, take up all your free time, abuse working hours, and leave you wishing you never took a sip of the apple coolaid."
bad,When I did my interview vs working there It was totally different. If you have confidence and are good at your job it's very competitive and not that comfy of a work environment.
bad,"too much stress for too little money. No customers calls in without being upset, you run them around in circles, which causes the agents to look stupid because you know they've already done all of this stuff before you can escalate to someone who can actually help them."
bad,"Apple is a great company to work for. However, too many new managers coming in with different styles of leadership that do not match Apple standards. ."
bad,"Typical day at work involves 12 to 14 hours. You also bring work home and work over weekends. Easily 70-80 hour work weeks through the year."
bad,You are just a number. The benefits and salary are very good but mental and physical health take a hit after some time. I would not recommend working for Apple in the AppleCare Advisor role.
bad,"Apple is great if you want to work for an unscrupulous company. The management is over paid and under performs, and does not support pursuit of greatness."
bad,"Apple is great if you want to work for a company with no morals regarding people protection. The management is over paid and under performs, and does not support pursuit of greatness."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"While i worked at apple, i was given no chance to study at university, by this, i mean i was fired because they were unable to give me (even though i asked countless times) the days off i needed to attend my lectures and seminars. I was also not allowed to say goodbye to any of my colleagues and was escorted out the store by a manager. absolutely ridiculous!"
bad,"No money, poor payment, Never hired, Never released from Agency"
bad,good benefits
bad,"Overall Apple seems like a great place to work as a full time permanent employee. But as a contractor you will be treated differently. Contractors are expected to perform at the same level but without access to the necessary tools to complete basic tasks in their role. And will be penalised when basic tasks cannot be completed. In IS&T itself, attitudes to contractors are very unhealthy and conducive to a passive aggressive and bullying workplace. Management styles for mid level managers are outdated and counter productive. "
bad,"Being subcontracted, like many of the people working under the name Apple, it has a very strong second citizen feeling to it. Very poor benefits, situated in one of the most expensive areas in the city, yet not paying enough to be able to afford food around work."
bad,"Micromanaging,sweatshop,assembly line, time clock punching  glorified being baby sat, with no real rights nor privlages. Being treated like an over paid slave and under paid robot."
bad,"repetitive and they don't pay good at all, not recomandable"
bad,This company does not value employees. Pay is far less than what is deserved and they like to pile on extra duties as time goes on.
bad,I’ve enjoyed working at Apple because their culture is emphasized on creating lifelong skills. We follow a guide to explain the expected competencies in the different roles in the store. This help to promote movement because of the understanding of these competencies. They give you time and offer support to help improve your personal growth.
bad,I had the worst supervisor ever and they would not transfer me to another one.  I was supposed to be contacted again by another supervisor and they never contacted me.
bad,"Apple bows continually to the genocidal Chinese regime. By bowing to them they are legitimizing the deeds of the Chinese Government. I no longer wish to be associated with this company, or any company that accedes to China's demands."
bad,I want to do job in apple company  for sales executive my qualification is bba first year my aim is to work at company for experience  and develop the apple product
bad,I enjoyed my contract position at Apple because it gave me the opportunity to advance my technical skills as well as my communication skills. It allowed me to gauge my skills and see what is required in the video conferencing field and working with Cisco products.
bad,"It was ok I just don’t want to be on the phones 24/7. The call center environment isn’t for me anymore."
bad,The company presents itself as supportive and motivating but is more like a  dead end. There is no room for growth. They pigeon hole you into one position.
bad,"Por el trabajo que haces el pago es malisimo. Vacaciones deficil de tener. Caso nunca te lo dan cuando lo quieres, tampoco hay semanas juntas. Todos son ""selfcreated ídolos"" y no saben que hacen, sobre todo la conversación entre ellos no funciona.  Apple en España esta representado por Sellbytel or últimamente llamado Zelda en Barcelona. NO LO RECOMENDÓ A MI PEOR ENIMIGO!!!!"
bad,"I thought working from home would be perfect, but it is just as stressful with this company and Kelly Connect. Management plays favorites and holds others back from moving around company"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"Beware of entering and applying for this job..I applied to work for my local Apple store in Exeter. I received a phone call from Apple to say that I had got to the interview stage, and that the interview would be held in the store itself and I booked a time. I double checked and asked again if the store was definitely the interview location and was informed it was."
bad,Its Mainly stressful because of management. And there is no freedom they don't even allow doctors notes if you have to go to an appointment.
bad,"Learned multiple things that Apple had to offer."
bad,Your going to be placed on an assembly line and be trained by the employee next to you instead of the actual trainer there. Work is very easy anybody of all ages and technology experience can do the work. Your not actually an Apple employee as all work is through temp job agency
bad,Volt is horrible. Pay isn't fair at all. Pegatron is a horrible company. They don't have your back. Co-workers get away with things that are wrong. Management with volt was horrible.
bad,They play favorites in promotions instead of promoting those that deserve it. It is like High School for with Adults. And if you don't go hang out with the managers there you are an outcast and don't deserve promotions.
bad,"This job does not car if you want more for yourself out of life. My fiance was murdered and i had a funeral to get together. They wanted me to come to work after his funeral. i was not paid bereavement either, after submitting the most personal information to them. they messed up my check and took $1,000  from me for a $500 mess up on their end. Also, in the interview I told them that I was in school and that I was on my third year. Agreed to take a leave for them to get me a schedule to accommodate and when it was time to go back, I was called on my off day and told that they would not accommodate but let me go. They have a very high turnover rate and when people are not happy they offer more money but cut hours. No insurance is offered and they do not have any real benefits except keep working and they will keep giving you bonuses as long as you stay on the clock. If you are sick, you can find yourself on unemployment, if you get it. And read the fine print before signing th job agreement."
bad,"The summary really sums it up - if you work for Apple as a contractor or consultant or vendor - prepare to be treated like a piece of trash. While FTEs get the world at Apple and tons of freedom and liberty (not to mention great benefits), outside/contingent staff are pretty effectively abused and looked down upon. Prepare to be excluded from every fun or interesting thing going on at Apple, including team-building exercises, parties, paid meals and special announcement events, etc. I've worked as a vendor or consultant at dozens of companies in my 25 year career and never was one so segregated as Apple."
bad,"if you like doing the same thing every single day and working for twenty-something managers with almost no life experience, then this is the perfect job for you."
bad,Great part time job for those who have not entered into the work force however the culture and climate is not conducive to those that value structure.
bad,"Everyone well likable and interesting, high diversity of people from all corners of the earth which is eye opening"
bad,The work itself is quite interesting and never boring. The information flow and communication from managers is dismal. Compensation is also really low. But it has as benefit understanding how technology companies work.
bad,"I heard it depends on the store but who knows. At first everything seems nice but they over work you and under pay you for the work you do. Dealing with toxic people on a daily basis and customers that walk all over you. Management only cares about their numbers, pay checks, and bonuses and good luck seeing the store manager more than 3 times a month. The team itself is stressed out and management only blames us."
bad,This company does not follow its mission. They are in the top 3 worse companies I have ever worked with. Management HR is horrible. If you want job security go elsewhere
bad,"I worked there 7 months before resigning. It was dark with no windows, and made you feel like you were going mad. The management was only there half the days you were and managed too many people to care about you or your commitment to the company. You are just a number to them. Between the customers screaming at you for their broken phone, the family of a lost loved one trying to retrieve information you couldn’t provide, and the nonstop queue that never gave you a moment to breathe, I can accurately say it was a nightmare."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"Une belle culture d’entreprise qui se perd, c’est dommage"
bad,"Constantly reminded that you are only a temporary employee and expendable. toxic work culture, (corporate and management). Fellow employees were amazing, we lifelong friendships. Mostly defending and supporting ourselves from management. The use of languages and co-workers were definitely the high point. Working in a room with so many other cultures; I learned so much from them. Nothing from corporate that I already didn't know, with the exception of their policies, which mostly contradicted other policies and were always changing."
bad,"Bad management, poor safe working involvement. The company treat people as number. Holidays and business request keep weeks to be approved. "
bad,"Overall at the beginning it was fun.  After a week, one can see how lacking management style was inferior, not becoming of a major brand company.  Very cut-throat co-workers and no loyalty to customers.  Unethical selling techniques towards customer who are unaware of the tricks to sell what they didn't need."
bad,"They only care for certain individuals as far as promotions and hours go. Work-life balance is nonexistent, mangement is a complete joke. They will blatantly lie to your face just to get you to stop coming forth about your concerns. I’ve received derogatory comments from a lead and had another lead try to convince me to quit Apple and go to my other job full time. I eventually put in my two weeks under pressure but quickly took it back. They told me they’d already send the request through and that there’s nothing they could do for me. Mind you, I performed very well and had a lot of customers who loved to come to me only. I displayed good work ethic and a great attitude and was basically slapped in the face when they told me they couldn’t do anything. I later found out that you have until the end of your two weeks to change your mind but that was not the case for me. Not to mention, I agreed and signed for $17/hr and later found out I was only getting paid $16.50/hr the entire duration of my employment. It’s really disgusting the things I experienced in my time at Apple but if you’re willing to step on toes to get where you want, this is the job for you."
bad,"If you enjoy working in a silo, horrible Management that will degrade you and see their best employees thrown in the trash, employees that will treat you like you don't exist....then Apple is the place for you!"
bad,"Apple culture is rooted to its strong entrepreneurial culture. "
bad,"You will work long hours and others will steal credit for your accomplishments. I would never advise anyone to work for apple unless you care more about ""Working at apple"" than living a decent life."
bad,"Disaster Place to work for. No help at all. You feel that you are alone."
bad,"given impossible deadlines, blamed for higher ups failings. constantly stressed and pressured to do overtime, and no credit for much of the work we did."
bad,You will work yourself into a state of ill health and then they will lower your job rating when you are not keeping up with the pace that requires your 24/7 attention to meeting your schedule and product end points.
bad,"If you want to stay in IT , Apple looks amazing on your resume .... the incessant customer calls will drive you insane as they expect you to only be on the phone 7 minutes per call and most issues go well beyond 7 minutes ... Don't expect much help from your manager in the way of suggestions they only push you to senior members of the teams that can meet the goal and tell you to mimic what they are doing .... other than the pay and benefits being pretty good the rest of the job leaves a lot to be desired"
bad,"The Apple Store is awful. It is the antithesis of Apple. I was scheduled to work at times I had previously cleared to be off on multiple occasions, the time & attendance time clock frequently didn't work resulting in my hourly pay being shorted, management pressured me to sell more without providing training or time to familiarize myself with the products I did not have access to myself, staff were abusive and difficult to work with. "
bad,"If you're looking for a job that might get you a full time position with Apple, look elsewhere. You are expendable at this position regardless of what your supervisors may tell you, you are still just a contractor. If you're good at it, you may get extra responsibilities but you won't be paid more, because that's through your contractor. As a contractor, you won't be entitled to nearly anything, all of Apple's major perks go to Apple Employees and they make sure you know it."
bad,"The company could be really great but has its issues surrounding its policies, work culture and professionalism. If you are a first-time job seeker... it can be a nice start."
bad,The atmosphere is very draining. This may be similar in other call centers. The hours and the pay are the worst i've ever experienced. There is little room for advancement and if if you did advance the pay is still minimal and the hours don't allow for much of a life outside of work.
bad,"Logging into the System and receive calls on various technical issues."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,was a freindly envioument but we always closed early and manger was always late. however i played a be role and was very inderpendant.
bad,"While the company itself is great to work for, the management structure of retail is atrocious and needs to be completely redone. Shareholder pockets and market goals run everything, not employee satisfaction. It’s an overly aggressive retail atmosphere and the pay is way to low for the level of work produced. I am absolutely relieved to be rid of that place."
bad,"My first 9 years as an Apple (Engineer) Employee were great; however, as a retail employee or contractor, Apple Work/Life balance and commensurate pay have a lot to change."
bad,Great as a temporary position. Not the kind of place you would want to work for very long. Benefits are good. Pay is low. Schedule does not support a healthy live work balance.
bad,If you’re a talented educated employee who knows a lot about technology this might not be the place for you. Anybody can do this job. I was not impressed with the difficulty or the compensation
bad,"Contractors are treated like second-class citizens. Absolutely no help in career advancement. No paid vacation, only the barest minimum paid sick leave."
bad,They don’t pay enough for how much stress and pressure they put on you. Recently they have been hiring folks with little to no experience for as much or more than tenured employees.
bad,"It was like working for a start up that had tons of money  "
bad,Worked at this place as a senior computer technician and also mac multimedia wireless tech for networking. Worst experience you don't get to choose times you work and you don't have job assurance one missed call after 3 years of work and i was fired because of a single call back. Also they cleaned the house with everyone else in my department just before i got wiped and all of them also for no reason to be fired at all. I still go to apple stores and ask stupid questions to them like whats a manual migration or how do you use terminal commands etc and no one can ever answer to this day and don't even get me started about airport issues. This company need an overhaul from the inside out wish I was still working at a higher level in this company so i can show how things need to clearly be done. Customer service in this company dropped huge and its lack of knowledge about your own products that makes it happen.Oh also the boss at this job kept trying to sell me weed so again good management koodos to apple.This was also not just a one time experience have many friend who went through the same stuff with this company
bad,"Apple tends to consume your life, discouraging having a life (or mental health at all) outside of your work. While the compensation is fairly good (unless you are transgender) you have no job security at all as you can be replaced at any time without any communication or warning even if you are salaried with a contract. Management is very bad at communicating the status of work with you and as a result it's a stressful and toxic work environment."
bad,"I really liked my job but I  quit on management and not on my work."
bad,"I’ve worked at several call centers and Apple’s is the busiest. Stay away if you want to keep your sanity. From long delays in management response to an average of three seconds between calls, it made for a soup of stress."
bad,"This job represents a low point in my career and it allowed me to see first hand how corporate America does business. I was grossly under paid by an outsourced company, hired by Apple to maximize profits at the expense of its staff and who fained respectability hiding behind the cloak of contract worker where those very workers were taken advantage of while being expected to maintain standards that flew in the face of common sense and the resources provided to do the job."
bad,Ineffective management.  Little to no direction or training offered to employees. Data center duties include managing vendors and site upkeep. Morale continues to be difficult.
bad,"The only positive was the benefits. I received full benefits as a part-time employee. "
bad,"It is a great company in business. However it is not the company that values employees like they claimed.  "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"Conduent is the company that I work for and Apple is their client. Conduent as a company is sorry, poor scheduling, unorganized, sudden changes daily on the job. Apple itself is all right to work for overall, but its customers are immature and unreasonable, which makes the job stressful. During the release of new products: especially the iPhone: it is a terrible time to work in customer service for them. Not much support and you're left alone to be ""eaten alive"" by their customers."
bad,"I had a specific schedule I logged into the phone to take inbound calls.  I get a call and take calls and have to meet specific metric for how long on a call, what you did on the call, how much time was spend between inbound and call so you had to go directly into receive a new call as soon as the previous call ended.  The customer did feed back on you as to how the call was handled.  I thought the hardest part was getting notes in the account and troubleshooting the issues.  It was best to have templates and word expansions for the notes but then you worked so many different products sometimes I would forget the template code name I created, especially if it was a call I did not have often.  I loved the job for the most part.  Did not like the scheduling that was what I disliked the most."
bad,"No interest in developing staff or seeing them succeed and would not address workplace issues. Although management were poor, the other staff really do make a difference to the atmosphere so it's not all bad. This role helped me to develop my rapport building skills  which has really helped me excel in jobs since."
bad,My job involved working with offshore and also leading the team. The team had only contractors that didn't know basic difference between  Map and List. They came to me with problems involving performance and many others. Dev work needs a lot of intellectual power but my manger hired sub par contractors from Wipro and Infosys. They needed lots and lots of guidance throughout their task. This left me stressful and manager never was supportive. He always said that was my job. I eventually left and am very happy about my decision.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Apple but I just think it was not the right fit for me. If you are interested in drinking the cool-aid then go for it. The management in the store was lacking, I think it is a company where working at HQ would be great but you are forgotten at the store level and there are lot of people that are willing to take your place."
bad,"Extremely stressful job where you're never truly rewarded for the outstanding customer service you are demanded to perform. You constantly bend your back over for customer but whenever something in your life occurs and you need your managers assistance; forget it. You're treated like a robot. 5 minutes to the use the bathroom for the entire day. Management will help you promote, if they ""like"" you."
bad,"Apple was a great retail environment once upon a time. I can only speak on the Southpark store in Charlotte,NC. In the beginning it was a positive working environment. We had talented people who all pulled their weight. We had management who treated us as responsible adults. We had a reasonable expectation of an occasional weekend off. Then management changes came and all of that went out of the window. We hired a crew of typical retail managers better suited to run a Walmart or Burger King than the worlds premier technology company. The so-called ""fearless feedback"" culture degenerated into whining whenever someone didn't say something ""just right."" Several leaders were so notorious for micro managing employees; many of us resigned, due to stress. People with strong metrics are nit picked, and made to work harder, while others are allowed to milk the clock. Open door policy is a myth. Feedback to management is met with retaliation. The concepts of ""perception is reality"" and ""positive intent"" only work in their favor. Apparently managers aren't expected to exemplify the credo. They either deflect with canned defenses or, they play semantics games. Taking a single word you say, and repeat it back; slightly changing it's meaning. ""So what I hear you saying is..."".  If you are not a ""yes man"" you will be immediately labeled as ""negative."" If you have a suggestion to make things better you are a ""trouble maker."" The pay is good for a retail store. The benefits are top notch, just be prepared, this comes at a price. Learn everything you can. Absorb it all. Put it on your resume,"
bad,"There is a lot of work to be done, with some fun and lots of seriousness.  Management can be demanding, but get easily confused.  Work with many different players and teams."
bad,"Management needs to communicate the goals of the organization. "
bad,"* Little to no training during the 6 week training process."
bad,"Seems like hard work doesn't get you very far. Kissing up is what does. The company has great benefits and I hear other markets other than South Fl are much better. They rather hire external managers than develop from within, which is a shame for a company like Apple."
bad,"tough culture with little opportunities.  Tend to promote people who are good at a single thing.  No support from HR in fact,  you should avid HR if possible"
bad,"Apple is a very innovative company with a plethora of items to offer customers. A typical day consists of hard work, and depending on your schedule you may not have much of a life / work balance. Since things are always changing at Apple this does include management. Since starting I have been through a number of managers each with their own rules and regulations."
bad,"Unless you desire to grovel of kiss mgrs butt you may not end up doing what you do best. Had poorly qualified lead genius (got job cause no one else wanted it) who I treated in professional manner but would not kiss up or pretend he was competent or fair in his dealings with people so remained at lower level jobs when I had proven proficiency as an educator (23 years teaching experience ) and instead ran around trying to help customers with broken phones and iPads in 10 minute appt limits.  Unhealthy stress levels as we booked more Genius Bar appts than we could truly attend to and 3-4 ""managers"" stood around looking like they were in charge wondering why your not running from person to person or if you took break at correct time. Pay no attention to the person behind the curtain BS  Very hard to find a real person who would actually call out inequalities or point out the emperor w no clothes, should be honored to work for apple (or clapple as mngrs insisted on clapping butts off for reaching meaningless goal - so fake and if you don't love it or are not a robot you apparently need more kool aid). Loved the customers and helping them with ANY problem they may have (even if there wasn't an apple solution for it or it took longer than a 10 min appt). "
bad,Productive place to work. But Lacks management and morals and respect for their employees
bad,The hours are outrageous and you have no life. During the holidays the hours are crazy early. The name is well known but the way the employees are viewed are not satisfactory.
bad,it was a at home job was very cool. pretty easy and i learned alot
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"All consuming, draining, low pay. If you are still blinding by the Cult of Mac then this is the place for you. If you want to love your job and still have a life, this is not the place."
bad,"Apple don't employ people, they have intermediate companies hire you and buy your effort as a service from that company. This makes for an immediate division between those that are actual employees and those that are not."
bad,If I had known then what I know now I would have declined this job. Apple cares very little about their contractors even though the contractors did the majority of the work (in my department). If you apply for an Apple position you will get automatically declined based solely on being a contractor for them.
bad,"For the most part Apple gave me initial tools to excel in all aspects of my life. After 7 years the job seemed to plateau. There was no more room for advancement and the per year raise was barely over yearly inflation. I learned a lot at Apple for sure. The only things that were difficult about working there were; you didn't really think for yourself, everything was micromanaged, outstanding performance was overshadowed by a managers comradery with an employee that potentially didn't do as well.   "
bad,Pay is okay but the culture is pretty toxic. There are some people who really shouldn't be allowed to code yet they're hired for whatever reason. They are 'programmers' who play more with politics than codes.
bad,"This is a good entry level job for anyone looking for consistent pay."
bad,"Due to Apple hiring people via Volt, management here is and was a pain. Reason was due to you only being able to speak to a Volt Manager (Which they had only 2 of them for 45 different teams that supported different Apple products) and before they did anything, no investigations are launch, so you are at the grace of your Apple Manager which can't instruct you on what to do unless he/she likes you."
bad,"Good job option for working at home, computer provided. Training and professionalism lacking. Scripts, coaching and working holidays required. Bonuses and promotions are not clearly outlined."
bad,"Salem NH Apple store management needs to get thier head out of each others bungholes.  Part time position I interviewed with 4 different layers of management, team leader, store manager, district manager, regional manager over 3 weeks time all separate interviews.  You think they could be more efficient and have one group meeting.  Can you say top heavy management, must be justification for the management group to protect their salaries.  What the store needs to continue to invest in staff that truly works with the customers.  The term Genius should not be used at this store."
bad,It was a a home position. I had to help existing apple customers with their issues mostly about forgetting password for apple ID. Lost and also more information about apple products
bad,"Mostly work focused in production and products. Follows the company culture and ethics. Productive work in a fast paced, very flexible  environment where delivering finished goods in a time constrained workplace. Work was enjoyable and fun."
bad,Company is difficult to work for. Inadequate training for products especially Mac. Help from management was not available without a struggle. Multiple people including me went out in leave because of mental stess
bad,"there is a nice game room available to you when off the clock. The custodian is nice, and keeps is clean. Huge building lots of parking space. Great filtered water available for all employees."
bad,"A typical day at my job is stressful management is very micromanaging always checking on you.  It makes you feel like you were at a prison. The bad thing about Apple is you have a bad manager you won't be able to transfer Dept nor move up to take another position even if you were selected for another position if your manager doesn't approve you won't be able to transfer.  You always have to ask permission from your manager.   My manager at my Dept won't let me move to another department to grow my career path what im passionate off and good at. Every time I try to move up she blocks my path to move forward.  I was offered and selected for another position I had applied within Apple and she didn't gave me the permission to move."
bad,"Useless management, cultish behaviour. I was forced to stay after work to watch a Eulogy for Steve Jobs. Nine out of ten people had no knowledge of computers whatsoever."
bad,"Decent company to start out for, they indoctrinate you pretty well. Discount was amazing, and my initial manager was awesome, but he was new to our group as well. Managers who had been a part of the group for a while were jaded, as were the rest of the people in the group. First two promotions happened within a year, and moving beyond that was hard. Had recommendations from every manager I had to go into management, but kept getting passed over just because I didn't have a college degree, despite being the one who trained the new managers on all the technical aspects of the job. This position actually isn't hired on anymore and is done through vendors, and when asked about it i was told by a director ""This is how the industry does it, so we are just being moved more in line with everyone else"". Getting mandatory OT at the last minute is always fun, especially when it's open to close with 6 hours notice."
bad,"I was a member of the Business team at Apple Retail, so the position was largely communicating with in-store customers about business needs. The role was interesting; I did well."
bad,"Since Steve left us the retail area of Apple has suffered greatly. Not at first but within 2-3 years after his death. Customers get less services than ever, wait times and store traffic has increased to ridiculous numbers. There simply is no work life balance. And even closing in on 10 years $41k is the best they can do ... FYI my annual reviews look and sound amazing on paper. So much any other company would’ve promoted me multiple times. My fault for settling I suppose. Even Jobs said, “Never settle”."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,It’s not a bad gig as long as you stay distanced from becoming too in love with the company. They promote culture and loving your job but it’s still a business and money is the bottom line. This job doesn’t set you up for any type of technical work outside of Apple as anytime you want to progress in those fields it’s seen as a conflict of interest
bad,"very unorganized: "
bad,"it is overall good job fo the person who does not have any certificate and experience. It only ask you to be on time and follow their rules and regulation. If you can do that, then you will be fine."
bad,"had a very serious stalking situation and worked as an executive for 8 years. Instead of helping, my very new manager had a panic attack and reported my concern,"
bad,"If you are looking to just pick up a decent paycheck with no real experience, then this is the place to be. The hiring feels like they are randomly pulling names out of a hat. For a retail job, it pays more than average, however, for the amount of stress you are put through, it is not worth it. They preach about how much they care about work/life balance and how much they care about their people, but do not actually stand by it."
bad,"Disgustingly toxic political environment, rife with back stabbing and incompetent micro-management. Like an abusive relationship that keeps you roped in because it keeps you alive just enough to drain you so it can keep that revolving door spinning."
bad,"I was a Concierge. The concept, borrowed from hotels, did not translate properly and didn't work well in a retail setting. "
bad,Allows some autonomy depending on the role.  Does not allow much room for error or failure.  Your manager like most companies can make or break your experience with the company.
bad,It is a great transitional job or if you do not have a family. But benefits are horrible and the pay is low. It is virtually impossible to schedule for future appointments or engagements as the schedule changes daily and weekly and no two back to back days off unless you just get luck the that week. Rules and the way that are handled are to benefit Kelly Connect only not the employees. Only perks are you work from home and you get paid every week. But with a low pay you still have to pay your own data connection not a real balance over all.
bad,"There is a reson of the turn around on the employees."
bad,"The management because you're having to communicate over FaceTime is very disconnected. If you're unhappy all they do is basically tell you that this might not be a good fit for you, even when asking for a reasonable relocation I was consistently turned down. Maybe the stores are better, but working from home is the worst."
bad,"Worked in a huge room with about 150 people.  It was as cold as a refrigerator.  During training, the trainers/coaches were good.  We then got our permanent assignments and group leaders.  Stealing other peoples work was fine, since it made the team leader look good.  It was so competitive, people were rude and hostile.  Accuracy was not an issue, just speed.  Managers were often degrading and mean.  Not worth the late hours and pay."
bad,"Data Center Break Fix Technician"
bad,"A Macstore é uma empresa de bastante solidez no mercado. Não é uma empresa nova no mercado e dispõe de produtos variados e de qualidade em relação ao ramo em que se insere, porém, no que diz ao tratamento dos seus funcionários ela peca bastante. Não há comissão, não há incentivo ou qualquer outro tipo de benefício para o melhor vendedor do mês. Além disso o vale refeição é quase nulo."
bad,"A system where the employee is not promoted to grow and prosper, poor salary and bonus structure extra hours unpaid. Tyical day included being micromanaged and undervalued, a poor structure system and incorrect job descriptions."
bad,Achieved challenging cosmetic parts with different technology. it make everyone think out of the box with the tight tolerance and cosmetic requirement.
bad,"Apple's culture is still vertical integration."
bad,"Took many incoming calls."
bad,"The Mac Store is one of those businesses that is just big enough and has been around just long enough to not be able to get out of it's own way.  The company has made some really poor electronic infrastructure decisions in the last few years and refuses to abandon some of its antiquated systems in favor of more efficient and modern solutions.  The parent organization seems to be too top heavy with more administrative support and in-house technology development.  Front line employees lack reasonable compensation.  As a result, retention of talent is an ongoing and unaddressed problem.  The business is slow to recognize trends and opportunities in its sector and clumsily responds to them when it does.  There are a lot of good intentions and a lot of really great people working at all levels of the mac store.  However, the business is doomed if it can't make some better systemic changes in the near future."
bad,"I answer calls for apple lvl 1 tech support about mac and mac pro laptops. help customer  resolves issue with the product and sell item to help out. handle stressed out customer over the phone when they are mad about the product goes down."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"This place was okay when I first started, but then it went down the drain after a few weeks. Management was horrible. They always played favoritism, and never cared or helped with things. They would just go straight to firing if it was something they didn't like."
bad,"I worked in Apple for two and a half years as a technical support. The volume of calls was very high. I only had 7 seconds free time between calls.What's worst, the lunch time was only 40 mins and this situation lasted from the first day I joined Apple till the end of 2011. While advisers were busy at work, the managers always had time for making jokes and talking nonsense. When the emergencies happened, they never provided any helpful advice.Pushing the duty is their best way to handle them.The whole AppleCare department only cares about the good result of customer's surveys, which uses to justify your performance of work.Your good other aspects, they won't care.The management always advocated how good Apple was and how many good opportunities they provided.So far, I haven't seen any.These kinds of bad things only happened in AppleCare department. However, I have experienced something bad and there is no any expectation on other departments of Apple."
bad,"Meet customers, refer products, diagnose malfunctions and fix mobile iOS devises, conduct training and workshops for staff and customers."
bad,Not a Productive place TO work and contracors are treated badly. No propercommunication chanell to express. No work life balance. Not a place to learn.
bad,Apple doesnt follow the same core value that it started with. it became an un-enjoyable place to work and I wouldn't recumbent it for people trying to improve their lives with more money and a management opportunity for any room for growth I personally know people who are well deserved the have been in the same spot for over 7-12 plus years .. hard pass
bad,"The company does a great job of including everyone. But just as many corporations, higher management trust departments to the area and team managers who do not do a good job or aren't well prepared to take on the roles. Promotions are biased and team managers choose whoever they like best vs the best-qualified professionals. This discourages most professionals to pursue a role. The favoritism is very apparent and there is no transparency in the internal hiring process. They should leave the hiring process with the recruiters and HR specialists rather than having team managers pick whoever they want."
bad,Leadership is lost and does not enforce a culture of inclusion and one's perspective has no weight. Store leaders are completely selfish and all good people are leaving the company.
bad,"Apple is a great company, and some teams are awesome; however, my team we led by people who where more interested in promotion than doing their current job. We have three project owners and the worst project manager I've ever worked with."
bad,Information is not pertinent to future job opportunities. While the information could help others I will abstain my review of past work experiences with Apple.
bad,"Learning and training environment.  Addressed customer service inquires in a timely professional and accurate manner.Provided information to answer questions, troubleshoot issues, and resolved complaints. Multi tasked across 4 system applications, analysed and resolved technical issues, and comfortably navigated a virtual work environment."
bad,"I worked for Apple through a third party. The third party company was very nice and helpful throughout the interview and hiring process. Training was about 3 weeks and the hours were non-negotiable and inconvenient. Training is also not very helpful to you when you actually get on the phones. You are told you will get one type of call, and are trained on that. However, you get all types of calls regarding tech support. Management is not very pleasant and helpful after training. Hours are also inconvenient. You do not have the option to have hours changed. Would not recommend working for Apple through a third party."
bad,"I have worked in several big companies in the Silicon Valley. This has been so far the most political environment I have worked in. Changes are decided on the higher levels and pushed down the organization, often with very little opportunity for teams to provide feedback.  Working in a project management function I found lack of project management framework and insufficient tools in place to support data driven project tracking and reporting; I have only discovered fragments of conventional as well as Agile methodologies applied to projects. To my surprise project management appears to be a very manual driven function."
bad,It is not a good environment for me since there were too many works. There were so many stress related to job environment. I don't like such environment.
bad,"Very few company are using apple laptop  .So we had few opurtunity to grow up in this field.There was no more engineer was required and apple laptop are high capacity laptop ,rearly problem comes on it"
bad,"If your a 20-something you will love it, but if you have any skills as a professional, forget about it.  This place is ran like a spring break bar b que. come to work in swim trunks, flip flops, with no personal hygiene and that's Okay! Managers spend more time goofing off with these 20 somethings than actually being leaders because they know the products sell themselves and they don't need to work to do anything. They may hourly people well, but unless you kiss up and play the game, you will not get anywhere.  Its a total waste of time if you intend on being a professional."
bad,Apple phone support is a soul crushing job. if you dont mind talking to inept rude people who feel they are entitled to the unfettered experience of the Apple staff. People refuse to understand or accept that there are educational programs required to use certain products and also refuse to consult documented resources available online.
bad,"Decent Job nothing special than selling apple care to customers. I took calls and directed customers to where they needed to be to get the help they wanted, very simple job."
bad,"They treat you very fair and pay you very well. however, at the end of the day, it's still Apple that you're working for. this is the company that only changed policies because of lawsuits. this company would still be making millions off the backs of Asian slave labor if it wasn't for lawsuits to prevent them from doing so."
bad,low pay hard work. very cult like very political ... I would not recommend this place to work . I was depressed the whole time . they always start you at the bottom.
bad,I worked for the company for 5 years and once I am done I will never go back. It's an unorganized company with no communication skills.  If you have a boss you can work with it's ok but if u dont good luck.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,I was hired to work iPhone and iPad issues with only a 15 minute turnaround time allowed.  It sucked!!  It was like working in a call center with idiot Apple users asking questions on how to use their phone.
bad,"Stressful day to day, lack of communication and misleading management decision making. The staff members were the best portion of working in the culture."
bad,"Job work and life balance determined by each individual's capabilities. It is possible to really get the all of it. "
bad,we are working in apple to check the mobile and the dignostics of these devises and also check physically damages and then we pass the units or fail it according to the fail codes.
bad,"No work / life balance"
bad,"Fine work environment, no more than 40 hours expected, but boring work with poor management and little to no chance of being hired full-time. Good for a starting job in GIS straight out of school but thats it."
bad,"Secretive, intense and non-collaborative. Not a team work and as a contract employee or ""contentment workforce"" treated as a 2nd class citizon made it hard to be productive by sharing all I have  to offer but expected to do what ask no more no less and no thinking allowed"
bad,Just a poor place to work. Always felt that my team was not set up for successful. Apple breeds and reproduces complacency. Corporate world is what one would expect.
bad,Constant firefighting in a complicated Solaris environment.  Including all aspects of troubleshooting LFS job sceduler and underlying Linux and NFS environment.
bad,"The pay sucks, some of the managers/trainers are nice, some of the workers are rude and unprofessional. Love the catered lunches on special occassion."
bad,"Apple is a fun place to work if you are a full time employee. If you on contracted you will get worked really hard, but you don't receive any benefits."
bad,Not enough tools to help the cust with there issue and the cust rating will make you lose your job even if you a great help to them the pay is not enough for the job you doing it can be very stressful and it's not worth 11.00 an hour
bad,"managers are not good and i was quite unhappy there. "
bad,"Management prefers Yes, Men."
bad,"Not very good environment, Contractors treated badly in some groups."
bad,Apple may seem to be a fun Silicon Valley type work place but it is actually very corporate feeling. My position was as bottom rung contractor with Apple Maps and we were very clearly second class. We were rigidly controlled and easily expendable.
bad,"The culture does not provide a promising way for contractors to grow up there. But for internal employees, yes. They have rotation program which is a very good program that help employee find out the best area fits his/her background."
bad,"You'd think for Apple it would be up to the standards that apple sets but NO. Management is a joke pick favorites, no advancement. People kiss *** and there is favoritism when it comes to promotion for lead experiences or genius.  They don't let you attend church and have Sundays off if you are religious completely anti- religious company. They don't care about the workers. You could work every day of the week except Sunday and they still won't be happy. the job sucks its good pay for retail but its still retail. better off somewhere else."
bad,Too stressful! Stress and it seemed like it was run like a weak start up.  They had so many glitches in their process.  Internal apps were not up to par.  Too Stressful!!!
bad,"The management culture of the this company is okay, but they dont care about employees, only about their customers, the salary is pretty bad for the work that is done."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,Worked here as a college student and found them to be very accommodating. Pay is great but hey it customer service. Not bad for entry level.
bad,Apple products are amazing and will continue to be reliable and cutting edge for the foreseeable future. Middle Management is more concerned with posturing and protecting themselves rather than promoting an environment where people are developed and promoted.
bad,They do not say you enough for the job at hand and out source most of the jobs with can be a big drag and its a boring invirment
bad,"Working at the Apple Store on paper seems like a good job (decent pay, benefits, and nice people) however below the surface it's not what it seems. This is largely determinate on local management. They are always giving you ""experiences"" to help you develop when it's really training for a job you don't have. I'm mainly referencing the GYOG program (grow your own genius) which is designed to teach you how to preform the duties of a genius. The way this is used in my store is to have higher quality technicians trained as geniuses to pay them less. Communication is abysmal, policies change which we are not told about, and then we have multiple meeting about it. It's just like Office Space, I have seven different bosses. Plus I have three secret bosses (people on experiences). I have to work in a box, I'm very limited in what I can do. It's very transactional now, instead of being able to give options to resolve issues. I'm being pushed to sell more phones. I'm trying to find a new job, because I can't stand it here anymore. Plus my store is falling apart, I can hardly do my job due to the lack of equipment and facilities, it takes longer for me to find things then it does to do the job."
bad,"I learned a lot like how to make reports, processing paperwork of shipping and receiving."
bad,Not very technical work. Very repetitive process. Management was good but there were no advancement opportunities available for technicians. Only a 6 month contract was available
bad,Wasn't happy over all. Management was terrible and under-qualified. There was a terrible lack of communication between all teams which often resulted in release errors not being fixed for weeks.
bad,"Typical day at work was hectic , the work environment never had any consistency. "
bad,"If you really need a temporary job, this may be it for you. It's under Aditya Birla Minacs. The hours are all over the place so you won't be able to have a stable schedule."
bad,"Good place to work if you like working in Mac OS. Hs lot of other opportunities apart from QA - Data Warehousing, Machine Learning, Development"
bad,"no pay"
bad,"Anrufe entgegennehmen"
bad,This was not Apple. This was Micro Center with a specialization in Apple.
bad,Apple is a great company to work if you land in a good group.
bad,"Depends on the store you work at, I experienced a relaxed environment but the management became bad towards the end. Not a career job unless you're obsessed with apple"
bad,While they treat a full-time employee very well and were never unfriendly to you. They made it very clear how temporary your position was as a contractor regularly. But it was normal for their Arizona data center to be like that.
bad,My lead always tried to get me in trouble & harassed me. I went to management and they just said they would review situation but they never resolved it
bad,"I worked on the retail side of Apple for almost 3 years. I wanted to move to corporate and do something else, and this was never, and does not happen for most people. It will most likely not happen for you. If you don't want anything else in this job, it's fine, but you're not going anywhere."
bad,"Pros"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"Working remotely was always the benefit that kept me working for apple, but the years of promised promotions that never happened and so much company advancement that is never shown is disappointing and shows the true dishonesty of this company."
bad,"Working through a third party, a contractor, is a different experience from working directly for Apple. You will not receive the same benefits, compensation, nor will the position be permanent. They no longer hire contract employees."
bad,"Don't think that you know Apple. You love the products, the ethos, etc- all great. You have no idea what to expect from them as an entity to work for. there was a fundamental lack of ethics. leading by bullying. retaliation is the hammer they wield unchecked"
bad,Cannot. speak to my experience than than to say that under the confines of a Non-Disclosure agreement I am no longer associated the Fruity Stand. I wish them all well .
bad,Working for this company help me grow hellp me become and great team player and work well with other help me grow as a person  and for that thank you .
bad,"When you are a contractor, everyday you are reminded how little you matter. No chance of a promotion or contract extension. No raises. Endless work that's incredibly boring. Team leads chosen at random, no hard work incentives. You can't shine here."
bad,"There are many companies around the globe that offers better salaries and way better benefits than Apple. It is a place to gain some experience but that's it."
bad,I was a contractor for my position for Apple; working through Apex Systems. The work hours were undesirable and there was no room for growth. The only good thing about the job were the others that worked there.
bad,Working at the flagship location makes the Apple culture very different there. Room for growth is very particular and limited. I mostly enjoyed helping customers with their technical needs.
bad,"L’azienda con cui ho lavorato mi ha praticato mobbing incessante. Nonostante il lavoro fantastico, i colleghi meravigliosi, ho dovuto attendere la scadenza contratto in malattia a causa di un mezzo esaurimento nervoso causato da continue vessazioni praticate in maniera subdola."
bad,"It’s nice that Apple has work from home opportunities but the options to advance from senior advisor (bring completely off the phone and not customer facing) are extremely limited and that alone can be daunting. Additionally, while the benefits are pretty great, the schedule change every three months is annoying, as well as always being reminded of how you could’ve done something better."
bad,"Apple is a giant company.  They have thousands of people standing at the door to get in.  You are a number.  If you don't add to the bottom line, your life becomes miserable.  They don't care about the issues surrounding daily work life, they only look at numbers. If your number (which may or may not be representative of who/what you are/are doing) is not where they want it to be, they don't care what the circumstances are.  They're more liable to barbeque you slowly until you leave than have their reputation tarnished.  "
bad,There's no human resources. It can be bias pretty quickly. No real structure on how to get promoted. Its totally up to management. They can change team goals pretty quickly without letting you know. Instead of being direct everything is ambiguous. There is a passive aggressive attitude that fills the air quickly thanks to the feedback culture
bad,"If you are a contractor then you are working purely for your pay. There is almost no opportunity of being a full time employee. Out of probably 100 only 3 went full time. You will be told good metrics will look good on your application but honestly it doesn't matter. I've had top metrics on my team for 9 monthes in a row and was not even considered for the position, and my metrics are better than most full-time employees. I know somebody with horrible metrics went full time though. The recruiter for apple is completely separate from your managers and others you work with. This means managers/supervisors know they are saying pure double speak when they say there is good opportunity for going-full time with good metrics when quite literally your metrics has nothing to do with your chances of going full-time unless you get fired during the contract."
bad,"Apple is a good company to work for. Notice that I said GOOD. They're not great but not terrible either. It's the kind of job that you will get sick of fast... I'm talking about an at home tech support advisor. "
bad,"Over stretched employees, fickle management follows rules when it suits them, trends towards blame game than work to find solution. Issues with favoritism from managers towards staff members. District and regional manager out of touch with the real concerns at the store level."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"The work at Apple is generally very repetitive, though this is to be expected. The work place environment is very friendly and the people who work there are very nice and respectful. Unfortunately the organization and leadership were often lacking and we rarely had any idea what was going on above us and worst of all management didn't really care about any input from lower level workers, who are, after all, the one's using the systems and software and following and implementing the procedures and policies. Generally a somewhat disorganized and frustrating place to work, albeit still again a very pleasant and not overly stressed day to day work environment. The pay and benefits were not very impressive either and they didn't seem very interested in helping you advance or continue to work for Apple."
bad,"when i first started it was ok, but then they started having issues with they system and the employee was , getting blamed for being  late, well when they found about about the issue they promise employee that attendance would be fixed and it didn't happened, it was seem like they only hired people for the Holiday of Christmas  and then after that then it was time to start letting people go and boy was they. They also waited til they devices was working well and they had enough people to handle the problem calls. I think this because it was people who had over 20 occurrences and did didn't get let go til after the Holiday was over and the returned and problems was figured out and deal with then we all lost our jobs...."
bad,"Taking calls for several product and services. Management focus on customers and not advisors. Management not taking to account  years of service, allowing newest, employee being promoted"
bad,"Apple is great company with great products this rating is for the management which is poorly ran (You get no support provided to help you excel at your job, There is no advanced opportunities to move up in the company)"
bad,"People outside want go in. People inside want go out."
bad,"Love helping people, but did not like the sales pressure.   Wasn't a whole lot of workplace environmental issues because it was a work at home environment.  They need to make changes to their scheduling and their coaching that is done to help  advisors having trouble grasping new technologies, that they then have to help the customer with.  Had great discounts and benefits but unfortunately that did not make up for the poor work environment and the pressure put upon employees daily"
bad,"As an Apple Chat representative, the first 6 months were fun. After that, you either excel, or you get thrown to the wolves. The chats are fast paced and can go very quickly, however some customers take advantage of anonymous chat system and insult the chat specialist. There is no remorse for the agent receiving bad reviews for situations that are outside of their control. The policies are constantly changing, with little notice, and the information that is typically given is indirect and vague."
bad,"Days at Apple were often very frustrating with workload being poorly distributed among employees.  About 20% of employees were seen working overtime each day, while all others came into the office late, took 2 hour lunches, and left early.  Little to no work life balance due to workload.  Upper level management was not present, and seemingly unqualified in their role."
bad,You have no life outside of work. Work is mundane and all it takes is one mistake for you to get into the dungeon. You will never get out of it. It's mostly CYA mindset.
bad,"This is a fast paced call center focused on answering as many calls as possible, resolving technical issues, and selling Apple products within a targeted time frame."
bad,"the work place ther is like a kindergraden "
bad,Its a unique company and it has its own improvements and positive sides to it. depending on what field you work in and who you work with or whom is your supervisor matters. its a large company
bad,"When you have a manager instead of a leader well then you will start getting a less motivated, and self-reliant individuals who not only get work done but who also innovate."
bad,"Working at Apple Care was fine. From the training down to the actual material given to assist customers could definitely use some improvements. Most of the trainers didn't seem to feel confident about what they were teaching, and when it came down to it most of the employees didn't feel confident and able to actually assist with most technical problems. e"
bad,"Working at Apple is not what all the hype makes it to be. The work life balance is minimal, pay is nothing special, and you could make more working on sales at Nordstroms hourly. Another major issue is the management, they are a burden on the sale associates (Red Zone) and unfortunately are paid to do minimal work for a decent pay. Overall the people you will work with are amazing and that's the only reason I was able to stick it out for a year."
bad,No stress fun workplace but too much politics.  Awesome dress code.  Most of co-workers were fun.  Dogs allowed in store.  Great benefits.
bad,"Productive not so much fun, just work. It was just another "
bad,"As a temp through an agency you don't get the privileges as an Apple standard does. You don't get to participate in Apple events  nor the benefits of them (the only exception being Thanksgiving). As far as workload, it fluctuates like any other job; something I myself can't really complain. The management is quite punishing sometimes except for a small handful. I think the status of standard is what provokes this and the overall high expectation of Apple products and service. You are prohibited to take in your cellphone in the work area, listen to music, use the internet, and converse with coworkers (depending on your lead and department). The only real enjoyment is ironically working together and conversing with other coworkers. One must make the best of it, as it is a warehouse environment."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,Poor managed and stressful environment.only one genius in the morning dealing with customers that were upset about their products. and having missed breaks due to under staffing and overbooking.
bad,"Apple is unfortunately run out of the HQ in Cupertino, California and this lead to all sorts of miscommunication between the store and Cupertino.  Secrecy clauses were of paramount importance and getting answers to questions often took months."
bad,"Lots of hours. Mandatory overtime. Minimal pay. The general work environment was friendly, among lower levels."
bad,I really enjoyed my temporary employment with Apple. My co-workers and supervisors were really diverse. I got to work with people who I've never  worked with. The overtime was great. The only thing about Apple was there was no Temp to Hire.
bad,"   My day starts off clocking in, checking my schedule for the day to see where in the store I will be.  Usually, my day is spent assisting customers on the floor with technical issues.  Since I am a Genius I work on all devices-mobile and mac hardware.  Every appointment is a different situation and with the way technology changes an educational opportunity always arises.  The management in my store is usually hands off unless needed for a customer service escalation.  Co-workers are usually fun to work with and many co-workers are educated in different things so learning new ideas or ways to look at situations are interesting.  The hardest part of the job is keeping others interested in performing their role.The most enjoyable part of the job is diagnosing a customers issue, repairing it and getting that satisfaction of knowing you fixed that!"
bad,"I worked and exceeded the requirements for my position and was given the opportunity to work in another area, which I accepted. Then I was fired almost a week later when they found out to many people were working in that area. It seemed to me that Apple over-hired temp employee's and then fired roughly 1/3 to 1/2 of them within two weeks of training."
bad,Apple is an innovative company with cool products. My time spent there  has mixed reviews.  Many management changes happened on maternity leave. Communication of these changes were poor. Not  supportive of remote work or a family friendly environment.  Over worked and under appreciated.  under appreciated
bad,"Apple is a great company in that there are a lot of job opportunities, but it is an oversaturated job field, the pay is not competitive, and the work environment is sterile."
bad,"Apple does a good job promoting positivity within the workplace and recognizing its employees. However, promotions heavily hinge on who you know. You can work twice as hard, however it’s not uncommon for other employees to receive positions or special treatment because of their friends referrals. Additionally, it’s still retail. You will always have a disgruntled customer, or have to work long hours."
bad,"Initially, Apple was a great place to work.  Over the past 5 years, the culture has changed so that they hire fewer competent people. Hiring is done primarily on the basis of personality than skill or intelligence.  "
bad,Did not like the call flow  most calls were complaints because we can’t help them if they forget Apple ID passwords  telling a customer sorry i can’t help you is horrible
bad,"Major metrics that are unobtainable on regular basics due too the high standards of % goals each month. They are very strict on compliance and surveys and logging correctly Surveys for every call if customers are mad at anything it goes against you... either a 100 or a zero. Be prepared too be bullied by your tl. Very stressful, and t2 think they r your boss. Actually hated this job, pays was good and I was 4 tens. They let me go and didn't pay me my PTO 2 days.Run away!!"
bad,"With IS&T department very poor management and because of lack of communication projects are processing over and over."
bad,Working for Apple is like reliving high school if you are in the popular crowd you advance if you aren’t you don’t advance simple as that. It doesn’t matter if you do an amazing job everyday and have amazing results. If you aren’t in the popular crowd you don’t get an opportunity to grow.
bad,"Really fun and cool place to work.  I had dreamed of working for Apple.  They also say there are so many different career paths, yet there are so many politics and you have to kiss so much tail to get anywhere there.  They don't truly value individuality, they want you to regurgitate their gibberish whether it comes to brand loyalty or gay and lesbian rights.  You literally have to be a robot to get anywhere here, and even then, you are expected to take on more roles than you get paid for."
bad,"At 1st it was a great job with good benefits & everyone was friendly.  After a year Management changed and made to many changes with it. Also they had & played favorites. I wasn’t one of them. Lots of secretes and whispers that I wasn’t part of. The reason I had to leave is, when a lead position for BOH was opened. They gave it to someone with zero experience.  I was upset that it wasn’t me  but more upset that they gave it to a guy with no experience!! This was the Hingham store in Massachusetts. DERBY STREET"
bad,"Don't expected to be hired on as a contracted employee. They hire from retail/within so chances are next to none. If you go, go for the experience and take it somewhere else."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"As soon as the door opens, it is extremely busy. Customers are extremely demanding and the stores are under-staffed and under serviced for the volume of customers. I've never worked at a place where there were so many sick days and leaves of absence due to stress and environment. There are not many opportunities for advancement and the criteria for measuring performance is very arbitrary. Advancement had to do more with what relationships one is able to build with managers vs the merit of ones work. I will say, compensation is good and retention is higher than average due to this factor, however outside of this, was an average retailer to work for."
bad,"You can find a lot of enjoyment at Apple, primarily by developing relationships with coworkers. Apple retail prefers to hire externally for leadership, and struggles to create meaningful experiences to advance internal candidates. If you are not being hired as a manager or member of leadership, do not expect to advance beyond basic roles, unless you have management experience from elsewhere."
bad,"Apples culture used to be much different.  It feels more and more like any other retailer now and any other big box store with assimilated employees that are there to blow smoke and butterflies infant of their customers in order to SELL.  There is always one more thing to push and mention and not forget to ask, all in an effort to generate more business and revenue.  Apples service model has changed from how can we help to how can we get you in and out as quickly as possible.  While Apple looks to appear an altruistic company to work for and does do some really great things for the community and is civil minded they still can not veil the fact that their actions are for pure profit and self sustainability.   I am certain that it is not like this in every Apple retail store and I can not speak for what the corporate culture is like but this overarching theme of disingenuousness permeates  the retail culture."
bad,"They promote based on how long you’ve been  at company and your physical age. It doesn’t matter how good your metrics are, it doesn’t matter how qualified or how many management positions you’ve had in the past. If you’re one of the favorites then your getting promoted, if you’re not then tough luck. "
bad,"After about 6 months of working for Apple, you start to realize its just another retail store at its core. Appears nice on the outside, far from it on the inside.  Heavy favouritism from management, poor scheduling & overworked staff. You think a company this rich can invest in a decent break room?  Instead- its a cold & sterile white room shared with a receiving area that has one table and a sink, hard plastic white chairs you can't even be comfortable in. Everyone walking around fake smiling and pretending to be SO happy and always clapping at just about anything a manager says just so they can get noticed."
bad,i will never go back to apple the environment was not that friendly and unprofessional. So tiring job and training was not so proper regarding troubleshooting
bad,"Fast pace job"
bad,"I loved working here...I lost my job because I was not approved for time off from them. My doctor granted me more time off which was not approved for by apple, so I was let go."
bad,horrible work experience. treated like dogs on a leash mostly because of lack of communication. hard to advance in opportunities. clean environment. good parking.
bad,"The culture of the workplace is fine, however, there is no career advancement. The pay is lower than the cost of living for Austin. If you have time to wait 10+ years for the low possibility to get a management role, then definitely work there. The company used to grow and hire internally, but the focus of the online store has shifted radically to keeping everyone at the same level as long as possible or rotating endlessly to lateral positions or positions with no change in pay. The focus of the online store has changed from expanding and promoting internally, to instead expanding vendor support from non-Apple employees at non-Apple locations."
bad,It was fun work environment but a management has changed and the department was falling a part. It became stressful and micromanagement work environment.
bad,"OK part time job.  Pay is $11 and hour for all security officers as far as I know.  "
bad,"Current employee. NO room for advancement. They fill your head when you become an employee (I'm in the AHA) and tell you that you have so much opportunity with apple, but they stick you with almost impossible metrics. They make sounding like moving up to Level or T2 support was such a huge deal...NO..they expect everyone to move up a level by 6months to a year! If you want a new department don't ask for it or you will never get it! I have been with them for 3 years and Have tried the local Apple store, denied. Tried 3 different departments...all denied! My metrics are the best on my team...still denied! Managment finds something to fuss about and your never good enough no matter what you do!"
bad,I've been working there for the past 8 months. The environment is friendly but at times it can be very frustrating to the point were you dont want to work anymore. They are constantly changing the way that we are suppose to work and then we get in trouble for it.
bad,"Nice perks, okay pay, new manger every six weeks ( bad business management )  Apple care "
bad,Easy going workplace not much room for advancement as a contractor. Biased treatment of some workers. Wish there had been more of an opportunity to find a permanent position here.
bad,"Work/Life balance is horrible if you're in a shift job that changes hours and days every 14 weeks and you have kids. Management wants to cheerlead you through the long hours, poor raises and sudden shifts in job requirements with copious swag and beer parties you can't even attend if you're on shift anyway (or you'll be on the phone buzzed, which isn't allowed). If you're willing to still through those for the health and retirement benefits then this is the place for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. It's so competitive here, people trying to get ahead will not hesitate to throw you under the bus and climb over."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"I have worked for AppleCare for one year, and I have to say, even though the pay is good and you work from home, the stress that comes along with it is NOT worth it. Yes the company has great benefits, medical, discounts, etc. But they like to move you around to different departments (Without your permission), you will come in one day to work and you be in a different department and queue. With no additional money to go along with the extra responsibility. "
bad,Apple is an amazing company but the management does not give you the tools to help you grow as a worker.  The apple culture is not shown in this particular store.
bad,"well, Apple is not a good place to make career especially for me. thought it is better than doing nothing."
bad,Work is a lot but some times interesting. This is an interesting and enjoyable place to work.
bad,Ops / Supply Chain at Apple is a challenging and fast-paced environment.  You will learn a lot and gain a lot of new skills but you will also have to give up a lot to be successful at apple.  There is essentially no work-life balance in ops / supply chain roles.
bad,"Everything was fine as the FT hours were offered and the work was consistent. It was after the shift bidding, the drop in hours, and the lack of direction that everything began to shift out of place."
bad,An experience in order to pay my hobbies when I studied (without working) at the University
bad,The ethos at Apple is that working for Apple should suffice as your reward for working at Apple. The pay isnt great. No real incentive in the way of commision on sales and considering the price of the goods you would expect a little something. Other retailers pay alot better and you dont have to jump through half as many hoops to do so
bad,"Very high expectation."
bad,Very cult like and employees are not inclusive to people unlike them. when a new employee comes and is very good people make them feel bad about their talents and try to create an environment where they want to quit. Mangers are never on the same page with 9 there's always one who contradicts the others.
bad,"Great place to work until they start piling on the responsabilities and expect the somewhat impossible.  ""Help the customer and don't rush them"" yet ""Hurry up and don't take long with the customer!""  Some team leaders were like drill sergeants and it seems the higher ups don't put them in check while the front line employees get battered from them and the customers!..."
bad,"I've been with Apple for over 4 years and it hasn't been the best work experience for me."
bad,"A typical day at apple would be me clocking in, setting up my work space, and then getting straight to work. We have an indivdual number goal we have to hit daily which was to receive 110 items with no errors by the end of the shift. I learned how to work with others, follow directions and the ability to adapt to any situation. Time management was the biggest lesson I learned. To me, there was nothing difficult about the job, it was just regular rules and stipulations like any other job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck."
bad,Training was not sufficient and pay was poor. Initial training was good but product training was poor. When working with customers Apple could do a better job with training.
bad,"Once one of the best cultures in tech and retail, it has dwindled away...sadly. I arrived before Steve Jobs passed and there was always optimism, creativity and innovation that still thrived. The priorities over time have shifted drastically. For consumers, they still make great products and are still considered to be one of the best. Behind the scenes though, staff was getting increasingly dissatisfied and disenfranchised. External leadership hires led to the decay of the original Apple culture; which once included ample opportunities to advance and take on positions of leadership. I once looked forward to going to work. By the last year, I dreaded going to work and couldn't wait for the end of my shift. "
bad,"If you need work after school this is one of the best places you can start. Just keep in mind there is little to no work life balance, pay is low, and you are less important than the customers and managers."
bad,"Apple is great for the people that actually work for them. That being said many of them came from contractors and repeatedly for some. Even after securing a position at Apple, people typically move slowly, being able to move to a new role every 3 years if they are lucky. Apple likes people that like being happy where they are for as long as possible. Entry level is not the best choice for the ambitious."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"Great benefits, diverse community, culture created is great, and offers competitive pay."
bad,"formazione praticamente inesistente e disorganizzazione, clienti esigenti,  l'unico aspetto positivo è l'ambiente molto giovanile"
bad,"Honestly, just dont work at Apple retail. You know there are better things you can do to advance yourself and working there will just derail your career. If you want to be extremely stressed constantly,and have the feeling of ""I hate my job but I'm afraid to leave because of the benefits"" than go for it but there's nothing ""special"" you learn. Its just a retail job, but pays a little better than other mall jobs but is much, much more demanding. If you want to sacrifice your own sanity for money, do it."
bad,"This can be an over-whelming experience for any person that doesn’t thrive in a fast-paced work environment. "
bad,"A general technical support job designed to keep clients in limbo between departments without any resolution. This job probably works for some people, but the changes in hours without notice and support system just wasn't an effective use of my time."
bad,"Not the greatest experience working for Apple. training went too quickly, didn't allow for different learning styles, expected immediate understanding of complex concepts, no time allowed to review and understand training. Also, job pushed selling of warranties over helping people with technical issues."
bad,"It isn't what you would think it would be unless you are thinking of a nice box with a mess inside. It is hit or miss depending on department. Management is hit or miss when it's good it's great, when it is horrible it is worse than you can imagine. Lazy. Entitled. Unskilled. Unprofessional. Success is hampered by top heavy and often management debacles."
bad,"I was hired on board for a lower level position with the promise of consideration for advancement within 6 months once I had learned their systems.  That re-evaluation never happened.  The supervisors while making an attempt to appear supportive, were a consistent negative presence.  I would never recommend this organization.  The product is amazing, I'll give them that.  But behind those doors in the back life is a nightmare."
bad,It was fine as a part time job but could not imagine making a career of it. Apple makes too many changes that you have no control over but take the brunt of the anger and outrage they cause.
bad,Would have loved to move to a different department and get off phones. Be prepared to work a ton of hours. Hard to take breaks when required. Not a fan of the politics that management pulls.
bad,"Great Place to just make money and have a job but, you won't really go anywhere only, if you want become an Engineer there are some options open. And, they are open with giving overtime if you want to work more."
bad,The pay was just decent.  Felt like there was no room for advancement.  Management had favorites among employees whom received better recognition.  Training on new products was really good.
bad,"I’m a little new to retail but I don’t think it’s supposed to be like this. My coworkers hate their job. The turn around at my store is insane. We do a clapout every week, usually for multiple people. Awful place"
bad,"Everything at Apple is all about the new products and launches.  They like to say you have a lot of training on information, but by the time you hit the phones, you have next to no training at all.  I know the iPhone X is coming out, but I don't know a thing about it and I work there."
bad,"Probably a great jog as long as you are not in customer support. I use to be an engineer before accepting this job during the economic downturn in 2007. Been at Apple now for over 7 years. Unless you are willing to sell your soul and self-respect, you will NEVER advance out of call support. Trust me..."
bad,"They praise you with gift cards all the time, BUT if you have a family emergency or you are pregnant going into labor as you are signing into work they do not care about those things. It was like, I dedicated my whole life to them and could not do the same for my family. I was pregnant and I worked 10-12+ everyday and even on my days off and when it was time to have my baby, they would not allow me to receive maternity leave, nor would they allow me time off to go be with my mother during a serious surgery. After I worked Thanksgiving AND Christmas all day for them, they treated us like we did not really matter, but just enough to work."
bad,"Apple started out as a fantastic place to work.  The job was satisfying and I felt like I was really helping people with their devices.  However, a change in upper management led to some serious changes in my position.  These changes added numerous extra responsibilities, including handling more customers over chat at one time.  Suddenly we were unable to focus on our customers in a beneficial way.  It was more about juggling.  Shifts in teams and managers also occurred constantly.  This meant that about the time we got comfortable with one manager, we were thrust onto a new team with a new boss."
bad,Beaucoup de bonnes personne mais beaucoup de mauvais choix ..
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"Still Apple by design, but the internal part has changed over the past 5 years. "
bad,Most of the work is tedious and requires a lot of mental stamina. The management there treats you like a person. What i learned from working there is that it's okay to take breaks.
bad,You have to maintain a positive outlook on your day to ensure that your customers are met with positive vibes regardless of any stress the store traffic or personal issues.
bad,"Mostly an ok place, the management has leadership problems. And the security is extremely tight, making cross project interaction almost impossible."
bad,"I was able to take care of customers in Italian, Spanish, English and Portuguese."
bad,"In chat, it is and always was constantly much busier than in the phone support queues, with the added struggle of assisting multiple customers at once while having to adhere to awful chat guidelines that take the conversation out of the support."
bad,"I started with the Mac Store as a way to earn a bit of extra money, and quickly found that to be almost too much to ask. Though hours started fine at first, it became so bad that some employees were receiving 5 hours a week, and when one requested more hours, they were instead let go and replaced with a new employee willing to work so few hours. The environment and the coworkers were phenomenal, but the management was subpar, the upper-level methods of maintenance were poor, and the overall financial structure and stability of the company are laughable. The incentives for employees to do better are remarkably unreachable, and the fact that employees are then punished for ""not doing good enough"" is just as humorous."
bad,A day at work was typically jammed with impossible/ nearly impossible goals. Hard work day after day. I learned exactly what they wanted me to learn. I have nothing positive to say about management in my department.  My co-workers are great people who can 'move mountains'. The ridiculous schedules were the hardest part o the job. The best part of the job was the friendships.
bad,"I have worked at Apple for the past year and a half. It is an incredibly fast paced, often difficult place to work due to the high volume. I rather enjoyed the people I worked with and most of the culture. I love the concept of ""assuming positive intent"" in all interactions. I felt that the management's turnover rate was too high and the outside hires didn't always grasp the culture, leading to a confusing, muddled mess of micromanagement. I love working with the public and I thoroughly enjoyed my coworkers. I also enjoyed the challenge of trying to deduce what was wrong with a device and providing a solution in how to get the customer going again. As a technician, we often got bogged down by having too many people come in at once. Although it is a fun challenge to juggle 3 or 4 technical appointments with customers at once, it can become hectic and tiring after a while."
bad,Work is very well organized and managed. However at times the workflow got so intense I couldn't even take a 15 min. brake. After a couple of years felt the routine was to boring for me to take. No further development after a level reached. BTW I was a Creative (trainer) which is a very so after job. At times it feels the company betrayed its values for the pure joy of amazing more billions in the bank leaving employees exploited just because they are super fans of the company.
bad,Apple retail started as a idealistic retail environment for employees and customers. Growth and increased business has caused a necessary change in management structure and attitude; Apple retail grew up as an organic organization but the increased business necessitated very high levels of labor and therefore a move to a more rigid chain of command.
bad,"I was a Family Room Specialist at Apple. For those of you who don't know what that is, I'm the guy you see when you break your iDevice. Management at the Mississippi Apple constantly opens more appointments than the employees can hand and then doesn't understand why people are upset that they are not being seen at their appointment time. It is not uncommon for one person to be expected to handle 3-4 ""appointments"" at once. The schedule was always a problem and management seemed disinterested in way to improve overall efficiency. The benefits are excellent but the pay leaves something to be desired."
bad,I really believe that the retail are of apple is not worthy.
bad,"Iffy management, dont get your hopes up on moving up fast...or at all. The training is not the best for such a big companyThe Pay is good, but it is almost not worth the daily stress."
bad,"Restricting management but good compensation and benefits. Management did not hold team members accountable and used favoritism. Also, management was rather opaque. Not a bad job when the right manager was hired."
bad,Although they have a culture and the people i worked with become more of a family to me. Apple has a lot to do when it comes to knowing the right way to develop their people. In addition they need to understand the way to use talent. The culture has become a place where no one will be direct and even to the detriment of not being direct when it comes to the development of the employee.
bad,"Typical call center, bad hours and hard metrics.  The facility is really nice and does have free coffee.  Their tier 2 agents were hard to work with and often push back.  The ding you on everything from not using bomgar enough to escalated calls and handle times."
bad,"fast paced, energetic, humbling experience, be innovative, hardest part of the job is to deal with the constant change on a daily basis and management"
bad,"The Dubai Mall Branch is the most negative Apple Store. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"I worked as a Technical Adviser and that is about the most exciting thing about the job: your title. The pay sucks, the leaders suck, the training is in depth and long. The benefits started soon and were so-so. I (and many others) quit shortly after finishing training because they hours they agreed to work us, were not the hours which were really available."
bad,I am a bad example because the management team was not fond of my outspoken behavior but the job was a drag. They sell you on dreams of getting promoted and make you jump through hoops to do so but they already know who will be promoted.
bad,"Good place to work, good pay, just wasn't a good fit for me. Very supportive team environment, management was eager to help employees. Would recommend to anyone interested in computers."
bad,"Even though apple doesn't pay well, the management was really good and the Team work was Awesome. I've never had he opportunity to work with a really good team like I had with them. "
bad,"Really over estimated what technicians were allowed to do or learn at the retail level. There are people in high school more capable than some of the repair technicians at apple retail. However, Apple designs their repair strategy around obedient employees, not smart, free thinking technicians. When obvious product defect trends arise, Apple will give their employees no information on the issue forcing them to play dumb to their out-of-warranty clients. Eventually, the company will offer limited services programs often only when faced with class action suits. This experience diluted my opinion of the company and lead to a lot of personal misery while working a second part time job to improve my quality of life."
bad,"The managing staff does not care about its own employees or issues including health issues. Staff here play office politics so it is absolutely best to lie about how you are and just keep to yourself. If you have medical issues I would absolutely recommend not working here because HR department has no sympathy or care. The only honest benefits of working here are the medical 401k and pay compensation,"
bad,"Most enjoyable part of my day is getting to leave. "
bad,"The job was great in the beginning. You can get advancements if you work hard and give it your all. However, there are many technical issues with their systems that mess up advisors' monthly stats that they are required to keep, thus resulting in them getting fired for avoiding their job when that is not what they did. HR hasn't even responded on the situation."
bad,"Every day at apple is a day of learning where every single moment we learn from our challenges at work"
bad,"Awful management, they twist your words and talk behind your back. Very untrustworthy and nothing is confidential. If you work at Apple, you have to play the 'game'. Don't expect to make friends."
bad,"Prepare to be micromanaged every second of your day. Also never spend holidays with your loved ones ever again. Because while most companies shut down for their employees, you'll be right there with the 7-11 employees working on Christmas Eve and Thanksgiving."
bad,Too much of work pressure and stress . Bad management . No project plans .
bad,"Great products, senior management not good, no people development at Apple. It's all about $$$$$"
bad,"If you value your free time and your sanity, avoid this place at all costs."
bad,"The job is ok for someone who is trying to work and go to school at the same time.  As far as a career in retail, I would avoid working for Apple. The turnover rate at Apple is absolutely ridiculous."
bad,Good place to work but I work at Apple ware house by the Volt company no benefits that not good for me that why I want to change work. If I have opportunity about computer or mainboard i think i do good job and work hard
bad,"Management and leadership is poor -  Very fake and only care about figures. The leads (Low management) are left to sort out the staff on the shop floor (Specialists & tech specs) after the managers constantly give out extremely downgrading feedback. Once in a blue moon does a good senior manager appear but they soon move stores. Leadership team do not expect you to have a personal life and issues, although they are often distracted with theirs. The company does not offer much support and is not great for your mental health."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,"it is corporate America, with advantage and disadvantage of big companies.  "
bad,I don’t really care to write this out but I have to . My experience at Apple was whatever I’ve worked there twice disliked it both times need more money
bad,"Entry level, proprietary software, poor benefits. The office for the department with which the work was done took place in Sunnyvale, California, not at Apple headquarters."
bad,"When you are a contract worker, the Apple employees barely acknowledge your existence. Also, I worked at a data center in the middle of nowhere North Carolina for TCS. There were no restaurants nearby and no cafeteria."
bad,"Accurately and thoroughly document issues and resolutions through email & phone support "
bad,Advancement is possible but it requires some serious networking. Promoting from within doesn't happen that much unless you consider lateral movements an advancement.
bad,apple warehouse was a pretty decent job I learned how to work the assembly Line package and send of phone also try to package up as many phones as i can by the end of the day but i would say the enjoyable part was cleaning up my station area.
bad,Since joining apple I have become apart of the family room team (FRS). Currently in this role I am a trained technician and I take appointments with customers who have issues with there devices. Customer service is a huge focus for us as a team and empowering and engaging our customers is a huge part of what we do.
bad,It was a very fast pace environment. Which a high turn over rate. I enjoyed until the next management team took over. After 7 years I'm ready for something new and more special.
bad,"This was kind of a good job, Mean team leads, system fails your paycheck because it clocks you into work but whatever pay structure or whatever clock in for us to get paid was awful. They didn't have to change the knowledge base system, it was easier to find the articles. "
bad,"Work is very basic and highly supervised. No space for growth. Nature of task is repetitive and monotonous. Highly compartmentalized. On the bright side, there are some good people there."
bad,I didn't like working here and it's apple crossing not apple. It was way to far of a drive and there was no advancement opportunties.
bad,"They force you to sell, if you do not you are frowned upon. Their business motto is old and often look to companies like apple and follow their sale tactics. Very low pay and micro managing is huge in these jobs."
bad,"While being employed at Apple Inc, I was able to meet varying personalities , gained long time friends , and enjoyed the many perks of the games/holiday parties they would put together for their employees. The downside, however, is that a call center role is not for a fitting role for someone that may have emergencies with their loved ones , due to their strict attendance policies. All-in-all, I look at my experience there as one I will never forget."
bad,"Job d'appoint pour la fin d'année afin de parer à une surcharge de travail et un service d'une qualité minimum pendant les période de fête tel que black friday, noel et nouvel an. Vente de produits et service après vente."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
bad,Work was contracted through Xerox. Job was unstable due to conflicts of interest between the companies in what is expected. Each company has their own legitimate and justifiable reasons from their perspective. They just don't blend well but have been working towards a decent middle ground.
bad,"Bad Managers, they throw you under the bus to make themselves look better."
bad,"at the restaurant that i work is very nice and i learn to be deserving,compatible.. the hardest part of my job is by standing all day and all nights with 24hrs. open.."
bad,The amount of time that you have to eat and have a break is a joke.... the fact that you have to walk from the back of the wear house and the security it takes up most of your time
bad,"for starters its a not a bad place to work.if you are a student i suggest you to work there but don't go there as a career job. I have worked there for a year, there is not self growth opportunity."
bad,Customer service facing role. On the phones. Not a great work/life balance. Great benefits. Don't like the work environment. Would like an out of home job.
bad,"Worked as an At Home Advisor in their CPU department for six months and then moved to WMM (Wireless Multimedia). "
bad,"It is most definitely as much of a cult as you think of. "
bad,"Working at apple was exciting, eye opening and certainly different. You learn a lot of valuable skills and the perks that go with the job certainly are amazing. However scheduling of rosters is extremely poor and leave you with little notice to plan your life. The scheduling is more of a casual roster yet you're hired as part time? Hours are scattered and never the same, and often extremely short shifts. Wage is extremely ordinary and the customers you serve are extremely entitled and rude at times.  While the experience is fun and looks good on your resume, if you're wanting to progress in the future and go into a hire roll or have a social life I would steer clear. Just another glorified sales assists position."
bad,"Working On Floor is good trying to understand business, making every day reporting which keep us active. co workers are more supportive, and knoweledge,"
bad,"This was a nice diverse place to work at, the only thing I did not approve of was how the place ran, and how they had their favorites."
bad,"It was fast paced "
bad,It was really slow working in the assembly line at Apple. The managers were rude and it was a really boring job M. Great for people that are lazy. I didn’t like working here but everyone has there own opinions.
bad,I missed one day for a medical reason and I came back to work the next day and was let go . I also had to wait 3 months before I received my last check
bad,"my typical day at work would be clock in get my auditor gun and start auditing my day would go fast, yes it was hot by then but i could keep it up i like the people i work with around, my only personal problem they let me go actually they fired me because i was pregnant ."
good,"Position was through a temp agency which has/had a contract with Apple.  Employees are not paid the same as bonified Apple employees.  Work is demanding micromanaged, poor with unrealistic metrics, out of control/rigged technology systems, demands, politics and favortisim/nepotisim."
good,A typical day is come in and immediately start spreadsheeting. I learned alot about warehouse production. I didn't care too much for management there due to alot of favortism and unfairness. My co-workers were really cool to be around for 8hrs a day. The hardest part was seeing and knowing about the scandal with management at work. The best part was meeting and working with nice co-workers everyday.
good,Company does not care about its employees unless you are high on the corporate ladder. They only care about meeting deadlines and do not care for work-life balance or team morale. Constantly overworked with no  appreciation shown by managers. Tons of micromanaging and favoritism with little to no transparency.
good,"Management at the retail level is all about meeting the bonus they receive, they don't support the internal team or back them when it comes to dealing with difficult customers.  Might not be the case for all locations, but seems to be the ""new culture"" at most apple stores I am familiar with."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Co-workers were excellent, but many disconnections between levels of management and intense secrecy surrounding all projects results in critical lack of communication. Also, most people dealt with very long commute times."
good,This store is an HR nightmare. The employees don’t talk to each other with respect. Management picks favorites and retaliates when you provide them with feedback. There is no culture within Apple. The position you’re hired in as will more than likely be your position until you decide to leave because every one lies to you and underpaid you.
good,"i would recommend it if you can't find a proper job, otherwise your better off,you may thing am an angry employee  how ever that is not my case, i was one of the best of the best, however there was really no appreciation what so ever."
good,"assembly line, taking apart and putting back together iphones. hours were ok but not enough pay per hour for me. mangers where willing to work with you good job if you really need the money and like working with/ fixing phones."
good,Fast Pace and High Energy Work Environment. Amazing life changing products. Good benefits. Could use better incentives and reward systems for work done at a high standard.
good,"I worked as an Apple Technical Specialist at the Genius Bar. I was treated horribly by management because i was older and didn’t get involved with outside activities with other employees. I was severely micromanaged and my job was under threat constantly by managers who were biased against me. I played by the rules and was penalized for it because the other techs knew how to cheat the system. I love the products and the company overall, but the management style  (Fearless feedback that you are not allowed to defend yourself against is a nightmare) I was never given a chance to defend myself or dispute their assessment of my performance, which they base in unrealistic metrics that even they cannot live up to."
good,"Working there is extremely mentally taxing, On a typical day, I would have to change computers at least once because the first one kept dropping calls or the computer itself froze. We were offered $13/hr for changing to this department, but after 4 paychecks we are still being paid $12/hr despite promises that it will be fixed promptly, so it's safe to say that management leaves a lot to be desired. It's very disorganized and at times downright frustrating, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the people I met there and the laid back atmosphere, or the fact that I am now able to troubleshoot my phone without having to call anyone."
good,Job was easy enough but pay was not compensation enough for job. bad enviornment bad  management. Apple did not pay well . That is all i will say again they do not pay well.
good,"I worked for a third party call center for Apple. It was great gaining that call center/technical support experience. But the pay was horrible, 11.50 a hour, they changed your schedule without telling you, iMessage was unprofessional because coworkers were extremely unprofessional. Managers gave no guidance hardly. The month training was helpful but it was really like working at a military base. There was also no Human Resources it was just ""workforce management"""
good,Very biased for contractors and employees. No planning in terms of work. Lot of improvements can be done though. Huge employee and contractors gap. No hiring for contractors ever.
good,No one really listened to me because I was a temp. I was told I was too needy and asked too many questions. The product rolled out and the customer complained about many of the things I had pointed out.
good,Apple Global Security management at lower levels are incompetent and manage like dictators.  Salaries are terrible. I'm amazed at the lack of technology used in an organization that is a part of Apple.
good,"Worked as a set up specialist. people called in to get device set up. learn about their product, light tech support. Have to have a lot of product knowledge. it is a very competitive placate work at. they only want the best noting less."
good,"the pay is not good. they lay off people, even if they know some employees are students and change their schedules and sometimes the computer doesn't register them but they been approved manually so they automatically get a tardy everytime they come later than usual. I was one of those students. Sometime when work is really slow and there are no phones for 6 hours, they would have you sit in your chair for those long hours and not talking to anyone, not even the person next to you. It kind of felt like jail to be honest."
good,"Managers and supervisors do not care about you. There is no advancement in this department so I would recommend working else where. If you don't speak another language, they will cut you."
good,"A typical day at apple care consist of management and staff enforcing an attendance policy they themselves don't follow, constant pay issues where advisors rarely receive their earned bonuses, and constant drama within the workplace. The job itself wasn't difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was time to clock out and go home."
good,Manager was very un Apple like. Very abusive. Work life balance was the worst. Pay was not enough to cover the hours that were worked. Everyone would step all over each other just to become a Manager at the store. Cult atmosphere. HR was not very helpful. Great place for college graduates to start working but best to find another job right away
good,"Pretty laid back place to work, with excellent co-workers;"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Most unorganized place I have ever worked. Bonus system is a joke.
good,"Only the beer bashes are cool. Cool restaurants tog o eat. Basketball courts. High stress work place. Great customer service, horrible "
good,"Apple Canada has a disaster of a management team, no support no guidance just demands. Demands that have no direct relevance to success, just what is deemed success on that day,"
good,"Best benefits you will ever have."
good,"Typically days are very stressful, long. I haven't gained much knowledge except following the process. Everything is a process. people are recognized based on close relationship but not based on knowledge or hard work."
good,"Coworkers are amazing. Fantastic benefits, and good discounts. However, shifts can be very long, and the pay doesn't match the work load and the amount of training you have to go through. "
good,"Apple has one of the best operational processes for any company. The work load is quite balanced. In terms of job security, Apple is one of the best company to work for but if you are looking for career progression then you may want to rethink your decision of joining Apple. Always keep in mind that Apple recruits the best and feel delighted to get a chance but don't forget you are one of best. Apple has one of best work resources and thus, its great to learning and application of new concepts and ideas."
good,"not available for comment "
good,"It was overall a good experience, learned SAP programming, improved analytical skills, the Cafe was excellent, management was a little nonchalant to problems"
good,"It is a very quiet place to work. Not any talking allowed and everyone is basically looking at a computer all day. You get 2 15 min breaks, and 1 45 min lunch."
good,"I worked for a Vendor site for Apple. Apple and the Job itself was Fantastic even though it was difficult. I excelled at the job and the position. The problem was it was for a Vendor site and the site was run very very poorly. Fantastic co-workers, Management was horrible. I left because someone threatened to physically fight me, instead of firing him, they gave me a water bottle. They just hand you stuff that Apple gives them to you to shut you up. Management fired over 150 people and then attempted to replace them. They could not because the Vendor's reputation in the region is viewed very poorly. The Management team has run three call centre's into the ground. Wish Management was organized better and that they viewed a worker not as a ""person in a seat"" but as a human being."
good,"There is little pay and no incentives or benefits. They'll change your schedule with no advanced notice. No sick leave, holiday pay, or vacation time. Insurance is offered but will eat up 80% of the pay check."
good,"the retail aspect is not all its cracked up to be. It was great when in college, but to have a career may not be an option when you work in a store that has over 100 employees its hard to be noticed."
good,Nice workplace and team. Management was good too till a new manager joined in. Commute to the office is longer than expected. A lot of internal tools are being used.
good,"meh, working from home was boring. 8 seconds between calls was a joke. it got old fast. there was nothing to break up the monotony of the phone calls."
good,"Harcèlement sexuel des managers "
good,You sit in a cubicle and answer calls all day while using Apple's database of information to answer questions. You can move up pretty fast but it's usually a lot of the same stuff just in a different area or new location.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Contract employees were not treated well. It was tough to work with regular Apple employees. Many Apple employees were decent people but some of the supervisors in charge of contract employees were not very good.
good,"I learned a lot of things at this work but there's no work development."
good,"I worked at Apple for well over a year along with many of my hardworking talented cohorts, without being offered full time. Management plays favorites"
good,"Great company bogged down by lazy heartless mangers whom would not be missed if the company decides to do a cleanup.  “We don’t quit our jobs, we quit our managers.” I know of 4 others that are in the same position and are looking elsewhere. HR has been no help since they need evidence before approaching the manager."
good,"Title says it all. I don't have time to go into detail, if you really want to know how I feel about the company I strongly recommend getting in touch to organise an interview."
good,"The brand is great and great pride goes into the creation of the products, however the company lacks proper management. May managers lack the basic skills required for management. Benefits are good, but you better be ready to give it all or nothing because there is no work /life balance."
good,"When I first started working for Apple I enjoyed every minute of it.  However work life balance began to disappear, and job growth began to fade. Every location is different however you hear the same three complaints. The longer you work for the company the newer employees get paid more than you. Work life balance doesn't exists and the culture at apple is beginning to fade."
good,I had a bad manager that spoiled the entire experience for me.  The guy did not care at all about me or how badly he screwed me over.  Nor did he have any sense of how to manage a team or properly rate individual performance.  The guy is completely clueless.
good,If you are not in the right social circle you go nowhere.There training is bad and there are alot of people there that are rude.The management has no understanding that everyone has a life outside of apple.
good,"It is a shame that my teenage son makes more money an hour than I do and he works in a deli at Walmart."
good,"fast pace, hard to please, no matter what you do it's never enough, moving up in the company is not a difficult task if you are a quick learner. No good benefits."
good,You will have to work at least one weekend day as a full time employee for Apple. You are really on your own when it comes to management .Holidays you will not be able to take any time off due to high volumes and your work load shows that also
good,"I worked as a barista. I attended and served apple employees espresso. A customer service based job. Much Starbucks , same functions and roles. Professional environment."
good,Too much work and little compensation. It was a lot of work for a college student who had to balance a lot and then deal with too many responsibilities. I deserved a better pay
good,"The name Apple inspires great aspirations...however, depending on what division you work in, there are literally ZERO advancement opportunities. The management team often puts the cart before the horse and does very little research into concepts before implementing them. Employees are not 'heard' or appreciated for the most part. Management consists of people that have never had the lower level experience of the people they are to manage so they rarely know anything about the actual job role they govern."
good,"Mostly hype here. I am sure this used to be a cool meaningful job back in the Steve Jobs Days. My experience was not that. After the fancy Apple corporate onboarding, its plain everyday retail.  "
good,"- Toughest part of the role is to navigate through various teams/processes to get smallest thing done"
good,"Learned a lot of critical system process, mainly procedure writing and meeting deadlines."
good,"come in setup your systems and take calls. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Mid-Level Managers and Directors lack the management and leadership skills to develop employees and team building. The work environment leads to competition and placing blame on other teams to shift blame from one group to another. It is like there are hundreds of small Apples each fighting each other for recognition and funding.
good,This company has changed ownership and is no longer a company I can support.
good,"Helping customers,Answering phone calls and resolving issues"
good,"CCI (vendor for APPLE)  is a growing company that has a lot of great people, with no room for advancement. The training and training team are awesome and the location is perfect.The environment and Management is unprofessional in my opinion. The Apple Customers are Great and So are there products."
good,"very poor compensation, very demanding hours.  Management had expectations that were completely unreasonable.  They timecard system works against itself, turnover is way to high and could be circumvented if management treated employes like adults and not high school students."
good,"Staff training is very good but to the point that it is too much in a period of time. Spending days talking about Apple values is pointless."
good,It pays the bill and thats about it. Underpaid and over-worked.
good,"Generally, snr managers in Apple South have self-interest than overall wellness of employees at heart."
good,"Working with Apple Vacations was okay. The compensation and raises were horrible, but working as the only on site Ops Rep alone, there wasn't a dull moment it was actually fun."
good,Μην πατε. Μπορεί να ειναι καλός ο μισθός σε περίοδο κρίσης αλλά κατά πασα πιθανότητα θα σας διαλύσει την ψυχολογία.
good,management will push you till you are mentally and physically sick.. they do not care about your well being or mental health. I learnt very quickly within the first 4 weeks that the team you work with is brilliant and you will make life friends. managers will never be around when you need them. If not enough customers respond to the survey email then you could potentially get fired
good,Going through a third party call center company such as Convergys was not a good experience for me. They did really care for the employees. They were more concerned on getting their numbers up for the company tjam anything. I would work for Apple again just not through that company which has now been sold to Concentrix
good,Apple on the whole is a good place to work but I wouldn’t recommend the Calgary locations. Working there was great for my tech knowledge but my work/life balance wasn’t great.
good,"Apple Retail was a great job in my twenties but didn't offer a ton of job growth or advancement. The team is always great, management can have some politics involved but overall not a bad place to work. It really comes down to the people you work with."
good,"The best part about this position was the ability to sit down with the actual engineers of the iPhone and learn straight from them. Speaking with all of them for the few weeks that they were state side was the best experience I have had besides meeting all the awesome people that I work along side of in the various locations of the Apple Campus."
good,It’s a great job if you need flexibility but the pay is low for the stress. They promote often within but high competition among workers and slow development make it hard to move up in a timely manner
good,Job Culture was very grey it did not feel like I was in Silicon Valley. They Sunnyvale offices were full of cubicles and the rest of my fellow Apple employees were not the friendliest.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I worked at two stores, one in the South and one in the Northeast. I left the Southern store because they told me I didn't have enough experience to be promoted and gave the promotion to a man with even less experience than me. I left the Northeastern store because it was incredible toxic, the management was sexist and racist, and my health and well-being were not taken seriously."
good,Not a good place to get on permanent employment. Mainly catered to bring in temporary workers with little to no chance for advancement. Management would treat the temporary employees as second class employees.
good,"Although Apple has great benefits, management and the culture of churning out revenue makes this company extremely unfavorable. This could be that Fifth Ave is a flagship store, however I would not recommend to anyone."
good,"This job offered a great deal of learning opportunities, however the all-but-complete absence of my manager combined with a hiring freeze and constant organizational changes in upper management made attaining full-time status nearly impossible."
good,Nothing to say really. Hours was crazy and working from. It’s like I never would leave home. Star crazy is a real thing. Pay is good. But call  fluctuate throughout the day.
good,Every minor change required a review by many people. It was hard to focus on the creative because it felt like we were pushing work through a sieve of groupthink.
good,"Rather than support the reliable guards that they have that's supporting them to fulfill their requirement for Apple Computer, instead they're recruiting."
good,A lot of drama negatively effects the employees. Management is unprofessional. Work is strenuous. Employees are poorly treated. Unsanitary working conditions.
good,I was given hope that I would be kept on as full time after holiday season and was abruptly told differently. It seemed that there were not enough positions available although every other seasonal employee got to stay on.
good,"My experience at Apple was not the best. I'm not sure where to begin..."
good,Was fun for a while but mgmt. was too busy doing other stuff than caring about company morale. Which is fine for a business that doesn't pride itself on it's people being the something or other of the company but this company often claimed otherwise.
good,Can find great opportunities if you are willing to put in some hard time and wait for it. Tech Culture is not for everyone and can be very stark.  They do appreciate input and people who can be creative and think outside the box. There are good people to work with when you get past some big personalities.
good,The culture at the company is decidedly unpleasant.  My own manager was constantly violating company policy and hitting on the women in his group.  The work experience was overall not good.
good,"great facilities, restaurants, gym etc"
good,You are required to assist customers that are not very appreciative or understanding of the products they spend so much money on. They tend to always be very upset with Apple and it's products and support policies. Makes it difficult to enjoy your job when you are being berated daily.
good,"I worked at Apple for over 3 years, long un sociable but they do somehow create a work life balance. Progression requires you go way beyond the norm and befriend managers. And terrible pay for what you have to go through."
good,"So, Apple is an okay company to work for if your management, but if your an advisor on the front lines talking to customer, it's terrible. Management is just awful for such a ""great"" company and if a manager continues to do wrong they get desk duty without there own team and used as a back fill for other managers. If that manager cannot work with employees then they need to be terminated! Work and life balance is terrible because your schedule does change every three months, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. If you have a bad week and the metrics go down then kiss your top 10 or 20 schedule choices out the window! Pay is okay, for such a large company and ""being the face of Apple"" you would think your paid better, but your not. Changing managers is also a bad thing because some are great and do there job and support you, while others are terrible, rude and micromanage everything second of your day. Discounts are good, 401K is bad with levels of how many years you have to be there first before the fully match anything. Healthcare plans are reasonable and pretty good. Overall this is a good job to get more experience for something better."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Loved and hated my time there. Learned a lot about myself. Great place for people trying to decide what they want to do but not for established professionals.
good,This is not the sort of environment for someone who has worked in the professional world for some time.  The culture is very young and hip- and at times unprofessional.  Anyone over 30 is immediately aged in the presence of these millennials.  This is a good part time job to make ends meet or just to get out of the house.  Just don't bank on having an actual career unless you are willing to play the game.  It's just like Big Brother or Survivor.  You have to build alliances in order to get ahead. Women are also grossly underrepresented in the upper management positions.
good,"The pay and benefits were decent, but not a good place to work if there are health concerns or other pressing matters. The management staff could use some training on how to treat workers as humans and not robots."
good,Apple has good benefits but the management staff is not as competent as one would hope . Management makes a lot of sneaky moves and blocks advancement
good,"Responsible for working closely with the team to ensure a positive customer experience & a maximization of revenue. In charge of increasing & maintaining customer satisfaction & ensuring that the individual needs of the customer are met."
good,"Service area is very stressful and schedules will hinder your work life balance. Overall the campus is very nice, however compensation remains on the lower end of the scale in many roles. Great benefits and growth has appeared to slow down."
good,"NA"
good,"A typical work day consist of problem solving, multi tasking, building and maintaining relationships with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is Making connections with different people and  enriching their  lives and helping create win win solutions."
good,"A typical day: answering phone calls from customers who have a technical question or needs help with there devices."
good,"In the beginning, we were told that we would have advancement opportunities constantly. We were told that we would receive benefits and Paid Time Off, Vacation Time, Sick time. I haven't seen or heard from any of those things. This job is not as sweet as they've made it out to be."
good,"I was able to learn a lot while working at Apple inc. My co-workers were great resources who I shared a mutually beneficial relationship with. There are issues with diversity, and growth potential, but overall I had a great experience at Apple."
good,Apple is a great place to learn about technology and to work with amazing people....and build not only knowledge but a friend base that will last a lifetime.
good,"Everyone is really friendly, there is free coffee/tea, the cafeteria has really delicious food, I am able to listen to music while I work"
good,"More or less typical retail experience. If you like to work in a very large company and and relatively fast-paced environment this may be for you temporarily. Unfortunately the idealism of the company by its patrons will soon take a tole as you find yourself going outside of your role and pay grade often with no compensation, recognition, or growth."
good,didnt work their to long they went out of business they were a contract company
good,Coaching and developement does not exist and atmosphere is more like a high school environment versus a business. Environment is more suited for recent high school and current college students rather than experience employees.
good,learned on how a call center works and how to assist customers with technical support
good,Great company to work for. I learned a lot and quickly became a master of my craft and was always willing to learn more and spread the knowledge
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"You are so busy that you have to be at 100% all the time."
good,"Apple has been infiltrated by new employees who brought their weird cultures with them from companies such as HP. The benefits are decent but be prepared to take your work home at night, provided you're salaried. I should say that if you take pride in doing an excellent job, you'll enjoy it. If you want to dial it in, move on. But be prepared to deal with some very not laid-back people."
good,"Les employés sont solidaires, mais souvent mal dirigé par l'équipe encadrante."
good,The people that work there are amazing but please be mindful of management. Everybody wants to make a name for themselves at HQ and they will gladly walk over you. Extremely micromanaged!!
good,"The interview experience is rigorous, resulting in new recruits joining a team of motivated staff who are knowledgeable, engaged, and happy to help new starters. The benefits are good if you enjoy Apple products, with discounts on offer after an initial probationary period. Unfortunately the pay is very low for the required training and skills. Even worse is that management staff tend to be recruited from other retail outlets rather than promoted from store staff, so their attitudes are not very ""Apple"". They focus relentlessly on quantitative metrics despite publicly claiming to care primarily about customer experience, placing huge pressure on store staff to bridge the gap between the two. Staff are instructed not to train or perform admin on their own time, but insufficient time is provided in-store outside of hours where staff are expected to be working on the shop floor - again, staff are forced to bridge this gap between competing requirements. Management's attitude to staff members with mental health problems is abysmal, with store staff being ""managed out"" if they are unable to meet the same standards as healthy members of staff."
good,"I worked with teleperformance USA for 6.5 years. In that time i had worked on-site and at home. The culture and management teams on-site were quite good, however after moving to a virtual environment, the care of employees was almost non-existent. Upper management had an incredible turn overrate. The turn over rate of upper management lead to issues with constant change of basic structure. There was no camaraderie, and all employees were looked at as a number. And management was no there to help employees grow, but more so fill a seat and speak to the client."
good,apples call center is a very productive face paced environment. working there for 6 years and 1 year in volt training for the company it has gotten more micromanaged and the work place morale has dropped severely.
good,"I was an outside hire, so I didn't know anyone personally. This seems to have hindered my advancement at the company. I proved my skills and merit time and again, only to be passed over for opportunities in favor of people that had more ""clout."""
good,"I worked for Apple for two and a half years, very faithfully.  I was very clear about my intentions of staying with Apple as a career. I kept asking for the training for a promotion but every time I was given a different excuse. I was so disappointed that I finally left. To be honest, I believe it was because I was over the age of 30, not due to my skills or work ethic."
good,I would have loved to have a work/life balance and a decent salary that is  competitive with the price of living in Seattle but that was not the case.  This is a fast pace demanding job and should be compensated as such.  Apple makes billions but cuts corners within their retail environment .
good,Management showing a bad attitude to the staffs. Double standard. Salary is low and not worthy. But workplace culture among staff is memorable. We had such an amazing moment and the best teamwork.
good,"I was temp there, and I was trying to join as permanent,  but Apple not hiring people unless you have a relative or a friend working there who can help to get in."
good,"Apple retail has changed over the past 8 years for the worst. Management is primarily the problem, but the culture too. They claim work-life-balance, yet are very rigid on allowing you the most basic of availability (specific days and times off). Once you reach your pay cap, don't expect much of a raise over time. Also, don't expect much advancement. The advancement that they do offer is a joke, as it is a very short structure, and although it seems like opportunities exist, positions rarely open and when they do, management will tend to be biased on who they choose depending on the store you work in."
good,"It's the kind of place where you punch in, do what you have to do. You make enough money to pay your bills then leave. It's basically the same thing every single day."
good,"Apple is a great company, however the lack of advancement is tough. As someone with an advanced degree you would think you would be able to move up, but that's not the case. "
good,"- Too many store managers. "
good,"Apple is a great company, just depends on the department you work for, shift work does not provide a work life balance "
good,I enjoyed my workplace experience at Apple. It positioned me to grow technologically. It taught the importance of treating every  customer with empathy.
good,"A lot of pressure from management and little concern shown for developers. I like apples though. Fuji's are good, if they are fresh and locally grown. Otherwise it has that yucky wax coating."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Contractor with with Apple as the client. Completed a 1 year contract, was offered a 3 month extension but chose to not to take it. "
good,Good for saving money bad for church life need more stable off days. Good for single people with no children or middle aged singles who don’t have a life or much going on.
good,"Talent doesn't come by easily and inexpensively. The company would rather hire cheaper labour than invest in talent, experience and knowledge that could advance the company. Not the best strategy, if all they think of is how to save on labour..."
good,"Great employees and great money, however, the overall experience could use some work. Over the time I have worked I have learned a lot. They are good at working around a busy schedule."
good,"Apple iso only a good place to work if you love the products and company culture. You have to overwork yourself and suck up to management if you want any possibility of advancing your career. You have to put a lot of time in your role before you can transfer to another department. If you're in a technical role you might be given more professional opportunities than others in the company. But regardless you're expected to always be positive and talk highly of Apple--even at the ""kickbacks""which are big parties wit food and alcohol. It's a strange culture and I left after a year."
good,"I worked from home for apple THROUGH CONCENTRIX. I was a technical support advisor (Call Center). It was okay, i loved concentrix Apple was alriight , i felt underpaid for everything required of me and they are very strict and tend to wipe all your notes and stickies clear sometimes."
good,"It is better to have a name on your resume then actually working for it. This company has control freaks, highly under valued people. Management have to improve a lot."
good,"The days are long because you are either dealing with angry (majority) or non tech-savvy customers. Management is not helpful towards your professional development. If you are over 25 years old, seek other employment as Apple does not compensate well AT ALL."
good,Fun great place to develop customer service skill and learn and have fun while learning and working at the same time. Everyday there are new changes and challenges and it’s easy to fall behind so it’s not for the faint hearted but it’s a great place if you like a challenge and problem solving and can adapt to changes rapidly as changes occur daily.
good,call center too controlling and demanding call centers tend to want to know your every move from breaks to lunch. They know when you are not at your computer and will have your supervisor come look for you if you are away from your desk. And your commission is based on surveys which is not fair. Customer's can be angry with the company but reps pay the consequence and receive a bad survey not fair either.
good,"I didn't really like it, hard to move up within the company. The schedules didn't fit me because i have children and when i got hired they made it seam that they would work with me"
good,"Great benefits, you meet a lot of cool people, easy to get in a role that is hard to ever advance from, managers can vary a lot but some are more worried about covering their own butts/ shirking responsibility than advocating for their people."
good,"Talking to customers was mostly pleasant. The hours were the worst (afternoon shifts). Pay was not equal to the amount of work required. "
good,"Can be good for someone trying to figure out their next step, however benefits/financial security are low for respective areas of living. In other words, good work culture but insufficient pay to support good quality living for a family, since workers are treated like retail employees vs. Apple employees."
good,"My job is incredibly difficult and stressful, but it’s not the worst example of feeling under appreciated by this company. There is a role that should get manager level pay and yet its paid the same as a starting sales associate. I used to love working for Apple, but now I feel like it’s rather shameful. Still, if you’re in retail it’s difficult to find better. Which is really unfortunate. You’re told it’s a career, but you’re treated as replaceable by the next hoard of college students. L"
good,Make your people happy and the rest will fall into place. Pay fairly across the board. Don’t make advancement so politically driven. Hard work is all around. You have to just look.
good,"Apple is not all its cracked up to be, at least when you work from home. Management is absent most of the time and they have unrealistic expectations."
good,"Apple is interesting to work for because you love the products. But that's it. Everything else is a challenge to your personhood. From the cult-like behavior, to the self-posturing and five-star act everyone puts on, evangelizing Apple's dogma they drill into your heads day in and day out - on how you should act to be to be a star specialist. Apple tries make you feel like its a philosophy, working for them, that if you listen to them, then all will be well. That you'll find some purpose in your life if you live up to their expectations."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"First I would like to start by pointing out some of the few goods there are. The benefits starts (almost) immediately, and you do get to work from home and depending on what your commute would have been you could possibly be saving on gas and vehicle wear and tear.  "
good,The line leads and supervisors give little to non of actually guidance and leader ship. The only time that they were involved in the assembly process was when there boss was watching.
good,"Pay is moderate as a contractor, though if you do good work, stand out, are a team players and have good attendance, it makes little difference to the management of Apple. "
good,"since it's a warehouse environment it is:  monotonous, unchallenging, building manager seems to want everything finished by yesterday.  what i have learned:  worked with new software pertaining to mac osx such as filemaker pro, some in-depth working of excel, and an understanding of mac osx."
good,"Apple has a great job culture and hires amazing people.   Unfortunately, the experience varies from store to store.  Some stores have amazing flexibility and advancement opportunities, and some, like mine, just don't.  Management was extremely rigid and scheduling was done by software that could not account for family life (there have been articles written about the software and how terrible it is for employees, even though employers love it).  I loved the people with whom I worked, but the job was designed for single college students who have no outside responsibilities or activities.  For that subgroup, it would be an amazing job."
good,"Good retail job for part time studies."
good,The job is a job.  The culture is different depending upon which group you are in.  Overhead is overhead so everyone is your client.
good,"It is unfortunate the companies string-along hardworking employees in contract positions. Although working at Apple Inc. has been an interesting learning experience (I now know what I want and deserve), it is time to move on. I need to be challenged and would love to apply my MA in communication studies."
good,It was great place to start. You can advance at Apple. Great place to work as long as you are not there too long.
good,"Very flat company. You do learn a lot, but you work a ton of hours, not much chance of promotion unless you're willing to wait 5 years."
good,"All in all, my time at Apple was spent as a ""specialist""- another way of saying salesman. While pay was average for a retail job, there was very little room for advancement, and with the nature of retail economy, wild variances in hours (for example, 40+ hours late October to Mid-January, to the other extreme of no hours during the rest of the year). Some of the benefits included in-house e-learning on such diverse topics as enterprise networking and distributed computing, audio and video production software, down to the more simple consumer wireless and tech devices. Not the worst job, but definitely not a way to find yourself in Cupertino"
good,"Good for people with kids- Allowance for maternity and paternity leaves"
good,Apple expects 200% dedication and perfection. The goals are crazy. They are hyper critical of work. There is no work life balance. Whether or not you're written up is at manager discretion so it's not a fair playing field. If your manager doesn't like you they will blacklist you for promotions so you are stuck in your current position for the rest of your time there. Love the products but did not like the environment.
good,Was a great place for wanting to develop yourself as a technology professional and taught me an immense amount about working hands on and off with the different products we offered the customers. The staff and management on the other hand were quite unprofessional at my particular location. Made it uncomfortable being on payroll after a while.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I like Apple and what the company stands for overall, but I do not agree with the compensation. This is a multibillion dollar company. Pay more $$$$!!"
good,"Loved my team and we are all there dedicated to learn and assist while having fun, but there is no work life balance and hours are long with minimal breaks.You will work six 9 hour days in a row with one day off and then repeat."
good,"The culture at Apple, Inc. has changed from a customer-focus to a profit driven model. Employees are overworked and micromanaged, by inexperienced managers who are not required to possess technical skills. Advancement is non-existent and only lateral moves are possible."
good,"The shifts are slightly ajar, meaning day shift starts at 10am-6:30pm. I don't mind the shift.  It seems to be a high school environment. There's a lot of immature behavior from grown adults."
good,Everyone's experience will be different. I work on the retail side-- certainly not the most glamorous job in the world. I love the company; just not my leadership team.
good,"As a specialist you would rotate between different areas of the store from day to day. Some days you answer the phone, sometimes your setting up devices, others your selling devices and accessories. You help a lot of people each day and you talk a lot each day. Management had their favorites and those were the people that got promoted. It was a culture of giving feedback which did not work out the well. People would over use the feedback to get back at you for a decision you made that they did not like. The hardest part of the job was dealing with coworkers, management and the customer. Customers were always upset about their devices not working and take it out on you. Coworkers were upset about how they were being treated and take that out on you as well. The best part about the job was the pay and benefits. The pay could have been better, but was okay."
good,Pay is fair w/ lots of Benefits for PT and FT. Retail part of the company seems so removed from what the actual Apple culture is doing that it becomes difficult to enjoy the retail experience. My heart now sinks whenever I see the Apple logo and I loved Apple prior to job.  Retail Management is not highly skilled. The terrific ideas coming from corporate is warped or watered down because it is viewed through the lens of a hypocritical leadership team.
good,"workplace culture is diversified, but not necessarily unified. workflow is uneven throughout the year. colleagues are fun and possess diverse background."
good,It may be Apple but it’s still a call center. Attendance is valued over performance. Limited time off. No flexibility on scheduling or time off. Very much felt like a cog in the machine.
good,productive work place but not that work life balanced place. Expectation is very high. Could be using lot of latest technologies and tools to develop the application.
good,Working with Apple was fine.   Management wasn't the best to me. I requested to be switched from teams twice. Upper management wasn't really helpful when having issues.
good,"I really enjoyed the work - talking to customers about Apple products. "
good,"I loved working with all of the retail stores while processing their Physical Inventory. Working through variances and any issues, processing corrections"
good,"In the beginning I was very excited to have the opportunity to work for Apple. I have always been an Apple enthusiast and have used Apple products since they came out. I enjoyed sharing my knowledge of Apple products and software with those that came into the store as well as facilitating group workshops and personal one-on-one trainings. I had excellent feedback from everyone I helped. However as time went on I began to realize that there was a great deal of nepotism involved in promotions and moving up to positions within the store that I coveted so that I could advance. I have had several bad experiences with unprofessional managers who had their favorite people and couldn't seem to get the type of training and support that I was seeking to move up into different positions within the store rather than just selling hardware and software on the sales floor! Believe me, after 4 years it gets tedious! I believe this was partially do to age discrimination. I was much older than most of the employees at my store but still had a great rapport with them. In fact I remain in touch with several of them even though I no longer work for Apple for some time now. I was trying to move up into the position of a mobile service technician (FRS) that I had taken training for and passed (Mobile certified). However after requesting to be moved into that position nothing ever came of it. So I feel I was really let down by Apple. I was hoping for a long term relationship until retirement. The bottom line is I feel I was let down by them and was not fairly treated and am very disappointed. Apple"
good,I have been working at Apple for 6 years and much has changed since I started. They used to send swag home to employees frequently. They never do it anymore. The pay raises have been real weak the last couple of years. Tier 2 pays decent but the job is super super tough. The support to be successful at Tier 2 is lacking big time. Its unimaginably stressful compared to the much lower paying Tier1. I moved back to tier 1 and am much happier knowing I will never be promoted.
good,"very stressful, full of politics, a lot of meetings and presentations. extremely poor work-life balance. the good thing is you become very creative and productive."
good,Eight hour shift sitting in front of a computer. Two breaks and off clock 1 hour lunch all pre determined with no flexibility. Ability to support customers was great. Required to assist up to three customers at once.
good,"I was very excited when I started here. It is a well known company and it was cool to work for them at first. The pay was good, got to work in a number of different stations and meet some cool people. Over time though the job lost its luster. The work environment changed, and I saw how hard it was to get any kind of pay increase or career advancement. I don't regret working here but I doubt I would work there again"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Good benefits, but no advancement opportunity Despite what the managers tell you. Job becomes tedious after a while and customers are typically ungrateful."
good,"Apple is a good place to work for a single person not someone with a family . Especially when you have to commute 50 Mies back and fort every day, It is recommended for people who live in Elk Grove and Florin area."
good,"You need to be EXCEPTIONAL at time management skills, controlling calls, and able to proactively manage your metrics in order to succeed. If your calls average over 20 minutes, you will be assigned a second supervisor to actively monitor your calls and extra coaching."
good,"Quite a learning process, poised for strong, long term growth. Leadership on the enterprise side learning as they go. "
good,"A typical day as a service technician is very busy. Most of the customers that you encounter are very angry, because their products either don't work or they work and they feel that they don't work (when their products are actually working fine.) What I have learned from this Job is how to think my way through problems and break them down to be solved or come to an adequate conclusion. I encountered many people from all walks of life with this job and it has taught me a lot about human beings in general regardless or race, religion, or sexual orientation, and that is everyone has similar mannerisms when a device that Is in their pocket is not working properly. I used to have to mentally prepare myself for work, for the mental and some what emotional stress that the day may bring. The hardest part of the Job was dealing with the customers, some of my coworkers were called horrible derogatory terms out their name to be little them. Its good part time job, wouldn't make it my full time again with out a plan. Health benefits and stock options are the good side of the job, customers, not being compensated enough to deal with the general public and its abuse is the down side. In some cases you meet great and interesting people to work with."
good,A typical day was to answer calls with only about 6-15 second spacing and provide troubleshooting and support to CPU and IOS as well as other customer needs.
good,Apple has lots of opportunities just not for the outsider. As much as they like to make you feel equal there are many instances of being treated as NOT an equal. If you are a contractor you will be treated as such. Just accept it.
good,"I had a tough time during my tenure at Apple for a lot of reasons.  Management didn't support me when I went through a difficult life transition.  My work quality stayed the same, despite a lot going wrong in my personal life, but I was attacked by coworkers, and management allowed it, while I was out on an approved leave."
good,"At Apple, I was afforded the opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest people I have every met.  The expectations from management are sometimes impossible, but with the great team of people there we consistently performed what was previously thought to be impossible."
good,Required to oversee R&D functions.  Required to drive up and down the east coast training various customers on how to sell and work the apple products.
good,It is great to work with all the nice colleagues. Tasks are simple and not challeging. No career opportunities offered in all these years. Working at a nice location in the city centre.
good,"Coworkers are awesome. you'll make great friends with everyone. always ask your coworkers for help instead of the managers, they will always be willing to help and advise on any situation."
good,Days were spent being ridiculed and harassed by customers. Management preferred to push internal problems under the rug instead of dealing with them as they stated they would and fired employees that actually wanted to do their job and make a difference.
good,"mala"
good,"If you have children, this may not be the job for you. They say its a set schedule but they will randomly do shift bids. They are very inconsistent  with with their policies, and constantly change your Team leader."
good,"The Apple GNCS team is good and innovative work will happen."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Being contracted by the richest company in the world exposes you to the reality as to WHY they're the richest company... you're being underpaid and overworked, no benefits except basic health... and they're contracted A LOT of people... just add the pieces together."
good,"My co-workers were great.  My last manager was not very professional.  Hardest was researching reconciling items."
good,"The job isn't very hard to do. Most of the calls are simple enough after you get used to it. The immediate managers are very nice and helpful. They will normally do everything in their power to help in any way they can. (schedule changes, sick time without write ups, or even time off the phones if you just need a break) The higher management is where the issue normally comes in. The site I work for is currently under new management and they are trying to make the environment better. But there is still very little room for advancement."
good,"Enjoyed the job, until it ended"
good,"My work day was typical of what I had experienced in previous positions however, management was never around yet demanded action on items team members were not included on products and projects to validate timelines and ability to complete.  Work life balance was poor and management would email and expect projects due at odd hours (11:00 pm on a Sunday night) by 7:00 am Monday morning when most times emails weren't checked until that morning. I am used to working in fast paced environments, having worked with the DoD and other military clients needs information and products immediately.  This culture of needing to be seen while not actually producing anything of substance did not sit well with me for a client that makes Billions a year in profits."
good,"The pace of the Genius Bar is incredibly fast while, after being in the Genius position for some time, is minimally rewarding.  There are pretty significant expectations from you as a competent technician as well as serving as a role model for the other employees.  The position is great if you want something that makes the day fly by, but otherwise, I'd stick with one of the positions prior to Genius."
good,"Initially fun place to work in the department where I was assigned. Lots of new things learned and implemented and some of them industry leading. But as new management came in, cutting edge work was replaced with bare minimum and with those that has PR value to upper management."
good,"pay frozen for 7 years, not even cost of living!  was once making well above Min-wage and soon will be making Min-wage or just above.   This is for everyone!   Pretty bad when one works for and represents a computer company and can't afford the devices they are supporting."
good,"I was thrilled to have the opportunity to work with such a high-esteemed company, but I can't deny that I've been left out of all the perks that full time employees have access to. Things like access to the gym, company events, working from home, having security clearance to work in the same building as their own team...I can honestly say contracting with Apple can feel demoralizing at times, if for no other reason than the color coated grey badge you get on your first day. The grey badge means you're a contractor. "
good,Great place if you would like to work part time. I would not recommend if you are looking for growth and development. Leadership are not flexible when working full time and school schedule.
good,"The people the I work with are great, I made great friends and made friends out of the customers. But management is disorganized, dishonest and don't really care about your life outside of work."
good,"Working from home life work balance is non existing. Apple does not give raises and there is no real growth in the company. The company does pride itself on making sure the employees are in a good space financially and mentally. "
good,"You would think a lot when you hear the company name, as many of my co workers and I did. However, there is a whole, long and stressful story that I choose not to get into full detail about. Bottom line--management needs to be revamped. Better opportunities based on experience and performance and not favoritism."
good,"Nothing special. You can do 1 of 3 things... Sell, tech support or management. No room to move to corporate. Management is very selective on who they like and dislike. Salary is good. Good health benefits. Don't expect a rewarding career."
good,"If you've worked with one staffing company, you've worked with most of them; Apex is roughly average.  Treatment of contractors is decent, but doesn't rise above other similar firms.  Benefits are available, but not standout."
good,Apple Retail is much much different then Apple in Cupertino. Apple Retail thinks they can be all one brand but its not possible. No growth opportunities and leadership only cared about the select few.
good,"I worked for Apple for a number of years and saw many ups and downs. Overall it's a positive place to work, but it really depends on which department or manager you are working for."
good,"AHA program is result driven. The company doesnt care about your personal life.You pretty much spend your whole day listen to people complain. Pay is decent hours fluctuate , you are really part time.  Only offer hours when busy."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Great place for Technical people to work but management is hard to work with as they are usually getting in contact with employees every two weeks which makes it hard to stay connected
good,"(Contract position)"
good,The job is boring but consistent.  Co-workers are great and from all over the world.  Lockers are provided for personal items.  Not a lot of parking spots but the company provides transportation from cars to building.
good,"Its great to work from home, but the job can be very difficult at times and the compensation low. The customers can be very difficult to deal with depending on attitude, age, or tech ability. Managers change a lot and point system for sick days adds to stress if you have any disability or children."
good,It's a cozy environment where working with friendly and helpful colleagues. Learned about various country locations through online orders. The most hardest part is to differentiate between genuine and fraudulent orders. The most enjoyable at work is to communicate with people around the world via phone conversation.
good,Unable to disclose due to Apple Security policies. Employees are contractually obligated to not discuss employment on any or all social media and job site platforms
good,Managers do not treat the employees equally. They only move their favourite people in advancement for their own selfish reasons. Not enough hours either. The worst part of the job are the customers.
good,"A typical day at work is very quiet as Apple's policy is to have much more people in than the activity to ensure that no customer contact will be lost."
good,"Was a great place to work for, being retail. Became exhausting and felt under appreciated a lot of the time. Deal with more than we should"
good,Very secretive work with a lot of security procedures and Non-disclosure agreements. All I can say is that I did a lot of spatial analysis and digitization.
good,"Apple is great, there is vision, innovation, inclusion, here we embrace diversity.  A feel good company.  I feel the executive team still has some of the old Apple genetic, newer generations are loosing touch to the principles envisioned and founded by Steve."
good,"Answering in coming calls related to iOS (iPOD, iPhone, iPad) devices, Apple IDs, iTunes operation."
good,"phone and emails requested from customers."
good,"In my six plus years working for Apple at once of their busiest stores, I can honestly say that the compony has changed dramatically and it is no longer the welcoming and sportive place i once knew."
good,The people who work the hardest and contribute the most to sales are appreciated the least and compensated poorly. They force a feeling of camaraderie with mandatory showing/viewing of videos (Apple commercials) in group settings. Management is aloof and condescending.
good,"AppleCare advisors used to have a much better ability for work life balance - new changes allow for cross skilling at a much more aggressive queue management practice. ""Mandatory"" overtime abounds. "
good,"Does not feel like you are a valued employee for Apple, Inc. Hired through a staffing service and tossed aside."
good,Apple was something that I was very excited to work at. The .environment was proven to be very unprofessional.
good,Not much to really say a huge disappointment in the job working thru convergys
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Trabajo tedioso, pues era telefónico todo el rato."
good,"Apple lured me away from my own firm to come to Cupertino and work with the technical staff that would soon become known to the world as ""Mac Genius"" techs. While I will admit that being at 1 Infinite Loop was an incredible experience, I soon found that the powers that be at Apple wanted me to show up early to have breakfast with my co-workers, go to dinner after work with my co-workers, and basically spend every free moment I had with other people working at Apple."
good,It was great to deal with people from all over the planet starving for great knowledge about the best technology available. It was miserable to deal with an absurd level of unpreparedness and even emotional immaturity of some kids called managers.
good,Great place to work if you like stress. The Management team seems to be stressed out on a daily basis. Unreal goals that have to be followed through and work until its done is the nature of the beast.
good,Create place to work part time and get experience while looking for a career.
good,"I ran a station all by myself. I was always very busy. I was prepping, cooking, and serving my food at my station. some days I couldnt take a break. The funnest part is being in charge of a station and being my own boss."
good,A typical day involves handling customers whom are having technical difficulties with their products. I learned about handling confused and angry customers. The management are un-coordinated and honestly are lacking that level of managerial skill.
good,"A typical hard day of work at Apple involve many testings, emails/meetings and interaction between colleagues, managers, and managements."
good,"Apple retail is a great place to put your feet into the workplace, not to make a career."
good,There are a lot of great opportunities here. The work life balance is non existent and management can be difficult to work with. HR is not on site and so employees are not protected from the constant popularity contest.
good,"Overall, working Apple was an experience but I will say that I left there with a totally different outlook on this company than I had coming in. I came in excited and left out completely turned off. I still love the product but the company culture is biased with classist undertones. Only after a few years of being there was inclusion introduced because they had no choice if they wanted to expand into the cool and hip gathering spot it is now. It didn't start out that way though. They only targeted specific groups who they figured were smart and who could afford their product. They intentionally excluded and ignored other groups in their branding. The other thing that got me is that they wanted us to sit in mandatory meetings to hear them brag about how many billions the company made for the quarter but was only paying retail employees 10 dollars an hour in one of the highest volumed stores. I refused to keep going to the meetings because that was insulting and I had to figure other ways to make more money because they weren't paying me enough to keep being a fool. The manager was also a fake who was only interested in moving up the ladder at all costs."
good,"tout était à construire"
good,"A day at work is something we all looked forward to we were challenged and inspired to be the best version of ourselves daily, and felt encouraged and supported through intense development that allowed us to grow. Those things look a little different today to say the least."
good,"Working for Apple was one of the greatest experiences of my working career. I would love another opportunity to work on a project with the company given that there was room for growth for my career. "
good,Apple is a secure job but the life work balance is awful. The benefits are good and the discounts are nice  you will learn a lot about how to properly listen to people and you will take new skills with you from this job
good,"Company provided computers made the job easier. I would return if given the opportunity to work from home remotely again. "
good,The benefits from this company are incredible. Unfortunately room for growth is not there. You have to know somebody to move up or be hired from a staffing company.
good,Did not feel support from management. Work schedule constantly changing. Very difficult to advance in career due to the extreme competition. There is people there that have been in the same position for 10 plus years.
good,"Apple Retail is quite the journey. The culture is very strong and pushed on you quite bit, which if you're into it can be great, but if not it is suffocating. Benefits and support from Apple are second to none in comparison to other part-time retail jobs, but the retail side of things can become exhausting. Overall, I am grateful for my time there, and would recommend it as a part-time job through college or as a second job."
good,"It's good pay for the type of job. But it's still a retail position. The hours are retail based. Most locations are in shopping malls. The most difficult parts of the job are maintaining the motivation to work hard with very little payoff in regards to purpose or fulfillment. As with any retail job, the customers tend to treat you like subpar human beings and place their product functionality over your value as a person. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"After the initial excitement of working for a major tech company, the job provides little to no growth. The lack of creativity and problem solving leaves you with a sense of emptiness."
good,"I was making less because I had to pay more for their benefits."
good,"Contractors are treated as second class workers with no permits to programs needed to the tasks, no entrance through the same places as full times, treated differently in many ways and the pay is very bad"
good,Good. Nothing special. Not professional. They never respect your qualifications. Sick hours is very less. So strict with time. We can earn more money by overtime
good,"Good people, culture, and positive attitude. My only feedback is work life balance and having more managers who understand what communication really is."
good,"If you work here, do not work in the creative media department. When i moved to that department i felt the culture wanted machines over employees. In a false sense of appeasing customers, they made the job stressful for employees"
good,"Work long hours. "
good,"Working at apple is really great depending on management. The culture at apple is really friendly and hard working. There are great benefits and it is a great environment to work in. Many of the managers at apple are not originally from the company therefore there is a lot of inconsistencies, unfairness and favoritism when it comes to advancing your role or promotions."
good,The Apple environment is great between coworkers but management plays clear favorites and you advance as far as your rapport with managers gets you. Once managers start liking someone more than you you will be put aside and most like stay in role for a fair amount of time.
good,"Working at Apple is an amazing experience, seeing your work in the hands of millions (maybe billions!) The work is meaningful, but challenging, and succeeding within Apple takes energy and patience."
good,"Apple is a company where you must like to work with routine, otherwise you’ll be frustrated. Because the budget constraints you will not be able to travel abroad your location and the most of interactions with people abroad happen through video conference. The culture is strong and competitive. They don’t have focus on the employees and the Career Development depends on your Leader."
good,"Management was terrible, results didn't matter for upward mobility nearly as much as being a yes man."
good,"Poorly managed. Too concerned with what is coming up to focus on fixing what is immediately wrong. You will be degraded and expected to deal with it. "
good,"Apple can be a very demanding place to work for an outside salesperson. If you have a manager at Apple that wants all kinds of reports and metrics- you will have less time to actually sell, and that will affect your work-life balance negatively. "
good,"The schedule was always changing, so if you have a family or if your in school this is not a good fit for you. I worked from home, that was the best part. The pay wasn't enough for me so I had to change jobs. Good luck in your job search."
good,"I certainly learned a lot in the short time I was there freelancing, however their training is lacking - you're pretty much on your own to learn the insane amount of processes associated with each project. Work day is 24/7."
good,"The culture at the retail level leaves a lot to be desired with regard to the brand that is Apple. The managers are inexperienced micromanagers, with poor communication skills and a sense of entitlement not earned."
good,"Work required to handle customer every 10 minutes which can get mentally exhausting. Work life balance does not exist for full time employees. Customers are full of themselves and demand everything be done for free. For them which when you state company policy and reject them, a manager will then come and override everything you’ve said. It’s almost pointless."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"As a contract worker you are treated differently than ""Permanent"" employees. Sometimes excluded from meetings, excluded from awards, and left out of incentives."
good,I worked in AppleCare's Customer Relations Dept. That in itself is difficult. First manager was great. Second and Third were not so great. Nepotism is strong in the hierarchy.
good,"Large lack of improvement in employee development, consistently hounded to meet metrics by low-level management team. Negative workspace overall culture beginning with store leaders."
good,"L'azienda in merito, risulta essere molto forte nel suo settore visto la grande quantità di commesse compresa Apple stessa."
good,Apple is a great company to work for overall; more opportunities to grow to become full-time would be nice. The culture of Apple is great and the benefits are amazing. Management could use some improvement.
good,Fast paced environment. Must be able to multi-task and handle call volume. Hours vary depending on needs of company. Overtime can be plentiful. Overall decent place to work.
good,"Unless you’re in an upper management position, don’t get stuck on the retail side. It’s very hard to move up or into different positions from a tech advisor position. Best bet is to leave first."
good,"Apple would be great if they paid they’re employees what they should. Also, I feel like there is no incentive to move up after you reach genius status."
good,The demand is high and the culture is not always welcoming.  The pay is not competitive and the employees are under compensated. There are not much growth opportunities in Austin but will be soon.
good,"Time at Apple started well until it became overbearing. In the technical support area, vacation time must be taken as soon available to avoid being burned out. Opportunities are there, but it always comes down to management. The Spanish support department left no desires to ever work there again."
good,It’s not bad just pays less but the working space is good enough to keep you busy for at least 8 hours. People are friendly and co operative. They give you different training but the only thing is it takes way too long to be a permanent employee
good,"Possibility to learn, grow, get promoted, and make a ton of money is all here. However, it comes at a cost. It will definitely take your life. Don't expect to have too much free time outside of work."
good,"Too big of a company for any effective advancement, or change. Depending on who your manager is you might have opportunities to grow, but corporate is making it harder and harder to advance."
good,"Don't take this job if your not 100% into Apple. If you do might not like the environment is mostly iCare, Applecare, apple.com Kbase you really don't help the customers you look up prior solutions to the issues and there a lot of issues. Best you have Apple ID or Could ID then you'll be screwed!"
good,Little consideration to life away from work and the imbalance in place. Immediate supervisors got it but above that it was non-existent. Spent more time reporting what I have done or plan to do than actually executing the plan.
good,"Some of the worst managers I’ve ever worked with. Lazy, incapable of assisting and constantly hiding. It made working there very difficult because when customers are angry, there was no manager to help."
good,"A former Apple employees back in the late 1990s."
good,"Apple used to be a great company to work for, but the culture has changed a lot.  The one REALLY, REALLY good thing about Apple is the benefits.  I don't think there are very many companies that can match the benefits.  The pay is relatively good, but unless you know how to work the system, there is no opportunity for advancement.  I would only consider working for Apple again if it was in a Retail Store or at a campus in a development or team capacity, and not in technical support.  Technical support relies to heavily on metrics, and metrics rely too heavily on 1/10th of your actual work.  It simply doesn't account for the ""real"" work that you put in."
good,"Apple used to pride itself as the best company to work for because they were ""different"". However in the last 4-5 years it has become very typically corporate. When I began it was different as it had all the best aspects of a small company feel with the job security of a large corporation."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"While the company provides you with great benefits, the work is extremely demanding. This isn't necessarily the fault of the company, however they could have taken steps to alleviate the stress of the job. Treated as if you are a machine instead of a person."
good,I worked at an Apple data center and learned a lot from this job environment that I can take with me anywhere. Although the job site was smaller then others and the growth was very limited low turnover rate from contractor to FTE. I'm grateful to be apart of this company and being able to work on advance servers and equipment. I soaked everything up like a sponge and hopefully I can find a full time job at another reputable company with room for growth within.
good,"its an ok job, pay is ok, work life balance not that great if you're full time. Room for advancement if you do your job. Part time employees get no paid time off."
good,"Working at Apple is a fun experience but requires a lot of tolerance to get by. Wouldn't recommend to a friend if they are looking for a career/reasonable work situation. There is a lot of bias in the warehouse that I worked at when it comes to race and how they are treated compared to how everyone was treated. A lot of issues can come up between employees. Overall however I had a somewhat great experience there and would most likely come back again if they asked, probably."
good,"I learned better UX design skills with my short time. The most difficult part of the project was forming a way to make my own type of landing page, based on the assets given."
good,If you enjoy the virtual call center environment then this position is for you. If not then look further. it is a very isolated position. all support is virtual and much less than immediately available.  to be successful you must learn to use the Tech data bas which is so convoluted that searching Google usually results in a faster answer to your inquiry.
good,It is a good start if you haven't had a job in a while.  Training varies and is not consistent.  It depends on who you have as a trainer.  You can meet lots of people from different cultures and backgrounds.  Jobs can get monotonous.  Pay is low considering Apple is making lots of money off work of employees.  There  are good people working there and there are people there that shouldn't be working there.  Attitudes vary.  Hard to get hired on permanently.
good,"Apple was a great opportunity to begin with, but once they started laying off teams the increase in call volume became overwhelming. Also, they do not offer an opportunity for employment if you have already worked for them before."
good,"Apple pays above average for call-center work and generally requires no prior experience. However, Apple is such a large company that advancement opportunities are scarce, and unless you are doing the work of 3 jobs, you are not considered for promotions."
good,"While Apple continues to rake in billions of dollars quarterly, its employees do not share in that wealth. Internal growth is stagnant, pay increases are subpar or nonexistent, and the expectations and responsibilities continue to skyrocket."
good,"I'm a contractor. So, Its not much difference between a consulting company. Its like working from offshore even though you're in US. Full time employees meet us(contractors) once a week."
good,was a very good job enjoyed to learn different pros  and cons about the company but the overall experience was great and I really really did learn a lot from the company
good,"It was very hard to get ahold of. I left messages, they were returned more than a week later. Just was not an ideal situation. I was put in job position that i was not trained for."
good,"los puestos son bien remunerados pero los riesgos son mayores por que te pueden descontar lo siguiente: falta de inventario, por equipos dañados o por descuentos mal aplicados."
good,"Apple makes great products. Some managers are awful some are great. If you work really hard, you will be rewarded. You cannot expect to be hired and jump in with suggestions - get in, learn your job, do it really well and once you are trustworthy you can start to share your ideas."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Lots of great colleagues, but pressure to outperform yourself every month gets tiring. Compensation is very good, but expect to spend more than 50 hours per week to do your job. There is a constant pressure to do more and more (expand responsibility), don't expect to be focusing on the core skills that got you hired."
good,They are very focused and know what they want. This was a contract project. They do provide good training and high standards. Once you get your project they trust you to make your own decisions.
good,Pretty much decent in terms of work life balance need to work through every day even after office hours and manager was not good kept bugging as micor management terms of work
good,Fantastic company for experience.  No work/life balance or progression of career.  Great exposure to some International projects and cross functional work
good,The culture at Reliability engineer group preferred fast pace and stressful. Every single day came up with new material for testing along with a lot of data collection.
good,"Fine place to work for awhile. Management is a very closed club. Regardless of performance I’ve seen talented people that worked close to a decade being promised career opportunities that somehow never quite happen. There is always a new reason popping up as to why you don’t deserve a reasonable raise or better position. Good health benefits, overbearing micromanagement practices. Fast paced environment, good exposure to lots of different technology applications. TERRIBLE WORK/LIFE BALANCE."
good,"My time with Apple i LOVED it, but the cons far outweighed the pros. I went through 5 Team Managers withing a 5 month period and during that transition there were times i was without a manager. A lot of my problems were ignored beacuse it was not being communicated at the time the managers left. Also we have a chat while we are on phone calls just in case we need help and they wouldnt answer any questions that were comlicated. they would move on to the easiest question and by pass the difficult one. Also its nearly impossible to communicate with HR i had issues with my paycheck and did not hear back from payroll until a month later. Very unorganized."
good,"Working on the Culinary side of things at Apple was a very average experience.  Salaries are better than typical private restaurant work but the culture is somewhat toxic.  There is a great deal politics involved not only in the day to day work, but specifically when it comes to promotions, bonuses, and compensation."
good,Not bad but zero room for advancement. You basically changed a name tag and stood at a different spot in the building. No pay increase either. Just diff badge.
good,"Being hired as an Apple Contractor may seem like a great idea, but that's not the case. Eventually you find out that you are just there to help everyone exceed and you never get credit for the work you do. You are underpaid and never invited to important meetings and events."
good,"worked for Apple 12 years management made promises they never kept."
good,"In my particular role advancement was almost impossible. And the managers were not willing to help you advance or switch positions."
good,"Apple is a great company, but the tax department has been under staffed for 20 years and it does not appear that the staffing issues will improve in the near future."
good,"When asked, ""How is it working at Apple?"", I usually respond, ""Intense"". It's a fast paced & innovative environment, and you work with creative and highly skilled colleagues. There are no slackers at Apple - one would not last. You must be willing to be innovative and independent because as a new employee there are no organization charts, nor written processes. They feel that would stiffen creativity and Apple wants to see how you handle your job function and what you come up with. It's an exciting place to work, but not for everyone. You have to be willing to think out of the box and respond/react quickly and timely. The downside is many can burn out as the pace often cannot be sustained indefinitely."
good,"It's a big corporation so it's typical as most. Management in my experience is poor.  There are so many levels of management that responsibilities just trickle down and if you're on the front-line you get the words off a person in management a few levels above you."
good,"Apple demands an incredible amount of dedication from their workers. Working on a hot project meant you worked non-stop until it was done, and then it was on to the next hot project."
good,"If you are getting hired as a temp, please be aware that you probably won't get hired. 120 people started working and only 3 got hired permanent. It doesn't matter how hard you work... you prob won't get it."
good,Just because my overall experience wasn't as great as I expected to be doesn't mean it won't be for the next individual. I'd still recommend this job to anyone.
good,"- Typical day was managing camera development for iPads"
good,Nice Working Place.Freely atmosphere.but lack of rules and regulation. language of staff was not good enough.interference of external people are on peak.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Hours were ok"
good,like working there looking for a company that will best use my professional skills. Looking for advancement and better pay. Willing to relocate and be trained in any degree.
good,I don't plan to leave Apple until I find a new job because the pay is decent. But the career path to advancement is invisible.  Managers are all different in what they want.
good,Although you work from the comfort of your home. You start to feel like you never leave your job and start to associate the negative parts of the job with being at home.
good,"The scheduling is competition based and changes every 3 months.  If you want weekends or evenings off, this isn't the position for you."
good,"-take about 40-60 calls per day dealing with iOS or Mac devices"
good,"Apple is the worlds largest company by market cap and is quickly approaching the one TRILLION dollar mark.  It did not get there by being a nice guy to either its suppliers or its employees."
good,"Learned many skills to improve not only myself, but my resume as well. Management needed to abide by Apple policies, however did so in a way which at times, could be contradictory."
good,"No real aspect of career progression available at all, purely left and right advancement. Great student job. Easy to get caught into the shine at the beginning but it is after all just retail."
good,It was good job but the manager wasent so good there is free food so that's good you have to be dating. Up for long time and be fast paste need better tea
good,"I am looking forward to something I really enjoy doing, like banking and Forex trading . It was not  really what I enjoyed doing, and not  the type of carrier I wanted to persuade."
good,"good people, good benefits. "
good,"You work with smart and amazing people but the management is a joke. They promise to develop internally and provide opportunities to work your way up from the bottom,. but with the favoritism amount the leadership team it is not possible sometimes."
good,"I have been here for nearly 10 years and I have seen it change from a vibrant, we can do anything culture to a target just get it done culture.  Hiring process seems to be more about who you worked for than what you can do now."
good,"I haven't worked at Apple for almost 10 years for no reason.  I love Apples products and its customer are second to none.  The dedication that people have to Apples products is legendary and supporting these people has always been a supreme joy.  The management style at Apple is its worst problem.  The culture of threatening its employees and providing zero encouragement and guidance and support in areas that truly matter is saddening.  The company is such a huge monster and has the potential to be even bigger and better if only it would treat its employees with more respect and treat them as humans, not just numbers.  The managers are expected to deliver coaching opportunities in every meeting, never being given an opportunity to simply praise a employee and nothing else. I have seen so many times when managers are on completely opposite ends of communication and ideas for managing and the confusion this causes with the employees is frightening.  The company itself is a good company that offered good compensation and benefits, however the management styles that encourage and expect threatening and intimidation as a way to motivate employees is misguided and wrong on all levels.  In my time here I have had so many excellent experiences with coworkers and customers, that is the only reason I have stayed for so long.  The hardest part of the job is knowing every meeting I will be told ""you did great! but..."""
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Typical day at work might be working on the sales floor, teaching people how to use technology better, solving technical problems, helping businesses grown and so much more. Every day is different and requires creativity and flexibility. "
good,I was only there for a couple months for a single project they needed done. Staff and co-workers were nice and helpful. Management didn't see to much as i was working a night shift.
good,"This company has changed drastically over the last few years. As it has grown quickly, the work environment has become much more corporate. There is a large influx of former Dell management that have joined the team and the work environment is more like Dell (all of the bad stories you have heard over the years). Employees are now seen as disposable."
good,"it was an okay place to be, but working as a contractor through Xerox, the pay was terrible, the benefits were a joke and it wasn't that great."
good,"There were parts of the job that I liked. For example, the down time. However, the management was very hard on us and unfair. They would not inform you of a schedual change and if you were late that day you would get written up or terminated. Very little to no breaks what so ever. Very unfair with pay. By the end of my three year carrer I was only making 25 cents more then when I stared and new hires were making at least $1 an hour more than me with no chance of a raise."
good,"Working in Apple Inc, in Elk Grove, CA is cool. I am in a good department which I learned a lot working there. I have good Lead and trainers helping me out when needed. It just the Temp Volt Agency is not paying well - pay almost minimum wage."
good,"The Mac Store was a great Pacific Northwest owned and operated company.  In March of this year they were acquired by Simply Mac a subsidiary of Gamestop.  I was promptly laid off as I they would have to have either given me a raise, or let me go."
good,"There is a slight case of geeks gone wild here, and they have a culture where they are the best and if you don't know EVERYTHING about computers you're not as good as those who do. Steve Jobs is basically God here, its a bit bizarre, but at the end of the day he signs the cheques I guess, so he deserves some praise…"
good,i've learned a lot about apple software and hardware apple product in general also how to communicate  with different culture
good,Apple was a fun company to work for. Working long days and weekends are a typical Apple Employee. You try to have a work life balance but that is really up to you or work will take over. Company events are always fun!
good,"It depends what dept. you are in. Within our department there was no advancement possible."
good,"•	Managed and maintained inventory to provide stellar customer experience"
good,"nice place to work in, there is not much red tape when you need to discuss work with management."
good,I was working under a temp agency when i worked for apple. I only had a 1 year contracted and then i got laid off for 6 months. Apple enviroment was good the coworks were fine the actual apple employees made is seem to us like they were better then us.
good,Good. typical 9 to 6 environment with need to stay late at times. Sometimes all month through.
good,"Typical day was spent answering inbound phone calls for sales and support related queries."
good,"Rewarding, but challenging work environment, can be almost 24/7 during busy periods"
good,"Lower Management = good"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,The enviorment of the aplle call center was very unprofessional and made me feel very uncomfortable.
good,"Lot's of 'retail lifers'. "
good,"You have to give it your all, and they don't care what else you give. I've loved the company for years, but I can't take it anymore."
good,"The transition with new management has been a challenge. The store has a different feel than before. Management is very challenging, however some of the best co-workers I have met. The hardest part of the job was the demand for time that management placed on technicians. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving it."
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company though it started pretty rocky,"
good,Working as a Apple Technical Advisor was great experience. I love hat fact that we had the freedom to by ourself with our customers and didnt have  to memorize and generic script.
good,"Working for Apple was cool.  A fun laid back environment at times, however, overall the job was just that a job.  Customers are rude and feel as if they are entitled.  Managers do not always have your back, and in some cases are unavailable when you need them most.  As far as compensation, it was great as long as the hours were given. Many times specialists were scrambling for additional hours and managers claimed there weren't any available.  Swapping/ giving away shifts were nearly impossible as part timers were not allowed to work over 29 hours.  In terms of benefits, Part Timers are not offered tuition reimbursement which made absolutely no sense as the majority of the company is made up of part timers.  You also do not accrue vacation time, so any time off is unpaid which sucks if you are a parent or live on your own.  "
good,"A typical day was retail related tasks."
good,"long and drawn out day with not much work to do , no advancement on offer unless you knew someone above board."
good,Work life balance is the hardest part. Sometimes you keep chasing the deadlines and work all day and night.
good,Checklist style of management with minimal time for development.
good,The most enjoyable experience working in Apple was the many fun events and direct interactions with customers!
good,Extremely competitive people to work with. Lots of geeks. World's best.
good,電話の応対、接客、資料作成、cad(トレース)
good,"What can I say? The corporate world is full of internal politics and major disconnects between departments. Apple is no exception. Middle management is killing innovation. ""Think Different"" has given way to ""drone on""."
good,"My favorite part of coming to work is my coworkers and the energy around the store. I have learned an extreme amount being there about both customer service and technical support. On a typical day, I see anywhere from 20-25 customers and I am allotted 15 minutes per person to solve their issue. I am expected to attend to the customer in no shorter than a two minute wait time. The hardest part of this job is that it is very stressful and non stop all day and we are no longer allowed to have two days off in a row... ever. Also the schedule is made only two weeks in advance. This makes it difficult to have a work/life balance as well as take the time to get renjuvinated before returning to work for the week."
good,"Apple has good benefits for full time employees and after working one year as part time benefits. Co-workers are good, young, fun people and make the job as good as it can be. Strong customer service skills are required here. Business is fast paced and busy all the time. Good place to learn about Mac's and Mac software."
good,"Micromanagement is the way of life at Apple  "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"If you enjoy pressure, stat focused and emotionally intense experience, you will like it."
good,"Work-life balance en het hoge tempo, maken het voor gezinsmensen lastig om hier lang te blijven werken."
good,"Although working at an Apple Store is not commission based, there a goals that need to be attained for certain metrics of sales. "
good,The training was very poor and so was the pay.  This was working for Apple online through a third company. There was a serious lack of training on technical terms in French.
good,"All about metrics. Metrics, metrics, metrics. In the beginning it's irrelevant as they see you as new, however as the world turns you find that you are simply another cog in the wheel. Eventually u are fired for not meeting expectations. "
good,"There are a lot of things I learned through Apple, and the company has taught me a lot about how the marketing world operates  and the politics of it. The benefits there and the stocks there are awesome, I’m not to happy with the management there at times as they seem unqualified."
good,"Unwilling to respond due to work confidentiality.  Privacy concerns mandate that I do not supply any detail about the job, responsibilities, company culture, etc."
good,"Apple is a great place to work retail if you're a full-time employee, but as a student they often prioritize their needs over school. They do offer quite a benefits for both part-time and full-time and the work environment is fairly accepting and open."
good,"It's a large company and my view is limited to what I can see. That being said, my experience is that Apple isn't a meritocracy, career movement is more related to personal preferences rather than job qualifications. That contributes to a somehow toxic environment, junior managers most of the time are clueless about their own job duties because never complete a cycle themselves or have the organization or personal skills"
good,Overworked and underpaid. Poor management team. Expect to be chained to your desk and expected to meet unrealistic goals. Ont he bright side they give you a great career boost on your resume.
good,Highly competitive consumer electronics supplier. You can search the web to get more in depth information. Privacy is highly regarded and guarded so you have to do your own research.
good,"The staff were great, the management no so great. One person would tell me one thing, the next would contradict the person before. "
good,"Pro:"
good,"I was actually fairly happy with Apple until they created a new branch of customer service where you were required to ""adapt"" to the pace of 3 customers at once in business chat. Adaptive means ""if they reply in 5 seconds, so do you"", and so forth... "
good,It is what you make it. There are times where its great. unfortunately the culture has change from being a company about its employees and customers to now focusing on the sale sale sale.
good,"Company seems to make up the rules as they are needed, started out as a family oriented company, ended up not being family oriented. It's a good place to start a career in the technology field, as long as you don't mind not using benefits you earn as company will hold earned vacation/sick days used against you as being ""out"" on yearly review."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I love the company and all they do to support their employees in terms of benefits, giveaways, and wellness, but as a student, they basically forced me to clear my entire schedule for them and made me feel guilty the entire time. All they care about are your call metrics. You could literally help someone recover seemingly lost pictures of their loved ones but leave you a bad review because the process is lengthy then get chewed out by the team manager."
good,"Over my time at Apple, there was a lot of growth in different aspects of the retail portion of the company. I was able to go into numerous fields such as stock and inventory, visual merchandising, and sales. On a daily basis, you are constantly interacting with customers and trying to provide them with a good solution to their problems. In addition, we weren't based on commission and so providing those options to customers were effortlessly done and in a genuine way. While I've been at Apple for a couple of years, I feel that there is more to grow from in other aspects of my interests like content creation, social media, etc. than what's provided in the four walls of Apple retail."
good,"Nice starting salary but increment is slow. The usual nice employee package benefits including dentals and optics, great facility and working environment but no much of career growth"
good,"Not the place for single parents of school aged kids, unless you have lots of help. Benefits are a huge reason why people stay. The job can be great or it can be miserable. Managers swing from being aligned to multiple conflicting messages."
good,"After 3 months on this contract the department decided to go with a contracting firm in Brazil and give my work to that team."
good,"The job was so short and the manager so unusual, that I don't have much to say about this contact position that I was on for only 3 months several years ago."
good,"As an At Home Advisor it was great working from home and spending more time with the family and pets, but after a while, cabin fever set in and I needed that social interaction of being in the work place."
good,"At apple you are always overworked and under valued. I've work for apple retail for many year and at different location. Apple Credo states that its people is what apple really cares about. Ive learned that they only care about their corporate employees. Getting promoted in the retail environment is difficult you can work your butt off and do everything they ask and still get looked over, but when you transfer you could be everything they other store is looking for and get promoted within weeks."
good,Great company to work for and learned a lot but no core values or clear path to what are priorities. Management overseas problems but no serious actions took place to  find solutions to solve the main problem which makes everyone job harder .
good,"the culture is difficult to assimilate to and whether you perform well or not if you dint eat sleep and breathe like them it doesn't matter how good you are at your job,"
good,"Great coworkers and Benefits. Job enjoyment has much to do with the quality of your 'leadership team'. If you get along it can a very productive experience. If not, it can be a downer."
good,"At the support level, there is no room to move to management. There is lots of internal training, but most moves are lateral."
good,This is not Google so its not all roses. Yes it pays decent. Yes the medical plan is good. The thing with Apple is the lack of work Life balance. The fact that the customer is over empowered makes it hard to meet the requirements to succeed. Your career is hinged by the customer survey when most customers either don't answer surveys or if they do its because they are upset at Policy. It is rare it is because of the employees failure to do everything they can.
good,"Worked with some of the finest and smartest people here. Everyone here has great work ethic. In a short period, sharpen your professional skills by learning from the best."
good,"While Apple compensates it's employees well, Senior Level Client Services is a brutal business.  To be honest, while I was promoted quickly, I felt I was stuck at the Senior Advisory Level."
good,"Great benefits, poor compensation. Apple in a nutshell. You'll hear the propaganda about how great your job is; meanwhile, you'll be paid less than equivalent positions at other companies. If you believe in the mission and love the products, it's okay."
good,"I loved working there, I learned a lot in my first contract role. Communication within the team could have been slightly better. I was not directly employed through Apple; I was a contract worker through Pro Unlimited, Inc. My pay was competitive, but benefits were the bare minimum. Since I was a contract worker, i was never allowed feedback from my supervisor. i always got the feeling that Apple did not want you to succeed. My team worked well enough together, but everyone really was looking out for their own interests. The only way to get more experience there was to sweet talk the supervisor into giving you more projects. Consistency and dedication are not rewarded as a contractor."
good,Schedule walked blocked for the day and pre planned including breaks and lunches that never occurred on time due to customer demand. Treated employees like children when it came to behavioral corrections with a point system.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,A place good for learning branding and how Apple does thing in Apple way. They do things differently from other brands and companies. Passion and love the products will keep you going on.
good,"I learned how to troubleshoot, upgrade hardware, update software and some minor repair for Mac's, Macbooks, iOS Devices, Apple TV's, and Time Capsules(WiFi Router Storage Devices). I mostly enjoyed becoming Apple Account Security Certified for iCloud and iTunes accounts and Chat Support. I was then able to help more Customers with more issues and provide resolution on my own."
good,Fun place to work but it is easy to get over looked with the volume of employees that apple has. I worked for Apple doing both Tech support and AOS support and felt there was very little room for advancement as Apple generally has a very low turn over rate.
good,"Was a nice experiencie. 11 months were I enjoyed of an amazing culture, wonderful people and good professionals.Good growing opportunities and a good bonus system. However, low salaries."
good,enjoyed my time there.  I wanted to go in a different direction and it wasn't available at the time.  I learned a great deal about Apple products and services.  Learned many qualities of providing great customer service.
good,"It doesn't matter whether your manager thinks you're amazing and you're good. If you're hired as a contractor, you're expendable. If they don't have a headcount for you as full time, they will not fight for you, regardless of your contribution to your team and organization."
good,"The schedules are not flexible, the calls are jam packed all day and all night. But you make good money and have great benefits. I worked from home so that was cool"
good,"There is some freedom with things like scheduling and breaks, but the pay is not great, there’s very few transferable skills to take home, the benefits are almost non-existent, and there are almost no opportunities to advance."
good,It was a great work place because there were only a few people working in my dept. The pace was fast and testing the devices were simple. Communication with supervisor was easy because she was very hands on
good,Management routinely hired from outside despite qualified candidates working in store for 5+ years. Constant increase in sales goals even for technicians. Be ready to spin conversations.
good,"Many meetings daily."
good,Joining Apple is  joining a cult. Spend lots of time talking about how great the company is while corporate continually undervalues and underpays retail.
good,"Zero communication with me on when the job ended. Went to lunch and was told my contract was over. No warning whatsoever. Based on that, I'll never consider applying for Apple again."
good,"Incredible company to work for however if you're looking for advancement opportunities and to make a career out of working for Apple, be prepared to stay in retail and not really go anywhere. You can move up and be promoted within your store but anything after that is northing short of a miracle."
good,"The workplace itself isn’t bad. However the bosses can be quite rude. Such as if your 40+ years of age with 2-3 children or they are grown. Don’t be surprised if your boss is 20 ordering you around."
good,I don't think this is a situation anyone would want to put themselves in. the pay is good but no chance to grow.. am I one with the set this is taking lo
good,"Wouldn't do it again. Apple was a great launching pad, but once within the company you were fairly Role Locked and there was little to no room for advancement unless you played the office politics game and sold yourself."
good,"Aside the long hours not too bad of a job considering the time it allows one to have free every other week."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"it was an ok place to work of course i started when the company interactions had apple as a client but management was horrible, but try it out.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"I was taught many skills, that therapy is a part of customer service and issue resolution. You need to fix the customer, then the issue. This applies in any arena of sales or customer service. Heck, even in life."
good,"I handled a high volume of calls daily ranging from technical support to general knowledge. I learned how to effectively troubleshoot both mac computer's and ios devices. Management is alright you must prove yourself daily. Workplace culture? do not pay attention to office politics or you will stress yourself out. The hardest part of the job would be the application process for long term employment, far to long of a process."
good,"Apple has a great fun working culture. I loved a lot from tenure at Apple and I wish to be a full time employee one day."
good,"No complaints, just need a daytime job making $16.00 to $20.00  an hour, I am a IT Tech responsible for repairing iphones and tablets. The management structure makes it very hard to advance in salary, The overnight shift after almost three years is very difficult."
good,picked and thinned apple tress in creston british columbia always good people and good things to see go to apple orchard in morning and soend the day picking apple tress and cherry tree
good,"...but becoming more like others. Fast growth challenged organizational processes for a long time, but new management is filtering in to make changes -- both good/necessary changes and ones that greatly affect the company culture. Depending on where one works for them, advancement opportunities can be very limited. Apple's typical approach to professional development is that you work in the same position until you search for another. They offer tuition reimbursement to some, however."
good,"Som det flesta kundtjänst företag, dock med mer samtal / timme."
good,"It was not for me, no consistency, scheduling crazy , worked from home, very unfulfilling. The initial training process is great, as well as the training schedule, but if you live on the east coast you could get off of work as late as 11:30 PM. This is if you work from home in the AHA dept. The training on new products is little to no help."
good,"Expectations are very high, job is demanding, hours are long and brutal and the team I supported was extremely difficult and challenging (and I'm being very generous with these descriptors). Because of how Apple is structured (or not structured), I learned early on to build a network and identify who I could reach out to to get my job done.  That was an invaluable lesson in not only getting results but in creating a collaborative approach to solutions."
good,"The days of RSUs being given out like water are over. It's a nice stable place to work, but there is no where to go. You will get stuck in the same role, with hundreds of people fighting to get every position available. Good luck if you want to move up."
good,This job is very cool you experience a lot at working at this job I really recommend anyone to this job you learn so much about computers this jobs is jus so cool
good,I can say its an exciting feeling to work for a company everyone knows. You have more than enough time to learn your job if you are working in a non customer facing position.
good,"I have been working as an AppleCare At-Home Advisor for about two years now. I have moved into a role where I often get to mentor new advisors and help them hone both their technical and customer-facing skills. The pay is good for a ""call center"" job but is still not that great. Pay increases are rare and small and only do enough to keep up with cost of living increases. I was offered to move up to a Senior advisor but the pay increase was less than 5%, which is not much at all when you are only making $38k/year before taxes. This would be a great job for a stay-at-home parent or someone that really does not want to commute to work every day. After two years I have really missed being in a traditional workplace. "
good,"Surprising not a lot of training."
good,"Micro management, well defined routine work flow and time line. More suitable to routine work lover without any big challenges. Dynamic working environment subjected to organization changes."
good,Apple is an incredible place to work. but the current management at Apple queens center is deplorable. The customer base is difficult and advancement is few and far between.
good,In the beginning when I joined in 2007 iTunes was more like a startup and a fun place to work. It grew exponentially and became a big mess. Hardly things get done without the top brass saying it is ok. A lot of good features get punted at the whim and fancy of these top brass.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Working for apple, especially as a non-tech person could be both fun and boring. The work is certainly good, and the people are nice, but they don't appreciate you being ""ambitious"" and they don't want you to ask for more work...I want to learn more and grow faster!!!"
good,"Work more earn less its franchise store our ideas wont accept and    "
good,"Apple is VERY customer oriented which is a good thing, but it also comes at the expense of employees. They are very quick to hire and fire based on surveys and do not offer performance raises."
good,"A typical day at work I would collect a box of units, and start to diagnose and test them. After collecting the data, I would begin to repair phones if possible, clean them, and then send them back on the line. I learned to work more effectively in a timely manner and in a fast paced environment. The workplace culture was rather laid back, but yet fast paced. The hardest part of the job would be to just keep up with the demands of the workload. The most enjoyable part of the job was just the laid back culture."
good,"Apple is a great place to work, however, it is very demanding.  An average day I will work between 10-12 hours a day.  I value the skills I've learned, the opportunities to take on new projects, and the strong leadership and support provided.  Apple has great benefits and is very competitive.  Personally, I would like a more balanced work / life balance and I am currently seeking new opportunities.  Below I am highlighting some of the great skills that Apple did provide and use them towards my next opportunity. "
good,"The company policies was not in Favor of employee. "
good,A typical 8 hour job dependent on schedule. With decent management and relatively easy work. A temporary contract job that helps meet ends meet.
good,"The pressure is a little high, as your performance is based on customer surveys.  These surveys could be completely false, and your manager could review the call/case and determine that you indeed did your job as required/expected or even beyond company expectations, but if the customer left a bad survey it affects your stats, period.  These stats play a factor in which shifts you're able to get. Schedules change every three months and you only learn your next 3 month schedule one month before it starts.  The only individuals allowed to chose the schedule of their liking are those who score in the top 5%.  The rest of the employees get placed into three pools, and your stats affect your place within your pool.  If your in the current pool that gets first pick, and you performed above expectation, you might get a shift you like, might.  However, these pools rotate themselves, between who gets to select first, second and third.  So, every nine months, unless you place within the top 5% of all advisors, your pool will be the last to get to pick your schedule, meaning you then compete with those within your pool for the shifts that no one else wanted.  Typically the shifts that have you working very late, or on both weekend days.  "
good,apple is a great place to learn and grow regarding technology. The only downside is the micro managing culture of SOME of the managers. It can be Mentally exhausting.
good,"Very poor management I think it is because of the out source company they don't provide any chances to your carrier and there is no place to spend your break in the street especially the lunch break you have to eat in the street.."
good,"Typical retail job, but with a amazing encouragement to learn.  Apple was an environment where training was fostered in order for you to be more effective at your job performance."
good,Top Company with Top Talent.  Apple is a great place to work.  Teams are cutting edge and very competitive.
good,"this will get you through the year and keep a roof over your head but not much else. "
good,"The people you work alongside are wonderful for the most part. There are many heart warming moments shared with customers. There are really good incentives, like the discounts for the products when they launch. The amount of knowledge you gain from day to day interactions is beyond measure. There are however terrible management techniques being implemented at some stores. If you try to change and alter the course of the operation, EVEN IF you are capable of making things more efficient, you will be shunned and made to feel like you do not belong by the guys that think they are smarter(Geniuses).The way people are promoted depends on whether or not you are willing to laugh at the Personnel Managers jokes, or are part of the inner circle instead of looking at your performance. There have been many times when new hires have been given opportunities before senior candidates.. The breaks are tailored more for a younger adult than someone that has come from a more professional environment.   There are more times when we have to participate in meaningless meetings, that block out time periods during the day, when we could be helping customers. If you've ever wondered why the wait time was 3 hours, its because we are in the back watching videos from our Market leader talking about how much fun they are having in another part of the country. Although I must say I have never enjoyed working for a company as much as I have for Apple. The amount of people that you are able to help with things they absolutely do not understand is very rewarding. Helping people would have to be a passion,"
good,Some of their policies when you can not work because their systems are down for maintenance but we get dinged for it adds up after awhile. Management doesn't budge on these and play favorites with employees.
good,In short Vendors are discriminated.  I will not work with Apple or recommend anyone.  The Employees sit in different location although we belong to the same team.  In the Vendors atmosphere there is a cut throat competition which manifests in unethical and unprofessional behavior of teams grouping according to the language spoken and not co-operate or being friendly with the people from different language (although belong to the same team). It is a terrible environment...
good,"The diverse atmosphere and flexible work schedule work well with Austin's population and traffic issues."
good,"Daily routine work, not much development as everything is built, no new learnings, coworkers are not much helpful. Nothing much enjoyable."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Very poor management, benefits were fantastic and an experience full job. Co workers very friendly and very convenient working from home."
good,"Apple is a great company.  There is never a dull moment; however, the job can be very taxing and it can be difficult not to take it home with you."
good,"Apple is great. They treat their employees good. "
good,"Learned a lot of life skills. "
good,the only way to move up is if you basically tell them that you're canceling everything out of your life and committing to just Apple.
good,"More word, but lot of nice technical stuff to learn from."
good,"The most valuable company on Earth.  Apple promotes a culture of open ideas and promoting those ideas.  The management of the company is somewhat erratic as most don't have any experience at a supervisory level.  Most of the supervision within the company are former engineers who were good at being engineers. These kind of issues are very common in a company the size of Apple. They are good people who work hard and are good at what they do.  A typical day of work involves planning for an entire week worth of changes that come from corporate office that has effects on the products that the consumers purchase.  I have learned a great deal about the work that goes into getting a phone, iPad, a Mac Book, or iPod ready for our customers.  The hardest part of the job is the erratic schedule and the excessive travel.  The best part of the job is watching all the new products come out knowing that I had a big part in getting them to be the best that they could be."
good,"You can give 150% to a company and do your best work!"
good,"Although apple has a multi billion revenue-It doesn't like to share that with there employees."
good,"this job was awesome through out training and with my first manager...yes i said my first manager...while working here i had the great opp to work from home but, by the time i made it to my third manager my stats suffered...my old manager would ask me personal questions during our 1on1 meetings instead of speaking on how my stats could improve...she came from a diff company of 12 years in a diff field but somehow she was qualified to manage 15 people...kinda hard to learn from a manager that knows nothing about the way the company operates.."
good,"-Some of the best people I have ever worked with"
good,"When i was working there, the job was very repetitive. It was the same thing everyday. I would go in there sit down and have to start inspecting apple units for any damages. Certain co-workers were very childish and annoying while some were very mature and just wanted to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was dealing with annoying co-workers and being consistent while checking the units because there was a minimum that you would have to do in a day. The most enjoyable part of my job was that i was able too speak with some of my co-workers while working so i was always entertained while working. I learned that nothing in life comes easy. If you want something you have to get it done."
good,"If you don't work like your addicted to the computer and don't make your numbers....your job is on the line. As a parent, I can't live like that. I want to go to a job and do whatever I need to as best as I can and not be held down my a magical number that is hard to obtain."
good,Busy workplace at all time . lots of unites processed daily. its was really fun workplace. there was restriction to taking you cellphones inside the ware house cause termination of your contract.
good,"A high rate of turn overs with contracts lasting one year, the over time was the hardest just because it was the swing shift.Over all a decent place to work"
good,"You must have political savvy if you want to move up in the organization, you are not judged or evaluated by results you are ranked on how well you conform to the companies hierarchy and culture."
good,"I worked for Apple for 6 months just about. IT was a roller coaster. The only thing that makes that job bearable is your fellow employees. Otherwise it is the most fake company and has changed drastically management wise over the last few years."
good,very busy retail work with very odd hours thrown in and the usual retail downfalls of very busy holidays
good,Many managers are too busy to develop team and feedback/direction is sometimes sparse. This results in some rather uneven promotion of individuals with an emphasis on hrs worked over innovation/creativity.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Online Customer Service 2006-2011"
good,"Pizza hut is hard place to work. There is so much to do while not provided with enough time to complete the tasks. It however open room to learn and improve many skills. It is a good place for an IT to start. Team work, Organization, time management are few of the skills which are obtained or improved working at the Pizza hut."
good,Working for apple is fun but if someone needs a long term job and a place where i can grow apple is not a best place. It start to cut back on hours and its a temp position.
good,"The job was good for the holidays as it was only for holiday help. I learned a lot about Apple Inc. and their products. Management was good and available when needed and the co-workers were ok, there wasn't to much conversation, because we stayed busy. The hardest part of the Job choosing which the proper manual to assist the customer with their technical needs, because there were so many of them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the overall experience."
good,"I worked at two locations. I was a manger at the Denver store - Adult World. It was alright but I had a hard time finding good people to work there, as it was an adult video and toy shop. I went back to the Longmont store because it was closer to my home (at the time) but my hours kept getting cut so I had to quit."
good,"enriching customer lives, multitasking many tasks at once, effectively resolving customer issues"
good,"Learned a load about Apple and it's products."
good,"From an individual contributor QA Engineer (non-manager position) Apple is OK on work culture and benefits. The work is relentless and rigorous. Say goodbye to a normal, healthy personal life if you work for Apple. It seems like every level position in QA departments are busy busy busy. After having worked at Apple through the 1990's and 2000's - 2010's, Apple was definitely a lot more enjoyable place to work back in the 1990's. Management in QA departments are a lot more uptight and demanding. Seems like to Managers are always under the gun and pressured to push their crews harder and harder."
good,"The job itself is not very stressful or boring. It's alway challenging and very engaging. The downside is the customers you have to deal with and the stressful work environment in which you have to work. It's like working on a trading floor with a ticking time bomb ready to go off at any second. Co-workers make the day very fun but when things get stressful it can go from bad to horrible. With retail comes the retail schedule which if you like it it's great, if you don't it makes work/life balance impossible. Older employees tend to hate the work hours more than younger employees. With that being said the job itself is very engaging and it never gets old and it's always challenging. The people that work there for the most part are very down to earth people and you would most likely befriend some of the employees."
good,Walmart is a fun place to work. I enjoyed the employees a lot and got along with everyone. The reason of why I did not stick around with Walmart is because of the pay.
good,"No work/Life balance"
good,I've been there for about 4 years.  Constant changes were made.
good,A fun day interacting with all walks of life. Compared to anywhere else it is always busy and always work to be done. 
good,I would check iphones for damages and enter it into the computer. Train new employees and audit employees for mistakes. It was long. We worked a lot of over time. Management was pretty strict. Very limited to advancement. 
good,"Learn many products and different softwares. Speak to many customers, co-workers are helpful."
good,• Promoted and sold APPLE CARE PROTECTION PLAN services to the customers adhering to Company regulations.
good,Don't expect to keep your job at apple if you are contracted through a temp agency.
good,Apple Retail is like no other retail work experience. One will work with some truly smart and ambitious individuals. This is a great job for a college student with great benefits. The employee stock program has made a lot of the tenured employees very wealthy. A very fast-paced and ever-changing environment. The demand for the product is always HIGH!!
good,"Apple retail like anything else has it's positives and negatives. Full time benefits are amazing - healthcare, dental, 401k, stock options. But the base pay is very poor and it's extremely hard to advance anywhere. Almost impossible to have a life (or even sleep) as the hours range from 7 AM to 3 PM on a daily basis. Working as a Family Room Specialist is extremely stressful and eventually wears you down as a person - every customer you interact with is there because their product is broken, usually by fault of their own. The real reason you want to show up on a daily basis is your peers. Really truly exceptional people, mostly coming out of college, therefore taken advantage of by being under paid and under appreciated. Overall a great place to work if pay and advancement aren't important and you enjoy feeling completely disposable."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Great place to work. Wish i worked there longer. I had a 3 month contract. It was better than not working there at all. Sometimes got bored. It was a good time.
good,"There was no promotion on the position where I used to work. no salary increase, no training to improve work experience  and it was a very boring job I have ever done."
good,"Apple retail can be a great place for young people to gain their first work experience while playing with tech. As an adult, you can't make a living there. Terrible work-life balance, no commission, if you have family good luck. Honestly it's a great job for young people. Apple retail (unless you're in management) is NOT for adults"
good,"Although I found great people working at Apple, including its managers, the culture there appeared very indifferent to group solidarity (i.e. members were not encouraged to participate freely, to express their unique ideas or speak in earnest about ways in which product/service could be improved). Furthermore, there was very little concern for anyone struggling; e.g. while there, I witnessed the end of some careers, wheon more than oneoccasion, the parting party was treated with about as much respect as any new comer. Needless to say, this did not inspire confidence in prospects for pursuing a long stay with this company."
good,"Everyday is a productive day for me. I'm always alert, on time, and responsible. The learning processes take about 8 months to learn but i was able to learn everything within two months and was appointed as the first technician to have hands-on experience."
good,Is has a very fast space working environment. It has short release cycles. It is an amazing place to work because one gets to work with the best people in the Industry and that helps to grows in professional capacity.
good,"Too few employees and stores servicing a massive number of customers. The policies that are in place make it difficult to provide quality customer service especially because the focus is on volume, not quality. If you want to get promoted then talk during meetings even if you’re not right or just rephrasing something. Hope you have tech experience because the training is bad."
good,"Ran like a spring break bar b que.  people came dressed in flip flops and swim shorts, no profesional management, no oversight of employees, mgmnt. did not care."
good,Working from opportunity.  Pretty good support for their technicians.  Average benefits.  Good training.  Time off was good.  Pay was decent.  Didn’t micro manage.
good,"Didn't really like how you had to literally keep up with daily updates, everyday things changed without notice and you had to keep up with all incoming updates"
good,"My typical day at Apple consists of 6 hours or more of queue work helping our mobile customers get up and running with their devices.  This can include any technical question that they may have about their device or any Apple service that we provide.  Depending on other support workers, your schedule may or may not be broken up to allow for change in your everyday.  Usually I have to ask for some variety.  The other role that you may or may not get for 2 hours a day (roughly) is being on point either at the front of the store (sales) or at the back of the store (Genius Bar), which allows you to triage the customers reason for coming into the store, get them matched with either a sales representative or a technical Specialist/Expert/Genius.  What i have learned in my years of being there is that a retail position still has its ups and downs, even after 7 years.  Great people to work with, but not so great getting advancement.  They tend to keep people in their position if they don't journal.  Those that journal tend to be moved into new positions.  The hardest part of my job is actually getting promoted after providing several examples of good hard work and customer satisfaction.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.  I would recommend Apple as an employer to anyone but with caution not to make Apple Retail their career."
good,"Apple is a great and fun company to work for, However the retail environment is sometimes stressful. The benefits are great and it is a good first job!"
good,"Culture is not receptive to ""outsiders"" who have not spent their entire career at Apple. If you are expecting to be able to industry standard processes and terms you will be surprised."
good,"At home customer support for Apple was a decent experience. Working at home was a bonus but the hours and stress levels at times took its toll. "
good,Payed decent for what you are doing. Schedules change every few months and you're pretty much stuck with whatever you get regardless of how it effects you. No real room for advancing once you get to tier 2 support.
good,"not challenging enough I wanted to progress got there is competition to who gets on bust with the managers rather than who's better at the job, feels like school."
good,"Very competitve and fast paced,short sprint cycle,no proper cubes assigned, contractors have to sit in a big lab, overall great experience, you will learn how to work in fast paced environment"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,I liked working for Apple however the work and stress for pay was very much unbalanced. I did learn a lot about customer service and I don't regret the experience. I love Apple products and that is why i chose to work for them.
good,"Good work place but fast pace environment"
good,"The experience is heavily reliant on the team as there is really no ""one"" Apple culture. Expect long nights and little recognition, but if you believe in the company, it's worth it."
good,C'est une excellente entreprise très dynamique et qi excelle dans le service à la clientèle
good,im just forced to write this review about a workplace i left due to differences in opinions on how employees mental health should be treated. so ill leave it at that
good,It is all about learning experience what I enjoy to work with people. I love Apple support accessibility for the diverse people to be inclusion. The hardest part of the job is unstable schedule.
good,"As a Technical Specialist, my duties were mostly limited to the Genius Bar. This is a difficult role, one that requires immense levels of empathy and compassion. During my two and a half years there, I made it clear that while I enjoyed the work I was doing, I was interested in moving to a role that would play to more of my strengths, so that I could continue being an asset to the company rather than feel like my talents were wasted."
good,"Working for Apple is what you make it. You either like it or you don’t. Working for Apple has its pros, has its con. Similar to any company. One thing I love, is the fairness and, how diverse the company is. And, also the benefits"
good,If you work in the call center. You will need to network and prove that you can handle the new tasks as well as your current tasks. The perks are good. But you need to be mindful of your growth and actively engage on how to advance in the company.
good,Performance driven culture where you either sink or swim. Will definitely push you to you limits & show yourself what you are made of. Good perks fr employees.
good,"Everyone is friendly for the most part. The job is high pressure and always busy. It seems like there is never enough people working in sales and when the managers try to compensate for it by pulling employees from where they are zoned, it makes the work day even harder."
good,"This wouldn't be genuine so I'll politely decline. My time at apple was long, but it was a long time ago so it is hardly useful for current applicants."
good,Mevcut çalıştığım şirket hakkında bir değerlendirmede bulunmak istemiyorum.
good,"I worked there for 3 years and a little change. The job is pretty basic with high expectations, but surprisingly easy to meet the standards with minimal effort."
good,"Apple has a particular way to work and expect you get the unwritten rules of work.  If you have a different way to work or don't get the Apple way right away, not a pleasant experience.  But for those who get it or are on a supportive team it is a great place to work."
good,"Fast pace moving environment. Collaborating with peers and vendors to provide support. Managing schedules, priorities to meet strict time lines and rollouts."
good,It's a great place to start your career. There's some potential for growth and the people are awesome.  I've been fortunate enough to meet and work with some outstanding professionals.
good,Working at apple retail is good for somebody in college that still is taking classes and needs a more flexible schedule or somebody that may be fresh out of college and looking for work. Don't expect to get the full corporate experience at the retail level. While compared to other retail jobs the pay is better and the benefits are hard to beat. It is still not enough to get by on in most places. Growth is also extremely difficult due to the amount of employees at each store.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"When I first joined Apple, I was in love with the company. It truly felt like a place where they really valued me and what I brought to the table. Over the years, there's been a shift in the culture where it's not so focused on the people anymore, but now focused on meeting unreasonable goals and getting down on the employees."
good,"Working as an Apple Specialist is a great retail opportunity working for one of the biggest companies in the world.  You will learn a ton about Apple, it's products and services, and will work with many young, creative individuals."
good,You get in what you put in its a job one of the cooler ones but still a job dope people great experiences you really just have to be your`self and it'll workout .
good,The work was demanding. Automatic email forwarding in Yahoo Mail. Mouse over the Settings menu icon. | select Settings. Click Accounts. Click the primary Yahoo account.
good,"You will typically fit better in this organization if you have a very liberal political point of view. If you have tattoos and body piercings, this is the place for you!"
good,"Work long and hard for people who don't care and don't notice. You only matter if you're ""main campus"" apple, otherwise you're expendable. So get hired at Apple Park and you'll be just fine."
good,They definitely didn't meet my expectations for such a well know company. I really wish I would have had more assistance and better tools to assist on a daily.
good,"Extremely good benefits and good pay. Nice to work within a team of mobile workers, however there is never a real connection so you do constantly feel like you are working on your own. "
good,Unreal expectations. Definite favoritism. Great co workers. Not enough permanent positions for contract employees. Inflexible time off options for contract positions.
good,"Apple can be a rather productive place to work for remotely, but in my experience, they hinder mental health issues and put people in the position of hurting themselves possibly by demanding some very unrealistic things. For the amount of stress and conflict I have put myself through as a part time job, I feel like I should be paid much better."
good,"Typical day at work was answering calls. Assisting people with technical issues. Very excited upon initial offer, excitement fizzled out after realizing the pay was not conducive and the chance for true advancement is  very slim."
good,I do not work at apple I just have training with the apple products which is nice I appreciate the fact that I am able to learn things that usually only the apple reps learn from apple
good,"Company is high profile and adds cache to your resume, but at a cost of work life balance.  working long hours is expected and to be on constantly.  learned a lot about driving teams though,"
good,"Worked on the apple maps project.  Good pay but want you to be hush about everything.  Even within your own team.  Didn't make sense, but you can definitely feel the money power apple has when you work for them.  Someone is always trying to keep tabs on you."
good,"was a great steeping stone into the world of IT. Would recommend to anyone trying to get their foot in the door. The perks are amazing too, Would work for them again if the right opportunity opened up."
good,"Loved the Company Hated the Job. Once I made supervisor, The customers became demanding and had unreasonable request, I liked being the low man on the totem pole much better."
good,the environment was fun to work in but the leadership was horrible there was a serious lack of concern for the internal customer experience and it showed.
good,"Good job just no advancement. Management was not as helpful as I'd like. Pay was ok could've been better, hours seemed long because large volume of calls"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"In order to work at Apple, you will need to have full availability, seven days a week, if you are looking to work full-time. There are benefits; however, the incentives could be better."
good,Work with some of the brightest people but work life balance is tough. Compensation does make up for it if that is what drives you. If it is family life then this probably isn't the place for you.
good,"Good products (back in the day). It has been a while since I worked there but I did appreciate the management, and work culture. Was my first job and it treated me well."
good,Apple is a great company to work for with great benefits. In relation to my experience as an at home advisor I would recommend working on campus if possible.
good,"Apple was okay. I enjoy helping people, so working as a retail specialist was a fine job. The atmosphere with other coworkers was pretty social. However, there aren't many opportunities for advancement at Apple, if you start in retail."
good,"I don't have much to review since this was a temporary position, but the culture was very fast paced. Only a small number of agents working as a contractor would receive the option to become permanent."
good,"The pay at Apple is great, as you would expect it to be. What you don't expect is the immense pressure put on the employees. In the customer service side of things there are two categories - Phone Support and Chat (Typing) Support. Phone support handles calls back-to-back for their entire shift, which usually results in being late to lunches, breaks or ending your shift - Which results in your Manager contacting you regarding your adherence, because you're apparently supposed to control getting a new phone call 2 minutes before your shift ends."
good,"It was a very good expranice. I loved everyday of it there. The pay was good , and the supervisors are very nice. The people i worked with very pleasant."
good,"The job was primary to help support the role out of iOS X and the first series of iPhones that were coming out, there was no opportunity to make it a long term job."
good,"The store I worked at I spent 9 years of my life and I saw almost everything! The managment team will under value you and  treat you like cattle. The people that I worked with really worked hard to keep the store together, but the managment takes credit for it. I won’t miss the managment, but the people I will hold in my heart for ever! Make Apple a stepping stone to help get you where you need to be. One last thing corporate doesn’t give a Shoot about people in retail."
good,"Demanding and challenging workplace.Some people are great to work with, but most of the sr. manager doesn't care about employees. Perks were better though."
good,The company provided paid training and gave me all the equipment I needed to be a successful work from home representative. Te schedules were flexible.
good,"good company, stock doing well. "
good,"Apple likes to hire people who are progressive and like-minded. So the relationships you make with the people on the floor with you are genuine. That being said though, management can be frustrating. It's a company that says it cares for their people, but there's been plenty of times where any innovative ideas were passed up, and then months down the line those same ideas are being implemented without so much as a thank you. They rely on umbrella policies far too often, rather than judging situations on a person-to-person basis. This also leads to a lot of micromanagement. The store can be absolutely dead, and you'll still get a manager breathing down your neck saying that you need to check-in with the one person in the store even though about 4 other specialists already have."
good,"lack transparency and management not genuine"
good,"work from home was convenient, hours were bid on. pay was low. apple products to work on. system was great, support was average, clients were very good"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I liked my time working at Apple but was frustrated at the lack of opportunity for advancement. I was encouraged to apply for a full time position and after applying, I still hadn't heard any updates for several months."
good,It was a pleasure supporting customers outside of the United States.  As a support agent for the Asian Pacific area it was wonderful getting to hear what it was like for technical issues for other customers around the world.
good,Your experience at Apple really depends only which group you work for. The culture can be drastically different from one group to another. The one I am currently in is okay.
good,"you are your numbers, this was a matrix driven business where coaching and recognition were based on your numbers, and how you score at the moment is what matters, not your track record."
good,"Apple is an incredible company to work for. Unfortunately, retail is retail. Working in the retail stores attracts a certain demographic, and due to the gung-ho bubbly nature of Apple corporate, the culture of ""the customer is always right"" overpowers care for the employees. Some managers will stick up for their employees when customers are being abusive, but more often than not, they're cowards who will do anything to make the customer happy, even if it means letting their employees be abused. And, unfortunately, due to the half sales/half service and IT support you find in an Apple store, the abuse is abundant."
good,Worked with small teams and had good working experience. Supportive staff and colleagues. Had a great time together. Executed medium and small projects in 1 year and 4 months time.
good,"Scheduling was always difficult, weekends were always expected for much of the staff as that was the busiest time of the week.  Management would often back the customer, undermining the employee and the company policies."
good,Helping customer decide which computer they need either PC or Apple as store carry both products. Advise customer base on their needs and requirement.
good,It is a struggle to balance work and family with the scheduling offered.  The starting wages and increases were great. Benefits were good. Breaks and lunches are required and needed.
good,Apple may be the most revered brand in the world and has the best products in the consumer technology market but there are some holes in the employment experience at the retail level. They is no clear advancement path with people that have career ambition and working with Apple over the years they do not show any loyalty for their veteran employees. It is a lot of work for elevated positions in the store with very little pay.
good,"While working from home is nice, Apple struggles to give meaningful ability to advance, with little focus on concrete advancement. Much coaching is focused on loose concepts of customer satisfaction rather than actual knowledge of the product."
good,"Leuke team, mooie omgeving om te werken, ontzettend lekker druk,  feedback systeem voor de klanten optimaal maar voor de medewerker kan erg nadelig uitvallen,  let dus op je woorden, jij gaat heel veel leren van de technische kant maar als jij verder wilt bijvoorbeeld bij genusbar dan kan het best lang duren voordat jij er doorbreekt."
good,Analyze data to work on large projects with a team and use research combined with communication to facilitate protocol and  guidelines compliance in a fun upbeat atmosphere.
good,"This is an excellent job if this is your first job. However, if you are coming over from a different corporate job, it is much of the same but with less pay. "
good,"I'm consulting at Apple and it's very clear of the separation between consultants/contractors and the employees.  Employees stick together and exclude the consultants/contractors from most activities.  You get use to it but for me, it's not the ideal workplace culture."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the people and learning my job.  Apple is a great company to work with.  I just had a contract job with them that completed.
good,Great place to work very competitive shape skills required for the company. Everyday is something new which is a great thing. New goals are set each and everyday
good,"Enjoyed working there although during launch time, was expected to put in 14+ hours of work on daily basis for 3-5 weeks. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Non stop repairing laptops, 30 minute lunch breaks, and paperwork.  I worked in a warehouse and was paid less than what I was worth due to having a Apple License thru a staffing agency plus i was part time with 25 hrs a week.  You do the math on why I left lol"
good,"I worked at the apple warehouse using a variety of tools ie forklift pallet jack. Data entry update stock status."
good,"Working for Apple is challenging, exciting and rewarding.  The AHA positions however only allow a limited ability to grow within the company.  Apple is a wonderful company to work for but if looking for a professional career with lots of career options with a career path and growth; you must be willing to relocate to work within the main office locations."
good,Fun working there   People where friendly good environment. No drama workplace. Work was easy. I just wish the would pay more money then I would of stayed
good,its good  for  first time job Experian's  but the problem is that its not a permanent job and its only contract for one year and then they going to lay out the employee
good,Good and productive use of time. Worked with other teams to fully understand the necessities of the project and utilize our tools and skills in the most effective manner.
good,"Employees are held to different standards based on who they know/politics. A completely biased work environment. Only performance reviews I received were at my request, and still offered very little insight."
good,"Preparing Phones and working hard"
good,"all very depend on project where you are, if you in good team you can learn a lot and grow fast, in some teams  you will have a lot of manual works. in general ok"
good,"some teams are good and some teams are not good. It depends on whom you encounter.  In one team I worked, the people are not competent and there are lots of politics. In another team I worked, engineers are generally good, but the managers are not honest."
good,"As a Technician, my every day job was to assist customers on mobile and mac issues at the genius bar. The environment is very stressful as you're dealing with mostly angry customers with little faith in their products. Apple corporate also is not open at all to its Genius bar employees on certain issues so you can be stuck trying to convince your customer to have faith in their product regardless of the issue. The role isn't very technical at all and does not require too much TECHNICAL skill. In fact, many people I worked with were completely blind to the way hardware and software actually worked. You don't need any formal education (degrees, certification) to be a genius as you learn most things from working day by day. The pay is significantly lower than other technical roles in the market mainly because of the fact that you do not need to know anything technical like (Networking, Unix Systems, etc.) For retail, the pay is great."
good,Apple was great. what can I say. I worked at the Soho store at a vary exciting time it the companies history. I started before the iphone and left right after Jobs
good,"Apple tends to be very compartmentalized. Technical support advisors are often not informed of known issues which makes the job more difficult. Aside from that, it was a fun environment."
good,I worked at Apple as a site support consultant for several months. My time there was enjoyable and the people there are very helpful. I would highly recommend working there.
good,"Working at Apple was fun because it brings together a diverse group of people who all have cool backgrounds and stories to tell. Furthermore, the work environment is well maintained and an enjoyable place to be while on the clock."
good,"I think my time there was great but I was in the wrong roll where I did not see myself staying longer then I did. If givern the chance, I would work in a different department."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I was merely an extra on a film shoot for Apple. It was for an Iphone X ad. The shoot was fun, but it is taking them a long time to pay. It has been over 9 weeks."
good,The best part about working at CCC is interacting with the residents and knowing you are helping to make their life better and easier. It is very rare to find a job where you feel your role makes a positive impact
good,I began working at Apple when I lost my career job. The pay is ok for retail but not enough to live on as a part timer. There is opportunities to go full time with other job titles.
good,All though your fellow employees are great to work we were still not properly paid for the type of work that you're doin. You could get paid more for the same amount of work in an IT position anywhere else you go. Although it is nice to work there your hours ours aren't guaranteed. Its a nice part time job unless you want to work retail all your life.
good,"I was working in Amman branch after finishing my classes at the university there was so much support from the management as I was still studying. However, that didn't affect my work or my relationship with the management."
good,fun place to work  just like any other retail job. opportunity for advancement was clearly an issue as positions seem to go to those already preselected
good,"Apple was, at one time, an amazing place to work. But as the company grows, the culture that made them amazing is beginning to be lost. Recent management in multiple departments has become very poor and a lot of teams and departments work morale is terrible. The pay isn't nearly enough for what is expected of you."
good,"Clean, modern environment.  Free coffee!  Lots of parties and get to gathers. Best customers in the world."
good,"I do not wish to participate in this activity"
good,"As the title suggests, Apple was not a good fit for me due to the particular health issues I was having at the time, but overall it was a very accommodating and healthy work environment."
good,"Great place to work when you have the right management. Unfortunately the management team as a whole is not on the same page when it comets the expected role of advisors,policy and coaching. There is favoritism throughout. Work tools onto work as expected and result in negative customer satisfaction surveys from the customer."
good,It was an assembly line job so it was a fast pace work place didn't really have time to talk to Anyone until lunch but it was a great job. They was very good on teaching you new things about the company.
good,"Very few advancement opportunities."
good,"For a company that was built on thinking different, they failed to hire managers that understood or supported this concept. "
good,"A lot of patience dealing with different customers. Some people are friendly, some are not, but at the end of the day, as a professional, I have to be respectful at all times"
good,great if you love call center job roles . hard to get career advancement depending on dept. employee must meet minimum criteria  of attendance.  no seniority  rules apply and yearly salary reviews  are competitive
good,Rate this company
good,"If you take a job with travel required at Apple, get ready to be away from home for a significant amount of time. Stock options are great and pay is good."
good,"Working at the apple store was ok"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,receive a certain amount of product a day to reach their goal. nothing really complicated about the job just have to be a fast learner. quick to reach goal.
good,Very competitive and poor process oriented. Lots of teams need to be involved to get a project completed. Leadership changes are frequent and completely run by contractors. Major Vendor have been here for 20+ years and rule and dominate the work environment.
good,"I loved to see how my knowledge from my education could be implemented into the business world, including my outside skills from design interests. However, I feel as though a cog for the motor is more what this job requests, rather than innovative strategies for workflow and design mechanics. Efficiency is a way of living for myself, and management seemed to be content with the lack of it. It is an easy job for a fresh job-seeker out of college, but not recommended for those seeking a challenging environment."
good,"A day in the call center is work as soon as you log in. I learned a lot about patience and working with a wide range of people. The management is fair and everyone has an opportunity for career growth, but don't expect an easy road. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the call volume and multi-tasks other job duties while sometime having very limits time. The most enjoyable is solving the issues at hand."
good,Always a place to learn something new with so many different activities taking place around the company. Some people are nice to work with and people genuinely want to help when you ask for it.  It is busy so be prepared to work hard!
good,Call Center Agent Job Duties: Obtains client information by answering telephone calls; interviewing clients; verifying information. Determines eligibility by comparing client information to requirements. Establishes policies by entering client information; confirming pricing.
good,Good training; consistent reviewal of new procedures; good knowledge base to be able to accurately help customers efficiently and effectively. Promotion available
good,Very fast past paced and very stressful. Service work is a mix of customer support and device repair. There's no room for advancement and you will not move to the corporate side from the retail side.
good,"Ex-Apple guys refer to this as ""Golden handcuffs"". Apple has great benefits but often work long hours for them. Typical day could be as long as 12 hours or longer. Sometimes conference calls need to be made late at night (11pm) in order to meet with persons who are traveling on Apple business. And while also traveling, often need to write travel reports for management in Cupertino. These can take several hours to complete again necessitating longs hours back at hotel."
good,"It is a fast paced environment, quite challenging. There were frequent staff meetings. We were well training and coached. We were asked about our challenges and goals."
good,"The culture here is fast paced but stressful. There are good managers but most of them are either on the verge of leaving, or have moved on to other projects. Lot of unnecessary meetings."
good,"intense work area with short design cycles. "
good,Concentrix is a third party for Apple and they really need to get things on proper order. I enjoyed working with the customers but not the employee. Management needs help.
good,"The company is great, good culture and good policies. However the job itself is not at all enjoyable. I work every holiday and never get weekends off. You just get yelled at for broken iPhones all day. The only reason I stayed was because of the discount."
good,Answering calls and making sure the customer gets the best help and customer service as needed. I also Learned  basic steps to troubleshooting  the iOS system on iPhones.
good,Apple is a good place to work. Very productive and competivie place to work. Work culture is good and people friendly. Learning is there always in apple. Its always make me proud to work at apple.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Good place and good company to work for, there are just no that many opportunities to move up. There are no advancements metrics set up that allows employees to advance."
good,"The job is great for a retail job, otherwise it can be very overwhelming very quickly. The management has gone downhill as well and the employee body has become more of a number rather than a name."
good,My manager is awesome but everything else is kind of meh. The job is too unique and that makes it almost impossible to transfer the knowledge I have gained. No promotion or whats so ever.
good,"It depends on who your representative was.  I asked one person multiple times a simple question, but got no response. Asked someone else and had a response within 12 hours..."
good,"Extensive investigative, research, and analysis of simple to complex “Card Not Present” transactions and customer accounts to detect unauthorized activity, determining appropriate next steps. Responsible to action fraudulent orders and accounts. To serves as a point of contact between cross-functional teams and business partners. Analyze, identify, and communicate trends. Research and resolve suspect fraud escalations from various sources."
good,I opt out of this review. I do not feel that rating my existing company has anything to do with searching for future jobs..................................
good,"Apple is full of very smart people and intensive interview process targets only the best of the best. However, the work culture can be overly demanding and work/life balance does not exist."
good,"Apple pays great, expects a lot and no longer has the culture it once did. You are expected to keep unreachable metrix, micromanaged till you are so stressed it shows in your work. If you are working outside of the call center, they are an awesome company. If you work onsite, that may make up for some of the stress caused by micromanaging but as an At-home advisor, you change managers as often as you change clothes. You cannot get any consistency because each manager has different expectations. I would recommend Apple to someone who does not have a family or commitments outside of work."
good,"Overall, there are a lot of talent people, very passionate about the products. "
good,typical day would first get work areas up and ready for the day secure material and machine. have a good attitude and be able to work alone and sometimes with a partner
good,Probleme von Kunden lösen per Telefon und E-Mail..
good,"A typical day of work consists on listening to customers getting upset about issues that don't have a great impact in their lives. "
good,"It is a fast-paced environment, where we have to juggle between 2-3 different tasks, short deadlines and expected to work over weekends as well, high security issues, lot of NDAs to sign to get access even for small things; get to work on innovative problems and challenges, minimal help.."
good,"This company demands the most from its employees, but does not do much to compensate them for their efforts. Management was prone to favoritism and nepotism. Contractors treated as though they were disposable assets even though they clearly provided a wealth of talent and dedication."
good,They take their training seriously and expect those who work for them to know the information backwards and forwards.  Advisors must enjoy talking on the phone but management seems to care more about call times and customer surveys more than making sure  the customers understand their new product or service.
good,"everyone bad mouthing apple's working culture and working hours, I am fine. but Apple is too big so too many political fightings,  in apple one die anyway left or right, just a matter of time, but you never know why you die"
good,"Apple has a lot of great culture, unfortunately, that's about it. Apple uses their name to pay you less than your worth, which is why I left. Although, their benefits are amazing."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,The company is great easy work just come to work and do your job. It is easy to move up as long as your stats are good. I only want to leave for more opportunity for my major.
good,"Leads at that place are horrible, blame mistakes on the operators when they mess up, time management is horrible, the environment overall was just so negative."
good,"Apple in general is a great company if you are an engineer, working for HR or some other upper management  dept. "
good,"Apple. Yes. It's real. You can work here and be part of the greatest company in the world. Apple has extraordinarily high standards. If you make the grade, you get to keep your job. If you perform above expectations; you can maybe advance within the company — though once you do, you must continue to perform even better to keep your job. Unfortunately, I had to leave for personal reasons, but do not regret it one bit. Apple is still the best of class, but the privilege of working there alone was not enough reason for me to stay."
good,I was a contractor I alwaysI felt I didn't have full privilege as a full time employee.  Good projects were given to full time employees rather than contractors. As a contractors I was left with projects and tasks that other didn't want.  There was definitely favoritism towards to certain individuals over others. Even with that said...my take away is somewhat positive. Manager and team didn't provide some internal training. Pay rate was good and we had free lunch a while.
good,"Overall the job was fine. However, I will say that the stress level is high and the experience of working for them can be good or bad depending on which team leader they put you with."
good,"Rate this company"
good,"If you're looking for leadership positions, this is not the place.  Go elsewhere, become a manager, then reapply.  Internals are not valued when mgr positions come available, which is rare."
good,Development project is very hectic where you are required to stay back or put in extra hours on weekends for completing the deadline and there is no overtime for that.
good,"Great products to work on, IT always around to help out."
good,"I haven't worked for Apple for over 4 years nevertheless I can't speak for other stores, but the store I was at towards the end was ran very poorly, with no advancement opportunities. After nearly working there for 6 years I was never given any opportunity to promote and grow with the company. They never valued my opinions or expertise more or less a cog in the drain. However I'm thankful for the time being their, especially at the beginning I learned a lot about myself and gained unique skills. It was fun being around brand new innovation and working hand in hand with customers. Apple is still an amazing brand, however they need to get back to what made them successful 10 years ago to better prepare them for the immediate future."
good,"Amazing place to work, great culture.  Challenging is an easy way to describe it, but not the only word for sure.  I love what the company has done for my confidence and self-worth."
good,"Sis security takes its job serious, a little too military like I am more of mellow guy and like to build a comfortable environment and show excellent customer service."
good,Working for this company was a learning and growing experience. Gained a lot of knowledge that can be applied to other jobs.Enjoyed working with the Apple product line as well. Still use most of the trouble shooting skills on my own and others products today.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Micro-managed, pushed to do tasks that aren't part of your job. No room to grow unless you play favorites with the managers. I exceeded their expectations but in return other people who played favorites were allowed the room to grow."
good,I've been working for Apple for more than 8 years and I am happy to be a part of the company. Everyday work appears to be repetitive but full of exciting twists. This company let me grow into a professional that can be an asset for any company I can be a part of in the future. Apple promotes a multicultural environment and does not let you feel that you are from a different race our country. The hardest part I find with my current job are the metrics you need to achieve but that can be flexible too and I had proven many times that I can deliver positive results. I enjoyed mostly the part that once the day is done is that you have that feeling of achievement that you  made another customers day by helping them resolve their issues.
good,"the workdays go by typically fast. consistent training. Apple management is determined and caring for their employees and generally do everything they can to see you advance, when first applying through the temp agency not so much. Volt is helpful too to get your foot in the door but the onsite reps do not care for their employees. Hardest part of the job is that you are through a temp agency at first which is pretty much a year long interview with very strict guidelines. the most enjoyable part is the variety of people you contact daily, and the extensive trainings."
good,I worked for a third party company that was contracted by Apple to do over the phone tech support for all iOS devices and iPads. The name of the company is called Concentrix. The call center had no was badly ran
good,"This job required being persist with very small clues, as well as taking your time to look at areas that may not come to the surface right away enjoyed the working environment, would love to work at apple again."
good,"It's not a difficult job, however, hard work does not pay off.  Everything is a personality contest.  If you rub one manager the wrong way, you will never get any opportunities for growth.  If you aren't their perfect little Apple boy/girl, forget about getting full time hours or changing roles."
good,Working with Apple was a great experience and it allowed me to learn different telecommunications skills with allowed to me to become more advanced
good,"Intelligent, hard-working employees, but very difficult to make ends meet, even for full-time employees. Company cares more about pet causes than its own people."
good,"Gute Chancen für Leute die keinen Abschluss besitzen, hier nochmal ihre Fähigkeiten zu zeigen."
good,Working at apple provides a lot of benefits as well as a good pay. But as a student they don't value your education. Managers would refuse to adjust schedules based on time for classes. I would do my homework during breaks due to how much time they required from me. As a part-time employee I worked 30-40 hours a week.
good,"Entered the call center, started with a low energy meeting, got to work, helped customers with tech issues. management was neglectful (outsourced call center to another company). Co-workers were highly qualified and great to work with. It was hard to keep enthusiastic with middle management not full invested with our success. The best part of the job was my co-workers..."
good,"job is ok for a start, long hours and not a lot of personal time but the pay is decent I suppose and you get used to it , it does get easy. However with policy changes and constant team switching its impossible almost to build a rapport with anyone or move up in mangement"
good,"I loved working for this company when I first started, and felt that I have so many opportunities to learn something new. The novelty of the company wore off, the management team is incapable of keeping a sufficient work flow. The company is becoming increasingly more corporate and does not hold the same values. The benefits are what keep me there, I feel every position, aside from mangement, are under paid."
good,"The work environment is good. It has work a lot, learn a lot kind of environment. There is always a shortage of resources and this kind of stresses the existing resources."
good,Apple is a great place to work. There are  great benefits and lots of  learning opportunities. Apple is a leader in the industry of technology and drives innovation.
good,"Apple is an amazing place to work, at first. You get excited because you're working for one of the biggest, most recognizable companies in the world, but it slowly changes. Managers become condescending, it gets tiring to see people working towards promotions while they hire externally, customers are crazy. After awhile it genuinely takes a toll on your mental and physical health. Don't forget, it is retail. Hours are long and inconvenient, and then HR has certain rules about availability and store demand that MUST be met (occasionally they bend them for individuals). Pay is decent but in order to see any type of improvement you have to be around for awhile (I once met a guy, it took him 7 years to become a genius and finally make more than $20/hr). One thing that doesn't change, regardless of the location are your colleagues. Apple has perfected the group of people they hire and you always have this mini family."
good,"good food at cafe and great co workers that led to a fun work environment.  great monthly beer activities lot of free beer, free beer. and lots of free beer"
good,"I was employed by TNT on site in Apple, it was over 15 years ago, but it was a young workforce. Very mixed bunch of people. Good parking and canteen. Varied work, got busy at product launches."
good,"Salário Baixo, horários flexíveis e boas condições dentro do trabalho"
good,"There have been little to no opportunities for advancement at the 2 companies that I have worked for. Pretty steady work, but I would like to get paid more for the efforts I put forth."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Answered 30 calls a day assisting customer iOS support. Worked with company systems, such as Live Support and diligently complete all assigned tasks, working overtime as needed. Responsible for handling customer account inquiries, accurately providing information to ensure a resolution of product/service complaints and customer satisfaction. Exceptional communication skills and telephone Service."
good,"A typical day at GC is productive.  I have learned a lot about the world of Apple products and the company.  The hardest but most fun thing about the job was having to play multiple roles such as Apple Retail Support, Sales, Customer Service and Business Support.  Everyday, there was always something new to learn about."
good,"Management is good, with good work life balance. The process can get better. The days are busier whenever there is a big release."
good,"Great company, happy and fun to work with people. Lots of cool and interesting new things to learn but not much room for further growth in the company."
good,"Malheureusement pour une entreprise comme Apple, il est impossible de s'y développer en tant qu'être humain et social. Si vous êtes loin de votre famille ou avez une santé fragile, peu importe, vous travaillerez jusqu'à l'incapacité totale."
good,"Responsible for organizing entire department and in particular, controlling it’s resources and utilizing it’s assets to achieve maximum efficiency. Overseeing the day-to-day management of the Operation and HR related issues.Logistics Management, Customer satisfaction and escalation, developing personal growth opportunities."
good,Good pay. Good benefits. Crazy hours. It's not about the people. Very cut throat. Very stressful. It really depends on what your personal priorities are but you will have to choose family or work. If you choose family you won't survive in this company. They pay you well and they have excellent benefits and perks.
good,"Great co-workers, poor onsite managers. Work was tedious and repetitive."
good,"Tech support sucks. It's an unending task. The ""support"" provided by your team is superficial and patronizing. A waste of time."
good,I have mixed feelings about working for Apple. I love the people that work for Apple but did not like the culture of what Apple enforced. Compared to Google and Twitter they were a lot more strict on their culture at work. Aside from that they did not offer free meals unlike Google or Twitter which did not make any sense since they had more money than them put together.
good,"Seems like the subcontracting agency keeps changing on a regular bases which leaves room to become unstable.   If you are looking for something long term, I suggest that you keep looking."
good,the typical work day is working in a assembly line working on the Iphone 6 and repair the phone and assembl and disassembl the phone
good,"-work with customers at Genius bar"
good,"Very repetitive. Not enough training or breaks for the traffic coming in. Can become mentally exhausted quickly."
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible for overseeing my teams as they progress on various advertising campaigns. I check in and help them with any issues they may be having such as upgrades and new lines. I keep in touch with clients, update them on our progress and make sure they are satisfied with the promotional materials."
good,"it was a good steady job, with good pay. and a different experience each and every day you would show up. no room for advancement"
good,"not enough hours, being over worked. im a team player,but i wasnt called out for accomplishments, which made me question the company"
good,"Great Benefits and team. The  people you work with on a day to day basis are talented and amazing. The vision of this business is blurry."
good,Apple was an interesting job as I got to work with new products and learn about the apple system. A usual day consisted of me handling a ton of phone calls to help customers through the issues they'd run into.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"we had a good team, but the work was boring. I had to wait for the clients, if they will look for something or they won't come inside the shop etc."
good,Apple Corporate is a fair and fine place to work. Apple Retail should be thought of as a separate company that has all the downsides of other Retail Giants..
good,"Apple prides itself on being different. That used to apply to their call centers, but not anymore. It used to be a place where agents stayed for 5+ years, and experience was valued. Now, agents are being burned out with a staggering workload and the talented people are  jumping ship. There is also no room for advancement, especially if you work from home. I can count the number of agents I know who have moved on to new roles on one hand, and every one was a lateral move with a pay cut and worse hours. "
good,It isn't bad nor good. The job experience is just par. It can be stressful at times but mostly pretty calm. Customer interactions can be annoying but if your coworkers are good then it is manageable. It is a dangerous job in the sense that it is easy to fall into the complacency trap. It feels like a great culture but you can easily forget to keep developing and striving for greatness.
good,"The perks are great like the shuttle service and extra days off during the holidays, employee discounts on products and stock purchase plan. Great co-workers."
good,"A typical day is anything but typical. No day is the same and there is not a day where you don't learn something, help someone, solve a problem and do something different than the day before."
good,answer phones all day. stay at your desk. not allowed to do anything besides answer calls. very nice coworkers. easy ppl to get along with. learned about mac computers and iPhones
good,Fair place to work but it's basically retail. The hours aren't very good either and there isn't any direction to go.  It's hard to move around once your in Apple Retail.
good,"From the outside Apple is by far the most admired company globally. Truthfully from a corporate perspective I can agree with that. The benefits and offerings that I have received are not matched anywhere else at the retail level."
good,How to interact with a customer of all technology levels.   We have a great supporting team that encourages one another to do well.
good,"Apple is a ok place to work , simple , and easy "
good,"bonne experience"
good,A great place to work - smart people but watch for burn out - relentless activity but a lot of fun and smart people around you.
good,"The co-workers/people you work with are often the best part.  Apple typically hires good people that are enjoyable to work with.  The problem is often management and expectations from the company itself.  Typically they want people who accept everything, question nothing, and think Apple is the greatest thing ever.  If you speak your mind, typically you won't go far because you're seen as someone that will cause trouble.  "
good,While working at home everything is timed down to the millisecond and it starts to feel like your trapped in your own house day in and day out
good,They are good if you want to work from home. Watch out for the fact that they will ding your attendance if you have downtime even if its caused by their systems and this does happen a lot. Also watch out as some managers do not follow by policy and do not pay your for 1/2 of your downtime like they are supposed to. Overall pay and benefits and swag are good. You'll usually get gifts from them about every month to two months.
good,"A typical day would be fast , fun and plenty of production line. I enjoyed most, production line because it gave me a feeling of satisfaction because it was the finishing touch. Co-workers where great and funny. Management like to see you always put your best foot forward."
good,"Customer traffic in Apple Stores can be massive. Often many times that of a Best Buy, but in a space 10x smaller. Employees are responsible for sales, loss prevention, customer service, light technical support, and stocking/floor preparation."
good,Every day you work with amazingly intelligent people. The hardest part of the job was seeing contract manufacturers that are treated poorly just because Apple can.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Working for Apple, you will be very well compensated and you'll earn every cent of it. The 40 hour work week does not exist there."
good,"Had a lot of fun working here, but was always ready to move on. Not much excitement working in what I did here. Learned alot about computers while working here."
good,Great job to have in college. You learn a lot of material that is very useful and this company is great to have on your resume.
good,"A great working opportunity that provided me with the important learnings of maintaining excellent customer relationships, and providing outstanding customer service. Apple was also a very diverse workplace which was great to see, as this reflected their product and company image."
good,Typical work day depends on job title. usually handling customers all day but you do not have to take work home with you. Lots of advancement opportunities.
good,"Most days were filled with constant work. I worked on disassembling and assembling various parts on all iPhone 5 models. Later, I learned  how to properly test all functions on the new iPhone 6 models and got qualified in performing those tests. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable for me. With six disassembly stations and seventeen assembly stations, it was difficult to not only learn the standard operating procedure for each independent station, but it was also an engaging challenge to be able to remember the procedures one by one and tie it into the next corresponding station."
good,"Good Experience. Very hectic. Good Staff. "
good,"Great place for techie people looking for a part time job. Watch your back, management keeps notes on all employess"
good,"Fast pace, stressful and demanding. It was a great job because of the people I worked with."
good,I have no work experience.I am a fresh graduate of mohammad ali jinnah university
good,"Remained articulate and effective while working under difficult tasks and temperaments Provided exceptional support to daily operations"
good,"Apple's a great place to work if you want to keep current with what's happening in the world of Technology. You'll be the first with hands on. You'll have the experience of working with people from all parts of the planet. You'll learn how people are using their technology to perform jobs you didn't even know exist."
good,"I was asked to come back, and I said ''No""."
good,"this would be a great place for apple lovers to work"
good,"Apple is a fun company to work for, however overtime it begins to feel as though you are undervalued. The workload increases and there is little that can be done to help level it out. There is a difficult time to work around the schedule simply because its retail."
good,good place to work and have fun and learn new things about apple computer
good,"Worked there for about a year, management could use some work."
good,"Working in Apple Retail is a double edged sword. You get to work with the coolest technology and the coolest people you will ever meet. However there is the downside of management. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"•	Performed visual, mechanical inspections and function tests, such as audio, video, powering on/off, burn in including multi-tasking running various software applications etc, manually and using automatic test equipment"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Apple when I first started nearly 3 years ago but since then the management has become sucker by the day. They micromanage and treat the sales team like children. "
good,"Het repareren van Apple laptops. Servers"
good,"This job taught me much about dealing with people, customers, and corporations. I enjoyed being around great technology and people who were willing to share their wealth of knowledge. Customers were generally rude and short, I think that working in a service industry builds character."
good,My typical day at work would be to help customers find the best product that will help and assist them in the most efficient way possible.
good,"Stressful, but redeeming. I already reviewed this company."
good,"Ich kümmere mich hauptsächlich um Training One to One, Workshops & Personal Projects für Unternehmen und Privatpersonen."
good,"I feel that the company did not train me well enough on the iPhone and gave use a none working phone to walk customer through trouble shooting or setting up phone."
good,Its a good place to help build your resume. and the people are nice to work with.
good,Productive and Fun workplace. Good learning experience with a friendly environment
good,"Data Entry/Warehouse Manufacturing "
good,"As a contractor i had a very specific job."
good,"Theres really not much to complain about when it comes to working for a company like Apple. They treat you very well and they make sure you're well taken care of. I used to really look forward to coming to work. The break room had two fridges, a microwave, a coffee machine, and a steamer (so that your uniform was never wrinkled.) Not to mention, the pay was fantastic. The only issue I had with this company was that their attendance policy is RIDICULOUS. The attendance policy is very Black & White. They do NOT accept doctor's notes. I was sick constantly during the holiday season and that left me in a tough situation. If you were even a minute late, it was the same penalty if you called out. I really hope that they change this attendance policy in the future. It's a very flawed system."
good,"If you are a big Apple fanatic, then you may like working at an Apple store. I found it to be just like any other retail store."
good,"Good company to work with, good benefits, but you need to be in good group as some groups are crazy, nothing is across the company,all rules. culture is based on the group"
good,"Throughout the years of serving my guests at various locations I have bettered my skills in customer service. If I cannot make my guest happy I will not give up, I have saved my guests money giving them the best services at an affordable price for their budget and them having exactly what they want. I create a trusting professional relationship with my guests. I have had so many compliments and very, very few complaints due to not being able to negotiate with that particular guest. With that being said at no point have I ever caused conflict within losing money from the previous businesses I have worked for. In  my thoughts I believe it is, make the business grow and maintain the business that is already there. I have an opened mind and always ready to learn new things in order to better myself,”we will never know every-thing but we can strive to know more than before”"
good,"es una empresa en donde a todos nos tenian  presionados por la cantidad de pedidos que hacian para ser mandados a otros lugares ciudades y  tiendas."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Very competitive workplace with a strive for the best customer service that a customer has received. Inbound calls helping and resolving customers issues. Very supportive peers and fun to be around. Management shows favoritism though which makes it hard to advance. No real hard part of the job and peers were the reason to go into work.
good,"Installation des systèmes d’exploitation Windows et des réseaux"
good,"Daily round on facility: looking for leakage, irregular noise and burning smell."
good,"management is ok. "
good,"I would say the best thing about working here was the people. Very fun work environment, serving customers in the same industry."
good,"Unfortunately when face with work/life balance Apple s not employee friendly.  However I was able to excel at Apple until the unfortunate death of founder , Steve Jobs.  The company took on a totally new direction and started outsource jobs, instead of hiring within. Which made work for Apple a very promising and enjoyable place to work. I truly miss working there and most of the Management Team was outstanding."
good,"Good Environment for working "
good,"Over my time in Retail, i have learned how to build a store from the dirt to the execution of its success.  The key to any business is knowing the team, knowing why they come to work everyday and tailoring their development to their passions and or needs to grow.  As long as you have a happy team with the right people in the right place the rest will always fall into place. "
good,"When the iPhone first released from Apple daily duties included helping customer with their iPhones or network related issues at first point of contact."
good,Ilearn to work as a scanner. My boss  is a good man .Co workers are nice and helping We always help each other.some times when new changes comes thatis little bit hard situationbut when we understand the situation that is our enjoyable condition.
good,"Apple is the most unique place I have worked in my career.    A typical day lasts from 8:30 to 6:30 with a few hours more at home. My co-workers and I kid that this is the first place we worked where we wished it was Monday versus Friday so we had more time to get things done.  Timelines are ultra short and there is little to no tolerance for mistakes.  Management gives their employees a long leash to do what they want as long as commitments are hit and constant improvement on processes and tasks happen.  The hardest part of the job is the ramp into your role, it typically takes longer than what I have experienced elsewhere but the expectation is to ramp in half the time.  If you find a manager that you have a good fit with than you should be fine.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great cross section of people.  All in all, a good experience but I have learned to know what I look for in my next role."
good,typical day is easy just talking on phones. just hope you dont get a angry customer. I learned proper phone techniques the management are cool. my co workers are the best. hardest part is angry customers but the most enjoyable is the customers as well
good,"This position came to me through a Temp Agency, my initial role was that of Customer Service handling issues w/ Apple products purchased by Spanish speaking customers. Soon after beginning the position, I was offered a chance to switch temp assignments to that of an in-bound sales position for the Mexico apple site. I was in charge of handling inbound customers, recommending products, and guaranteeing customer satisfaction w/ their products. Hardest part of the job was being organized in regards to all the customers contacting you via phone and web.  This opportunity taught me how to function in a normal office environment which i had not much experience in.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers and getting to know different types of individuals and characters, the hardest had to be meeting certain metrics regarding the conversational process through which we did sales. "
good,we are not allowed to talk about apple.it is A fun place to work at
good,"Customer recovery and retention;"
good,"As Apple grew up and became 'corporatized' its lost its appeal. Decent employer but doesn't have as much trust in their employees as competitors and this is demonstrated daily. Apple has the reputation as a sexy fun place to work, it once was, no longer. Having worked there for many, many years, resigned and returned, I've seen the change unfortunately."
good,Fun place with good work but it is a Korean company with a harsh work life culture.
good,"I spend my day helping customers with technical support to successfully operate thier iPhones, iPads, and iPods."
good,Very time consuming company yet worth while if you wish to expand more in this field
good,"Being a trainer and educator for the company allowed me to never leave work without an influecial story. Another advantage of being a trainer for Apple is the ability to build relationships with people, due to the return visits. These particular sessions lasts 90 minutes long. Teaching everything from how to build a spreadsheet for work related duties to creating a scrapbook for lost loved ones. If ever there is a time that I may not know the answers to set questions provided by our pupils, a member of my team is always feet away. Typically always at least two managers on the floor to service any additional assistance may be needed. I find it most difficult to be held responsible for not having some of the answers for some of our students while still encouraging to never strive for anything short of perfection."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,It was a fun and very enjoyable place to work. There were a lot of people that I met and are still really good friends with. The best part was being able to help people and feel good about myself. The hardest part was keeping order when new products came out and making sure every customer was where they needed to be.
good,Apple has great values and ethics. I believe the vision of the CEO and corporate team becomes diluted as the message pass from corporate to retail. At the store level there is much attention needed with what we call the smartest and brightest associates to work retail. Many are immature and as it is a call out leadership does not know how to focus efforts to hire more professional mature people. Accountability is a huge call out for leaders as well. With the poor mix in behaviors it makes the retail end miserable and stressful to work.
good,"Outstanding, goal oriented people all working for a common goal. The company, however, does not have much of a training program. So, all new hires are expected to already be experienced and ready to perform."
good,"This is a review for ACS, Inc, a call center for Apple Customer Service, Sales, and Technical Support. The work is easy, the training and resources to do the job are there as well. The benefits are really good. The pay is nothing special. The hours are flexible and easy to work. The management seems to be a little 'big headed' and opens the floor for your suggestions just because they have to. If you decide to work here just remember to keep all of your personal information and personal life to yourself, never sign a two week notice because they say the call volume is low, and simply do your job the right way and you'll be fine."
good,"I really liked working for this company, there is a diverse group of people that work there and a great atmosphere."
good,"An okay job, not much room for growth within the company. Cool for something to keep you on your feet and steady income.."
good,"I had such high hopes when applying to work for Apple Retail. And I thoroughly enjoyed my job, but management (at least the management at North Park) screwed that up for me and many others by picking favorites and not allowing individuals' work to speak for itself. I had stellar results as a salesperson and was made to look incompetent because I spoke up within Apple's Credo about the cleanliness of our store. Management pulled me into the office, wrote me up and said the next time I spoke up against them (apparently, they told people to go home without cleaning on occasions), it would be an issue for HR. Scared and intimidated, I signed the write up and didn't say anything about it. Later, my interview for full-time (yeah, I was the one person that had to interview for full time, while others were just given benefits) was moved to my single day off in about 9 full shifts on. I've appealed to AppleHR but I don't think they'll count me eligible for rehire, which is sad because I actually enjoyed the job. Management just ruined it for me."
good,The work was interesting and the culture of the company promoted team work and room for advancement. I worked at Apple for fifteen years and it was a the fastest fifteen years of work in my life
good,"Apple was very generous with their pay scale, but the job was only through a contractor for one year.  Once you're done with the contract you are released.  Plus they closed that location."
good,Apple was a great company but the location I was at specifically had a lot of inside drama. After I left there was even some employees separated from the company as a result.
good,"On a retail level, leadership makes or breaks your store morale. Accountability isn’t really a thing neither is development. My store has this really cool thing where if you’re good at your job, you get to do other people’s job. Managers are more concerned with what looks nice rather than what works efficiently. Our company is all about innovation but on a retail level, don’t expect much. Benefits are truly great for full-time employees. Apple as a company is very accommodating to life events. There are other stores in my market that are amazing but that’s mostly because of their leadership team. It’s a good, decent paying job but it’s emotionally and mentally draining to work there after five years."
good,was a good experience when first joined but management are so bad that when customers are angry its hard to find them. Working 10 hours a day away from loved ones is really hard.
good,"Depending on where you work and what you do it can be very exciting to work for Apple. Retail and Corporate are two different places, no one know what the other one is doing."
good,"Working at Apple definitely never gets boring. There’s new challenges every day which is a good thing. However, the work culture is very tight. Breaks would be scheduled and they are very strict In that perspective. The shift changes every three months and you’re mostly not off for Xmas as you’re not allowed to take holidays which I found hard to deal with."
good,"Manager seemed inexperienced, but well-meaning, so we got along OK,  On-boarding was minimal, leaving me in a sink-or-swim mode."
good,"It wouldn't be a bad place to work if management at the Maiden facility changed. The job itself is satisfying and can be challenging at times. The people you work with are kind and giving, but management is complacent and clueless. "
good,"che dire. periodi di prova non pagati, minime prospettive di crescita. o dai il 100% o niente."
good,The benefits at Apple are great! One of the reasons why I work there til this day. I believe APPLE is a great company but the turn over rate is ridiculous
good,"It was very fast paced. Handled different issues every day. Learned a variety of different skills and helped customers troubleshoot all Apple products."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Apple is a good company to work for.   Like most it has some policies and procedures that should be revised to make the workplace both more efficient and more enjoyable.
good,"Working at apple was a great experience, it's good for a first time job experience but the problem is that it's not a  permanent job and it's only contract for one year and then they're going to lay out the employee."
good,"Grand job, pay was good, working from home sucked. the benefits were very good. I have to keep writing this thing to get to one hundred and fifty characters which sucks"
good,"This was the easiest job I ever had but it was my first job, so I did not realize that fact. Most of my coworkers were cool people- A mix of kids starting their first job, like myself, and retired folk making extra scratch. Most of the staff sipped the koolaid on Apple as a brand, and that mentality gets old after a bit. Tech nerd/know-it-alls and kids who think they're going on to bigger, better things are often attracted to Apple Retail...so you've been warned. I left because I wanted full-time employment, and this store was fully staffed in that regard. Most of the time it was a revolving door of workers, so never assume anyone is essential."
good,I would inspect and give knowledge of iOS products and MacOS products to maximum customer experience. Hard part of job was having staff for everyone to be effective.
good,This was a standard telephone support position.  Apple provided all equipment and compensation for high-speed internet service.  The culture strives to partner with customers to resolve and improve products to meet customer needs.
good,Job is really la back; opportunity to grow within the company is available. A lot of employees so there is areas to learn everything. Hours are short for PT employees
good,"I liked the culture and atmosphere of Apple. BUT I was there for over a year and they kept telling me i would be full time soon. I waited over a year and they kept thinking of excuses on why i wasn't getting fulltime, as they consider full time a promotion which personally i did not agree with. I was top salesperson in a lot of areas but it wasn't really enough for them it seemed. You sell phones, accessories and services but there is never any compensation or reward for being the top person for any of it. Whether you sell a lot and are motivated, or just someone who does the bare minimum, you make the same amount of money on a flat hourly wage. They offer great benefits and discounts but that's about it."
good,When I first got there as a contractor they told us if we did not pass this certification then our contract will not continue. Also the software they used was not good.
good,The work routine was the same. The interactions with people was always really nice. The hours were more or less consistent. The management was really friendly and always encouraging. The workplace culture was extremely welcoming.
good,"You will be inspired, you will work with some of the most intelligent, dedicated, capable and driven people on the planet.  You will be inspired by some of the most amazing technology and products the world has ever known.  You will work for a company that will do whatever it takes to deliver.  You will have all of this at the expense of your personal freedoms.  Your life is 24/7 Apple.  You will expected to commit yourself wholly and unquestionably."
good,It's fine for those who don't mind being in customer service settings getting back to back phone calls with no breaks from the time you start until you finish. You get a few good customers but most are needy and entitled and will make you tired of this job real quick.
good,Apple was a community enviornment where staff and patients worked together to accomplish missions. staff were friendly and opened minded multiple work locations
good,my job there was ok they did a lot of promises. i wish i could have had more time there my office shut down. i was moving up and it was over. a lot of shut downs
good,Things have changed....things will always change.  It was inevitable with the ambiguity of day to day operations that many of us would be left behind.  Losing stock value everyday and customer base hopefully gets the company back on track.
good,"•	Prepared/ executed test suites, test cases for different features of the Maps Client across multiple platforms: iOS, CarPlay, WatchOS, MacOS."
good,"A typical day is to arrive early, make sure the store is clean, stocked and all demos are working. I learned how to influence sales associates to lead with and recommend Apple Products. I worked with people who I had no control over and tried to get them to do extra work by completing Training on their own online when they aren't getting paid for it. The Management at Apple varied. Some were great, others carried their millennium prejudices and treated you like an idiot because you didn't spend 80% of your time gaming. Agism is rampant. The public culture is different that the private Apple. "
good,"If you are looking for something temporary till your next career job, then this is the place for you. If you are looking for a career, be ready to fight for a good career path"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,I love the core value of Apple is very casual and fun place to work . But the lack of professionalism from coworkers and management really make it hard to deal Daily. They timing your appointment with customer after waiting 3 hrs you only have 15 minutes to provide the best solution and this end with an unsatisfied customer.
good,"It was decent pay for fairly easy work, the management wasn't all too great but the wages were worth the headache the apple management caused to the employees"
good,There is no place like the Apple store.  You meet all kinds of different people who all have an affinity for the Apple products.  There is certainly opportunity if you can get a full time position.  The part time position won't pay your bills but if you get full time you can live on it.
good,"When I first started, Steve Jobs was still alive and I felt privileged to be apart of the company."
good,Apple over the phone technical support was a fast paced teach as you go environment with little room to advance. I learned how to handle stressful situations with ease and comfort.
good,"Apple is evolving into more of your traditional retailer. I don't know that it's a bad thing, but the hours are long and customers are not as appreciative as they use to be. Leaders within the company at large aren't recognizing the hardships they are potentially creating at the store levels for both the internal and external customer by some of their policies changes or roll outs."
good,"To work with management its really hard task, the work pressure will be more and more. We have to take care about our timings many of the people work offshore, to manage offshore calls its  high task in different timings. They are not going pay anything extra for call times."
good,Apple is an outstanding and forwarding-thinking whose innovation has paved the way for awesome products to be introduced the public.  Apple is a proven global leader when it comes to providing an interesting way of communicating.  They are pacesetters.
good,"Apple is a good company with good benefits and regular hours.  Not much overtime is offered or required.  Pay was good, but getting a chef job by working your way up is nearly impossible.  Some people helped each other out, but others were backstabbers who were trying to get ahead by making others look bad - a mixture of people just like any company.   Managers were pretty remote and not good at feedback, but chefs were nice. Typical day included keeping station clean and stocked, and serving customers, along with slicing vegetables and other prep work.  Everything related to clocking hours and pay is online.  Time card needs to be filled out online every 2 weeks.  Home computer access is essential because computer stations at work are always busy."
good,"Grueling commute from Oakland, no free lunches, spread out. Overall job was fun/good, but seemed to be 24/7. Over-reliance on email. Proprietary products (bug tracker, Scrum board, etc)."
good,"The political bubbles were too much. It's nice to have worked at Apple, but the games people had to play to get things done was too much. I was happy to find another place to work."
good,"Clock in "
good,"The environment at Apple does not suit everyone. It is fast paced and fun and you learn valuable skills that are translatable to any industry, however, there are a lot of negatives that people do not see from the outside. The culture is great at times but it is fickle and does not provide much support when things aren't going well."
good,"I worked as a transcriptionist from home, so I could work whenever I wanted and wherever I wanted. I could balance between my life and job. The fun part was I could work freely, like I didn't need to dress up in order to work."
good,"Astonishing focus on silos even within functional business units.  Cross-team collaboration limited to the network of relationships that you develop yourself.  Unlimited supply of middle-management resources.  The company can afford extensive duplication of effort and never misses an opportunity to exercise that preference.  Apple's core capabilities are world-class consumer device design coupled with great supply chain management.  Yes, the supply chain management piece is outsourced."
good,"I always joke that Apple is like the church, they may be part of the same umbrella, but each location is drastically different. My first experience at an Apple Store was very difficult, fraught with scrutiny, unrealistic expectations, and gossip culture. My second store was much more close knit and friendly, but significantly less results driven"
good,It was good as a job but I felt no career advancement here. I wasn't paid nearly enough for the cost of living. The stock options are nice but the take out taxes because of them.
good,was a really cool experience wish i had more time to spend age that job but the opportunity for advancement too 40 hr work week wasn't very possible and the management was something else
good,"The job is so stressful, and the management are not fair with people. The discount they give to the employees was good. The money should have been 3K more at that time. I liked the fact that they have a health cover and the fact that they pay for the family of the employee when he dies during his employment."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Der er mange standard procedures når man arbejder hos Apple men det var en sjov oplevelse
good,"Apple use to be an amazing company to work for. Its a great place to star a career but the advancement opportunities are not really there. Apple is quick to spoon feed you development as a mean to move up and rarely does you hard work get recognized and often you are told you are not doing good enough in your current role. Apple needs to learn that their customers do need to take personal responsibility for most of their own issues as the majority of the support related calls are due to customer created issues. Scheduling is another thing. You either work in retail with those lousy hours or you bid for a 90 day shift that can turn your life upside down and cause you to eat up all of your vacation time to take time off for family events. As a tier 2 advisor you can expect to have new responsibilities added to your plate almost daily, including having to take calls on products you are not train in, without any additional pay."
good,"The workflow and communication at Apple is amazing. If there are things that need attention they will be discussed, whether it be by management or employees."
good,Very engaging work and you'll definitely learn a lot quickly.  The pay is also pretty competitive for the tech industry.  However the hours are long and meetings and calls are never ending.
good,"The only issue that i had with apple is never get sick, never have an issue with family or natural normal things that happen with your kids, your car, etc cause apple does not have a policy to cover you for those things and no way to recify them at all..."
good,"I loved working at Concentrix, I loved the job, it was interesting and rewarding, but it was only temporary."
good,"The people are brilliant, and the culture is very relationship focused.  Longterm employee development is completely absent.  Leadership is as it is at other companies.  Some leaders are incredible and inspiring.  Others it's not clear how they were selected.  Leadership supports leadership.  Individual contributors are isolated.  Pay is slightly behind competitive.  The paid time off is not competitive at all."
good,It depends on which team and who the manager is. Lots of opportunities to shine and do something unique. Filled with very smart people and most are very passionate about working for Apple.
good,"Their employees are their champions and their biggest fans, so do not approach with complaints or criticism. If you express your love openly and freely, you will be rewarded."
good,"Beaucoup de passion, différentes cultures, produits et standards de qualité inégalable.  Par contre, pas beaucoup de coaching et peu de possibilités d'évolution."
good,"I had a bad manager which wasn't open to me exploring new positions available, specifically a mobile technician instead of sales. The Manger was demoted to Specialist after I left the company as the other management seemed to have a similar perception as I. I would have loved to continue working at Apple but the opportunities to excel are so limited at the retail level."
good,"It's retail, so you will work weekends and holidays. Sometimes requesting time off or planning a schedule is rather difficult. Also, they do not promote from within the company. I was in top 10 sales for my region and it was nearly impossible to advance up the ladder. When I enquired about management I was actually told it would be easier for me to leave the company, become a manager somewhere else, and then come back to apply for an opening."
good,"Apple gives great benefits, the managers care, free lunches on holidays, health and education reimbursement to even part time employees. But stores are too busy and make a poor environment for the employee and customers. I wish Apple didn't feel the need to keep the exclusivity of its stores and would open up more stores to take off the stress of other stores. The genius bar is always running behind in appointments, and many days I feel like the only reason why we are not breaking fire Marshall code for the number of people that are packed into one store is because there are no doors to get into our store. No doors means no max capacity. That said the only negatives I can say about Apple is the fast paced work environment and the constant stress of being stretched too thin because there are so many people requiring service of us. If Apple would just open more stores it really could be one of the best places to work. Please open more stores!!!!!"
good,"Good place to work, but retail hours and inconsistent hours. There is also limited opportunities to move up. Management tends to micromanage, which causes tension."
good,"If you know the right people it's a great company to work for and will offer great career options.  However, if you make a bad first impression, there is no growth for you.  The position you enter the company with may not be the one for you, but if you don't excel at it, you will not be able to get anywhere else."
good,"As a Senior Technical Support Specialist for the past almost 3 years now, I can say without hesitation that Apple is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The benefits are a great perk and the pay is competitive. Apple is very inclusive and discrimination of any kind is not tolerated. Training provided by Apple when you join is some of the best I have ever seen. Great support from management for the most part. The downside is that advancement is not possible at this time and has not been for nearly a year or so."
good,"Great Culture, good benefits, great management. Those who love  feel a strong sense of loyalty to the company. The Campus in cup. is an amazing place."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Talking, restocking and dealing with costumers either over the phone or in person. "
good,"Apple is a company that always wanted change as it wanted to ensure innovation and creativity in workplace, hence work life balance is something person is less to have as beside operational requirements you have to deliver projects as well. Though I believe company would want to strive for it,the actions are still very minimal and not consistent. Benefits and salary are good based on Singapore's industry standard. As to job security, and advancement, it's a bit less for our team in terms of progression as there's always attrition so we can't be transfer to other team, stability with team process needs to achieve first before transfer can be done. Management is supportive but there's no organisational chart which is a bit unconventional hence line of escalation is quite difficult."
good,"Working for Apple is hard work but fun, can be a bit difficult when it comes to managers and targets (which you aren't told about till about 6 months in) but other than that its alright."
good,The managers micro manage the employees. The pay is great for a retail place but a lot of hours are expected for even part time workers.
good,"Although I can say that working from home was indeed a pleasure, this job requires a great deal of patience and knowledge to assist Apple customers with their products. Most issues can be resolved by having the customer perform steps online, or by having the customer go though some basic troubleshooting. However, keep in mind that the customer base for AppleCare is for anyone that may request support. I enjoyed helping customers, however management makes it extremely difficult to meet all of the metrics that we are judged on. If you take more than 30 minutes to assist a customer, you better have a good reason, or it hits you in efficiency. A customer did not give you a 10 on a survey? That's going to hit your over SAT rating. This may be why the turnover rate on this job is very high. IF you enjoy doing phone support at home, this may be for you. Beware of what is expected of you monthly!"
good,"change is different, for me it was easy, some people quite.most just didnt want to change because of old habits, it was fine for me"
good,I enjoyed all that I learned about the Apple computer software. The management use to let we work mostly during the week. Had a lot of weekends off. Only bad about the job is the sad pay.
good,"Interesting workplace with little communication from management, tasks are very ranging, making the days adventurous and engaging, hard to get overtime when tasks come in 15 minutes before end of day and informed it will be turning in roughly 5 hours. Co-workers are very interesting, with different views on how task can and should be completed considering no directions were given. makes for a most engaging encounter. Hardest part is never knowing what you are working on, you only get a piece of the puzzle, and extremely limited information. only informed when something is not done to managements liking. But the reward is being part of something larger, being the person who put personality and function to something that would of not been otherwise."
good,"Apple Retail offre incontestablement un cadre de travail et des moyens uniques, pour vivre une expérience exceptionnelle, ce qui a été mon cas."
good,"The people you work with and the challenges you face on a daily basis will provide satisfaction and personal growth.  It is a very self-driven developmental environment, don't expect your leaders to provide much development."
good,"The calls are nonstop, but most of them are easy.  I was on both the iOS and the CPU side. iOS is much easier and where most people start. CPU was more entertaining as it required more thinking to solve the issues, but was still pretty easy. "
good,"Placed, cancelled, edited, and/or provided information about orders for the customer calling in. Learned nothing after it became part of Best Buy. Management was fair and understanding. Coworkers easy to get along with. Blame by upset customers always went toward you no matter how hard you try to satisfy. Management tried to keep things enjoyable."
good,"Come ready to hit the ground running, as it is typically busy from emails the night before and continuing emails throughout the day. All in the midst of weekly meetings. Management catches up on a higher level on how projects are doing and address where there is attention needed. Work with coworkers to ensure the information on projects are spread throughout cross functional teams. Despite the rush and constant running around, once a product is put out in the market it is extremely highly rewarding."
good,I would receive calls from small businesses and consumers inquiring about apple products and I would pitch and sell them those products
good,I deliver 20-28 daily appointments providing hardware and software support across multiple devices. This role has taught me how to multi-task in a fast-paced  environment.
good,great for college kids looking to survive and make easy money. Hard place to enter unless your referred. The people you work with are pretty down to earth and friendly. But the retail environment gets old very quick.
good,"I have a fun day at work filled with lots of laughs mainly with the customers."
good,NO real complaints. Others have complained about check issues. No time sheets used.. That can cause issues. Pay could be better due to nature of the work.
good,"Most Apple Retail employees will agree that the best part of the job is the excellent people that they work with on a daily basis. But as it turns out, the management is not nearly as competent. If Apple retail promoted from within, not only would management be substantially improved, but employee retention would be greatly increased."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Apple hires very smart and outgoing people so its always a pleasure to meet others that work for the company. Great place for team building.Sometimes long hours during launches and meeting. Dealing with customers can be extremely tiring. You leave work mentally and physically exhausted but its rewarding to help others.
good,"it was fun to work there on a day to day basis, the sales specialist are a fun group to work with they are friendly, management and back of house are the areas you need to worry about. other than that good company"
good,"I was on production lane, so constantly under pressure to achieve my target."
good,"- Managed localization at AppleCare"
good,"I worked for Apple for 3 years just about. IT was a rollercoaster. The only thing that makes that job bearable is your fellow employees. Otherwise it is the fakest company and has changed drastically management wise over the last few years. "
good,"Inbound phone calls from AppleCare customers."
good,Job was fun and exciting. This was my first job; here I learned my customer service and sales skills. It was working in Apple Retail that I developed my passion for sales and technology.
good,"it was quite disagreeable to be in such a noisy warehouse and not be permitted to talk. The tasks are rather mundane, and no specifics about the warehouse are to be disclosed."
good,"The Flagship store for Apple Retail provided me with an incredible wealth of knowledge and constant learning opportunities. I encountered customers and coworkers from many different walks of life and all corners of the globe, which helped me to hone both my communication and teamwork skills. There is no such thing as a typical day at Apple. It is a constantly changing, always innovating, truly dynamic workplace and I am truly grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of their team for these past few years."
good,I loved the job and doing technical support but I was working from home and I like to work in an environment around people.
good,If you like the technical troubleshooting aspect this is a job that you would love. Overall it is an ok job the compensation could be better due to the amount of tasks that are asked of you at times though.
good,Apple struggles with B2B and BUsiness Development---too many changes and no leadership direction
good,While employed with Apple i have acquired many customer service skills and practices that i am also able to use in life. I have also gained and extreme amount of knowledge in a new field to me and the ability to utilize that when helping the customers day to day makes me feel like a valuable asset to the team. The managers check in with you and the team is great. the only hard part is that its only Part Time.
good,Learned a lot about the different products and how to interact with different individuals. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was no advancement opportunities.
good,I honestly loved working at Apple and maybe if I wanted I would go back to it. A great team awaits anyone who wishes to work at Apple. I learned technical skills and social skills. I also learned skills that would allow me to become a manager. The management team was ok. Different agendas sort of conflicted with one another and so not entirely on the same page. Also some managers were truly there to help you grow while others not so much. The hardest part of the job was maybe dealing with unexpected situations but that also made it the best. Thinking on your feet is certainly a challenge but totally worth it.
good,"I really enjoyed working at apple, although the hours are not guaranteed. I was working my butt off there, and performing the tasks of a manager. I lead a team and really worked hard for success every day. Even after exceeding the goals and having worked there 4 years, I did not move a single job title. To top it off I did all this as a part timer. There were quite a few managers there and while I may have been favored by by some of them, not all were in my favor when it came to any type of promotions. There are also a lot of competition when it comes to promotions, I was one of the veteran sales people and had been fully trained to assist as a technician, even in the business department too, generally anywhere they needed me they could place me. And at the end of the day not a single thing I did could move me in the business. The favorites always got the options first. One person moved around the store 6 times, and always to a higher paying full time position, and he was one of the most unsociable people you could deal with. He constantly filled the room with a very dry and uncomfortable air, but because he has a kid and was a favorite they basically let him move around. He and I are the same age, I may even be a little older than him, and I had a kid on the way. They still refused to promote me even to full time. Its a very fun atmosphere and people are great. But this is not a ""career"" decision. It would take half the effort for me to grow in another company in 1 year. Someone who works incredibly hard shouldn't be neglected just because someone else is more of a favorite."
good,"Working for Apple was an interesting experience. If you are wanting to work for a company that does telephone support and this is your first time, this job may not be right for you. Not only is the training challenging but the situations you encounter on a daily basis are even more challenging. 90% of the time that was spent on the phone was with customers that were upset about their product not functioning properly. Angry and frustrated customers come with every business but this company had far more angry and frustrated customers than happy customers. The goals that the company sets for you to reach are set very high. Advancing up in the business can take years. I will say that the co-workers made the experience a little more enjoyable but management really needed to improve its training classes. The training that I received was good but it didn't really prepare me for what I was going to face on the phone."
good,Great place to work. Compensation is beyond anything else in the retail world.
good,"Apple is a really good place to work if you have the drive they are looking for. Your doors will always be open. They try to have fun, and make you excited to be there. But it is very metrics driven and will have you competing against your friends."
good,"PROS "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Good entry level position for future GIS professionals. As a contractor this position does not offer a foot in the door or a way to climb as it is a year in contract. Limited job and learning development since the tasks are repetitive. Overall it is a good way to understand the industry and the workforce at an okay pay rate; hence the average rating.
good,A company that initially took care of its employees is turning into the retail machine and turn over is no longer a big deal. They do compensate decently for a retail job and the benefits are undeniably good
good,Typical day at work included working with a team and solving problems appointed from your managers. Relatively easy work if you are detail oriented and can problem solve.
good,I worked as a contractor for Apple via Apex Systems Inc. During my time on the Apple campus I was part of a small team designated for a new GIS coding project. Our team had plenty of autonomy for creative decision making and consensus building. I was impressed by the amount of trust Apples executives placed in our team.
good,"It became very stressful from being thrown into production with very little training i loved working from home "
good,"Apple's infrastructure group is broken down according to the applications supported.  As Infrastructure PM you have control of certain aspects of the project; working through schedules based on data center availability, freeze schedules and constrained resources made scheduling a difficult task; the PM could move the project along but the PM needed to stay focused on the activities and time table."
good,Demanding work environment with many resources but sometimes struggle with  management support/time to utilizing the resources provided. More politics than I would prefer and feels more corporate than I'd like.
good,Apple is notorious for not giving their phone support employees opportunities to advance. If you are in the computer/application support side you can be an excellent advisor and still be a Tier 1 after 5 years
good,I wanna say I have worked here for 4 years and within 4 years I have only had 2 managers that was going above and beyond for me as an employee. But the job opportunity was something management lacked in.
good,"I love Apple and have been using their products since the iPod Shuffle came out. Even though I left my job with Apple, I still highly recommend their products because of the simplicity of them and the quality. I left mainly because my manager was not helpful and my schedule was never flexible even though they said they would accommodate me since I was a full time student."
good,"They have great Benifits, and great hours to work. It is very hard to grow your career. It’s is hard to make enough money to show a difference from lead cook to manager."
good,Great benefits but management could be tough to work with at times. This is mainly due to favoritism. Overall a great job to have to gain experience in the industry
good,"I’ve been a fan of working for Apple for so long, but recently I’ve been exposed to a darker side of apple that has become political, greedy, and is chalk full of favoritism. I’ve seen many talented specialists come and lose hope and be rejected all because they aren’t the favorite."
good,"People pride themselves working at Apple, but very few people were passionate about Apple, which shocked me. Most people who apply are looking to be a manager for progression so it is VERY competitive. Very political there, relationships can be more important than just working hard. Required to work holidays and minimum one weekend day (Saturday or Sunday). There is NO downtime. You are helping multiple customers at once. Customers are very entitled and pretty rude. You'll need a backbone and have to leave your pride at home. I miss the Steve Jobs/Ron Johnson days. They were progressive and cared about the customer experience. Tim Cook is all about profit and gone are the days of just helping people and doing the right thing, especially at the genius bar. I love helping people, training and I love Apple products/culture. Your co-workers and Apple execs will not share the same priorities/enthusiasm. If you are looking for a job that pays well with good benefits, don't care about weekends/holidays and don't mind difficult customers in a fast-paced environment, this job is for you."
good,"I would say that they don’t treat contractors insanely well, it’s very black and white between contractor and full time and it does feel like that sometimes. Culture was corporate and restrictive feeling."
good,"Fast paced and intense workspace."
good,"Apple culture made a typical day at work less stressful than expected. If you're able to enjoy a fast paced environment with multiple customers at once, its a pretty exciting job."
good,"Get there early or stay late if you want to do your email or the development journal they want you using.  You will rarely be given enough time to do it."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Was an At Home Advisor for over 2 years. "
good,"Apple, Inc. retail is a good starting place to break into the technology industry. There are many opportunities to explore new work positions within the company. However, I have discovered that if an individual wants to pursue career advancement with Apple, the individual would have to pursue working on a corporate level."
good,"Fantastic benefits, competitive pay, exhilarating place to work... At first. Burn out is inevitable. They either over leverage their top performers, or slow-cook their lowest performers until they leave. Either way, it's painful. If hired, enjoy the first 18 months, that's the honeymoon phase... It's all downhill after that."
good,The management has a lot of great training materials and I felt pretty confident when it was time to be on my own. The money was hit or miss and I did not think that we were always given the most popular sections equally.
good,I don't want to leave a review so I am typing one-hundred and fifty characters to meet the minimum requirement to move on from this section of the webpage
good,"The work life balance in Apple is pretty much non-existent. The stress levels are very high since there is never any room for error or any misses. The compensation is great, but it does not account for the stressful working environment and the pressure."
good,I learned about how seamless it is for each  product to talk to each other. I learned the capabilities of each device and what expectations should be of current devices and future devices. A typical day is about 20-25 appointments helping people with tech support.
good,"As someone in their 20's, I did not find Apple's culture to be the most appealing. I wanted to transition into another field but found it hard to take on other projects and grow as an individual since the company is very secretive. "
good,So training was no so good really didn't feel like I learned a lot trainer was super young once we got on the flor super nervous felt like I didn't know anything but our floor walkers helped a lot and once you got the hang of it it got way easier to solve people problems
good,Learned much about business to business selling and management in rural Bay of Plenty. It was time well spent for a definite time while my wife worked as a radiologist.
good,"Working for apple is a great experience. my issues aren't with the company, just the role specifically. Customer service is very demanding and hard to do anywhere."
good,"Apple has a great culture and environment to learn, and grow, for yourself and for customer. "
good,"Working for Apple as a retail Specialist is a stressful but fulfilling job so long as you value connecting with people and building relationships while you earn your paycheck.  The company has tides of ultra-corporate and a pseudo ""mom and pop"" feel, which can be frustrating to navigate without prior experience.  Definitely the most intellectual workplace I've been involved in, and I'd possibly return, however people quit their management, not the job, so the likelihood is low."
good,Typical work day at Apple personally was a great experience to connect with different customers on their needs for personal or business needs. Management always make improvements depending on the needs of the business each day. Biggest opportunity Apple has taught me is being confident each day when  working on the floor by approaching customers and be comfortable in customer issues.
good,"There was not enough time to train and get familiar with the new products before taking calls from Apple customers. We often had to multi-task to get the job done and help customers in at a rapid pace."
good,"Worked at an Apple store for almost 2 years. Wages of new hires with less experience are higher than what the raises give you which is extremely frustrating. When in meetings and talking about this, management always says ""we are working on it"". Essentially nothing is ever done about this."
good,"As T2 I take a lot of chats and take over a lot of chats from other Advisors. I have learned to support all Apple devices and there are a number of mandatory training courses that must be passed to continue. I work from home which is a plus, there is a stipend from Apple for Internet and Phone service. The hardest part of the job is providing support for unhappy users and getting your CSAT scores to a high level when most of the time dealing with users who are less than happy with situations with the Apple Store, Products, or other Advisors they have spoken with. The best part is paid time off and discounts for yourself, friends, and family."
good,"Great workplace. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,When I first started working at Apple Retail we weren’t treated like retail employees. We were treated fairly without the stress of playing politics or worrying about hitting numbers for management. This is no longer the case. They are pushing retail harder and harder and the culture has completely changed. The pay here used to be competitive but now other chains like Target AT&T and Verizon are quickly catching up and surpassing. However the benefits are excellent and the people you work with are wonderful.
good,"Nice work culture. "
good,It was fun working there I loved my coworkers. Linda who was my manager was okay. They did very extensive training. It took about a 3 weeks before I was on the floor.
good,"Apple is a great company to work for however some of the managers can be too ambitious and not focused on the big picture.   Although diversity in appearance is acceptable, there is little acceptance for diversity in thought.  If you ever seen the movie ""Get Out"", it may be a reminder of the internal culture of Apple."
good,"Work life balance is maintained through hourly work up to senior management. Learn a lot about apple products, maybe not about life. Great stock options and benefits. Extremely limited room for growth."
good,"Good place to learn why and how apple succeeds in sales and product quality."
good,Being so long ago there is really no relevance to this review.  Many things have changed I can imagine.  The company is very big and I found I liked working independently in smaller companies where one has more control.
good,"As a Genius in Apple Retail, you're expected to do the work of 4 - 5 people. The job is really demanding but we cannot show how demanding it is to customers. We are expected to keep appointment times between 10-15 minutes while also getting business intros and having the customer sign up for free classes. We are expected to multi task, if we are with extremely difficult customers. We are given reviews on our net promoter scores and how the store did as a whole. The teams overs all performance or lack of performance can degrade your review even if you did an amazing job.  Trying to grow outside of the store and into corporate is almost impossible. Most of the time you will not hear back. We have tools to help us improve and grow in our current positions which can better help us achieve interviews in corporate but we are hardly given the time to use those tools as our day is filled with helping others. "
good,"Great organisation to work with "
good,"This job was alright, however there was no room for advancements and lunch was only 30 minutes unfortunately. Other than that some of the managers were really self-absorbed and did not know how to speak to people at most times."
good,"If you love talking on the phones and do not have a life, Apple is the place to work. I have worked for Apple for about 2 years and have not climbed the ladder even though I have over 8 years of customer service under my belt. This job is very competitive. You will only be given night shifts and no holidays off. The management care more about the customer surveys, even if you were friendly to the customers and resolved their issues."
good,"The reason to me why everyone goes for employment at Apple is because of the LUNCH and the fact that they cater 80% if the time, but MOST IMPORTANTLY the PAY RATE!"
good,"I love the job but didnt agree how my team was being manage. Chat support was busy all the time, and it was hard to meet the metrics goals. I got praises all the time from customer, co-workers and even managers; but always got look over for promotions. I was on special research groups where my manager presented the data as if it was his. The job was great, but i had myworse management experience there."
good,"Working at home was great. Not all the managers are terrible, but mine was, unfortunately. AMAZING benefits though. HR was great and VERY helpful to me personally."
good,"NA•	Handled high volume of inbound calls to support customer with device set up, usage, and repair"
good,It was a fun atmosphere to work in. We stayed busy which made the work day go by quickly. I enjoyed the management as well as the management. I will love to go back and work for this company if given the opportunity.
good,"Fun place to work, high volume of people and very busy days. I would recommend anyone thats looking for a decent part time job thats in school to work there."
good,"Work days were stressful, as a hostess i had way to many jobs such as room service to the hotel from the restaurant, take orders from the phone. Only one host to do five or more jobs while also having to cashier for both bakery and restaurant. Blames for other employees mistakes because your the only one at the front desk."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple is a great company to work for, They have excellent benefits, Full time hours, Vacation times, holiday pay and sick leave. sometime customers can be difficult."
good,Great place to work love the management but alot of judgmental workers. Not many minorities that i could see. But pay was great and i learned alot. this was a contract
good,This company has all the amenities that one could wish for and decent pay as well but the management tries to sacrifice customer satisfaction for numbers.
good,"The work environment was very intense, the culture is strong and a pleasure to afforded the opportunity to be included. The management team in IS&T Global Network and Compute Services is fair and very supportive. The day to day Network operations of approximately 500 Global Retail Stores was very demanding and required 24x365 day availability. This had a large impact on my home life, although it was stressful it was in most part manageable."
good,"A typical day  will be answering call, managing communication from different sources like mail, data base, groupe chat, meetings."
good,"Not the best employer. Great technology but horrible pay, compared to how much money is earned by the company, and there don't really invest like they should in their employees."
good,"This office had an amazing two story cafeteria with wonderful shifts. Recycling, compost in every break room. Free coffee and tea. I worked with a temporary placement agency, so I am sure there were more monetary benefits for Apple Badge employees."
good,Eine sehr gute Arbeitskultur. Es macht Spaß dort zu arbeiten. Das Management ist leider sehr oft unfähig in vielen Situationen und man muss sich daran gewöhnen nie Antworten zu erhalten oder das man an der Nase herumgeführt wird und man nachher versproche Zusagen doch nicht bekommt. Eigenständiges Arbeiten ist nur bedingt möglich.
good,"very nice company to work for."
good,"Apple is a great place if you are trying to develop your skills. It keeps you challenged every day, and you are constantly learning. Your peers have incredible personalities, and I have made many friends while working here. The days are long and the customers are sometimes difficult, but I enjoy getting to meet new people every day."
good,Company was pretty well but a couple of people had a god complex and believed they were better than everyone else. I think the company should do classes on customer service for those people.
good,"La mia giornata tipica non riguarda solo la vendita, ma anche l'assistenza al cliente e l'offrire la miglior esperienza e soluzione possibile. "
good,"You learn a lot about yourself while working here."
good,Empowered to make the right decisions for customers. A fun working environment. Offers great benefits and the company really help you with your personal growth.
good,"looking for a change due to personal reasons , preferred location is south / west (Bay area)/  . "
good,"Management was friendly, but unorganized and micromanaged."
good,"A typical day at work involves diagnosing in coming Macbooks, repairing them and sending them off to the test line/department; once it finishes test, it ships off to the customer. I repair at least 20 to 40 units per day. Best part about the work is the feeling you get once all the pieces to the puzzle fit together."
good,Coworkers are some of the most bright minded people I've met. Management culture differs store-to-store. Benefits are excellent.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Great place to meet aspiring people and great people the co workers that you meet are the best thing about the job. Work life balance is horrible.
good,"Apple's culture is much admired, but it is not for the faint of heart. Typical work days are very stressful with little or no autonomy. The schedule is rigorous and erratic with no predictability. Managers are, for the most part, invested in employee development. The hardest part of the job is combatting the crowds. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with amazing technology and very intelligent people."
good,Retail is difficult as it is. I honestly believe that we aren't given what we deserve as employees. And diversity to be bold & speak our minds is stiffed
good,"Apple is a Big dady in social media. every day around 25 million of conversations scatter around different social networks. but providing insights by considering the sample size of just 500 doesn't make sense. This is not a process related confidentiality that i can't discuss out of office. but, i would do this because i love to take challenge. when i do something which they have not done before! then i am on target."
good,Working at Apple was okay. It is such a large company that there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement. Not as much as you would find in a smaller company.
good,"The people you work with are pretty cool and management is nice, its just that the job is one of the most mind-numbing experiences known to man. It's repetitive and tedious with no visible ladder to climb (and it's contract work, so expect recruiter BS too). It's great if you're looking for a position that will hold you over until you get an actual career, but it's not a position you want to be stuck with, otherwise you'd loose your mind. Though, on the plus side, job security exists!"
good,"the job is easy the people and the lead is approachable "
good,Great corporate culture but getting seen in a giant pool is tough and new management is recruited from their managements own friend groups instead of it being merit based.
good,"work long hours, and they require too much open availability. It lacks a balance with your personal life. Its also hard to advance through out the company. They give you alot of false promises."
good,I can say enough about how much inspiration is around Apple. Everything we do is for the customer and that I can appreciate. However Apple is better for coming on the end of your career when you have 10 to 15 years of work experience. But if you have matured within the company than you might feel left out when it comes to vertical growth opportunities. It is easier to move up in the company coming externally then it is internally.
good,"Apple likes to make the working environment as positive and fun as possible. They succeed in that in many ways. "
good,"Good company with high name recognition and market value.  Actual experience varies with group/department.  Teams raising revenue and reputation rank higher respect, recognition, and compensation."
good,"If you like hard busy work, but working with great people for basically minimum wage. This is your place, your job includes dealing with psychos and idiot customers that you treat all the same regardless of how they treat you. Expect to have your schedule moved around until you find a manager position, which then is the top of the food chain. You can still get fired at will, and it happens often if you mess up a few times. If you work HARD you will survive, not thrive, survive..."
good,"With the right managers, hard work and determination, you can go anywhere with this company."
good,"This job genuinely tested you on a daily basis. Every situation was unique, required advanced problem solving skills, and involved a fair bit of effort to determine where the data stopped flowing. They just tended to underpay the staff and have some rather unintelligent individuals at the helm. When you are repeatedly providing recommendations on what the Director should do on this or that based on X... You realize that perhaps you are at the wrong position within the food chain. "
good,"no life balance"
good,"great company, lots of room to learn a lot of things to prepare you for the real world."
good,"The culture is a little too cultlike for me there, and everyone is very extroverted. It can be a little overwhelming sometimes."
good,"Great people to work with. Culture is friendly and they use the soft sale technique. Although, they definitely push certain products. You can move up to corporate and around if you're motivated, as well. I enjoyed my time here."
good,"As a primary fax/email and part time chat processor, it is not only important to know how to complete the customers request, but to also conduct them efficiently and accurately. I have the ability to stay on top of department process and procedure and apply exceptions when possible. As a individual contributor I set forth strong leadership qualities for my peers,which in return has fostered respect from the people that I work with. These qualities are demonstrated by positive and constructive contribution in Team Meetings, by reacting to change in a positive manner, by sharing best practices, and by serving as Go-To Person for those that they work with."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Great if you want to save and start a career but lack marketable skills.  They used to be better at this.  Training was more detailed and functional when I began, but became more sales oriented which was frustrating.  Great benefits.  Managers are generally caring but company through and through which is also frustrating."
good,Apple was a great company to work for. They expect you to work your best and give it 110%. They support their employers and train you to be the best you can be.
good,"Working with customers at Apple was pretty fantastic. However, the management and employees are so narcissistic and cliquey that it becomes difficult to really enjoy work if you're not part of the ""in"" crowd. Not being part of this crowd precludes you from advancing in the company, which is not okay. Also, working in a supervisory role made it extremely difficult to ever turn off your brain after work. I felt like I never truly clocked out in 3 years."
good,"I’ve worked in a few different areas of the store in the past five+ years of my employment there. While the company does a pretty fantastic job of taking care of its employees through benefits, it still isn’t enough to negate the negative affects of having to deal with a consistently crowded store full of anxious, angry and entitled customers. And unfortunately the positive stories are not enough to outweigh the -ones"
good,"Working at retail is just that - retail. Apple has exceptional benefits, but I would not weigh it against other retail places I have worked, since the politics are all the same."
good,The job description changed before training completed.  I resigned because I did not feel the training prepared me for taking the calls they required.
good,I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that doesn't like to sit down for long periods of time. i learned how to fix a iPhone and also whats inside one. to me the hardest part was to stay focused on sitting down because i like to move around
good,"Getting to learn the ropes was something that wasn't given enough time. The training was about 8 weeks but stuck too much on technical by the book learning that doesn't prepare you for the live environment. The biggest problem was how fast they throw you to the wolves with actual customers without seeing any of your trainers showing you how it was done. There was basically never any opportunity to shadow a senior employee, basically forced to learn on the job which sucks when customers can clearly pick up on that. Hours were pretty much restricted so the work-life balance wasn't there."
good,"We had team building activity every quarter and managers were quite friendly, however although I was hired in Accounting team, I didn't have to know much about it. I had to deal with system error every single day which I didn't expect when I was hired."
good,"The phones get very fun at some moments but the management isn’t too good they treat everyone like trash."
good,"Pros:"
good,Good place to work but not much scope to learn new technologies. Lot of manual work on repetitive works. Management is supportive. Need more team co-ordination
good,"Het werk bij Transcom begon leuk."
good,"An engaging workplace environment that thrives on shared knowledge and developing staff to an extent. Every day was a joy in terms of interacting with customers and the fantastic products and new and valuable experiences came to me each day. "
good,"Working at Apple can have the facade of development. It is a great company with great values, however you have to work the hustle to get you to the next step in your career. If you know what you want to accomplish, Apple is a great stepping stone to go out and make more money. You definitely develop life-long  connections and network."
good,"Working at Apple sure is fun, the people and culture of the company is amazing. Trying to balance your work with your life is pretty difficult to do when they expect you to put your job over everything else or you can say bye to your position. The positions are fun but I don't believe any job is more important than your family."
good,"Apple provided lockers for safety, break space and a friendly environment for employees. The work duties enhanced my General Labor experience. Foremost, my schedule was very convenient."
good,"A great place to grow"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Great part time job. Great benefits and they work with your schedule."
good,I worked from home.  I found basically everything about Apple to be reputable and straight forward.  However the pay scale was too low for me to cover my monthly bills.
good,"For the work that you are required to perform, many apple employees are very under paid. Management is so awesome, but sometimes the customers are very fierce. There is always a meeting in the opening of the store and closing. I was not fond of that. After I got off I just wanted to go home, but was not allowed to because there was always a meeting at closing time of the store even if every time was smooth with no problems."
good,"If you are passionate about Apple products and tech in general, this is the place for you! Growth and knowledge within the field is encouraged, and you get to talk tech all day!"
good,"Stand up position for hours"
good,"AppleCare At-Home is a great job while in college or in-between careers jobs. Advancement opportunities are few and far between. There is always opportunity for lateral movement but you WILL NOT be paid any more. You'll just have more responsibilities."
good,"Working for Apple as a Genius is... stressful. The customers are more often than not already upset when they get to you and the pace doesn't always allow for good break in that."
good,"I love the job. I loved doing the job, but its extremely demanding. "
good,very nice work atmosphere. nice people to work around. Most of them keep to themselves. the building itself it very modern and the activities they have for their hard working employees are pretty cool
good,"Apple takes great care of it's employees. Because of that, I will always recommend it. The customers are horrible and treat you poorly. I left because it was too hard on my psyche."
good,"Apple invented Kool Aid!"
good,"I ran my own store inside of a reseller so I got to deal with Apple as well as Best buy.  Had a blast , had a great manager and co workers. We as a team got to do many things and go places that Apple paid for. They treat us all very well. I would absolutely work there again"
good,"Apple provides many benefits and challenges. Working from home is obviously a huge benefit for the most part as you avoid daily traffic and save money on gas. However, when you need help with a call, many times it is difficult to get internal support using the internal chat option. "
good,"If you like to sit down entire day and extremely busy you might like this job event if it good at your customer service job, their pace is so fast and lines are so busy.. the most enjoyable part your collages somehow they always find good and talented people even tho they don't last in the company..."
good,"As a manager and lead tech I was responsible in training people as well as repairing all variety of tech devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.). Any given day was a balance between completing repairs, managing employee activities, making sure numbers are being met while taking in, accessing, and repairing devices with various issues in an efficient and timely manner."
good,muy bien organizados para trabajar a distancia pero todo muy frio
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Buenos beneficial mutations amable todo du personal
good,learn new technology. see new products. management cool and works with you on learning new items. interesting group of coworkers but all very nice. good overall place.
good,Apple is a great Segway  to something much greater. To long at Apple retail you will start to resent it. Very stressful job but decent pay. Its retail so random shifts no continuity .
good,"I believe this is a great company to work for in a short term. It is also very difficult advance outside of the retail level.  As far as benefits is concerned, Apple does have one of the best benefits package you can receive in  retail and in a corporate level."
good,"Apple company is nice but so strict, salary also so less you are surviving. Job security is so so. Management is best part of this job. It is quite fair."
good,Short and sweet: Great compensation and great perks. However it is not necessarily the dream place it is always presented as. It is still a company with a bottom line and high demand. Keep this in mind when applying to work there.
good,"When I started with Apple back in 2005 it was an mazing place to work and they treated their retail employees very well!"
good,"it was nice working from home, the management was not what I thought it would be. But we worked together in the  end. I left because I was not happy taking 40-50 calls a day with no end in sight."
good,"Best part about working at Apple were my coworkers. Benefits were great. After a while, however, the culture changed dramatically. Management increasingly micromanaged and increasingly sought to remove the work life balance that was always so cherished."
good,"The training for this job role was great and most of staff are always really polite and supportive. The benefits are incredible too. Pension schemes, big discounts, health insurance/benefits and more. "
good,"I did not like the high chance of termination. The company had intelligent employees. The company doesn't prepare new hires with enough elbow room to advance. When systems would bind us, we were left to fend for ourselves."
good,great place to work. However if you are considering advancing in the retail work it's a lot of politics with management.
good,I am enjoy my work and this the best work place .apple products is very amazing things which everyone purchased it .mangment and ASM is superb.
good,"A typical day included maintaining the order and presentation of the sales floor, unloading and branding new shipment and assisting customers as needed . "
good,Signed non disclosure agreement and unsure what information I can post that is relevant yet will not conflict with the agreement.
good,"I would recommend Apple to anyone who is a fan of customer service and Apple itself. "
good,This place was a balance of organized and friendly with benefits and work structure. The management actually assisted when needed unlike other places I have worked at.
good,Good flexible company for someone looking to work at home. I would recommend working here if you are able to handle a high stress job.
good,I believe the emphasis on customer service and learning effective communication and self improvement is worth the price of admission.  The fact that the management has seldom gone through the same training that the staff has is a point of contention.  This fact will not bother you until you have been with the company long enough to see it though so do still apply.  It can be mentally taxing most days as it is a retail position.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"My current employer is Apple and my role is Family Room Specialist.  I work in tandem with the Genius Bar to troubleshoot iOS devices, (iPhones, IPads, IPods, Apple TV's and the forthcoming Apple Watch).  The Job is constantly changing due to the ever-evolving technology.  My goal is always to provide the best solution in the fastest way possible that leaves the customer happy with their experience at the store.  "
good,"Accountable for the sales of the AT&T Advertising Solutions portfolio of products (SEM, SEO, Online Display, Mobile Ads, Direct Mail, Banners, Websites, Mobile, Videos, etc) throughout, but not limited to, Middle Tennessee and Western Kentucky to SMB. Manage a direct budget of over 1,000 customers for >$10M annually and 10 Account Executives.   Responsible for achieving overall sales objectives, including revenue growth and net increase, product penetration,      productivity, advertiser growth, adjustments & complaints, customer satisfaction, turnover and training objectives"
good,"Fast paced strict working environment."
good,"Not a bad place to work, wouldn't work there again if I had the chance to, full of optimistic people, but too much stress on the job. Management is alright but goals are kinda unreachable especially at christmas."
good,"I have the privilege of working for one of the most valued companies in the world.  As an Apple retail employee, I represented the face of Apple.  This is one of the most sought after companies to work for and there is good reason:  Apple understands vision more than most."
good,"Apple Retail has a credo the whole company is supposed to go by, which can basically be summed to ""our people are our first priority."" For HR and management (at my specific location), however, policy is their first priority. The tension this creates causes perpetual anxiety to myself and coworkers who do value Apple's ideal culture of personal growth and development. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an unsympathetic leadership who will appeal to ""the needs of the business"" whenever an employee has a conflict."
good,"its the best ""retail"" place to work.  Fast paced, Your tired all the time.  Great benefits."
good,"Well-understood, coordinated work in a friendly team with strong discipline. "
good,Pays well for at home work. Supplies all equipment necessary to do the job. 
good,"Research, analytical and communication skills are imperative within this role. Working with a team of engineers and product analysts focused on improving current and upcoming Apple technology being released in UK. Extreme patience and understanding required as communication was between many different types of people."
good,"The people you work with are great!!!! The most creative, silly bunch you have ever seen everyone can do something else... play an instrument, photography, graphic designer, artist...."
good,"The environment is so fast-paced and constantly changing. This can be a great thing, but when things slow down, work is almost unbearable. Very little brain work is needed once you learn the ropes. The habitual cycles from day to day get old fast and there is little opportunity to do new things."
good,The Call Center location where I performed my duties for Apple was unique.  I was very impressed with the paid leave that was available when  it was needed.  The ongoing training was amazing and the goals set forth were reasonable to strive for and achieve.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and helping back to back customers. You hardly get a second to breathe. The people you work with are the best people ever. That’s my favorite part of the job and what makes me still stay. The worst part of the job is dealing with the entitlement of guests that walk into the store. The way you get disrespected, you must have thick skin. If you don’t, you’ll develop it over time, but there are moments where you may want to scream."
good,"The download is a meeting before the start of every shift. Managers use this time to prep you on how the store is doing, what is happening currently in apple culture, sales or initiatives, motivating speech to pump you up for the day. Most enjoyable part of it all is the customer experience!"
good,"Loved the opportunity and ability to grow with this company. Retail culture speaks the same as corporate but doesn’t practice. Management style is different based on the person, the company wants results, and I brought those. Massive rift between Flagship stores like San Francisco, and a mall location. Still an incredible job."
good,"Loved working for apple all my colleagues were great and i learnt a lot. However management were unapproachable in my opinion, i once say a customer making fun of a colleague and a manager talking to him laughing about it. Managers seem a little fake and i would not work there again, however all my colleagues were great!! And most customers were fun to help."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"They hired me part-time & kept me there for over 18 months despite cross trained in 3 departments. ""Hire, then dangle carrots in front to keep intrst"""
good,"This is a very good college job. The only con is that it is not flexible for college students. You must work 8 hours on the weekend, usually taking up your entire Saturday."
good,"I'll just say all that is pretty on the outside isn't always that lovely on the inside."
good,"During my long career at Apple I have learned continuously for years, I have improved my abilities such as; public speaking, evaluating, customer service and building rapport with your customers"
good,"Busy day after busy day, Apple was generous, the Outsourcing company was not."
good,Fast-paced environment that can be fun and upbeat. There is not a lot of time to collect yourself after a stressful customer interaction or if you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. Take a sip of water to stay hydrated and get yourself back on the sales floor.
good,"The company did give me the opportunity to grow as a professional individual and the first 4 years were one of the most magical and ambitions but with time and growth,  Apple began to hired externally. Great benefits and team placement."
good,Apple is truly an amazing company with benefits better than most companies. The culture and environment that apple works to create is nothing short of spectacular. The biggest downfall of apple is it is a huge company that often overlooks the people putting in the daily grind to keep its customers happy.
good,"Great energy with co workers. Customer service is always a struggle however. Not very giving with sick days, but they are great with coaching on how to deal with angry customers."
good,"A typical day at work can be stressful, but fun and challenging. I have learned a great deal of new information and experience in all areas such as Robotic Teleplan Machinery working with Apple Engineers, I worked on disassembling and assembling various parts on all iPhone 6&7 models. Later, I learned how to properly test all functions on both iPhone 6&7 models and got qualified in performing those tests.  The management was and has been fair to some extent.  I really enjoyed working at Apple Inc.  The most enjoyable job is meeting new people and making new memories there."
good,"If you didnt handle support the way the manager did, you were considered the bad one of the group. I always had great comments from customers and did support the way I was trained from apple. However since I never did it the way the manager wanted, he constantly harassed me and"
good,"Apple overall was a good experience, my main issue is that I feel like my team managers would not address my concerns as an employee properly.  It was very demanding even though you work from home."
good,"The company as a whole is great! Amazing benefits and amazing people to work with. Management could use some help though. Scheduling is unorganzied, getting advancement in the store depends on favoritism, and leaders rarely assist with transactions. I highly recommend Apple for a great place to grow, but not at this location. I have visited many other Apple Store locations that have willing managers who really want to help their people instead of standing in a corner and holding an IPad"
good,"It was fine just not flexible with my schedule, also not much room for getting higher up the corporate ladder or a wage raise. I would have loved to end up managing, but not possible."
good,"Would rather not say, overall good company"
good,"The work is challenging and the expectations are high. Calls are back to back. if you work from home, you'll feel alone against the customers. For an advanced technical advisor ""senior advisor"", theres not enough time to investigate ""odd"" cases. A lot of mean people call in, and you are pretty much the dump for rude ppl. "
good,"as Apple does not have physical presence in Greece, they used a subcontractor company (Teleperformance) for recruiting and training new hires. "
good,"Overall a good job to hold while being a college student. Flexible scheduling and understanding managers. Great money and benefits. Learned a lot about time management, problem solving, and communication."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"1. work on holidays"
good,"- You have to plan your own goals and achieve them"
good,If i got selected in this organisation.. would gave my 100% and prove my self to achieves the goals for me and ths organisation
good,"The brand is well established and over-all an admirable company. As a whole will try to reward employee's as much as possible and give them as much incentive stay loyal. Which will keep some employee's as ""lifers"". However the day-to-day culture of such a fast-growing company comes with a stigma of ""enrichment"" which actually may mean ""entitlement"". Lots of in office politics and not much loyalty to the individual employee themselves. Working side-by-side with other employee's was worth while. Those who stood above you make you feel just that."
good,"Travel between multiple retail locations, join multiple conference calls throughout the week, assist others in growing in their role and with the company."
good,"Job is more ideal for older people. The work can get excessive and stressful but it's a great opportunity to see how a corporation is ran and to get entry level experience in the world of accounting. There are some really smart management figures working here so it is a good place to come in and learn, it'll put you on a faster track for career growth. Stepping stone job for sure."
good,I was first promoted to management though AAG. They compensated me well and have been a fun company to work for. Their consistency with enforcing procedures could use some work.
good,Overall my time at Apple was good. I'm going to keep this very short but its a good place to work to have on your resume then move on from there.
good,"I had a struggle emotionally in Customer Relations, the calls where never not intense. Each day was draining, the customers would eat you alive while tying to provide the best result for them but with a smile you push through and make someone very happy and a promoter of Apple in the process. "
good,Great culture and fun environment when not getting berated by customers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers and management was not very supportive to back you up if you feel threatened.
good,"Fun Culture with its ups and downs. The work-life balance was not something that management cared about. But for a young adult starting his working career, I would recommend this job."
good,Can be isolating and over worked. Changes to procedure every couple months. Low work moral and exhaustion. Was great management and benefits. Great schedule
good,"The branch on which I was working it’s ok, the professional level varies on the location and your piers. "
good,"was there for 9 months contract. "
good,You just sat at a desk for your shift answering calls at home. Management pushed a happy attitude on you which would be expected especially over the phone communication. Hardest part of the job is obviously the customers.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,There was no work life balance could have days off for school. Management was there most of the time. Some days we would only have one manger on the floor while others were in the office.
good,keeps you working on a steady pace.always have at least 40 hours aaeak so that i can have the money to pay my bills ;as well as having a inside chance on being kept on as permanent employment. employee wear im working at what ever company.i have allways had consitent employment and team staff have allways be sure to place me in position that gave me a chance to show off my skills to employer or maybe permanent employment after completing asingment with apple one apple allways have found me employment not to far away from were i live so it wont be so hard for me to make it to work everyday.
good,"No comment yet,  because I'm still working in this company, I think it's not ethic to talk about your current employer. I think the most important thing is ""depends on what department you are in"", you can't say all bad or all good."
good,"Apple Techsupport has a lot of great things about it. Pay is decent and time off is decent, however career advancements are few and far between. Often people who know how to work the system pad their metrics appearing they can perform the job at an ideal level. However these employees are not passionate or knowledgeable enough to support some of the request we would receive."
good,"Stand up followed by development, weekly status report on Friday and will need to work with the design team to implement the requirements from the business."
good,"this company is amazing to work for. they provide benefits for all works, the companies culture is great and influential. Ive worked there 8 months...."
good,"Good job to work part-time. They pay well for a retail job and benefits are good. Depending in what store you work in, it gets very crazy. Typical customer service job. Customers are jerks, but you will get by. You get good discounts, don't think you will move so high in this store, but it is possible just takes time. Management isn't great, but again it is a good part-time job just because of the pay & benefits."
good,"Apple, like its products, are great to work for. I learned a great deal from not only my managers, but from working with our retail partners. Being able to cultivate an idea that could help my business was only held back by our partners willingness to ""innovate"". But growing within the program is very difficult! Although performance was recognized, it did very little to improve your stock. "
good,Apple was a great place to meet friends and great people. The training course is really in depth and thorough. Managers are fair and good people
good,"m working in apple ipkone since last 3 year "
good,"Apple is a great company to work for depending on the specific department. Typical work days in my department are high-stress, high demands while working in office. Stress is reduced when working from home due to a more comfortable, personal environment. I've learned an extensive amount of administrative work, including the understanding of handling all types of customers on a case-by-case basis. The management within the company differs but can be challenging and/or difficult to develop a healthy employee-manager relationship. Managers within my department often lack good communication and experience. They often take action to assist their favorites with advancement opportunities over employees with knowledge and experience. Managers also often lack in taking action against employee complaints related to system issues or other employee toxic relationships. Their micro-managing skills often conflict with employee and company needs."
good,"A typical day was just like any call center environment, except the fact my position was from home. I learned a lot about how Apple's iOS works and how simple it is to troubleshoot many problems. Management was nonexistent, if you needed help you were on your own. Thankfully there is team chat support, if they're available."
good,Working for apple was a dream come true. While working at apple I decided to go back to school. I worked with some many great people. The part of the job was teach guest how to use the devices.  I enjoyed putting smile on people face by just giving great customer support and service.  
good,"I liked it. You get paid every week, it was a good first job. I don't think I'll ever go back though because I want more in life but if it's your first job, you should def. apply to this warehouse."
good,"I was at a work from home position, everyone at Apple was very supportive. Training was good, and Apple itself is very interested in culture, and streamlining phone calls for their advisors to make things better, I had worked there for about 5 years, some of the procedures worked, some didn't. "
good,Overall ok environemnent to work in. A lot of learning opportunities from management if you are willing to participate and show enthusiam and interest.
good,"Pretty good workplace overall. Pay could be better. Work life balance depends on the schedule you receive. If you do your job well, you will not have to worry about that. Work culture is pretty decent."
good,"Nees to up their wages for home advisors , but the trainer was 5 star, loved working with my team, and I learned ALOT. Would of loved to stay with the company but my salary wasnt enough."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"good job but not right for me. There were a lot of benefits and my manager was fantastic with working with me and my school schedule. The atmosphere was good, but sometimes the job went on and on back to back with angry customers and that was hard for me, but some people love it."
good,Assisting customers with their iOS systems for technical issues. Training is the hardest part and passing exams. People are fun and lively
good,Here in apple..I earn good benefits..I receive every salary on time..taking very good benefit..good incentive schemes..nd uploading claims..everything is just awesome realted to salary..bt I need a good growth and more salary that I deserved.
good,"It's retail, and that's a niche market. Customer service, not a flexible work schedule, great co workers."
good,"It is a retail job, without a doubt. That comes with retail hours, retail expectations, and retail customers. However, it is worth saying that Apple retail is far from your regular retail experience. One I would gladly take up again."
good,even if you find your tempo the job can be a pain at times. You can do everything right and still get the short end of the stick. Its something that can be very hard to deal with but if you go ahead and find your way it could be worthwhile.
good,"I appreciated my time at Apple. It was an amazing job to work at while going to school. I grew in many ways and it taught me to think critically, to take ownership of my career, and to deal with any type of experience that would come my way. I would say, however, that I did not find advancing in the company easy nor, at times, welcomed. I felt there was an encouragement to grow, but stay in your lane at the same time. Having said that, the benefits and company culture was amazing and I loved my co-workers."
good,"used to be a wonderful resale company of Apple products, but no longer exists. Was able to get everything discounted and played with the latest apple tech before anyone else."
good,"I worked with apple as a technical advisor who assisted customers over the phone with their technical support. While working here, I realized that technical support is not the job for me & I do not like dealing with customers over the phone."
good,"For retail it has a corporate feel for it's people."
good,have been working here since college and has always been a good place to imrpove on my communication and sales skills
good,"I loved working for Apple! Everyone at Apple is very friendly and helpful. Apple is very goal oriented. The managers set goals that you must meet. I was a retail specialist, so I answered the phones for customers calling into the retail stores for like product information or inventory."
good,Among all the jobs I have held Apple has provided me viable skills that I have been able to transfer into my everyday as well as professional life. Apple provided ample opportunity for self growth as well as on the job training experiences.
good,That's an interesting job have ever done. And I developed  my computer kill & improved my communication. I also learned a great deal about handling customers.is was great have the chance to develop my talent.
good,I worked briefly as a product demonstrator at a local NEX. For just 20 hours a week demonstrating Apple products to the customers looking for computer and other high tech items.
good,"As with any company, there are positives and negatives. If you are lucky to have your dream job with a great manager and management, you are in heaven. However, there are too many layers of management who are worthless, and not enough workers. A lot of workers don't pull their own weight because they are not qualified for their jobs or too lazy. This makes getting the projects done more challenging than they need to be. Personality clashes, power struggles, the usual things as in any large company can be expected here."
good,"When i worked there you could never get the help you needed unless it was from QA. If you went and asked another manager, they'd stand there conversing with others and tell you they can't help."
good,"It’s a great job if you like the office life style, days can seem long and boring. Looking at a computer isn’t something I am into so sometimes it’s hard to come to work"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Empresa quando administrada pelo dono excelente para trabalhar.
good,Fun working with apple inc but after sometime management changes everything changes useless area mangers they dont know how to talk to staff no job security.
good,"I worked as a contractor at Apple fresh out of college which was really great for me to get professional experience in a field that is directly related to my degree. Overall it was a pleasant experience. Work conditions were fine; it's just normal office work really. The most difficult part of the job was meeting the expectations of project managers in California. They had a difficult time in the beginning communicating their expectations so we had a difficult time meeting them, but after several meetings this was rectified. "
good,"Great job, good environment overall but contract means no benefits or advancement. Otherwise a great place to work overall and would love to be full time."
good,"Its typical retail, don't let the videos fool you, its retail, as retail as it gets!!! No future, no growth, only the select few who have no goals grow, if you have potential they dont advance you, they will tell you to leave apple"
good,"I enjoyed talking to an expert about my posture and how my desk should be structured. The cafeteria had a lot of options. "
good,a great place to work as long as you do what you are required to do. No pressure from supervisors as long as you do your job right. supervisor and colleagues very cooperative .
good,"Nice place to work, everyone was friendly and helpful. There was no advancement in the call center, and its too bad the place was shut down after a few months."
good,"just assist customer on unlocking apple products"
good,Pays the bills but offers no advancement options or even trains you just in case there was.
good,"It was very fun, but if you ever expect to get ahead it may be a little troubling. Managers have their favorites and they are the first to get ahead. Also everyone is a little touchy and has an attitude at all times of the day. You get used to it but a bunch of cry babies."
good,"Apple was a large group of people coming together for a chance to help people evolve through technology, however the work environment and employee interaction were the largest negatives"
good,"Management isn't what expected, very unorganized. Applied for ADAAA and was misinformed and guided which led to being terminated. Overall good paying job but lots of stress due to lack of training."
good,dont want to put my thoughts Down has people need to decide for themselves if they get a position all i would say is do not tell anyone too much about yourself
good,"Apple retail is an amazing experience-- if you plan to just be there part time while you pursue your real passion. The fact that they provide insurance benefits to workers under 40 hours is outstanding. I happened to work full time, and was quickly over the store's cheeky culture and fake management who are super scripted. Advancement is difficult for advanced people..."
good,This would of been a great job if management was better equipped to be management also the pay rate and the sliding scale was horrible needed to be better at the rate
good,the job is not for you if you have children its not flexible if you would like knowledge on technology or are good with technology you would be a good fit
good,"Typical day there is badging in, going to your section within the warehouse your supposed to be in and simply sit at your station waiting for a device to come down the conveyor belt."
good,"its a job, its an ok tech job. as a contractor you have to be on work on time if you are late by 15 mins you have to email HR explaining why you where late. we had meeting at begging of the day telling us what the plan for that shift was. there is a hierarchy and most of the people where nice. the deadlines where hard deadlines and failure to meet them you where harshly dealt with. there is a constant feeling of micro management which is standard for any tech job. the facilities where ok and the environment was quite. as a contractor you are bottom of the food chain, but at times I did feel important to the project. the best part is probably the co workers, I made a lot of friends and encountered people I never would have on my own. I would do another job like this, but this time I would be a little bit more prepared to the sudden drop that happens to most contract works in california."
good,The benefits are great but with wages you are choke held to continue because its just enough to get you by but enough to make you hate that you work so hard to please unnappreciative customers and team.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Not much in the way of advancement opportunities. Everybody out for themselves and no possibility of promotion unless you are on the management's good list.
good,"work from home , chat with team and lead ,ask for help with customer issues learned about customer relations and apple technology. Fast learning keeping up with new things "
good,"Learned to break down large amounts of data using a systematic structure to identify locations, ensure validity, expand company reach and connect with customers of different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds across the world. Dynamic cowering space with over 20 different languages being spoken for average workflow."
good,I enjoyed working as a contractor at Apple. I would do it again if I had the chance to. Great management and great people to work with. Excellent teamwork.
good,"A typical day at work, set up station to start work.  Work with co-workers to get started quickly. Help train new team members and set them up at their work station."
good,Um bom ambiente de trabalho ! aprendi muita coisa consertando os famosos aparalhos apple e fiz grandes amizades.
good,"Friendly working environment"
good,"Working at Apple as a contractor. No paid time off and none of the benefits offered to Apple employees. I have worked in companies where in-house contractors are treated exactly the same as full-time employees, within the limits of the law and liability. Apple isn't one of them. Work atmosphere is casual but focused on getting the job done. I like the dress code - I've never gotten to wear shorts to work before."
good,"I was a POI analyst and map editor as a contractor. Contractors don't have the benefits of Apple employees. There's plenty of mentoring and follow up. However, the management can be better. Food is expensive, but delicious."
good,started in 2005- was very good place to work but gradually turned difficult over the years. less emphasis on technical knowledge and gradual disregard of staff health. resulted in physical problems with legs.
good,It has a lot of potential and there are some benefits if you can get your foot in the door.  There are good days that you can have during the busy season. and you can make a lot of money!
good,"Don’t believe the hype. It is a nice place. But they pay terribly. They don’t mind sinking thousands of dollars a day into making sure the stores look and function well, while the employees are starving."
good,"Overall, Apple is a decent temporary job. You come in and work the same task everyday for two weeks, you move over a station and then the same process. You are most likely to learn something new when it comes to a job/role/position switch within the workplace, which may be the ""hardest"" part of the job. Once you are trained by you're supervisor your everyday task will go smooth."
good,"My typical shift was 10 hours. I had the benefit of a standing desk but you are locked into your schedule. Your breaks, including bathroom breaks, are locked into a schedule. Meaning that if you have to go when you are not scheduled you will incur a penalty. I was fortunate to get a doctor's note for IBS, but others were not so fortunate. Customers use you for a sounding board for good and for worse. Your phone calls are recorded and listened to by your team so you need to be on top of what you say constantly. There was little room for promotion or incentive to show up daily and continue the daily grind. I developed an ear infection from the headset and was surrounded by techies that wanted to leave."
good,"- Asesoría en Ventas de teléfonos móviles, ipads, macbooks"
good,"I just stated that I worked part time, so I really do not know much about the company except that I noted it is a good place to work more especially for those who are lucky to have full time employment."
good,The problem is not time off. and always working including from home. other than that it was fun and good experience. very nice and smart people to work with.Doing your work is not enough it kind of you have to show that your doing the work too.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Yes, Apple company is amazing but not perfect as a work place for all people. Those who have a permanent job can earn money so much that running a normal life, yet for technicians it is nothing. I never recommend this kind of job to my friends just because of the low salary."
good,it was my first job in US. it was a pretty good experience and learned new skills. got a chance to work with different people at a same time.Good management team.
good,"Apple retail is a clique. If you're not in it, you get no reward for working there. The red tape and politics in this company is overwhelming. If you're up for the stress of it, then go for it. Team leads stand over your shoulder to listen to every word you say so they can come back to you and tell you what you said wrong - and occasionally what you said right.  Most of the co-workers, however, are amazing people. You can make some great friends working there. But Management is a different story. Many of them left Apple to work for Microsoft. Interesting."
good,"Awesome nice work space and crew"
good,"AppleCare Management often fails to communicate or sends out conflicting messages. The leadership style was very collaborative, but leadership effectiveness was poor. Area Managers and supervisors often communicated ineffectively and had poor knowledge of even basic personnel policy. Worklife balance can be poor at times, especially during product launches. You will write your own quarterly and annual review."
good,Zuviel gelaufen gehen arbeiten und stress schnell zeit..
good,Ready to better myself for me and my sons future .. got great talent . Can take onnl brutal shifts by myself . Which cooks these days it would take two to 3
good,"Good workplace and very good on giving days off  when needed."
good,"It's a work from home job which automatically draws a lot of people's attention, BUT if you have children or a spouse you have to help (like with transportation to their job), it does make things difficult.  It's  next to impossible to get a day shift position, and most employees start out in the evenings, working 2 to 11 - which is great if you have nothing else going on.  If the kids get home and are loud or need to be watched every minute of the day like mine, the job doesn't work.  If you have to clean the house or run a bunch of errands, it doesn't work.  You have zero time to balance your home life or even enjoy your days off working this schedule, and as much as I would have loved to continue, my home life was suffering"
good,"Apple is just like any other retailer: long hours with minimal pay. But everyone is very happy when they come into an Apple Store, which helps as an associate!"
good,"Customer Service Chat position.  I balance three chat at a time.  Each individual chat is about a technical issue with any  product.  There is a massive about of knowledge, training, and staying current involved in troubleshooting these issues.  Many are simple email issues but others are much more complex and time consuming tasks."
good,"I truly enjoyed most of my experiences on a daily basis working with my team, teaching them what I know and receiving their knowledge as well. The management for the first year was non existent which made daily activities difficult and I was not able to get full time or a raise due to this."
good,"I loved Apple and it always was a fun gig, especially during launch days and overnights, my co-workers will forever be good friends of mine, the hardest part was demanding people and supply and demand, other than that it was a high demand sales gig, that taught me skills I will keep forever."
good,"Refunds, respond to all customers request in regards to their product."
good,supervisors need to be more about there employees instead of themselves
good,"When you first start work for Apple they give you the hopes and dreams speech as I call it, everyone whom I know that started work for Apple have high hopes and expectations. Over time you realize its all a lie, extremely misguided management, overworked and many times not paid. The way you learn of new policies is by being written up first, don't speak up or out or you may end up on the unemployment line. Many times they have mandatory overtime, change schedules without notice, and have since outsourced scheduling to the philippines. I did enjoy the history and the culture and great people to work with but there is no future with Apple, every supervisor or manager is eventually replaced and the new ones will not even know your dedication and loyalty despite being screwed. "
good,"Map out the DFW documenting potential marketing partners, prime locations for corresponding demographic, and trendsetters companies. Interview, hire and train and staff based on client profile."
good,Great energy amongst co-workers.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"When i was hired i was promised promotion after first year, didnt get it.  Supervisor I had was not knowledgeable and caused turmoil the first few years so much so I had to take leave.  After several complaints they finally switched me to a tougher supervisor as punishment.  Benefits are great!  Discounts arent the best for such a lucrative company. Overall its a secure place to work like anywhere else."
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy interacting with people, very busy but rewarding. Benefits were great but work place environment can very depending on day and factors like co-workers and management. However, overall a great experience."
good,"Job is retail, so you will be working retail hours. This can be a great fit, or a terrible one depending on your current lifestyle. Pay is decent, benefits are insane, but work is robotic and constant."
good,I learned a lot during my time at Apple and worked with extraordinary individuals. The managers were all approachable and the culture was great. They value self-growth and giving back.
good,"Turn around of employees is extremely high despite what people may think.  Employees can jump other employees easily and it disrupts the environment frequently, some people get skipped and just quit.  It feels like being in a high school with lots of different cliques"
good,"Working for Apple Care is like working for any other call center. You will get the same types of calls and be responsible for the same types of metrics. The metrics that are focused on may shift, but ultimately, no matter the situation, the onus is on you."
good,"This place is great for someone building a resume, still in school, having another lane of income, or not having to pay rent. Career advancement is v politick. Really hard to get fired. Low pay for cost of living. Still a cool and unique job."
good,It’s a beautiful culture at Apple Retail but the development is slow and not exactly transparent as it should be. A lot more inclusion and diversity should be applied in regards to leadership positions.
good,Difficulty having two bosses to report to being Volt and Apple.  Metrics for performance were unusual and difficult to understand and achieve.  Great physical locations and equipment to do assigned tasks.  Great pace or work with accommodating breaks.  Offered good discounts on products and Volt offered competitive priced benefits to personally acquiring them.
good,"Managers receive little training, so politics and your individual manager play a huge role in your job satisfaction. If you have a good manager, it’s great. If you have a poor manager, you’ll want to leave."
good,"The workers are so unprofessional and spark different languages at the office. The leads are sometimes very partial and favor only people from their countries. "
good,Fun workplace. Contract role. Little chance of progression. Low pay and no increment. Good cafe for meals. Nice office. Good and chill environment. Multi national.
good,"Apple is a fun place to work. You're constantly challenged to make the best product possible. People are smart and passionate about what they're working on. At time, work-life suffers during major milestones but not unlike other top SW companies."
good,The projects were really interesting. If you perform well there are opportunities to transfer to new projects as they come up. This is exciting. The line between employee and contractors was pretty clear.
good,11 years at Apple allowed me to make some lifelong friends and advanced my career well. The work life balance is the main reason for me leaving. Working weekend and until 11PM is no longer for me.
good,"Working at apple is great at first, lots of benefits and coworkers are amazing. The downside is that the management is poor and varies widely depending on the store your at and there is little to no room for growth."
good,Ottima azienda ma gestita da manager locali. Quindi all’italiana.
good,"Overall, a very nice place to work.  Great compensation for a retail position.  Most apple stores are understaffed and / or under trained to handle the high traffic levels and needs of the customer.  The model for repairs needs to change.  My estimation is that 50 percent of in store managers are not customer focused enough to properly help the employees.  It can be a very stressful job due to the high traffic."
good,fast paced work environment  that struggles to meet the the personal needs of its employees. the needs of the retail environment usually are met at the expense off their employees
good,"Great work environment, co-workers are wonderful. In an environment that is so fast paced there are always things to do. Opportunities for learning and development can feel stagnant."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Cool Place to work at. Management was ok. Hired people from outside instead of hiring within. Great training programs. learned a lot about customer service on the retail side.
good,"i learned how to assemble an iphone and to know and analyze the problem .the workpleace is very bright and comfortable..the culture we respect each other opinions and open suggestions,the hardest part of the job is that you know how to handle the situations and explain everything about the parts of the phone when its being failed to test and there is no power...I enjoyed working here becase you  can meet a lot of different cultures who are working here."
good,They are a good company but the leadership in my store was poor I was in several locations and trust me they are all different  so good some poor but over all it was an experience I’m glad a took
good,"Apple is a great company to develop, learn, create and innovate. The management can be at times very micromanage. Overall you will have a more positive experience than a negative one."
good,"I took my talents and experience to Apple at a time when Apple was about to bust out with the iPhone and later with the iPad.  I had a good time overall and the food at the cafe was well prepared (LOL).  Overall, wish I could have gotten into the music business aspect of the company because that was where my love was at but felt that making that move would have been difficult due to having to relocate to Silicone Valley in order to attempt a change."
good,"A typical day at work doing iOS and Mac+ technical support was being on the phones the entire day with 15 or more customers throughout the day. When finished with one call, another would come in 10 seconds later. I learned much about iOS devices and Mac computers and became efficient with both. "
good,A typical worked day would be busy from the moment I clock in. The lunch rush is so busy its kinda hard to do the transition for the cashiers because of the long lines its a mess we don't officially get things done until the rush is done which is around 2.
good,"Great company to work for and I think everyone knows that. I had a really great time working here however, it was extremely stressful and full of customers that ""think"" they know everything. That made the day to to day really difficult. Also, the managment is always afraid to offend or do something wrong so they are a little harder then they should be on their employees. The company offers great benefits and perks but you give up a lot of yourself to be ""apart"" of something bigger."
good,Working here shaped me into the person I needed to be to face the world. learning more about self growth and being able to use those tools day in and day out was a great opportunity
good,"i learned how to get along with multiple different styles of management, since my manager seemed to change every month."
good,no real advancement in my desired trajectory. The culture is nice but not a match for me personally. Good for early career just out of college or early 20s
good,Fun and exciting environment to work in. Great colleagues with the same goals and ambitions which are to help customer’s find the best solution to their needs.
good,"the teammates i worked with here are some of the best people i've met in my life. passionate and creative i've remained friends with them even after leaving the company. i was at the genius bar which might as well be described as getting yelled at for 8 hours by management, by customers, by pretty much everyone. the benefits were amazing and the best i've ever had. very high stress and not a lot of chance for advancement. but overall it was a good experience."
good,Its hard to encompass everything I experienced with Apple. But I would say that they have the infrastructure for most anyone can thrive. Its a massive undertaking and well worth it at times.
good,I love working there but development and advancement is near impossible in a smaller location. Hire in at part time but will schedule full time hours if THEY need it but impossible to get if you want.
good,The job can be fun and stressful at the same time. Compensation is good but management support is soso. I learned a lot and had fun learning about the apple history and products.
good,"No day was ever typical, my time was focused on supporting our team in all their activities. This involved authoring and delivering training, managing the day to day activities of our 100+ person team. Often rapidly switching between customer facing activities to resolving deep technical issues. "
good,"I enjoy working from home, it gives me the flexibility to handle things around the house on my breaks and lunch. My management is always an email or phone call away and always willing to assist."
good,"productive environment and also motivating to get stats together. However, training can be a bit short and feels like it's ran through without much detail or explanations. It can be a hassle not having a team lead near you for direction since you are working from home. Also, redirecting customers to the correct department can be a headache as other advisors find ways not to take the call when"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Hostess were working as servers when short of staff "
good,"The pay is not what I expected, the pay looks like it will never increase . After 1year no better raise . I appreciate working here only if they can increase the pay"
good,"Very flat organization without much room for advancement. Your experience can vary greatly depending on your manager.  On the positive side, everyone is very smart, the work is compelling, and it’s an exciting environment. The pace can be frenetic at times, which can be both exciting and challenging."
good,"In the 9 years I was with the company the culture changed a lot. It became a place that was no longer fun or interesting to work at. "
good,Helping customers solve issues is very rewarding however working every weekend is draining. Hardest part of the job is not being able to sort some issues which can be distressing for customer
good,"Working here as a college student was great but it was hard managing a work-life balance. I would recommend it for the experience. Great discounts on products, moving in the company was very difficult."
good,"As an intern at a mall location I cannot give an accurate review of how working at Apple could be but I can say that my time there was interesting. It was more about learning what Apple and it's products do, not so much as working for the company but I was paid."
good,"Very similar to many other high tech companies in the valley.  Coworkers are strong technically and many are passionate in their trades.  However, work-life balance is mostly negative."
good,"Apple provided a lot of professional fundamentals for me. However, there is a glaring opportunity to better equip their workers with the resources to develop and progress within the organization."
good,the  calls would come in every five seconds.  You were graded on your calls and customer surveys.
good,Environment can be mixed depending on the the group that you support. Management can be difficult to deal with at times when expressing concerns. Hardest part of the job was the culture
good,"Tasks given are easy to do, pressure to meet minimum units per day is there, not enough compensation for what you do. No benefit if you work for the Volt Staffing, sometimes double standard to apply for permanent position compared to those hired already."
good,"Average work life balance"
good,Apple moves slow to convert contractors and at times inaccurately portray that they will convert and several months go by and no change other than more work load and no change to the status of contract conversion.  Feels like they use you and then release you.
good,Good overall good experience. Got to learn and work on many challenging tasks. Builds a good career level and carries a life time technical skill capability.
good,The toughest thing about a job at Apple is the politics and being savvy enough to navigate through situations politically. Other than that it was a good job with great benefits.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,They don't leave no room for error and if you go into the hospital for any reason they have you as a no-call no-show even if you call the first day but then call every day that you were in there they'll put you as a no hire which is kind of messed up if you have medical papers in medical problems like I did I went into pre-term labor so I was pretty easy especially through Vault through stormy
good,"Expectations were that everyone would work above and beyond at every moment including doing overtime with no hope of pay. Customers made or brake the working day depending on what they have been promised. If you want to work your butt off and focus on moving upwards in the company, then Apple retail is for you."
good,Apple is a very good work position. I want to advance more in my career so this is why I am looking for a different position. I want to be higher up and be able l further my career.
good,"Great Place, Great People, Lots of training, Lots of overtime available if u want to make some extra money. Have to go through a temp agency. They Have 1 year contracts."
good,"Generally Speaking, Apple is a successful IT company in the world, Under AppleCare management, should have a good relationship with your boss, i think morale is the driven for you to stay the company, so please think wisely before to apply."
good,"If you are running a store, expect calls at all hours. There is not a lot of opportunity for advancement above store leaders. They recently eliminated a lot of field positions and are extending the stretch of Market Leaders to have bigger territories."
good,"come in and get ready to take over work station,"
good,"I was being constantly harassed by an assistant manager, and when brought to HR attention, they did not investigate. The manager would consistently take me behind closed doors and berate me with vulgar language and question my character. She had a reputation for treating many people like this and had been reported to HR several times after I left the company."
good,"Apple is a great company to work with. The people you work with are very knowledgable on all things technology and you can learn a lot from each other. The information you gain while working for Apple can not be found at many other companies. The customer service, thinking and acting quickly, problem solving are a few of many things you will learn while working with Apple. Working at different locations can be eye opening of the different practices from location to location but one thing that is the same no matter what location is the friendliness and welcoming atmosphere. The management team varied where some locations management were very helpful and other locations management seems to stay in the back and didn't have a big presence on the floor. The hardest part of working at Apple is the number of customers in the store. There will almost always be more customers than employees so learning to multitask and help groups of people at once can be intimidating but most people quickly adapt to the busy environment."
good,"I liked working from home for Apple.  They provided all the necessary equipment.  There work from home position is completely work from home.  By this I mean: that your equipment is sent to you, training is done remotely in your own home.  You do need high speed internet as well as a phone line, VOIP is okay."
good,"Excellent company to work for, but the room for advancement is rather slim.  Even with getting customer satisfaction up and average call times down, myself and other coworkers weren't able to move into a different and more desirable job position which was really frustrating."
good,"When I provided my resignation management tried to keep me by giving me more money.  This made me feel that they did not value me when I was originally hired.  If they really valued me they would have initially given me the higher salary and not wait until I am quitting."
good,Working at Apple was prestigious. The hours were just way too long. My boss had bad management practices. He screamed at everyone. I ran into the person who replaced me. He quit after 6 months
good,"Great place to delve into the Fortune 500s and tech world. Super great people to meet and work with! We had free lunches every other week, free coffee/tea/cocoa, relaxed atmosphere while still being productive. Definitely fast-paced, but hard to keep abreast and included when not a ""full employee"" (as opposed to a contractor position), which is the biggest issue I noticed while there. Their cafeterias are top-notch and very healthy. They stay on top of supplies and usually don't hesitate to order what someone needs for hands-on jobs or office work. They usually approve lots of overtime as long as the job needs it and gets done. Stressful to maintain all of the safety and secrecy rules, and confusing when you have multiple managers (which happens with contractors a lot), but they usually give you lots of room to move around and learn everything you'd take interest in (if it's applicable to the main team/job you're on). Definitely an experience that will stick."
good,Very fast-paced sales environment especially during the holiday season. Management will invest in you if you invest in yourself. You own your own growth if you want it.
good,not the best company when you are worked to death even when 8 months pregnant and work long hours with no professionalism. Need better work culture in the company.
good,"Working at Apple as a contractor is somewhat stressful. Managers tend to assign projects that are a little ambiguous. The instructions for these are very open. For the most part, new contractors will start with nothing and have to learn the infrastructure of how the system works. There is no pay for holidays off. The possibility of being converted to  full time is very slim and many do not make it after their contract is up. Once a contract is up there is a three month break period before you can apply for another  contracting position."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for, but you can hit a ceiling very quickly without putting many years in. There is a very big grey area between retail and corporate."
good,The nature of contractor job at Apple is that you are extremely disposable. You either fit in the time and schedule they need you or you don't. There's no flexibility and work / life balance. Also very few opportunities for advancement.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"As i was working over there as Technical Support Engineer, over i was handling all the work of every deparment as being most educated persone after the manager n and my senior, rest were only labour in hardware department in Apple Authorized Service center , Customer comes n yiel alot n Lots of Politics is inovled in Manager n Company only giver 5% discount to employees once a year on there product to customer"
good,"I worked with some really great people, though that was not universally true.  There are really sharp people there, and people try very hard.  If you can work here, go for it."
good,"constantly running with many competing priorities"
good,"I learned that working from home required a lot of self motivation. The management team wasn't the best, but the pay was decent. The hardest part of the job was staying woke. They didn't really work with the desired hours."
good,Creo que es trabajo muy divertido y interesante pero tiene problema de organization y el salario es muy bajo.
good,"I learned more at this job than any other job on my resume. I learned almost daily how to become a better manager to all levels at Apple. The teams are very bright, intuitive and driven. You have to be highly adaptable and humble. Each one of us was hired for very specific skills, talents and character we brought to better Apple. You may have been ""the best"" in your previous company in certain areas/competancies..but suddenly you enter Apple and they challenge you in ways that you realize you have a lot to work on. It is a community/team where everyone inspires one another to do more..become better at their job...think differently. It is extremely diverse which creates so many opinions and questions - a reflection of what the world in a way is. I highly recommend Apple to anyone ready for the challenge."
good,"Job is great and very independent. The best thing is the benefits. They provide free public transportation, fitness reimbursement, employee stock plan benefits and pretty good health insurance"
good,"Become a usual day for me which reach to a point that my daily work and responsibilities has no trill and it doesn't challenge me anymore."
good,"Pay is decent, but there is no insurance or benefits and since it's work at home they want you to work overtime and weekends. You only get two bathroom breaks and they are scheduled."
good,Bon job - Bonne Ambiance -Tickets resto - Mutuelle - pas d'opportunité d'évolution
good,"I learned how to effectively manage people and production in an environment where policy, prodecures, and SOPs are constantly changing."
good,A lot to lean specially when you are young. You meet all types of people. You learn from them and move on! Company has room for improvement.
good,"It was pretty surreal working for Apple as I've always been a huge fan of their products and company. A typical day was pretty stressful as customers are very demanding, which was expected going into the position. I learned a lot about world-class retail. My co-workers had amazing personalities and were resilient. The hardest part of the job was the holiday season, but I loved the people I worked with and the benefit of getting to work from home for Apple as a chat support tech."
good,Hectic Environment to work . But gives a lot of opportunity to learn new technology and new areas of interests. Adopt to new technology and believes in quality of work.
good,Had fun working with customers on finding products they enjoyed for their Macs and iPhones. Working new releases was especially fun as you could always feel the excitement.
good,"-Apple has a good training program but once you put out on the floor they tell you they are there to help but not much help is given."
good,"My typical day of work is not your ordinary day.  Everyday is different when you are a nanny, watching small children.  I love children and have been working with them for the last 10 years.  I want a job where I can advance and use my brain."
good,"A typical day for me was waiting for the storm to hit. Creative direction changed many times a day for many days at a time, and the 3D rendering artists at the end of the chain would get the go ahead to start work with very little time to create high quality 3D renders. The payoff is seeing your hard work everywhere. Management is top-notch, and everyone puts in the long hours needed to create the content to Apple standards. The creative talent there is the best in the business, and everyone I worked with was really enjoyable to be around. You can't ask for more in your co-workers. My favorite part of contracting there was learning from the super talented artists that surrounded me."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Contrary to the low numerical review I gave, I really enjoyed Apple. I liked working around the clock and feeling like I was part of something."
good,"Typical retail, punch in and start helping customers.  I learned I'm not a sales person as this is a job where they judge you more on if you've sold the right percentages of things than if the customer left happy, which was probably the worse part about the job itself.  Coworkers tend to be awesome human beings and I miss them.  The training they give you is great as far as customer service goes is the best.  Management towards the end of my time there started changing and it was not for the better.  When I was terminated it felt like a bad breakup where I didn't know I was doing anything wrong and then was berated like a child for not knowing.  Extremely depressing."
good,A very fast paced environment with always something new to learn or do.
good,Mornings begin with each employee doing an assessment of the work load in varies area. Then as a team we would select our areas based on heaviest work load areas and based on each others strengths and familiarity. The supervisor would also do an assessment after 2 hours into the shift and reassign members as well as provide training to strengthen us in all areas we would eventually be able to work proficiently in all categories. As a team we supported each other by assisting  a teammates who may be unfamiliar territory or just needed clarification The hardest part of the job was some times trying to dissect the communication between front line and the customer due to incomplete statements. I enjoyed the constant change and learning new systems and process.
good,We worked as a great team.  Management was suppportive.  No real hard parts of the job.  Most enjoyable part was the people.
good,"Constant Stressful workdays."
good,Lots of talking and dealing with angry customers. But the people you work with have your back and are life time friends. 
good,"I appreciated my coworkers and the pay. But eventually, upper management began to treat us like second rate citizens. It gets tedious and there really isn't anywhere to ""advance"" per se."
good,"To say working in an Apple retail store is easy would be the greatest lie I've ever told. It is without a doubt a job that keeps you on your toes. More than anything I have learned to trust my judgement, maintain composure, and to stay up to date on the latest information. The most difficult part of my job was being hard my management. In such a large store ou can begin to feel just like cog in the wheel, that you have no individual identity. However my interactions with my coworkers helped keep me motivated and educated. My greatest pleasure in my position is being able to support my coworkers wether it be with a technical issue or with an internal issue in the store. I love supporting, training, and mentoring those around me."
good,"Das Arbeitsklima war sehr Angenehm obwohl von uns allem eine sehr hohe Leistung abverlangt wurde, sowohl beim Training/Seminare als auch bei der Arbeit."
good,"Easy work, just stay busy and you get paid. Work for one year then get laid off."
good,"Enjoyed working for Apple, but each year the metrics keep getting harder to meet. So if this did not happen than everything would have been great."
good,"There's always room for improvement. We need more diversity in management, and better community and compensation for the employees. The overall business model is great."
good,Everybody experience is different. Overall the work environment is good. For nyone willing to work in that fast paced environment needs to be patient.
good,"A typical day on the job starts with a spread sheet of a list of jobs to work on for that day. I make shore that I have the equipment to get the job done."
good,"Great place to work, The experience was very helpful for my IT passion. You get exposure to new apple device before they come out and as well as the operating systems."
good,There is a somewhat feel of favoritism that may give other employees an advantage when it comes to job retention this was recognizable early on in the work assignment.
good,Great company to work for. Take care of employees and are flexible. Different positions available to meet qualifications and interests of employees. Great training.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"It was a great place to work. My coworkers were the best in tech knowledge and were a pleasure to be around."
good,"Measuring against other retail cultures and businesses Apple is top notch but don't be fooled it's still retail with sporadic hours and shifts. "
good,"This work was conducted in hard hats and steel-toed boots. This data center was under construction and special rules and restrictions applied. Contractors vied for fulltime positions. Work was interesting, Apple has a unique system for rack & stack that is adhered to rigorously."
good,You come into the office in the morning and start working at your usual hour. It is very laid back and you can listen to music or a podcast as long as you get your work done!
good,"Apple is a very professional & friendly environment, I had a really good experience from the management team to other employees. It’s definitely a very comfortable environment/experience."
good,"This is an EXCELLENT retail job. Excellent benefits, and avg. pay. The downside is that all scheduling is handled by a ""system"". Translation: zero work-life balance. You'll love working there, which is great, because it's all you'll find yourself doing. Days, Night, and Weekends."
good,"Hard werken, geen targets, maar wel veel klanten dagelijks over de vloer."
good,"Great benefits, beautiful office building, updated gym, and an amazing cafeteria (though you do buy your own meals here).  You'll work hard here, and with a good manager, you'll be recognized for that."
good,"Good job but not many benefits being a contractor. Supervisors are great but have little interaction with their employees."
good,Hires great people but very rigid and surprisingly uncreative depending on the role. Expected to work long hours. Very different experience depending on the department and manager.
good,As an Apple technician the position was a busy position but also required you to be up to date on the latest products. I learned a lot about apple products everyday
good,It’s a great company for technological innovation to modern society. As a past employee it was both a school and a career loved every moment that I spent.
good,"Mi experiencia no fue directamente por Apple sino a traves de una ett para una campaña, a pesar de que la campaña fue corta estuvo muy bien."
good,"You will do you life's best work here. It's a great company to work for and extremely smart, motivated and driven employees. "
good,"The job is great as far as pay and benefits but I work 11 hr shifts,  they do not have 8 hr shifts . They do offer advancements but it’s at their discretion."
good,Second class citizens is how I'd sum it up. Not much direction from FTEs. Kinda like in Silicon Valley when they're on the bench at Hooli.... Likely was just the group I was in I'd hope
good,Good to wok. A typical day at work. I have learned. Work place culture. They hardest part of job the most enjoyable part of job. A typical day at work.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Looking ahead, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee will hold its regular meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis-point,"
good,"I had a difficult time believing that the last manager I had truly cared for their employees. Additionally, there was a continuous cycle of managers where it got to the point where I didn't know who my manager was for some time."
good,"Retail work is constantly busy, and rarely slow. There is always something new to learn about the various products they sell. "
good,"It was a fun experience, and provided a sense of family. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys serving other people, and craves for a sense of purpose."
good,"Great company if you are prepared to simply stay in your lane and do your job. Good perks in sales.  Good autonomy, Enterprise sales is still second rate but most of their money comes from retail anyway."
good,"Good as a stepping stone for development but they still have far to go in terms of internal progression. "
good,The Coworkers make the culture and drive the atmosphere. You can get burnt out rather quickly due to coworkers transferring leaving and lack of coverage that follows.
good,Paid very well. Work from home is a really nice perk. Holidays are mandatory. Benefits on day one. Nice discounts. Stock options are amazing take advantage of them.
good,Working with very talented designers made me a better designer. Made lifelong friends. Worked on some of the more interesting and impactful projects of my life.
good,It was a great job but exhausting at times. And you have to work weekends and holidays. I had to work on Christmas day one year. Excellent benefits though.
good,A really technology knowledge intake in every aspect of apple technology and it’s fun if you like technology. The information gathered is everlasting and the growth of technology is evitable.
good,"At Apple in LA they have some snacks. The coffee is okay. The coordination with facilities can prove to be difficult. I enjoyed eating lunch outside, but we had to bring our lunch as there was no cafe."
good,"Amazing people working there. "
good,"I learned may great competencies from Apple. In the moment feedback, accountability and customer focus, both internal and eternal. I was taught the importance of work life balance from them, though it is definitely difficult to maintain a proper balance while working for the company. They have high and sometimes questionable expectations."
good,U would grow as  a professional and learn the latest technologies here.Difficult to keep work & family life balance.But a good place to work and gives  good compensation
good,"I love the work I am doing but do not want to work from home most of the time, which ends up happening because my team is based in the US."
good,"Meetings, Design, Software development, Business requriement, Data Collection, Server installations"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"The environment at Apple is structured and scheduled. The people and other employees are kind, welcoming and professional, and the employers treat them with respect."
good,Since I was a temporary employee I did not get to participate in the events that full time employees did. It looked like they liked to bring the workforce together so that everyone felt included.
good,"I worked for Apple but was employed through a different company. I guess they outsource a lot of the call center positions. The company, (Xerox) at the time was a company with a horrible work culture and environment. It was like high school but worse."
good,"Apple has a unique way of showing their employees care. Apple goes above and beyond to help their employees have a fulfilling work and home life. Great management, motivating culture, and a knack for keeping its employees happy and content!"
good,"This position was incredibly difficult since we only dealt with angry customers. The benefits were good, pay was fine and the discounts  were plentiful."
good,I had a blast working for Apple. It helped me with how I worked with people and customers. The managers were great as well as the employees. They were always around to help.
good,"I've been involved in network design, documentation and implementation most of my career. Indeed, those three qualities were how the job roll was explained when I first accepted the offer from Apple. The first year felt right and I was challenged in all the right ways. I also had a sense that my work was providing value to Apple."
good,"Apple gave me the flexibility to work from home, and was very accommodating of my schedule (being a college student). There were many options for advancement and self improvement."
good,it's a very good company to work at with the benefits and the pay rate for a retail position you are pretty well off. open environment and very diverse.
good,Good Place to work as student as pick there own schedule. Good benefits for part time employee. Constant communication with customer oftern leds to frustrating shifts
good,"I enjoy working here, but wish we had more flexibility to allow better work/life balance. I like our benefits, such as health insurance and stock plan."
good,"I enjoyed my time at apple and would have stayed, the only con for me was the constant schedule change. Makes it hard for work/personal life balance.otherwise a great company."
good,Not what you think it is. A great company with great benefits. In store culture with the leadership team is poor and they don't really care for anyone.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Apple. Specially they did let me work at home since I had a long drive from my home to my work location. I learned a lot during my time at Apple.
good,"I loved my time as a Campus Rep, however the positions basically that of a brand ambassador; interact with the student body, faculty, and staff, repeat. I liked the position and the opportunities that it afforded me, but there was not a lot of opportunity for advancement save for learning about apple and applying to a separate position."
good,"Apple is a good place to work, it provides opportunities to improve yourself and become a better communicator. Days can be stressful, but overall it is a nice workplace."
good,"Enjoyed the people and fun place to work overall. As long as you do your job and learn and grow, things typically go smoothly. The management provided good feedback and helped you by providing tools necessary to grow.."
good,"A wonderful company to work for, great work culture and good leadership. "
good,"I would recommend working here if you’re new in the tech world, love technology and teaching people how to use their technology in a more unique personal level."
good,"Apple is everything that we know. A company that builds some of the best products on the planet. This drives their culture and as long as you fit and follow along, you will be happy. don't try to change Apple, learn to conform and you will be happy. Overall a great company."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple has excellent benefits and employees have a wealth of benefit-related resources available to them. Depending on the department, there can be a lot of opportunity for career advancement."
good,Customer focused and continuously striving for excellence.  Supportive team environment with an abundance of available resources to achieve both team and individual success.
good,The training was easy and the pay was good for what it was. atmoshphere was great co workers and trainign and mangement was great. I would have stayed if i did not have to move to california
good,All in all not a bad place to be. There is some need for smaller teams to grow the individual and prepare them for larger projects otherwise it is a fine company to work for.
good,"Provided both consumer and enterprise level support over the phone, onsite, and in store."
good,"I was always working fast non stop "
good,"This is an amazing company doing amazing things. The job is often misleading and you will be expected to go above and beyond as the norm. "
good,"Apple Inc. the company is an amazing to work for.  The retail stores on the other hand, are an awful place to work.  Some people love Apple and retail, but the schedules are so odd that it's hard to have a life outside of the retail store."
good,"I worked at Apple for nearly a decade as a senior manager. It's not a bad place to work and is good for the resume, but despite the think different facade they put up, they're just like any large corporation, with all the attendant problems. It's very easy to get pigeonholed and mobility between teams is not encouraged."
good,"A good place to work but you only get promoted if you know someone and not by your work. So, networking is a must at Apple! "
good,"As a person that is into technology, it was a great place to work and learn. When we provided the right computer solution for the customer it was a great feeling to enhance and enrich someone's life."
good,good not bad I did some hard work but no promotions second I got laid off of work it was a temporary job so I was looking for a permanent job or pretty decent pay job to
good,"- Recepción y emisión de llamadas para clientes potenciales del Online Store de Apple."
good,"Honor to work on this global company.  Mostly, I liked working there because of the culture, environment, and peaks.  But, management was very poor skilled."
good,"Apple definately has it's own culture... from training to day-to-day work life... they have a ""hive"" mind and cult speak which can come off endoctrinating and manipulative"
good,"Good place to work. Fun coworker, always a challenge. Lots of changes over the last 10 years, but still a good company. Just different now. Not in a bad way."
good,customer focused environment with heavy traffic in the store no matter the time of operations.  I've learned compassion and empathy along with going beyond what the customer expected. I love the people I work with it like a second family.
good,Not a bad place for a brief stint. The never-ending line of customers is a bit much at times.  Great benefits and you work with great people.  Small wins are what keeps you there.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple is an amazing company, but the management staff is untrustworthy and kiniving. Advancement is difficult for some, easy for others. There is a game to play and if you play it you will succeed. Stray from the course and punished doesn’t begin to explain the experience one will have. I love my job. I love what this company stands for. Not all of the retail stores I worked at are like this. It is a rare occurrence, but one I won’t soon forget."
good,"Great Job, but still only felt like a job. Although there is talk of career advancement, it only occurred on business needs and personal initiative. If personal initiative is high, it would still require waiting until business needs exist. This is only good  for those who have maybe lost that passion/drive/optimism considering job security and bad for those who actually have passions and aspirations."
good,"It was great experience to learn skills and working procedure."
good,Team Leads where way under the bar set for advisers. They were not required to take phone calls at all. It was a decent place to work at despite the distance to drive and lack of career advancement.
good,"Learn many new skills, great office moral, management was great. Training and location was exceptional. Many incentives for employee's that went above and beyond."
good,If what you are looking for is a good job with a minimum 25 hours to simply help you out while you finish school or look for a more full time job then Apple is a great job. But it has been a tough road to get promotion opportunities and the schedule is set a month ahead so often times work/life balance takes a hit. Management leaves a lot to be desired as at any given time I have 8 mangers to answer to and there is very little communication between management or from management.
good,"I really enjoyed my position with Apple Tech Support. "
good,Amazing benefits however management was not the best to work with. The coworkers were great team players and everyone was very willing to help. Great work place.
good,I worked there as a vendor for a year and a half in two different projects. For one project we had the option to commute with the shuttle for the other project the shuttle wasn't available for vendors.
good,Lots of benefits including private health care and exercise
good,"Everything about the system and materials to help with the job was great, however the contractor location i was working at (Atento) had a few issues as far as organization, and keeping us informed"
good,"Fast paced job , but overall I feel it provided good entry level experience in the business world. The job could be a little stressful at times, however the benefits were excellent."
good,"When I worked there, my duties were clear and I had plenty of help from my more experienced coworkers. If you know where their Coaches do pick ups, commuting's not a problem. Especially with Wi-Fi onboard. And nobody says no to free beer once a month."
good,"Decent place to work. Third-party company was poorly managed and ran. Small pay for the demands, but Apple as a client was overall very efficient and productive."
good,"When I came to Apple I had a lot to learn. The most important take away from me was, I learnt to step back and look at the big picture to design simple solutions for very complex problems."
good,"lenient work place, under good management. They work with employees and other staff members to try and keep the work place a fun, safe, and learning environment."
good,I greatly enjoyed working with the company. Preforming the role of customer service/sales was great because it is a product that people love and is easy to get behind!
good,"I absolutely loved this job, in all of my positions there.  The environment is one where you can absolutely thrive but best if you have no family or outside obligations as in extreme fairness, they will not work to accommodate you for fear of offending your peers."
good,I am still working here. Super fast paced environment and definitely a job where one must constantly stay in the know and always open to learn and grow.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Working at Apple retail is great for anyone who has exemplary customer service skills. However advancing my career at Apple was quite difficult with the over-saturated amount of talent at Apple.
good,"Good place to work.  Challenging and engaging tax positions and types of work.  G&A functions do not have as many perks as engineering and sales, but no complaints."
good,Apple is a great place to work that really focuses on you growing as a person rather than forcing you into a sales role. The focus on the customer and the complete solution builds a really great work environment.
good,"Career growth in Retail is limited after entry level management. Internal promotions have decreased drastically over the past three years. Experience is variable based on your regional (market leader) manager. "
good,Not going to review out of respect for the company culture. This place is amazing and can be awful. Every department is different and all people value secrecy.
good,Fast paced and extremely customer oriented. Can be stressful at times and rewarding at others. Must adapt to constant change between procedures and work environment.
good,Apple is a great company to work for. They are progressive and dynamic. This is a great place for people looking for a culture that cultivates greatness.
good,lacking in up to scratch communication between managers and employees
good,"Bonne expérience on apprend énormément, il y a une bonne ambiance, , sinon trop sympa en général, après le management reste un peu trop french encore"
good,"Deal with lots of customers."
good,"Decent pay, mostly cool, fun coworkers and customers.  Working at the Apple Store in the Eaton Centre was one of the most fun jobs I've worked.  "
good,"Overall, Apple was a great company to work for. At the time, however, management was subpar and the culture was loose. If given a chance to start again, I would consider it deeply."
good,"Expectations of the employees were often communicated too late, resulting in an environment where one constantly felt unsure of whether they were doing a good job."
good,"I was doing prototype work for Apple products. I feel that I learning more seen I get this job, I'm glad to support engineering, like rework , repair, building test systems and testing CPU and other Apple new products."
good,"Overall, work days were relaxed yet productive, with projects meeting deadlines on time without stressing out employees.  I learned new insights on corporate structures and working as part of a team of dedicated individuals."
good,"A typical day in Apple Retail is hectic as heck. Honestly, you get used to it after a while. It's actually really fun, if you have a great, close-knit team, like I did. The overall culture is relaxed and open, which is nice. The management team can sometime be non-existent, until it's time to harp on you for messing things up. There also seems to be a disconnect between management and corporate. Apple is known for its secrecy, and that sometimes makes things almost impossible to do or understand when handed down from corporate or management, because you don't really get any details, and are expected to sort them out on the fly. Also, things can get lost in translation, because leaders aren't always on the same page, either. I learned a LOT about who I am, what things I'm good at, and working with people. I also learned how to take criticism, customer anger, and questions like a champ, not internalizing them, and putting the energy into providing solutions and doing better work. The worst part is the idea of work/life balance. It is pretty much non-existent. I had several teammates have to choose between work and school by managers. If you're a technician, don't expect to have weekends free, nor a social life, because they are sacrificed to the Apple gods for you. Again, I've had multiple teammates who almost missed their children being born, and other events simply because they couldn't get someone to cover their shift or time off. Thank goodness for our teams willingness and flexibility with each other, because that has saved us more than once. If you have any other talents,"
good,Apple is filled with fun people and offers great benefits.  They will hire a whole team of full-time people off the streets instead of promoting from within.  That's why I left.
good,"The Apple store is a great place to work as a retail store. But it's just that- a retail store. Do NOT consider working at the Apple store if you have aspirations of transitioning a job in the store to Apple Corporate- that NEVER happens. Instead, go to school and get a software or hardware engineering degree and THEN apply to Apple Corporate."
good,"work life/home life was poor"
good,Apple is an amazing company to work for but the atmosphere is beyond exhausting. I became such an introvert after working here for almost 4 years. I wish it was more fair when it came to having weekends off without needing to request them.
good,Also don't show any kind of negative emotion ever. Seen people let go for short burst of frustration or anger over something very reasonable. Don't count on the job for a long term thing.
good,"Customers don't call tech support until they are very angry."
good,"I liked the people I worked with. A typical day at work was 8 hours. Although I liked my team, I felt we could have been more interactive. I would have loved it if there were snacks in the building."
good,"-Decent pay for retail/helpdesk support."
good,"apple is a great company to work for, providing great benefits and an open atmosphere that goes all the way to the top... even after working there you can be sure to have strong relationships that have formed"
good,"Apple is a great company to work for, however, over the last number of years things have really started to change in terms of management. It's more about the numbers vs the human experience these days."
good,"Be the best worker regardless of position"
good,"I love the multicultural diversity at Apple.  People who have terrific memories, work fast, are detail-oriented and good at building connections are most successful.  Everyone is responsible for finding their own way to achieve results."
good,"Having worked for Apple almost 10 years, I would say it was a fun and challenging place to work. I learned a lot, met some great life long friends, and gained invaluable IT and customer service experience."
good,Excelente oportunidad de desarrollo personal y profesional
good,"a typical day at work was receiving inbound calls from customers and having the joy to troubleshoot their products, chatting with them about what they needed, and doing research with customers to make sure their needs were met.  I learnt how to engage with customers to know where to go to help them or lead them in the right direction."
good,"As I'm sure most of you know, you are just a number on a page to these big companies until you reach for higher positions. Just a friendly word of advice!"
good,Working for apple has given me the experience to work with individuals from all over the world. I taught me that communication is a very important key to overcome any challenges that occur in the workplace and helps you build long term relationships with others. Managers in my department treated us with respect and were always there to assist us in any problems we encounter .
good,"Due to the confidential nature of my work, I can share very little. I will say, I'm privileged to work with the most creative and talented minds in the world. I support Apple as a company and believe in their products."
good,Enjoyed working with my customers and my fellow co workers. Management was very helpful willing for you to understand your task in knowing your job. The hardest part would be sometimes understanding there problem. Them explaining it clearly.
good,"Extremely faced paced learning environment. You will probably meet some of the best people you will ever meet at Apple. Amazing culture, pay is a little too low for It support."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"As long as you’re on time with making it to work & back on time from your breaks everything will be fine. It’s a very friendly work place, mangement is very good with helping with whatever is needed."
good,Applecare is one of the better paying work from home positions available at an entry level. I feel the promotional opportunities decreased once they began to outsource their tech support through other companies.
good,Working at Apple was ok. It had its its good and bad. I tried to transfer to other department and advance in company and every time there was an opportunity I got skipped over for someone who had worked their less but had same qualifications as me.
good,"I'm only a contractor working at Apple, and so far, the experience has been incredible for a recent college graduate, but the contractor vs employee experience is a bit discouraging at times. People come and go so often that building solid work relationships can be difficult. The work itself is interesting, and exciting for a twenty-something like me, but I can see how Apple's work culture is not as ""progressive"" as other Silicon Valley tech giants. It's still an incredible experience however."
good,"Great friendly coworkers and excellent benefits. Horrible work life balance. "
good,"Working from home was nice at first. over time it can become isolating with the amount of works you;ll be doing. Most managers are very helpful and accommodating, and building a support structure for yourself can be very helpful. Overall the work wasn't bad as call center/tech support work goes."
good,"As a Specialist, you’re highly skilled at uncovering customers’ needs, then following through with enlightening solutions. Not only are you the first person customers meet when they enter the store, but you’re also the person who guides them — advising, selling, and even setting up their new products. You perform other roles within the store too, whether it’s maintaining visual merchandising or assisting team members. Always curious, you stay on top of news about products and initiatives, ready to apply your learning in customer interactions. Your success is measured by team and individual productivity as well as overall store performance. You’re proud to represent Apple, and you get great satisfaction from helping customers develop lifelong relationships with Apple."
good,Si eres amante de la marca seguro te encantara trabajar en este lugar.
good,"A vibrant workplace with good learning opportunity. "
good,"Working at Apple is awesome due to the great products you get to help build. The culture is very focused on product and engineering. If you're in Finance or support roles, your experience won't be as great."
good,"Very engaging work."
good,"The job itself was not a bad job, simple and easy to do. there just wasn't a lot of room for growth as a contractor at least. Overall, it was a decent experience for me or someone trying to get into the field."
good,"Good work environment and lot of new technologies to learn."
good,Apple is an awesome company y to work for. You work along side quality talent from the four corners of the Earth. I personally have been a lifelong Apple user (I find the CPU/hardware just superior technically and ergo-wise) so this may seem biased but it it completely objective.
good,"Working in Apple is an experience I would never forget, it helped me to grow professionally and learned a lot of things that I believe I woud be able to use and apply in my day to day life and future job prospects."
good,Very professional in every way. Customers are treated with respect and care to provide the best care possible. Taking time to answer all questions and doing what is necessary to satisfy the problem.
good,"Great location, environment. Beer bashes and bbq's are organised from time to time. Open culture, multi-cultural and different nationalities and languages. Open door policy. If you need training just ask and they will provide. No pressure on employees even though I worked as a contractor, I felt like I was working for Apple. Job was repetitive and boring but calling on the phone and speaking with business owners in the designated market was fun. Great supervisors and trainer."
good,"buena relación con los compañeros un ambiente agradable,aveces jornadas largas fuera de tu horario normal no hay pago por horas extras obligatorias ,esquema de comisión cada vez mas dificil deja mucho a desear para los asesores ya que se pierde la motivación de vender ,no toman en cuenta tu experiencia ni tiempo en la empresa para crecimiento,no se puede descansar fines de semana ni mucho menos juntar tus vacaciones con dias que la empresa te deba o tus dias de descansos por ley ,descansas o tomas tus dias pendientes de acuerdo lo que los superiores opinen."
good,J'ai appris beaucoup de techniques commerciales afin de vendre au mieux certains produits
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"This company has a great set up for the temps working for them, typically a temp work is short term, but at Apple Computer the temps get a longer term positions and can work in other building onsite."
good,it started as good place then they started moving how the system worked with employees and became a little more stressful.............................
good,NYSDOH is a great place to work at for me. I'm able to work along side the client. We did traditional graphic design work. Focused alot on formatting data and producing power point presentations.
good,A typical day at work for my position required managing my own time while taking orders from my manager. Work was fair and instructions were clear and concise.
good,Lots to be done here and sometimes not enough people or time. At times managers do not stay on top of things and breaks  would get pushed back. For the most part everyone is upbeat and having a great time.
good,"I am responsible for overseeing my teams as they progress on various tasks"
good,"Doesn't matter how hard you work or how fast you are. you will be treated as another employee. so no competition. be on time, don't take personal devices to workplace or on the second time of bringing in personal devices (smartphone, headphones, etc...) you are done."
good,I liked the place and the group. I had the chance to work on new and disruptive technologies and travel a lot. It was a great experience and would repeat it.
good,"I liked working for Apple. I enjoyed all the benefits that they provide their corporate employees. From the discounts to the health care packages. However, the job was very stressful and I personally didn't this the benefits were worth all the stress."
good,i liked working with apple it was fast pace and having work to do all day made time fly by worked thru temp agency so it was only a one year contract but over all good company.
good,"Flexible schedule."
good,When I worked there salaries were terrible.   I  understand that has changed.   It is a fun place to work but it is retail and you will have crazy hours.
good,"This company has the most loyal fan-base, but not much loyalty to employees. It seems like a meat grinder but as long as you know that going in, you wont get your hopes dashed."
good,Apple provided me with an Abundance of experience in technical Support. I've learned things related to the position and IOS devices that will benefit me throughout life.
good,"Although i loved my job, getting injured from the job became a nightmare. Loved working at home for the most part, the changeing of the schedule every 6 months was ok but eventually during the end of the year it changes more frequently. and getting time off during ""holiday"" season is impossible due to poorly structured and written PTO management system."
good,It is indeed one of the great companies in the Silicon Valley and it's going to be there for a while. The work-life balance is not that good and people are not technically sound (at least in the team where I worked). You are mostly all on your own to deliver and very little help is provided by your so-called mentors.
good,"It's a great place for benefits and you'll work with so much talent. The company pushes career employees but for most people, they reach a ceiling within a few years. If you aren't top of the class, you'll be working retail for years."
good,A lot of work to do. Typical day will involved helping customers with their needs. Great culture and you get to meet amazing people. Managers are good.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"They work with China, They manufacture in china and India and depending on the furniture they have to make."
good,"I mean everything that forms part of employees’ involvement with the work itself, such as the relationship with co-workers and supervisors, organizational culture, room for personal development, etc."
good,"Fun, creative, empowering workplace. We get to assist internal and external customers, assisting them with problems and introducing them to new devices that can enrich their lives."
good,Excellent place to work as a retail establishment.  Consistantly supported to do the right thing.  Taking care of the customer is the top priority.  Many opportunities that can be had with the proper motivation.
good,Good place to work. Good work/life balance. Store politics play into promotions as with any job which is unfortunate. Great team with which to work. Thorough training process.
good,"management and store owners are good and working with apple is a good brand name."
good,They are always changing the goal you need to meet. but overall it's ok. I loooovvvveeeee my manager but the HR is not as great
good,"The people are great, but the demand of the job left little family time."
good,"Considering hiring more management positions from within. Not much opportunity for growth for employees, and management doesn't invest a lot in career opportunities for employees to learn new skills and new positions."
good,"People that speak English is always a nice start, with an issue that is challenging but not insulting that you actually have a resolution for is always a god conclusion."
good,"I love this company. Good place to learn and work, Gives more opportunities to grow professional. Projects are pipe lined and has a long life."
good,"At this time Apple is still one of the world's leading companies. Working there, you really do feel the global impact the company has because customers and employees come from every background imaginable. The benefits are great, even for part time employees. However, progression in the company is nearly impossible. There is a lot of favoritism by management and it is difficult to be noticed."
good,The management team is not great. There is no employee engagement or career development planning. For such a great company it's too bad they don't want to make the most of their people or keep them happy and engaged.
good,"Apple as a company is a great company to work for. They train and give competitive wages. The benefits are a real positive that the company offers. "
good,Help Apple to achieve sale’s objectives by illuminating the value and features of products in order to transform curious Apple store visitors into owners. Current member of the Visual Merchandising and Workshop teams responsible setting up marketing product displays to increase sales.
good,A typical day at work included handling escalation calls from Tier 1's and gaining agreement with customer's while maintaining a professional demeanor.  Day to day work at apple was stressful but fulfilling!
good,Excellent company to work for. Good learning and exposure to new technologies. Work Environment is very healthy and competitive. But too much politics which introduces gaps in functioning and synchronizing the overall goals.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Good place to work, salary is not competitive with the current bay area market tho. "
good,Fun place to work if your young and just looking to maintain spending money but very little room for advancement and career establishment.
good,"Management and the job culture is lacking, but the company is a great company to work for. The benefits are really nice, and once you are in with Apple, it is very easy to move and grow within the company"
good,"Apple hosts a workplace environment that keeps you excited to go into work. A place where you can be yourself in the way you provide customer service, and create loyal customers. They encourage a self growing environment, with very knowledgeable coworkers incase you have any questions. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the products and updates, since they are released so frequently, everything is always changing."
good,"A typical day at apple was very fast.Great training.Friendly people and good atmosphere to work in.Could have better hours,but still can make a sound living"
good,"You're kidding if you think I'm gonna have my name attached to anything I say about my company."
good,a bit stressful as less wage and no commission but job secure as management is understanding and supportive. work hard and you will be fine
good,"My typical day is anything but typical, I could see my self working with just iOS devices like iPhones, iPads and iPods troubleshooting them. Or the whole day just working on Macs and the issues that arise on those. It could also be a mixture of both as well as just supporting my fellow coworkers if they have any issues and to come in and help them. "
good,Apple is a great place to work. Lots of new things to learn and lots of possibilities to move forward. Each day is a challenge never knowing who is on the other line needing assistance. It makes me feel great when I can solve a customer's issue and hear the smile on their face over the phone.
good,"Had a real good time there was one of the best places I worked at. "
good,"The apple store is a nice retail place to work. They paid much better than average retail, and worked around my school schedule. Would reccommend to a college student."
good,"The job was fun when you were actually getting to do the job you are supposed to do. If you were a full time employee or one of the leaders of the store, you could be expected to do many different things, which you have to do to be promoted, but very often the work you do and the effort you put in to your job goes unrewarded. In my experience a carrot was dangled in front of my face for to long so eventually I left."
good,There are many good professors. Students are smart too. Beautiful campus and lot of nearby restaurants and bars. It is a good learning experience.
good,It has been 16 years since working there but it was a good place to work with friendly co-workers & learning experience.  Management was helpful & the hardest part of the job was keeping up to changing equipment.
good,"Apple has a great company culture and provides lots of opportunities to learn but the retail environment can be incredibly stressful and the schedule really strains your work/life balance. As the company has grown so have the politics and bureaucracy, which makes it hard to get promoted and establish a clear path for growth above the lower level roles."
good,Great place to work at. The people are great and the culture is very laid back. fast growth and development. A chance to be you.
good,"Simple, low-payed job, good for start though. "
good,"Xerox Apple was some what of a ""hire anybody"" type of environment. The actual working place was very professional and highly advanced with the latest Apple technology, however the certain employees/ managers were completely unprofessional. A lot of ""non business like"", for lack of better words, actions and lee ways took place. Overall i loved the experience because it was new and i loved learning about the product and being able to help customers resolve an issue with resources i learned to navigate."
good,The greatest thing about the position is I got the convenience and ease of working from home. Apple was very prompt and attentive to make sure that I had all of the equipment that I needed to do the job. A typical work day would consist of inbound calls that would assist customers with a wide array of troubleshooting and technical issues. Apple provided more than enough support so that there was no time that I was unable to properly assist my customers. The work environment was all virtual and we were able to keep in contact with our team members via computer. All in all it was a good opportunity for me.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"-earned useful skills"
good,"call center, always busy, and allows for a great opportunity to work for a large company. very knowledgeable in customer service because of this job."
good,"Apple is a great job for a retail environment. They have great on the job training, and great products and discounts. The benefits were second to none. However, the time commitment and scheduling sucked liked every other retail environment."
good,"Trained support staff and assignes staff to events throughout the campus."
good,Great shift work system...cww - Compact Working week...3 x 12 hour shifts...only downside is very rarely are permant contracts issued.
good,"Easy going work environment. Great pay and benefits. Very hard to get into. Lots of nepotism, career depends more on who you know than the work you do, (just like anywhere else, wished Apple was different)."
good,Great working environment. Managers were really great to get along with. Little opportunity for advancement and little pay. Work hard but not many incentives.
good,"to work!  I can honestly say I enjoy going to work every day, my team and audience are friendly and professional and we all like to have a good time which helps the hard work more palatable."
good,"Let you do your job at your own pace. Things are always changing, so keeping you on your toes. Co-workers are welcoming and friendly always willing to help when there's questions."
good,Apple Retail is still retail. There's no way around it. Each store is rife with petty politics and conflict as managers vie for their domain. It often internally loses the culture that Apple strives so hard to create.
good,"I enjoyed working at Apple in the Steve Jobs era. Since the passing of Steve, the company has started to go down a path I'm not that passionate about. I value my time spent at Apple and will take the great knowledge they gave me to whatever I do next. It's just time for a change."
good,"Good place to work for learning new GIS tools and analysis."
good,Apple is a great company to work for I am more then grateful for the opportunities Apple has presented to me but its time for me to spread my wings and fly.
good,"Great place to work but does not always follow through on promises. ""Work life balance"" is important to Apple in documentation but days are long and crowds are busy, so it always seemed the left hand didn't know what the right one was doing. Poor senior management in Canada in general."
good,"Typical day includes taking calls for your entire shift. You can make it hard or easy on yourself, depending on how you can talk to people. The best part is when you do get that chance to make someone's day and solve their problems. The ability to help someone understand their products better and giving them the control over that is such a great reward."
good,The Mac Store was a good company to work for. It's mostly sales and guest service. The co-workers were great. Everything was pretty solid really.
good,"While I was not terribly fond of many of the individuals in my department, the vast majority of people I met at Apple were very welcoming and energetic."
good,"Great team work, awesome staff, Customer service is crazy but we always help them so they can leave happy. Inventory is always on point and everyone will acknowledge your hard work to make you feel like you actually accomplish something."
good,Apple Retail has a enriching environment that encourages their staff to extend their knowledge and sharpen their interpersonal and organisation skills.
good,worked from home on the apple connect project for kelly services. apple is great but kelly services not so much but overall a positive experience.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Very challenging task can be in your plate any times and you have to come up with solution with in dead line. Lots project keeps you busy and constant change in work environment make worth while to go to work.
good,"Working as a Technical Support/Customer Service Officer at Apple was a rewarding and challenging job."
good,Ein typisches Einzelhandelsunternehmen welches auch seine Ziele verfolgt.
good,"A typical day at work would begin with my department coming together to set goals and expectations for the day. Afterwards we would assign tasks amongst each other as well discussing what is a priority and what can wait. The day goes on in completing these tasks which may consist of communication of changes in procedures, keeping the store up to visual standard, and assisting the sales team with products in our inventory. The most important thing I've learned at my time at apple is how to adapt to change very quickly in a short time frame. We have many new procedures, polices, products and events that come at short notice. An employee must be able to adapt and learn quickly so a consumer can receive great customer service in a timely manner. The hardest part of my job is when my team is low staffed for the day. It creates frustastion among my co-workers with the increase in workload, thus affecting me becasue of a low team morale. At apple you learn to cater to diversity very quickly, we have many different types of people with their own unique personalities. It has been a pleasure to meet so many exciting individuals from across the world."
good,"learned sap, fed ex labels, an tracking,  how to download test media onto electronic products, "
good,"-Very seasonal work, centered around new product introduction"
good,"I answered about 100 in-bound calls, I had a sales goal each day to achieve. I was the online store and sold hundred of products."
good,"Great Company. Great Co-workers, Chaotic Atmosphere. Management unreliable. Horrible work/life balance."
good,"Typical day as a Apple technical advisor is challenging and you don't really know exactly what to expect from customers. However i enjoyed that challenge each and everyday as it helped me gain more and more knowledge on not only the product but how to relate & deal with different type of customers at hand. The management was ""shifty"" seeing as how when i got employed, most of the old advisors moved up to supervisors so it was kind of new to them. I would have to say the hardest part about working at Apple is learning the information and having to implement it to the customers in such short notice. Data, info & updates changes almost everyday. Just for the simple fact in the same token you have to keep customers happy, remain professional at all times, and be efficient with the information your providing them. The most enjoyable part was the job environment and being able to learn Apples intriguing information and getting heads up on upcoming devices, software etc."
good,"As far as retail jobs are concerned, Apple is the best by far! Plenty of support for self-development and great co-workers!"
good,"I learned a lot about myself and how to empathize with customers and employees alike. I left a much calmer person, having experienced what real chaos is. I worked with some really great people. I left a better person."
good,"Awesome Place to work with great Co-workers. I've Learned how to develop and become a great leader and excel in my career. Dealing with ambiguity and demanding customers is an essential part of my job, which is the most rewarding aspect."
good,"I think that working at this company is a great experience for me. It is somewhat challenging. I just graduated college with my Computer Technology Degree. I also think that they pay should be a little more for example: I specialize in all Apple products such as IPhone's, IPad's and ect."
good,The people of this company make it what is is like most companies. The people are passionate and involved. The Cons start to surface when you start to look to advance. This company has some of the most disconnected recruiters I have ever dealt with. Internally and externally. It appears that they chase a quota or rely on the staffing companies to do most of their job functions.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

good,"It can be a bit ""big brother"" at times but working for a company with superior products has its perks."
good,This jobs as the best retail job out there. The job is easy and i would recommend for a student. do not stick around too long. its easy to get sucked in.
good,Confidentiality considerations prevent further elaboration
good,"My responsible products are Server and Storage, Apple was not good at that at all. However, still had to figure a way out, find distributor, solution partner and direct market."
good,"Apple is a very intense place to work however, you are required to use critical thinking which is good experience to use in and out of the work place"
good,"Had a great opportunity to learn, thanks to the team I was in."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

good,Selling Apple products. Enriching the lives of Apple consumers.
good,"Apple is a great company to work for from the retails perspective.  However, if you're not accustomed to working a retail schedule where your shifts change every week, it can be brutal on your personal and family life."
good,"Business Specialist responsible for supporting the red zone , coaching the value of the business introduction, Net promoter score and business awareness. Previously a Apple online store Manager Representative, handled customer service recovery."

good,Each day is very unpredictable. Its been one of the best experiences of my life. It has challenged me in ways I never could have imagined.
good,Overall this is a very nice placed to work. The pace is fast. You are exposed to cutting edge technology.
good,"The company provided a good amount of training. The culture is very upbeat but expect to be part of the ""Apple-Koolaid"" club."
good,I learned how to manage teams and individuals and build projects. Lot of independent work and self starting work. 
good,"NCO was a fun place to work, even if I didn't stay more than 2 years. It offered quick advancement, and a competitive salary."
good,"This is while I was employed by Security Industry Specialists to work spend the night, locked inside the downtown Walnut Creek Apple store. You can hardly ask for an easier job. Only problem is, it's not steady and you can kiss your love of daylight goodbye."
good,Brush up on your customer service skills. This job is not for everyone.
good,Great place to work and move up with Apple. Great atmosphere and great people. Very busy and constantly moving around.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Empresa muito dinâmica, que tem na sua área de criação o maior diferencial."
good,"Apple Enterprise has tremendous opportunity in the US, but Apple continues to provide limited resources to this organization. Great people, fantastic products, but not a sales driven company."
good,The At-Home Advisor position is your average technical support/customer service job. It can be trying at times (mostly due to irate customers) but as long as you pay attention in training and know the product it is an easy job.
good,For good reason Apple is an interesting cultural mix of micromanagement and geographic diversity. People from all over the world work there. Since you cannot talk about projects you have to talk about people and where they are from and what their interests are. I learned allot.
good,1. Provide support for Account and Billing issues for iTunes Store customers through email.
good,fun place to work but pay is horrible. management is nice but was never on same page.
good,"Learned sales skills in a very corporate environment, asked to perform a variety of tasks on a daily basis from normal opening closing activities to repairing hardware"

good,• Manage the equipment tracking process of global data centers
good,"I worked on the Service Parts Team which was a team I helped create in our store in particular due to the discrepancies in stock (esp. service parts). This was a team of 6 men and myself. We would start at 6 AM, counting all sellable, allocated and return parts and sorting out any issues that caused the numbers not to balance. Then posting and shipping out all returns to have them removed from stock. Accepting and posting deliveries to add to stock. It was hard work and required a lot of concentration. However, we brought our accuracy level to 99.96% by the time I left. In a store the size of ours (450 employees) this was a great accomplishment."
good,"I have met some of the most fantastic, unique, special, driven, intelligent, compassionate, quirky, SMART people I have ever know by working for this tremendous company."
good,"I handled approximately 35 calls daily resolving customer’s technical issues from general how to questions, software installation, and application and system failures for desktop and portable computers with Mac OS X Panther 10.3 to Snow Leopard 10.6, as well as hardware troubleshooting. I also sold Apple products to customers to assist in resolving their technical issue."
good,"My time at Apple has been a enriching experience. It has a wonderful staff that is artistic and diverse, yet very knowledgeble."
good,"While at Apple, I enjoyed working with the various customers who entered into the store. It was challenging to learn about the many differences in PCs and Macs but it added to the overall experience. My co-workers were very welcoming and made me feel like I was a part of a family."
good,"Apple demands your best, and only your best. They are a great company to work for."
good,"I have had just about every skill even to a mechanic but i am not interested in mechanic...

I a young lady searching for good work. I absolutely love meeting new people and those types of work i love working period...thanks you everything"
good,"The people are generally very polite. All of them can be classified as weird. You will find people dressed as wizards, transgendered people, elitists, hipsters, and the most obscure races/nationalities all under one roof. The food and parking are great. The only downside is the amount of die hard Apple fans. You will get shunned if you own any products made by Samsung, Microsoft, Sony, etc."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Typically, it is a pretty high stress job in relation to other retail work places. It will have it's slow paces that are nice, but incredibly rare. Most of the time, you are on your feet putting on your best experience for whoever walks through that door."
good,"I enjoyed my time there. I genuinely like Apple products and had a good time selling them. My co-workers were always so helpful and kind. If you can get in, it is a great place to work."
good,The company employs anyone from different ethnic background and working experience. They are very open and accept anyone who don't have straight gender orientation. What I love most about this organization is that it does not discriminate anyone in any ways.
good,My rating for Apple is based on how they treat their employees and on the general culture there. I love the job and wish I had the opportunity to work as a direct employee rather than a contractor.
good,I had a blast working there although I was struggling to meet certain quotas since they had a concrete way of doing things that wasn't very flexible. Not everyone does things the same way in the same manner based off of their comprehension skills and my manager wasn't very accommodating to that.
good,Allie retail is not like many other retail jobs. At Apple you work as one collective team to create a truly one of a kind customer experience.  It’s a one stop shop for Apple users. Apple gave me so mich experience and made me grow as an individual but also as an employee  depending on the store the management will be different but they all have a common end goal and structure . The hardest part of the job is well it’s retail  working retail you are required to work weekends and late nights  the schedule is different each week. At Apple you have a family  each day is completely different then the last. Working with new technology and learning how to integrate that into people’s lives is an enjoyable part for myself  but meeting new people every day .
good,"Apple Pays well but of course it makes up for the amount of ridiculousness you may face in a typical work day. This location specifically, the managers and leads micromanage you and tell you one thing while not all of them are on the same page  you have your good days and you have your bad days but one thing I do appreciate with this job is the work life balance"
good,"Not quite the same as Apple, it was just a vendor. I learned a great deal and the pace was fast with information and products constantly changing. Generally they had a more evolved approach to everything."
good,"Culture wise it has changed a bit over the last years, you can even see that in each store as a customer, but as long as you're supported by a good leadership team then you'll enjoy your time there"
good,In general it is a good company. You can work on a variety of Apple products and understand a cycle of a product from architecture to shipping. Working is challenging but the political issue and culture is making people frustrated.
good,"During my time working at Apple… I waited on customers answer questions regarding all the products, inventory management. I work very hard to try and get a full-time position. I have actually applied To get rehired, but never heard one thing back from them."
good,"I came in the door under Contract with an agency. Worked a few months, and followed the application and interview process when they announced they were hiring."
good,"I enjoyed most of my work at Cafe Macs/Apple. My team was great and we were praised for the food we provided. Unfortunately several managers with big egos made for a less than pleasant atmosphere. The other department lead and myself were put in different departments, even though we created the one we originally worked at. No explanation was given."
good,If you are interested in advancing your career path in the tech industry Apple offers many opportunities to advance your career However you must meet the minimum requirements of time employed before you move from retail to corporate
good,"Pros"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my job at Apple, although I could never advance out of a part-time sales position. The atmosphere was very upbeat, because managers had good attitudes, and most employees enjoyed their jobs. I learned a lot about technology and became workshop trainer certified. One of the negative aspects of working there was it was always very loud and crowded, so it got kind of stressful. On weekends it was packed with teenagers, who tended to monopolize the computers; therefore, it was an issue when trying to show a customer features of one of the iMacs, etc. Apple allowed too many people to linger in the store and utilize the technology; people who never purchased anything but would spill drinks on the computer tables or take up seats that were for actual customers. I think Apple was too lax about people coming into the store and loitering."
good,"I'd been with Apple a long time, and things changed. Under Steve Jobs, it was a fun and thriving place with Managers who cared for you and wanted the best for you. But things changed once he passed."
good,"Working at Apple is a good experience, using their internal tools, good work environment. "
good,"being on the production line was interesting, even though you were expected to reach certain quotas the pace was relaxed. the canteen was very good for food"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Great staff and made good connections. Environment and training are excellent but management very lacking. Advancement promised but opportunities very hard to come by.
good,"The volt office in apple could do a little better, Being a reciever is easy but being able to reach the number you're supposed to reach could be difficult at times."
good,Definitely an experience.  Very private organization. Prefers to keep everything on need to know basis. Slots of multi cultures and incredible backgrounds the employees come from.
good,"It was a great work experience with great benefits but they hold you back in terms of growth. You'll reach your required goals however you'll always get an excuse for why you're not ready. Also, they make you believe you're doing the best work of your life."
good,"I feel that Apple has some great opportunities, but they aren’t creating a system where they hire within as often as they should. Some companies hire 80% within their companies while Apples numbers definitely don’t reach that at all. They tend to hire you into a certain department and make it incredibly difficult to move cross-department, resulting in good people leaving the company for other endeavors and then coming back once they gain more experience. I don’t think it should be like that at all."
good,"Apart from the role it's self, being part of the company was a fantastic experience as the company culture is very cool and the onsite catering facilities are excellent. Parking in Cork city centre isn't great at all when you have to pay 8 euro a day to park on the top floor of Carrolls quay which can be a little dodgy dependng who is sleeping in the doorway of the car park since homelessness has sadly spiked."
good,good experience saving gas very cool working from home easy work and easy to learn to assist customer with varies issues and coaching to get better with the company
good,"Great company average promotion cycle takes about 10 years. I enjoyed the people and the products. Retail was always busy. They had awesome account managers, the leadership at retail was a little petty."
good,Bedrijfscultuur is in korte periode erg verandert.
good,"The job itself is challenging and demanding. Management doesn't consistently provided time for training when new product comes out. As a result, you're tasked with troubleshooting a product you know very little about. The metrics that your performance is measured by are simplistic and lack the nuance that the job itself requires. Many managers, when called in to assist with a customer service issue, make matters worse not better -- or they cave in to the customers unreasonable demands making you, the technician, look like an idiot."
good,"Apple retail is a great place to work overall, but the average retail schedule is tough  to live with. Additionally, the work experience can vary dramatically from one store to the next, and poor managers are rarely cycled out often in place for several years. Benefits are great, but are not the same for part time/ full time workers, with part time workers often receiving less benefits."
good,"I worked as a contractor as Linguistic Tester on a contract position. Days were monotonous.  As a contractor I did not enjoy the workplace culture at the fullest; however, I was able to get discount at the cafeteria and ride the company´s buses. The contractors are dismissed after few months in the company and Apple starts hiring new contractors to continue with their projects. Saving money?"
good,Working for Apple gives the employee a  chance to learn about all the hardware and software that is associated with the company. It is a highly motivated atmosphere with individuals who are anxious to provide the best service possible.
good,Great people all there with a purpose and passion for what they are doing. CEO and executive team are all visionaries and would work with any of them again.
good,"Apple was amazing to work for, the people are the best people I know to date. The culture can feel a bit brainwash-esque, but it almost feels worth it to be privy to the next big thing that comes out. The benefits were unreal and the pay was good for a retail job. The progression between job roles was always promised but not always fulfilled."
good,"The job is enjoyable, you get to chat with a lot of different people. Those people aren't always nice and do curse, however you can tell them that they aren't allowed to do so and let them know you will end the chat if they continue. The pace of the workday just depends on the day, sometimes we are getting double chats back to back and others we are getting one or two an hour. I would love to go back and work for this company, but would love it more if they would pay their home based agents more than $9/hour."
good,"PROS"
good,"Great company, world class benefits, leadership team however are terrible and its run like a mafia. If your not in with the clique your career is dead in the water. It's not the companies fault, its a bunch of leads in positions of power that collude and cover their tracks with 'Apple Language' and know the system so they protect themselves very well."
good,"Typical day would be constant work flow "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I feel very fortunate to have been hired into Apple.  I literally knew nothing about being an executive assistant when I was hired, and so pretty well everything I am lucky enough to know today I learned on the job there.  Working in Steve Jobs' office was quite the teething ring!  :) . The best part of all of my roles at Apple was working with such incredibly smart and humorous people.  The worst part was the stress level could be high--no room for error--and the work/life balance was not the best."
good,"-18 months contract, on-site "
good,"Training en opleiding, daar is er nog wat werk aan, zoals toolbox training meer toepassen naar call agent op de werkvloer."
good,"The job itself was very simple, however when switching over  management the job became very ""messy"". There were lots of discrepancies and inconsistencies between managers with the feedback we were getting for our work."
good,"J'ai appris des nouveaux choses concernant les produits d'Apple."
good,"Apple Inc. is a good company to work for, benefits and pay are unmatched in the retail space. Work/Life balance can be a challenge, but overall, I would still recommend it if you enjoy working with people and technology."
good,"If a store is a major financial producer, the culture of putting people first takes a back seat.  Being in one of the largest stores in the country and being with the company for over 10 years, it was clear that as profits increased, the focus on culture decreased."
good,"I enjoyed it for the most part, but the people were very fake and always felt like there was a target on your back. In terms of compensation and the room for growth, Apple was phenomenal there. I just did not enjoy the culture, tough to fit in."
good,"easy going/fun environment, great for people starting career"
good,"Apple is a great company to work for. Each technician has their own work station, to fulfill their job duties, free from distractions. The opportunity for cross training is always available, and encouraged.  I like that overtime is not mandatory, but is also, always encouraged. I noticed that the management for apple are very patient, and understanding, of the different growth speed of employees. I began my contract with apple as material handler, but through my willingness to learn, I cross trained to repair technician and calibration technician. One of the difficulties of the job was the fact that the warehouse was not an environmentally controlled warehouse."
good,"Fun and Fast Paced but lacks Career Development."
good,"Apple is a trillion dollar company, and a good one to work for. It is an easy job if you are an extroverted individual that uses Apple products. It is also a great place to work if you are currently in school or have another occupation. The benefits and pay surpass general retail stores (especially if you are a full time employee). However, there is a lack of development when transitioning to different roles as well as the corporate world. I definitely recommend that this company be used as a stepping stone towards bigger and better things."
good,"Apple is an amazing company to work for! But...as a Specialist in a retail store just know that you will be on your feet on hard concrete all day long, no matter your age, wear shoes that support your feet, knees and lower back or you will have problems."
good,Well run stores. You do get to learn new technology daily and have challenges. It was a fun place to work. It depends on who your bosses are - getting advancement opportunities can be difficult.
good,"My first tech job. I worked in MobileMe, now called iCloud. This was a live chat queue that shared the phone queue building with Apple Care and iTunes support.  I supported sync services and took payments. You helped three people at a time, and it was stressful. Eep if you were not skilled in certain apps and the HT articles didn't make sense."
good,"Apple is a good place to get a start in retail and/or information technology.  It is fast paced and can be a fun environment.  Apple does offer advancement for specialists, but for managers, the options are limited.  Management runs the gamut from really good to bad. Some of them are brought in from the outside and are young and don't have any operational experience.  Overall, it was a good experience."
good,"It was a good place to work with good management, but it was hard to advance with a career. They emphasized and taught us certain skills that were applicable to everyday life. They frequently checked in on the progress of their employees."
good,"If you're looking to get in somewhere and make close to 50k per year with no experience within a year and a half of working, this is your place. But, if you're experienced you better be ready to be fighting entry level people for the positions that you're more qualified for. If not, they will absolutely place an entry level person in a position over a skilled employee. It's all about who you know."
good,"ótima empresa, benefícios acima da média e função Ok."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"They provide decent jobs, yet you have to stay on them to produce different job oppurtunities.The job I obtained through them was very short lived. Overall it has fulfilled its purpose as a staffing agency.  Although, I went through the motions to get my W-2 forms to file my taxes this year. And still have not received them.I had to go forward without filing them."
good,I worked from home for Apple. I did enjoy my time there. There was plenty of training as needed. Managers were always there for support. Wages were comparable to other companies.
good,You feel that you're making a difference. The work is challenging and never stops. There are many smart people all around and a lot of teamwork. Benefits are awesome and fun beer bashes.
good,not a carrer job. you have to work odd hours. best way in retail. very competitive. good benefits. no work life balance. good starting job. not a career job. can feel like a cult
good,Colleagues we amazing but management were never on the same page. led to very inconsistent expectations which confuses and demoralises staff. definitely a honeymoon period with this job
good,"aprendes a ser responsable, puntual. "
good,Great positions for me as a college student. Flexibility of working from home and company worked around my school schedule. Have had almost 5 managers in my 2 years which is frustrating but they have been good managers for the most part.
good,"No transparency or visibility, very private. Not collaborative with external partners. Lots of red tape for projects. Gives great experience in tech industry."
good,"Apple isn't your average retail job. Its an interesting job,. not one day is the same. You meet new people, encounter new problems to solve. There are many different lateral roles you can change into if the one you are currently in are not for you. There are also many experiences you can take part in to help you grow in the company and in your personal life. I definitely recommend working for Apple."
good,"Working for Apple Inc. is one of the best stepping stones available for customer service. The benefits and discounts available are wonderful and should be taken advantage of. Hower working for the company can be mentally draining. Working from home is an option, but it keeps you isolated. Working at the office building is nice for its on site amenities. But there is definitely a big-brother atmosphere and a glass ceiling."
good,Definitely made some of the best connections working for Apple. You learn so much just being in such an innovative environment. I would say Apple needs to provide a better system for employees to grow within and out of their roles. A lot of employees stay stagnant. Also better work/life balance.
good,Retail is not like corporate.  There is no work life balance.  The amount training you receive is top and the best.  Need to work on hiring better managers as well. Need more in hour promoting from manager
good,"You don't work for Apple, you LIVE for Apple. That should be the company motto. A bully boy culture from the top down, and most are victims. Evolved very fast from a great environment to one where you felt less and less part of a company and more like part of a cult. However, its evident that plenty of people buy into that."
good,"good job, hard to move up, very fast paced, learned a lot and felt with many different people each day. always get to work with new technology. diverse"
good,Great company to work for under most any circumstances. A lot of freelancers work at Apple for the great benefits and seemingly understanding scheduling. I enjoyed my time there.
good,Low stress job and its a friendly environment that promotes collaboration. Management is great and work loads are reasonable. Fun place to work. I would recommend this job to recent graduates.
good,"Good productive work experience, but lack the job security. don't have many projects in hand to retain the resources. Legacy code and would have to use outdated versions."
good,"Casual work place culture, very professional environment and atmosphere. There will always be assistance given if needed and often offered at any time."
good,Calls were back to back - the job posting was advertised as Tier 1 support:  The calls were 2 and above.  I had the background to support that but my agents struggled.
good,"The work was fast-paced, metrics-based telephone technical support, with strict guidelines as to call-flow.  It started out okay, but morale fell as the feeling from the call floor began to feel more like a ""white-collar sweatshop"".  Good job to start with, not a good place to make a career."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple has a pretty hard-glass ceiling in the areas where I worked.  AppleCare has literally no room for advancement once you hit a certain threshold.  The pay is OK but the hours required are pretty terrible.  The AppleCare schedule changes every three months, so having much of a work-life balance is difficult."
good,"My only experience with Apple is as a contract employee, so therefore, it's not representative of the employment experience in general. I was a maps contractor, so I had a fixed hourly schedule with no benefits. I arrived, sat down, did my work, and left on time. It was a pretty stress-free contract. I was able to listen to podcasts or music during the work day, and had a good rapport with the manager."
good,"Awesome product/services line!  Solid brand that tends to sell itself.  Constant improvements and technology changes to product/services line."
good,"7 to 4 shift off sat & sun"
good,"We had limited time to get a project online. Transfer of large amounts of data stored.The work hours were not bad, but contractors were not treated as well as full time employees at the facility."
good,"Apple offered competitive salary"
good,"Ability to learn new things."
good,High-paced and stressful. Working from home was difficult when it came to technical issues or problems keeping you from working. This job would have been a lot easier not working from home and being in college.
good,"I was contracted through a temp agency, and due to a death in my family I had to part ways because bereavement wouldn't be excused due to my contract."
good,Cool. This company had a great work from home position through another agency that I worked for> They pay was competitive but the benefits were blah . They needed more structure but it was okay
good,The work environment that apple created was the best! I felt comfortable at work and the team that i had to work with were life family to me we were that close.
good,"Apple does a great job of hiring high performers.  Wherever you work, you will work with smart, ambitious people on great projects.  If you're used to standing out, however, the work environment may come as a bit of a shock to you.  The work load is overwhelming and the pace at which development and commercialization occurs makes the hours long and infuses stress into everything.  If you can handle that type of thing, it's the place for you.  It is not, however, a cut-throat environment."
good,"Nice environment for children and good co-workers. I"
good,"Although, Apple had good benefits I found it hard to advance. I worked there for over 12  years and felt like I could have been developed better. Some managers are lazy."
good,"I started working in tech as a Mac Genius, and it gave me a wonderful solid background to further my career with. They took a young man with customer service skills, and turned him into an efficient tech expert."
good,The Job is okay but not great honestly. theres times you can have fun and theres times where you can go through tough times with customers. Benefits are great though.
good,"The coolest thing about working for Apple was simply that... working for Apple. It's a retail job, nothing more. The Apple culture and the amazing folks that brings into your store is what keeps you working there. Unfortunately, I had a few managers that were seriously lacking, so I left after only a year... but the company as a whole is amazing. I have several life long friends because of my time with Apple and know a few people that even headed to Cupertino to work for corporate. It was a really cool year."
good,"Innovative, creative and productive.  Great environment to work in and be in daily.  The relationships you form and build are amazing.  Being able to touch co workers and customers is a feeling that is rewarding and most of fulfilling."
good,"Very hands on design and test environment, inter-group communication sometimes a challenge. "
good,"Fun, energetic, and cutting edge training.  Once you hit the floor you have great support from managers and leads.  Opportunity for OT is very good.  A great place for newbies starting out."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple Has an attravtive culture, but it doesn't advance my career options. I'm working as a sales chat specialist. Not as a Front-End developer. I'm mostly self taught but I learn something new almost everyday."
good,The ability to work from home and competitive pay and benefits drew me to Apple. The hardest part is the lack of advancement opportunities as you move up.
good,"Everyone wants the opportunity to tack on a big company name to their resume. Apple was mine. "
good,worked 12 hour shift and generated products on a manufacturing line. A diverse work environment and health benefits. Friendly atmosphere throughout the work force.
good,"I do not feel comfortable giving a review nor am I going to. it was technically in my contract not to do so. on top of that I just don't feel comfortable doing it ""anonymous"" or not,, and I don't think you should continue to make this mandatory"
good,"most amazing brilliant team of people, and exceptionally hard conditions to work, full of secrecy, privacy, and confidentiality.. best part - concerts on the lawn by world top musicians"
good,The major takeaway from this internship is that I learned a lot. From soldering to testing equipment/boards to design to using RF equipments. I've never had a coop term that is as fulfilling.  The culture is highly secretive which is okay to me. I do wish I knew more about what my team does
good,"I had a great experience at Apple Maps. The people were great and management was above average. This is a good starting point for folks starting their career, however, you need to work for it and prove your worth in your team. Good experience overall."
good,The job would be amazing if it were less stress. I spend a lot of time feeling exhausted and debating if working with this stress load is worth the pay.
good,"If you like working at home and enjoy a call center type job and Apple, you'll do great. Life/work balance is subpar and they're really strict on following your schedule exactly."
good,Not a bad job overall but not for someone looking to make a career out of it. The room for advancement at first seems great and in a year you can advance to senior support but after that you will need to kiss major buttocks and do everything that apple wants like a good little robot.
good,"Just helped customers have a great experience."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for if your single and no family commitments."
good,"not every customer understands that you broke their device. the management was just ok. the work/life balance sucked. co workers were great, store leader is a jerk."
good,Workplace is interesting and overall a good job. Advancement becomes tough even when you are head and shoulders better than your peers. This is a good ole' boy network.
good,"There is no shortage of work to do. You'll never get bored because there is always something to do and it is a different challenge each time."
good,"Fun, Fast paced, Demanding mentally, a lot of standing, exciting "
good,"Apple is what you would expect of company of it's size and stature, it's competitive. For people really willing to buckle down and play the ""game"" there is room for growth. Though I would recommend getting leadership experiencing outside of the company if you have aspirations of becoming a leader here."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"- typical day at work would be stressful but it depends a lot on the team you work in"
good,Some groups at Apple can be very innovative and interesting to work for. Others will be dull and boring. It is better to ask enough questions about a position and a group you're interviewing for before committing.
good,"Working at Apple Care you learn a lot about the device you own. The hardest part about the job was the surveys. Sometimes customer will rate the company as a whole and not yourself even if you provided radical customer service experience. This taught me to understand the call patterns and how I should start off my calls."
good,"Apple is a fantastic place to learn about processes and how a successful company operates."
good,"worked as an at home advisor, you never get to personally meet colleagues"
good,retail stores needs major restructuring. Managers need to be hired based on experience and qualifications. They need more transparency and a better management of hours.
good,"good pace to work, hours are good and the staff, "
good,"Throughout my time at Apple, my daily duties consisted mainly of performing wrote tasks to assist customers with issues that arose during the shipping of online orders.  Many days, I would go about these tasks with very little downtime or even customer contact. (it was not needed in most cases.)  However, every once in a while we would receive a customer or specialist request that didn't quite make sense or had been handled incorrectly and in these situations, I was able to play detective for a bit.  Unraveling the real reason behind the request or to find out where exactly communication broke down between a customer, a distribution center, and / or a shipping agent.  It was these challenges that truly made this job fun and often times once the issue was resolved the customer was far happier to know that we were looking out for them."
good,Take inbound calls. I love my supervisor. I am an at home advisor. Trainings are online and can be rushed at time. The compensation/benefits package is great.
good,"great place to work "
good,"Great benefits, low pay, high expectations. "
good,"Apple was great to work for, don't get me wrong but they were stingy when it came to raises and there was not a lot of chances for a home based agent to move up.  Probably because well, you are home based and many of the job openings are not.  The benefits are excellent; if I remember it correctly you had health benefits on day one (no waiting period.) which of course if very rare.  Another very silly and vain perk was just the fact that you are working for Apple!  When people would ask who you worked for and I would say Apple you could see the admiration on their faces (and working from home for them just added to their jealousy!)  All in all it was an awesome experience and one that I really wouldn't hesitate to recommend to someone else."
good,"I tutored different grade levels students from every walk of lives. I learned the different culture of the people, the way they live their life, dealing with each other and the respect they were offering me during my tutoring sessions. "
good,"Handling Escalated issue of customer is tough work in day."
good,The work environment is one of the best I have ever worked in.  They care about their employees and always try to help when they are able too.
good,"A very productive and positive workplace. Comaraderie between co-workers and also with management was very relaxed and supportive, while being a highly pressurised and goal driven environment."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Overall positive rating for Apple retail. I worked as a technician, which is overwhelming at first but became pretty redundant and easy over time. My favorite part of the job is the people. Apple focuses on hiring personable people, so its easy to get along with everyone."
good,"We start our job at 8.30pm and finish it off at 5am. Basically the job is easy as i only screw 2 screws in assembling of a phone and that is it. there are other stations that do other parts in order to get a phone properly assembled. Basically the job is easy but the rules and regulations of Volt Services our recruiting company is very strict."
good,"Overall, working for Apple finally enabled me to use all of my skills for a company that I believed in and supported as customer.  The position was remote and afforded me the ability to work from the comforts of my own home.  The technology was superior to other remote positions I've held in that you were able to still feel very much connected where working remotely 100% can lean towards a sense of isolation.     "
good,"Encouraged to resolve the problem at hand, but it must be done within 15 minutes. The side-chat provided to us is a helpful tool when one of us is stuck and needs help from a teammate. The managers, who are not required to take phone calls, (some of which haven't since iPhone 1st gen in 2007), are giving instructions on how to handle a call for an iPhone 6+ with the newest iOS. That aside, everyday is a productive day for me, because I do not leave work with an open case. I make sure I am the last representative a customer has to talk to and I resolve the conflict at hand. The conflict resolution not only looks good on myself, but on the company as a whole and this consumer may then become a loyal, returning customer."
good,"The work culture is not very good, any time anybody can call for work even in midnight. The cluster was not so stable so the data corruption happen any time so team need to work to correct the data."
good,It was cool working for Apple for a while but then it came into everything was a number and you never felt worth it to the company. you were a man in a box to answer phones and that is about it . Nothing special nothing cool nothing great just one big gray box...
good,"Competitive atmosphere, great peer work environment."
good,Fast pace working environment and great learning opportunity. Apple is a nice place to work at and a great technology company.
good,"I love Apple and the company has GREAT benefits. The At Home Adviser positions have good and not so good advantages. I have had 7 managers in under 2 years and out of all of them, I found that 2 were beyond great...the perfect people in the right position. However, a good number of people in management positions were not always the right people for the job."
good,It was a good company. the only thing I would change is the work life balance other than that it is a great company to work for.
good,Apple is a great place to work at. Always there is lot to be done so you are always on your toe. The work is challenging but its bit hectic here.
good,"Company Based in Hollyhill Cork"
good,"Working for Apple is an extremely great opportunity. You gain experience that you will not be able to gain elsewhere. The company itself offers great benefits and compensation. Sadly the work schedule can be a bit of a drag but the perks make up for it. "
good,"I've learned the most about myself from this job. Not only a great experience, but working retail has really opened my eyes to the nuances of working with the public. Empathy, listening, and compassion are skills I use every day to help customers either solve issues or find the product they're looking for."
good,I appreciated the opportunity to join one of the best companies in the World. I learned valuable lessons that will help me in my next position.
good,"Fast paced and challenging environment for efficient technical support of a vast array of customer issues. The job requires to you be creative and constantly learning.  "
good,"I enjoyed working for Apple, despite the stressful environment and long days and hours because the coworkers I had there are still some of my best friends."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for, but advancement is hard and the hours are hard, it is retail afterall.  I enjoyed the times when I taught and also my times working at the Genius Bar helping those who had technical problems.  I am a problem solver."
good,"-New and Handful of experience ."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Great company to work for. Job security is there if you can handle how they handle scheduling, the mandatory 8-10 hours of overtime during product release times, the extremely high levels of stress, and changing your team leader every few months (I had 11 TMs in just under 3 years). If you're looking for a static schedule of Monday thru Friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, keep looking. The schedules are bid on every six months, meaning your schedule WILL change every six months, and you may at some point be asked to move to a graveyard schedule time."
good,My co-workers make a fun working environment. days are very fulfilling and exciting. management is great. hardest part is stayin awake sometimes as it is a night shift
good,"Delivering world class customer service and creating a great experience for Apple customers (Apple Online Store)."
good,Nice place to work in a thriving busy environment.  Good colleagues with good atmosphere to work in.
good,"As any retail job it has its highs and lows. "
good,"when i was joining my job in apple, i was totaly shocked because that day i make my dream come true, i learned lots of thing from apple on of that is i know my position who i am there, in retail market. i learned how to make customer positive about our product how different i am from all other. because of full time standing job i need to leave the company thats my unhappy day,..."
good,A fun place to work and learn about Apple Culture. Understanding the Customers needs and how to trouble shoot the Devices.
good,"Shift from 10 pm-7 am."
good,"Excellent technical, time mgmt., leadership and team building skills."
good,A typical day consists of tracking and tracing shipments as well as other carrier and warehouse receiving and shipping issue. I also communicated with internal to make sure the customer was taken care of as well as processing claims if necessary. I've learned more about SAP and various track and trace programs. Management and co-workers were friendly and very helpful in the learning process. The hardest part was correcting errors in inquires that were submitted incorrectly. This most enjoyable part of the just had to be the atmosphere and environment.
good,"Analysing trends in revenues and expenses."
good,It is a very challenging face paced environment. I typical day is spent on the sales floor coaching and developing staff.  This is not the job for you if you are an office dweller.  The most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with generally happy customers who are shopping at an Apple store for fun.  The people which Apple hires are the best in the industry hands down.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of advancement opportunities.
good,"Most days are spent fielding technical support calls and emails from customers and software developers.  There are training and information sessions schedules as needed."
good,Apple is the fun. You get to meet a lot of interesting people at the stores if you work sales. Have to invest a lot of time before any advancement.
good,This job was a very good place to work.  Just when you wanted advancement they would give it to someone that didn't have a lot of experience with the floor and how to speak with employees.
good,Good company that cares about its employees.  Hours were long however flexible.
good,"While working in retail can never fully be described a ""fun,"" Apple is the first company to come close to making it so. Working in an Apple retail store makes you feel like a kid again each day, and keeps you on your toes with its fast-paced and ever-changing environment. The management takes a direct role in the store's overall performance and makes those tough decisions in the moment on a daily basis, allowing the employees to multitask quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of the job would have to be maintaining professionalism. In that kind of environment, working with mostly college students, it can be fun but also very immature. At the same time, this was the most enjoyable part of my job, because every person I worked with had their own interesting or even exciting story, and in the position I worked, I was able to form lasting friendships with some of these extraordinary individuals."
good,It was a fun place to work and it was a thrill to be able to not only assist people with there technology but to aid people to become comfortable and relaxed so that assisting them through there troubles would be an enjoyable experience for them.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Getting up early in the morning was a challenge. It was hard for the first time, getting 5 to 6hrs of sleep every week days. When I started working at Apple, I've learned every aspect, every details in the warehouse. I've learned how to process warranty and adding information to the system. Every Apple products returned by the costumers are highly different. The warehouse is 100% secured and I understand because its a big corporation with technology. Everyone of my co-workers are nice and diverse. We smile, laugh and having a good time. The hardest part of the job is working more than 10hrs a day (Overtime). Now, the average hour at Apple is less than 40hrs a week. No more overtime. I enjoyed working at this job, I just like to keep myself busy everyday."
good,"Unique and extensive learning opportunities "
good,With every customer comes a new challenge testing your knowledge and skills all the time. I have learnt how to control very upset customers as well as Apple's world class service. The hardest part would be dealing with upset and high rate customers. the best part of the day would be helping a customer by putting a smile on they face and showing them how easy the work can be by just a few clicks
good,"* Many employees get by coasting.  NYC employees typically have other gigs.  A typical day on the sales floor is a good amount of socializing with coworkers as well as customers – not a bad way to go."
good,"My days consist of checking customers in for genius bar appointments and also troubleshooting the customer product before they get to the technician. I will also repair mobile devices (iPads,iPhones,iPods) and repair the relationship with the customer on their product."
good,"Apple is an amazing company to work, very demanding , always looking for perfection"
good,-Processing shipment
good,As a Genius I have been given the task to resolve certain situations that customers may have with the highest level of customer satisfaction. I enjoy communicating with people at different technical levels and I am able to translate the most difficult tasks into everyday dialog so there is no perceived level of difficulty at all. As a dynamic team player I am always ready to think outside the square to make sure my store is a step ahead of the rest.
good,good workplace wit loads to learn everyday.always kept busy witch helps day go better.
good,"A typical day a Apple is not one that can be match anywhere eles, what I mean by that is that there are no two days that are like there. I have learned that you must be able to stop and switch postion roles on a dime there while at the same time still taking time and consideration to make the customer happy. The co-works are just as different and unique as snowflakes, while there you learn how to talk to many different people in many different ways to make them conferable, a very valuable skill in my option."
good,Main QA engineer responsible for manual/automation testing of the Printing system for Mac OSX OS & iOS print center.
good,"As long as you know the managers personally, play the games and hit your metrics, you'll go far.  If you do your job, even really well, you'll make a great living, just don't expect to advance at any reasonable pace."
good,Great place to work however there were some issues with my pet that had forced me to quit. The management could have been better and the hours I received were acceptable but erratic.
good,"I rated as per my short experience working with the agency. It was never clear who was handling my job case if I did have a concern however, when I did speak to someone they were always courteous and kind."
good,I overall liked it but I was seasonal so management and the coworkers were starting to act distant while my last days there. Which made me not feel welcomed.
good,"Skills developed at Apple are valuable at many other companies. Apple is known for hiring good people so it looks good on a resume. A very people focused job, so much of what separates a ""good day"" vs. a ""bad day"" depends on your customers that day. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,The company is big and has a lot of layers. You feel like a part in a big machine.  You focus on your tasks and work and are not encouraged to discuss other groups work.  I'm ok with this  but if you really want to be connected to the core of your company it may get to you.
good,"Not at liberty to say, working in this particular team was a challenge on many levels.  Rewarding sure, but a challenge all the same. I don't personally feel disclosing like this is a terribly good thing folks should do."
good,"Life with Apple is stressful but interesting. There is plenty of opportunity to move up the chain in Apple so you can challenge yourself or stay right where you are, there's no pressure"
good,"The work environment was amazing , you meet so many gifted and talented people. The benefits are amazing!  The management is the biggest downfall, LOTS of micromanaging and belittling."
good,"High volume job, that requires you to think quick on your feet and be prepared for difficult customer interactions. Management has your back every time that they are needed to step in. Training was very thorough and never felt like I did not have resources to turn to if need be."
good,"This was a retail environment so the typical work day is typically hectic but the people you work with and around are genuinely nice people and great to work with."
good,"Enjoy Teaching for Apple Computer as a Freelance/Contractor for many years at various Apple Certified Training Centers, and Independent Producers, Corporate Entities, TV stations etc."
good,"The best part of the job was meeting so many different people. Job culture is very high. Management is friendly and professional. They can be strict, but it's expected with so many employees and deadlines to meet."
good,The managers were great. The pay was not. I thoroughly enjoyed clocking into work and getting to know leadership and management. It was an enjoyable experience.
good,"high pressure to meet your stats and some antisocial hours, good amount of training and support and management are approachable. good benefits but alot more benefits to being based in holyhill rather then remote."
good,"Really great pay and benefits if you don’t mind being an IC for your whole career  because the competition is so intense, it’s very difficult to level up to a people manager role. Overall I would recommend working here."
good,About 5 years with Apple and the days seems to kinda blur together during our launch season. Definitely a lot of opportunities to build yourself as a person but also your career within Apple. I learned a lot about best practices when speaking with customers and matching there customer personality. As well as learned that working from home you really have to fight for the job title you are aiming for and make sure to network to the best of your ability.
good,"Trouble shooting is the best way to sum up working at Apple. Always working with customers to fix devices and teaching them the platforms (OSX/iOS). Great experience, in terms of client interactions. Learning how to deal with very angry and difficult individuals was the biggest take away."
good,A good place to work. Great experiences and more than fair salary and benefits. The team I work with is dedicated to a wonderful customer experience internally and externally.
good,"Working for Apple is extremely enriching. Being surrounded by enormous talents both staff and management makes everyday intense and interesting. "
good,"Things at Apple, or in the technology sphere in general, are ever-innovating and always evolving. If you're the type that is hungry for knowledge and growth, you'll fit right in. You get hands-on training with the latest technologies in a collaborative environment that fosters a thirst for learning."
good,"Apple was a great place to launch my working career. I learned a lot of valuable skills working there, both personally and professionally. The pay is higher end retail level, unless you are able to fight through the political maze that is their career advancement process and make it to management or corporate, you will more likely flatline financially within a few years. The benefits are very good though, and they offer an amazing stock program, so if you are in a place financially to save money,  you can turn this into a solid situation, but if you pay rent, bills and have student loans its a very difficult balancing act to thrive and take full advantage of everything they have to offer.  I honestly did enjoy working there and made lifelong friends thanks to their amazing company culture and hiring standards, but the thing that eventually drove me away was the lack of valuable advancement opportunities and low wages. I would highly recommend a stint at Apple if you are fresh out of college and looking for a job, but the best way to a worthy career is to follow the technical path at the genius bar, get repair certified, and then find a similar (but less stressful) job doing the same thing for double the salary somewhere else, where they actually have budget to pay you fairly,"
good,"Part-time sales at Apple. Wonderful team to work with. Demanding for a part-time role, but I felt worth it. Hard to advance, despite experience, education, and demonstrated abilities."
good,"Great benefits and a great place to work overall. Really good company culture. All of the resources you need are at your finger tips, however is it tough to advance."
good,I was brought on as a contractor and right off then bat this particular team makes you feel alienated and small. Compared to the companies I’ve worked for this one was just a depressing experience when I look back on it.
good,"The retail stores are retail but unlike any retail you've most likely worked up until now. The noise level and pace can be quite intense at times. The location I work at employs roughly 100 people but management is a total of 6 managers and 2 lead helpers. This stretches management assistance thin which can be daunting in itself. Fighting crowds on the weekend can be a job all its own, let alone having to meet deadlines and staying ahead of the expectations, both customer-driven and systematic. At the end of the day, it always feels good to help the customer. We all have things we cherish and our devices tend to be the keeper of our memories, schedules, contact with the outside world, etc. It's nice to be there to help protect and retrieve those important things for someone else."
good,"It was a great facility friendly people. Job overall was relatively easy coming from the type of background in my previous jobs."
good,"Great company, you can wear anything once your hired at a corporate headquarters but requesting time off is pretty limited. There was a cafe so you always had plenty of options."
good,Great place to work and amazing atmosphere. Great energy from those around you and willing to come in and work hard to put a smile on customers faces each and everyday.
good,"Benefits of working at Apple are really good. Even as part time you get health, vision, dental, 401k, fitness reimbursement, tuition reimbursement. Pay is decent enough. It gets very easy to get stuck there."
good,"Fast paced, focussed and collaborative environment. Easy to move across groups but up to certain level. Being subject matter expert is important and appreciated for career advancement."
good,"Work life balance at Apple is tough but manageable. Make sure you have a separate working environment where you can close the door and step away from. The salary at Apple is very good, not quite great for the pressure of day to day calls in my opinion but is a good starting point. Benefits are great with discounts internally and externally (hotels, in stores online etc) as well as health and dental insurance provided. Job security is a given with such a large and thriving company but advancement is slow as the company has plateaued (July 2019). Management is good at Apple provided you are not passed pillar to post between different managers. Job culture is good but could be a lot better for AHA's as we are not really thought of (out of sight out of mind). Some advisors have set up their own social clubs and get very involved with volunteering in their area."
good,a wonderful company to work for and knows how to take care of employees once moved out of retail sector. The hardest part of the position is work life balance as well as returning to pursue higher education. Not as flexible with school scheduled as you move up in positions
good,"A typical day at work consists of dealing with ambiguity while repairing the relationship between the brand and the customer. Management is unable to take feedback at times, but the Store Leader usually has a good head on their shoulders. There is a sense of politics in order to advance which can be annoying, but as long as you ""play the game"" and become a ""yes person,"" you will move up quicker than others. The hardest part of the job is acting fake with peers in order to advance, and becoming a robot to fit their ""image"" all while ""being yourself."" The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers or managers praise you for your work--which is unfortunately rare if you are a high performer."
good,I loved working at Apple. I was a full time student while I was working there so I was only part time. The issue was that they expect minimum 24 hours as a part timer. Most weeks I was scheduled for 28-29 hours while taking 16-17 credits a semester as an information technology major. 22 of these 28 hours were expected to be done between Friday night and Sunday. Other than scheduling issues that eventually caused me to leave the company I had a great time working there. The people working there really do care about their customers and it can be a very fun environment. Not much room to advance in the retail sector though.
good,Leadership/Management not always aligned on goals. Inefficient product development process hidden by product simplicity and volume/scale.  Problem amplifies when working on complex systems.
good,"Current role involves investigating cost issues in construction, where budgets and actuals are more than a certain percentage apart. Investigating bids and bid leveling versus actual job site performance."
good,"Apple is a very well-known company, and as such, employees are faced with standards that are often impossible. The rating system for employees, technicians in particular, are arbitrary and based entirely on the whims of the customers who fill out the full surveys. Management is supportive and tries to make the job positive, but often asks too much commitment from the best and brightest employees, causing many to burn out quickly. Many people who start working at Apple are very excited--understandably so. They say ""yes"" to everything they are asked, from staying late to coming in on days off, but after some time--months for some, years for others--it all becomes overwhelming and draining. It is also difficult for many to move up in the retail store due to changing expectations and moving goals. At the end of the day, the salary is competitive for sales and retail, but the stress of the job and the weight of the expectations for technicians do not match the compensation. If technicians were paid more competitively, perhaps the turnover rate would not be so high. I love my job, but like many others, am currently seeking employment elsewhere for better pay and a more consistent schedule."
good,"Take all the things you hate and love about retail and multiply them by five."
good,"While Apple pays well, the management leaves things to be desired and the rotating shifts every 6 months is brutal."
good,"A very Solid company. It has Great benefits and decent salary. Worth working for and learning from. Highly recommend it, if you can make it in. Solid solid solid."
good,"Overall, Apple was a good place to work. The benefits were good but the compensation wasn't as good as some of the competitors in the tech industry. For example, you had to pay out of your pocket for Caffe Macs while other companies gave free food. Management can vary but generally was good and allowed you to do what you needed to do without micromanaging you."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Worked on a project for season of product releases.Created web pages, banners, email, print collateral, store signage and OOH advertising. Security is very high."
good,"Great Company, but the Management can DEFINITELY improve."
good,By far the most fun job I’ve ever had. You are hired on your personality as Apple values core qualities and can teach what you don’t know. Management varies and you can find it disappointing at times but that comes along with any job.
good,"Much less stressful of a job than some others I've had. They're understanding of work/life balance and offer plenty of benefits, but I was a contract employee so I worked for a different employer while I was there. I miss it sometimes because they take care if you, up to and including ergonomically fixing your desk, chair, computer screen, etc."
good,"Apple is a company where you receive benefits even as a part time employee. From tuition help, to 401K contribution, and health insurance. If you want to move up, there are opportunities. Not many on the sales floor, but in Genius Bar; yes."
good,"Great culture, took a long time to get promoted, and also poor management who had their favorites.  Great work environment to get to know others and learn."
good,"I enjoyed working at Apple because it allowed me to have the work life balance that I was seeking.  Management is ok.  As in, managers tend to manage up."
good,"Stressful at Christmas which managers tried to bribe you with free food/events"
good,"I quickly realized working from home full time was not for me. The training was well done.  I liked the online trainings a lot.  My first supervisor was awesome, but my second left a lot to be desired."
good,"Very good people to work with - knowledgeable, committed, professional. Know their areas of expertise well.  "
good,"Great! Laid back environment, customer service skills,  great training program! Managers are awesome, pay was good, break time was good, great people to work with!"
good,If you can positivly impact the team and customers you will go far. You will have to be politically savvy as well. Build good relationships with management otherwise you will not go far.
good,"When you are favored by upper-leadership, your position is secure and your work is valued.  If that changes, prepare for the worst."
good,"Productive place."
good,"Although good to great pay, I had to commute 2.5+ hours even though the Apple shuttles were accessible. In addition to this, job tasks were repetitive and job location was almost far for any downtown area. This made me reconsider other job opportunities after graduating from a prestigious 4 year college. I really had to reconsider this job to commit to other life responsibilities and duties as a parent and provider."
good,"In Apple retail you’ll work with amazing, enthusiastic people who are genuinely so passionate about their job. Management is also mostly great and supportive. However at the end the day, it is retail and there are expectations when it comes to meeting targets. Also there are no pathways to growing in the company outside of the retail business."
good,"Good starter job in the technical world; horrible environment to work, lots of high school drama, good way to get your foot in the door but then transfer somewhere else long term"
good,"Fun place to work, if you enjoy retail.  Bad hours and weekend schedules.  Not extremely flexible for outside needs.  Benefits were great though and you can meet a lot of great people."
good,"I was a contractor in Apple, it will be different from Apple employment. My contracter manager was super nice, care and responsible. Unfortunately I can not access to Apple park head quarter for touring."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Very fast paced and a great team dynamic.  I learned everything I know regarding iOS and Mac OS X software and hardware during my tenure there.  The only negative aspect were the full retail working hours.
good,"Apple retail is a great place to work if someone wants to move up to a corporate position. "
good,"Very fast paced environment. The only downtime is your meal breaks. Keeps you mentally sharp as the company constantly updates its hardware, software and company focuses. The people you work with are the highlight of the job. The customer base is challenging. They have very little known resources to help learn about apple products and services. Apple provides many different career experiences based in Texas, New York and California. The benefits are great and the perks you get for working there are outstanding."
good,"Apple is a great company to start your career in the working world! They are competitive and fast paced, with positions in store that allow to hone in on skills. Ultimately, this wasn't my first place of employment and although it was better than previous employers the pay structure and overall management leaves room for improvement."
good,Apple is a great place to start your career if retail is the path you would like to go on. They offer great advancements pathways if you’re interested in the field of retail/technology. It has a high turn over rate of employees.
good,"Fast paced, wirth exposure to technologies as I mentioned, it all depends who is your manager, there is a competitive edge to you end up involved with."
good,"Really great place to work, the only downside is that they do not close for the holidays.  Bonuses every month and classroom training for new software and products"
good,"I loved the work and the training and the trainers/managers. However, I had to resign when I did not want to which was disappointing. My mom went into hospice and has very few days left. I asked to take a leave of absence but could not because I was too new. For what the company invested in my training I would think giving me a few weeks off unpaid would be in their best interest especially for an employee of my caliber. I guess it just wasn't meant to be."
good,Working at Apple for 6 years taught me a great deal about myself and business. The most rewarding thing about working for the company was all the amazing talented people that you worked with and met coming into the stores.
good,"The culture of Apple is what makes it special. Your teams are the backbone of everything you do. Be prepared to be surrounded by people in a noisy chaotic environment because it's rarely slow. Technology is a part of our everyday lives, so when things go wrong people get really nasty. Customers will yell, threaten, steal and overall treat you like garbage a lot of the time. The benefits are nice even for part time, but the pay doesn't make up for the stress of the working environment or the people you have to deal with. There is next to no room for advancement."
good,"As long as you are good with people, its a great place to work. I had extensive background in product knowledge, but as long as you are fearless in your ambitions the sky is the limit."
good,Great Pay  Lots of hours to work  can  get  very hectic with call after call after call . High pressure every one is calling you for a problem very stressful most days.
good,"A typical day for a retail Apple employee includes team huddles, constant engagement with a variety of customers. Demonstrating Apple features can sometime get repetitive, however depending on the customer it can be a great experience."
good,"I had a lot of fun at Apple. Moved across the country, met a lot of amazing people, and learned about the culture from Apple."
good,"working for apple from home is great if you dont desire consistent advancement. pay is great, hours semi-flexible. If customer service is not a long term career goal, this is not the gig for you however."
good,"I was only working for a short time at Apple. This does not give me enough insight for a detailed review. Employees seemed to be passionate, a common vision is shared."
good,"Everyone knows what Apple’s culture is like, same goes for actually working there.  A lot of politics, be prepared to jump through hoops and never forget this is a RETAIL POSITION. Benefits, discounts, perks are ahh-making. Take advantage of them even simple ones like discounted movie tickets)!!"
good,"The teams at Apple are inconsistent in how they are managed. Some have good work/life balance, some have work from home privileges, some have inconsistencies within the team where privileges are granted to some but not others depending on the managers whim."
good,"I wish I could say some nicer things, but after a year of giving everything I had, being one of the best employees my manager had ever seen (so they said), they let me go a month before the end of my contract and did not even flinch when I left sobbing. They laid over 100 of us off on the same day. Some say ""that's what we signed up for"" and I guess they're right. It's a shame. i would have never left Apple."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,good place to work but expectations are high and the praise received for doing a good job is forced and fake. i would rather get no praise for doing my job in an adequate then fake praise to try and get me to work harder.
good,"While working at Apple the pay was wonderful and they helped pay my internet bill. I worked from home for three years taking calls back to back everyday. You are always by yourself except for the ability to chat with friends and management. After getting off a call yuh are expected to immediately take another call, this was difficult because I would still need to finish notes on the previous call. Apple is very fast paced and not for the faint of heart."
good,"Great People, Fantastic culture, always helpfull and friendly, always there when and where required, even onsite, hours in the Malls are abit long tho"
good,"Apple is NOT the best place if you have a family. Also, ALL who work in the Family Room are under paid. Especially, for the New York City market."
good,"Great experience to have worked here. Lots to learn and great people to work with. But you have to deal with the worst self entitled customers screaming at you all day long. Not much room for development either, and almost impossible to move from retail to corporate."
good,"Great job to get through school. The culture is great, management could use some work and the pay could be better considering the company is one of the wealthiest, but loved it beyond that."
good,Great Place to work. Very fast paced and a lot of room for movement within the company. You'll gain valuable experience with apple in customer service and things that you'll find yourself using outside of work.
good,"It's hard to rate a tech giant. Culture differs heavily from org to org and no two employees will have the same experience. However, I will say the overall culture is that Apple cares heavily about their brand and products. However, this kind of dedication and focus does not translate the same with how they treat employees. While they provide more than the average company, they are not as focused as other tech giants in making sure all employees are treated the same."
good,"Retail job. So dealing with the general public everyday was draining. Learned a lot of tangible and soft skills. Management can be overbearing and you can get stuck in one role for a long time. But overall, I would recommend."
good,Se debe ser muy rapida para trabajé cobrar y atender a las personas
good,"it was overall a job that i meant to join and leave                                                    "
good,I received projects which allowed me to explore other fields in design. I was able to learn new softwares in order to produce designs associated with Ui/UX and got to work with other teams on projects
good,"Great place to work. Fun, and fast paced. Would highly recommend if available in your area. Excellent training provided, good hands on before cutting you loose on the floor with live customers. Very good place to get call center and customer service experience."
good,We will have an opportunity to work for any technology that we are interested. Everyone in the floor were grouped together with 6 people per cabin that makes us work collaboratively. Sometimes it is quiet disturbed while some group of people discuss something in a loud.
good,"“A place for everything, and everything in its place” describes a typical day at work for Apple retail. Each team member has specific roles and specific zoning to accomplish the goals for the day, which include facilitating sales of Apple hardware, offering training opportunities for customers, and providing customer-facing customer support at the Genius Bar. Apple is open to innovation, inclusion, and diversity, but as a global company it can take time to implement change."
good,The work is very organized with respect to the tasks assigned to each one. A lot of review and follow up with your work. Deadlines are important. Great team culture.
good,"Organized structured yet easy going environment..overall cool place to work for sure."
good,"In sales it is pretty relaxed on how long you could be on the phone in order to relate to the customer. After a big release we took customer service calls as well. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,The work was exciting and nice to see the benefits to the customers and end-user.  This isn't a place that everyone can succeed due to the dynamic and fast-paced environment.
good,Laid back. Got to get up every 2 hours for mail runs so I didn't get bored of sitting all day. Manager was nice and cut up with us about things. Could always talk to him if I had a problem.
good,"As an AppleCare Team manager about half of my day would be spent coaching my own team to provide excellent support to our customers. The other half would be broken in to meetings: management team, quality team, etc., and admin tasks like attendance, payroll, data analysis, emails, etc. "
good,"Great people and great environment, but management was not flexible with those who worked other jobs or also went to school. Compensation was more than fair."
good,My experience in the service industry has taught me how to meet and exceed each customer's expectations with service that sells. I have assisted all types of customers in all types of settings. I realize that acquiring and maintaining loyal repeat business as well as spreading the word of your business through these loyal patrons is of the utmost importance in every company.
good,"If you work hourly at a store don't expect much, pay wise. Never understood why they choose to pay so little to the customer facing employees. Especially with the billions being made by the company. "
good,"Working at Apple, is a very relaxed and casual experience, even though the store is busy, you do not tend to get stressed out as everyone there is there to support you. As a lover of the products it was great for me to experience working there. There were good benefits there too.    "
good,"Great working environment, everyday is different! Most of the people that work at have something that you can learn from and who are willing to share. Everyday is a learning day."
good,Good job for energetic go getters willing to learn about mobile carrier services and fees.  No heavy pressure to sell.  Team work is a huge part of their culture.
good,You really did feel like you were a part of something bigger. Something that was changing lives. The culture and people were amazing! What I did not like were attempts to advance in your current position or apply for another position. It was more about who you knew not what you knew which is unfortunate.
good,"It was a pleasant work environment, the management was really very kind. They have a great training program. If I lived closer, I would definitely return to work there again."
good,"Dealing with payment issues around EMEIA, contacting customers about payment problems, adding new cards to orders, dealing with unencrypted CC numbers."
good,Great place to learn the technical aspect of the company while supporting customer needs and desires. Great management team that is very supportive. Great place to meet all types of people and build relationships for the future. Often offered opportunities to explore different parts of the company outside of your role.
good,"I took the job at Apple as an in-between job and it was fantastic for just that! Incredible benefits, even for a part time employee, which is amazing. I finally left when I switched stores and the stress level and demand became too overwhelming for me! It's all about location. But overall, really great job."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for. Unfortunately, there is limited advancement from retail to corporate. Otherwise, culture, benefits, and pay are well above average."
good,"- work was flexible"
good,"After years or working as a chef, I wanted to get back into working in technology, but few companies would hire me with my resume."
good,"What originally seemed like a positive upbeat culture that was entirely customer focused soon turned into something else. We began getting pushed to focus more on how fast we could go through cases instead of taking our time to make sure a customer is 100% satisfied. The metrics you are graded by are arbitrary, and seemingly had no bearing on advancement at all. For example if you have a 100% customer satisfaction rating, but say your average call handle time isn't exactly what they want, then they kind of shrug off advancement talk and reiterate a focus on your metrics."
good,I would greet the customer as the concierge. I then would help any shopper answer any questions they might have and go over all the benefits of each product. This was quite enjoyable. I learned a lot from working here and would recommend a friend to work here.
good,"This is a challenging place to work. They are interested in your development but I can't say INVESTED. Being that the company is very insulated in its own right, work life balance can become challenging especially in a retail environment. They give the perception of more than just a retail store but essentially you are stuck with the same limitations as with any retailer (hours specifically)"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,The atmosphere and culture of working at an Apple Store was great even though it was hard work. Like all retail jobs it could be hard to maintain a good work life balance sometimes. Also the managers in stores could vary significantly in terms of how well they did they jobs and worked with employees. Very little opportunities to move before working in retail store.
good,"Pay is higher than any other retail environment, but you're still underpaid for the work that you do for the company. Schedule is never consistent, which is the biggest downfall. Some managers are great, some managers are terrible. Just the luck of the draw. Expect to work every major holiday except Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. You'll work every day around the holiday, so good luck spending time with family. Time off, paid or unpaid, is hard to get, especially if your manager doesn't like you. Advancement within stores is all political and hard to do. Some people were able to escape to corporate, but don't expect that to happen if that is your goal."
good,Faced paced but hours got cut. I had to look for something else. Would have stayed there because I worked hard and had a great team but unfortunately hours were not the best to make ends meet
good,"Working at apple was wonderful. I worked to advance for several years, but opportunities are currently, and (we were told) will continue to be limited."
good,"Let me start by saying that all Apple Retail stores vary immensely. I was unfortunate enough to work at one in which the management team was very weak. There was almost no room for advancement within the company, and the lead manager was insistent on recruiting from outside the company to fill positions. This made it impossible to advance in the company. As a result, this company bleeds talent. If you work in the technician side of the house, prepare to be yelled at and screamed at by customers, and sometimes be made to eat your words by management after the customer asks to speak with them. The sales side is generally enjoyable, and stress free. Typically, you clock in, have a short meeting getting caught up on the day, then you are off to your role."
good,"Work is non stop, working with customers has its benefits. You meet some cool people. People tend to taker out their anger out on you quite a bit. My coworkers are some of the most amazing people I have ever met. I am still friends with most! Management has been subpar I never felt I was recognized for the things I have done well only what I could change."
good,"A lot of people are dead weight, but seem to have job security because they have been there a long time and know where the bodies are buried.  These people seem to have high influence as to what changes are implemented.  Because they want job security, they also don't want anything to change so that they can remain relevant.  I found this frustrating.  "
good,work is always serious and you learn everyday. management is good and very good workplace culture. the hardest part of the job is that the job is so intense and the most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly atmosphere
good,"Having a contract at Apple has its ups and downs, overall it was a great learning experience and I would recommend it to anyone trying to break into the tech industry. Because it was a contract gig, I couldn't really benefit from the job because after a year they make you leave for 90 days. Workplace culture was awesome and the campus is beautiful. My favorite part of the job is how Apple gives you offline time to get caught up on your emails and research for certain topics and past cases. Definitely a plus for job experience."
good,"Good company, good pay, a lot of new technology to work. I would recommend for anybody to work here with full confidence that their experience will be positive!"
good,Not a bad place to work as a contractor your not going to have all the benefits that a full time employee and benefits like insurance will vary depending on the separate plans that the company you are contracted through offer.
good,"Work/life balance is extremely difficult if you want to succeed in your career, and there isn't much guidance there. Culture is great though, youthful, fun employees and great perks."
good,"Most times i felt isolated as i was a home advisor. Not a very good work and personal life balance. Worked most weekends and during holidays. Very faced paced environment. Consistently learning and on going training. The hardest part would be lack of human interaction and consistently trying to meet the high metric standards of the business while working with not so happy customers. Can become mentally draining. Good thing is you are always busy, so never really bored and benefits were amazing."
good,"I loved my coworkers, they were friendly and encouraging. We had potlucks and really bonded with one another. I enjoy the labor a lot. I prefer at times to work by myself and improving skills. The work was challenging, there were not always cut clean answers but there was always a solution if you looked for it. Its a really independent base of operation. You have a lot of communication going on that's necessary for work flow efficiency. That was some of my issues with the upper management. I want to do my job to the best of my abilities, and all I need are the right tools. The management couldn't always be precise in what was expected or needed, which made it more difficult than it had to be. I still enjoyed my experience overall."
good,"No opportunity for advancement - true retail environment. Health benefits are great. If you need a decent retail job, this is answer. If you are looking for advancement, this is not the answer."
good,"The management style seems to be one of pointing you in a particular direction and then seeing how one can contribute.   There were always some well-defined jobs, but how the job was done was left to the individual.   I liked this very much."
good,"Apple culture nurtures ""out of the box"" thinking - allowing employees to work in an open friendly environment. Good company with great benefits. I would recommend Apple as a place to work"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Truly I am grateful to be able to work with an amazing company, full of amazing employees and generous benefits,  but it is time to move on from retail!"
good,It is a shame but it is easier to walk in from the outside in many cases than to move up internally. Work life is so so as there is little consideration given to employees when the company needs over time.
good,"The environment has changed over the years, but is still a good place to work. Over the past 10 years, Apple has gone through a growth spurt and has gone more corporate and less family oriented. Also, the one thing that was most important....the outsourcing of jobs and in-sourcing of contractors from other countries which affect our local economy. Especially, in Northern California's Bay Area which is very expensive to live."
good,very good  place to work some time like other jobs get a bad manager an it happens so be careful as you will tossed tween managers an ear one is different
good,Assisting my clients with Apple products and services was very rewarding to me. Apple is a great company that believes in their products and continue to lead the technology market.
good,"Pros"
good,"The company has a strong vision. It is very rewarding to work for a company that really thrives to make positive impacts on the way we live. Leadership has a very important responsibility to spread their words and help the big team, envision the future with Apple and empower each and every one of team members to maximise their talents to make this vision true. It requires a hard work to keep up in the company. Great place to learn leadership skills."
good,The greatest part of working with this company is the benefits. It is really hard to grow within the company. Its hard to balance both a life outside and inside of work because of the demands of the job sometimes.It is a very competitive workplace.
good,"Great place to learn about how to use technology in work, personal, and passion settings. Definitely values their culture and beliefs in customer service."
good,"Each day was filled with new experiences that helped build ones character and ability to adjust to an ever changing environment. "
good,Great place to work and awesome compensation for the age I was when I started. However advancement was long process and included minuscule pay increases. Management was awesome and friendly as well as most of the team I worked with.
good,"This job has been great so gain some experience in an industry setting. The work is interesting and you work with some really great people. Unfortunately, there is little job security as you are on 1-year contracts with few people being converted to full time employees. Would recommend to anyone moving to the area in need of work or GIS industry experience."
good,"This is a great company."
good,"its a very busy day everyday, dynamic but exhausting, i learned alot about the products and technologies it uses,team work and presenting the most satisfying customer service ever."
good,"La giornata inizia e finisce sempre con sorriso."
good,"Working with interesting people and sharing high end technologies. However, more pressure on multiple projects and shorter deadlines from management, creating imbalanced life style."
good,"Great, fast-paced remote environment. Difficult at times to find a path to ""climb the ladder."" Motivating and enthusiastic!"
good,I work from home and love the company and benefits that Apple provides for us. I am trying to get away from the work where you sleep job though as it can be hard to separate work and life when it's all done in the same building.
good,"Apple is very demanding and long hours are a must due to shear volume of work and debug required."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,I enjoyed my job at apple. I was promoted fairly quickly and I liked the fact that my hard work was quickly noticed. I enjoyed the people with whom I worked with.
good,"I think Apple is a great company but I had a higher standard in my mind. I saw a lot of mistakes that the company makes, I wish I had a more executive decision making, just enough to get rid of some inefficiency. 4-star overall."
good,"If you can handle working in a call canter, and then doing so from your home, there isn't a better company to do it for. How much you enjoy the job does depend on your manager though, if he's relaxed its great, if he's a micro manager it's terrible."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Working there is great for someone that starts or is looking for a part time position. I worked as a phone tech there and it's a very demanding, fast paced, high customer interaction environment. The customers can be rude at all times, be belligerent and sometimes nasty. But it's up to you to change that around. Your co-workers are the best, you will meet a lot of friendly people there. It's not hard to find friends. The company does have excellent start pay and great benefits. Some managers are cool, while others can be a pain. Get ready to be put through the ringer because the company has a reputation for great customer service. The customers there will remind you of such."
good,"Pro: Chat was available 24/7"
good,"Supportive co-workers, creative environment. I got to collaborate with many different department and learned a lot."
good,They underpay because they can and their structure is so conservative that employee input is pointless. I loved the people I worked with just not the leadership.
good,"Was micromanaged every day by management.  Awesome coworkers and great people."
good,"The benefits are fantastic and management actually cares about the wellbeing of all the advisors. While this may be the best example of a call center, it's still a call center. The pressure to maintain metrics is constantly there and every second of your shift is being recorded, counted, and scrutinized."
good,"Working from home for Apple is great, but there is a definite caste system that separates at-home workers from those in Austin and (even more so) Cupertino. That affects your opportunities for advancement. Management is extremely inconsistent, with remote employees moved from one manager's team to another randomly for no apparent reason (or at least none that is explained to the employees). The benefits are wonderful, and the pay is excellent compared to most support jobs. It is still a call center, though, and the schedules reflect that fact. "
good,"Working for Apple provided a lot of great benefits like phenomenal health insurance and a great on-site environment, however once you become familiar with the company's business structure it has all of the same problems as any other huge multinational company."
good,"The company has a very strong internal culture and networking system that requires the employee to embrace in order to succeed."
good,"I liked Apple a lot. I wished I could of stayed there longer, but there was some problems with the bosses and it didn't work out. They loved me from the first day I started."
good,One of the greatest companies to work for.. Very difficult to get in to this company as they look for certain types of people to fit the culture. This is really apparent when you are a minority applicant.
good,"While Apple is absolutely an amazing company to work for the culture can easily suck your soul dry. The expectation of being an individual is so demanding that every person has almost the same high stung personality. "
good,"Fantastic company however working in the At-home world had limitations to advancement and hours available for employment. "
good,"i learend alot of stuff over there and i developed my skills in english,computer and programs i enjoyed working in the warhouse abut unfortunately its a contract for a year .."
good,"drukke maar leuke job, via telefoon mensen helpen met problemen van computer"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Hardware Engineering department - Product Realization Lab we support all rapid prototyping for Product design. SAP invoicing / Filemaker Pro / EAM - Engineering Asset Management. "
good,"I am looking to get into management from engineering."
good,"Apple is great for people who are completely absorbed in the culture of Apple. It has great benefits and employees you encounter are relatively good to work with, however, you CAN NOT be unhappy at any point. If you are, stay home and all out sick. The management has no time for people who are not smiling constantly, or basically people who live in reality. The stress at the store is above normal for any job. The customers are extremely trying at times, so it is almost impossible to keep a happy, smiling demeanor. If you enjoy Apple products, you get a decent discount, but do not expect anything for free, ever, except for an occasional t-shirt or wrist band. All in all, I would say this job is a great stepping stone."
good,The work environment is extremely diverse and well cultured. The management is wonderful with a great quality of people and supervisory ethic.
good,"Very fun place to work! Amazing culture and great teammates- also great support from the company in general."
good,Converse with customers with the most accurate information about products. Count cash drawer to make sure amount matches sales.
good,"As a huge company the thought of getting easily lost in such a hive of activity is frightening, however Apple work closely with everyone of their employees to make them feel important. This works through feed back there is nothing you cannot say to anyone and it is this that keeps the team close on all levels of experience and management. The most enjoyable part of my day is meeting all kinds of different people and being able to connect with them and help enrich lives. The working environment can be difficult being one of the most relentlessly busy stores to be in and some customer interactions can be difficult. Apple makes it their mission to help you improve on a daily basis not only within a team but also on yourself."
good,"Apple is all about it's people. They take care of their employees. It is a great place to work."
good,"Busy day managing tickets and devices for an ever expanding site. Keeping abreast of new technologies to help you progress in your day to day work. "
good,"A typical day at work is usually busy, I've learned alot about apple products. Management was okay but could of been better, co-workers were nice for most of the part. Hardest part of the job is trying to stay busy when it's a slow day."
good,"Identified customers’ technical needs and recommended appropriate products"
good,"I never knew there were so many tips and tricks the iphone had, i thought i knew everything that the iphone had to offer but i was wrong, so many shortcuts to make it easier to use."
good,"If you are passionate about the company, is a great experience looks great in your resume and open doors. But low life balance. Many many many hours standing but the flexibility of Apple is one that you would not come across very often, tattoos, piercing, flip flops and very lay back clothing, colorful hair and you are not judge by appearance, I mean personal care is a plus, but very open about your looks, which I love... The only downside is that to get a transfer within the company is like been re-hired again, is very difficult and sometimes you wonder if is easier to quit and apply in another store or hold on tight. Different stores different management and the Millenia store in Orlando FL has the BEST management team. The store leader is exceptional and he is loved by many."
good,Since I was in a Global role this required early morning and late evenings.  Typically lots of meetings and conference calls to gather user requirements and intense sprints to meet deliverables.  In my case my manager was under qualified but the co-workers and rest of management team were excellent.
good,"I enjoy working at Apple Child Care Center "
good,"Organisation des plannings de formation"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"High Traffic, Constant learning on the go and adapting to new products and technology. Fixing software issues of all kind on the flow. Fast paced work environment. Amazing coworkers, talented group of people."
good,"Constantly learning and being supported, working with customers to find perfect solution, management is always there for support, and coworkers are essential tools to do my job."
good,Excellent pay! The management was not always available. I felt as though I was constantly worried that I was going to get terminated. The metrics were almost impossible.
good,fun to work for apple. No hard and fast rules. But lot of physical and computer network security.
good,"It starts with meetings and ends with calls with offshore team."
good,"A typical day involved many different duties including troubleshooting and customer service.  This was a fun work environment that had a very relaxed culture.  Management was decent for the most part and my co-workers were a pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of my was the in depth troubleshooting, but was also my favorite because of the challenge that it provided me with, along with the sense of accomplishment."
good,"A typical day at work involves supporting customers by answering their technical questions, repairing computers - managing repairs.  I work with a group of highly motivated individuals that focus on the customer journey.  The hardest part of my job is when I have deliver unwanted news to a customer.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people."
good,Income and benefits were great...Very demanding. Would work here again. Don't recommend if you have a demanding home life.
good,"This is the best sales job I've ever had in my life. Great products, innovative designs. They have it all."
good,"Networking is key."
good,"- very good working environment"
good,"As a Creative a typical day of work is one where we teach customers as part of the One to One network how to use their compeers or software. In my case, I deal with not only basic Mac teaching and training but in Pro Software such as Final Cut Pro (v7 and X) and Aperture. We are taught to be patient and nurturing with the clients, since many are learning the software or hardware for the very first time. "
good,"- Lots of new work"
good,"社内の風通しは良いと思う。"
good,Fantastic place to work before finding an actual career. No advancement.
good,"Overall working at Apple is great, although it is hard for advancement."
good,Great place to work..fun environment...energy levels are high and very dynamic
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Lot of innovative interaction, fun, but always room for improvement"
good,The job itself was awesome. The coworkers really fed into the culture of the company. Management was friendly but didnt really have a grasp on the products we sold. The hardest part of the job was advancement because it was based on peer relationships with management.
good,"Covent Garden is Apple’s flagship store and the largest in the world.  I was hired as one of the 300 staff chosen from over 4000 applicants.  During my time with Apple, I have had many varied roles."
good,"As far as retail goes, Apple is the best it gets. Great benefits and amazing colleagues make it a great place to work. Hard to grow from within the company or have creative input on daily operations, but teaches transferrable skills that are valuable in all workplaces and in life at large."
good,"Very busy stressful environment, yet fulfilling and rewarding to work for a top notch company."
good,"Daily provide updates to the production ctb for the daily planning meeting.  New product launches were always exciting, lots of hussel, team work, making sure shipment arrived and delivered on time. Any revision to product was tracked. I loved that in inventory environment was controlled, great inventory management."
good,"I had worked well with everybody in all aspects of the company. In example I worked well with management, computer techs, smartphone techs, and logistics. I learned how to work with C.D.M.A., Q.o.S. also benchmarking various devices. Such as iMacs, Hard Drives, Monitors, iPhones, Ipods, Ipads; just to name a few. I was awarded several awards for quality of service also for work performance. The enjoyable part about this job was the company, what I brought to the company excellent work ethics, desired to learn, ability to work well with my team, acknowledge to assist team members on various projects."
good,"Great place to work and meet fantastic people. Apple gives you the tools for the best training and development, hard job if you are not familiar with retail, easy job if you love people and Apple products."
good,"I worked for four years at the Apple Store and during this time I worked in many roles, from shifting boxes, to training customers and staff as a senior mentor at the store. I learnt new things on a daily basis, but one of the most important things I learnt was to allow people the opportunity to talk, to listen and then how to offer advice as needed. Learning when to talk instead of listening is the hardest part of any customer service role. For the last two years I was behind the Genius bar fixing, and exchanging broken or faulty iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad. It was rewarding, but also intensely challenging. Not every customer was happy to be there, and as the face of a company it was often hard to stay upbeat. The people at the store are absolutely first rate. You will never meet a group of people more motivated and inspiring. They are the reason I stayed so long. The best part of working at an Apple Store is when you get to train people to use there shiny new computer. They genuinely enjoy coming to the store to learn new things and to finish projects etc. We would learn faces and names and see them through their entire year. That was the most rewarding part of any job I have had so far."
good,This was a very demanding job during holidays but was a fun place to work.  This was a transitional job for me but still have friends that work there.
good,"Apple retail is a great place to work while in college and looks good on your resume. If you are looking for a long term career, however, look somewhere else."
good,Busy and mostly managed well but always a few bad people in charge. They take care of you to a degree if you like the toys and are in the cult. If you are a hipster it's great.
good,Apple is a really fast-paced work environment. You can feel and see the energy from people around you. It is a well-made and well-maintained work environment where it supports its employee to be as productive as possible.
good,"Meeting our targets,working hard.Learned to be compassionate,and have patience in the work field i did.Our management was motivating us all the time.We had fun at work and supported each other,we worked as a team to meet our targets.The most hardest part of the job was having to go home with meeting our targets and working overtime.The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with our clients and building a trust between us"
good,This is an awesome company. You have an opportunity to work with some of the most talented and amazing staff. The retail hours during product launches and holidays are long a challenge. The company holds customer service as a priority and makes helping customers a positive experience and not a job.
good,"Apple cares about its employee's well-being as being vital to the company's success and growth. The employees are the best part of the company. Lots of amazing personalities and lots of creativity abound. While the atmosphere is fast-paced, the company takes care of its employees with extra time off, great benefits, and lunches during the busy seasons. The employee discount is great too!"
good,"Apple is the Grand Central station of the retail world; hundreds of people visit the store each day. Apple customers want answers -- correct answers to complicated questions. The company has impressive products that work well and leap off the shelves, but Apple doesn't pay their employees in a compensatory manner when compared to the information the employees are responsible for. Great place to work if you have another job and enjoy learning about technology."
good,"This is probably one of my favourite jobs I've had. The work environment was super friendly. You walk and are instantly greeted by your coworkers. The managers know your name specifically as well as your attributes. There are tons of opportunity to get into different aspects of the store such as becoming a technician or a trainer. The hardest part of any given day would be helping customers who were against buying an Apple product. Sometimes people were irate or even hostile towards you, but you learn how to diffuse the situation after awhile. Overall, it was a good experience and I learned a lot."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Remember to be yourself character counts a lot at Apple!"
good,Apple's culture is one of the best I've ever experienced. The best part is the people you work next to on a day to day basis. You make some great friends and relationships for life.
good,"lots of benefits and training and learning opportunities"
good,"If you are looking for a job that can help you grow and develop your leadership skills, Apple is a great starting point. This job is very different than other retail locations, so do not go in to this job with the idea of ""selling""."
good,"As the company culture shift changed, so did the enjoyment to work there.  It went from being a customer driven sales company, to more go a big box sales pitch store.  It's unfortunate, but when Jobs died, so did Apple Retail"
good,Apple is a great place to work. There is a culture that is contagious. The only problem with the place is that advancement is very difficult and you can be paid 3-4 times as much to do the exact same job.
good,"I honestly think I would have stayed if they were more considerate to my health. I wasn't able to get certain documentation in on time and for the reason, I ended up losing the best career I""ve had in years. I would still recommend the job to others, but I wish they were more considerate to their employees. Especially those with religious beliefs."
good,"I'd recommend anyone with a strong personality and good charisma work to there. It's not for the faint of heart. The products sell themselves, be prepared for all types of customer interactions."
good,This company constantly has changes and makes it adaptable to work with and for.  Would love more flexibility in work schedules but standard shift bid process. Management varies based on the team you are placed on and how much experience in the position the manager has.
good,"Les plus : Belle culture d'entreprise, environnement stimulant et formateur, bons profils à manager. "
good,"Apple tells you they do retail differently, but I didn’t see that to be the case. It’s still retail—supply and demand. BUT I loved the customers’ loyalty to the brand. The customer was the best part of the job. I had some terrific managers as well. "
good,"I found it quite difficult to balance work/ life however Apple provides set hours which can provide peace of mind. Training is intense - but definitely well thought out. I felt slightly lost when I was finally on the shop floor but Team Members were really helpful. I feel that recently there's been a push to hire members from diverse backgrounds which is needed. But Apple were really fair to all who applied. Really surprised by how professional and well-thought out every aspect of the Apple store/ service is. Definitely give props to management! I learnt to take initiative and deal with irate customers while working alongside other departments of the Apple store (Genius Bar etc..). Felt kind of out of place at the beginning but then started to slowly get to know more of the team members (who are really nice!). Probably the hardest is balancing work and being a student - the job can also be overwhelming at times during busy periods and some customers can be impatient. Also, learning about the financing options was tricky at the beginning but became easier over time. The most enjoyable part was talking to customers and learning about why they were buying a certain product. This job has really built my confidence and to be hired by such an incredible company has really raised my standards. Definitely recommend working here."
good,"Typical day at work: Time goes fast since you do a lot during the shift."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits and fun coworkers. Could still use some work in management at some locations and compensation for what each person does."
good,"It helps build your skills since you can opt for projects. "
good,"Fun place overall, work balance is okay could be better when wanting time off. Management can be a hit or a miss when it comes to certain stores. Overall, its a good place to meet people etc."
good,"Its a call center where you spend your time taking calls for people that need technical and non technical support for their Apple products. It sounds like one would need a lot of experience beforehand to get the position but they actually provide all the training necessary to work the phones during the three week training period. The lessons are very straightforward and the training instructors were very helpful."
good,"Good company but you need to know someone to advance. Always have their ideal candidate, difficult to grow. No matter how good you are or what degree you have they only promote their people."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Good place to work but the work load is extremely high. The workload is why I ended up not accepting a permanent offer, you need to come to terms that you will never get ahead of the work load and just accept the high amount of work or projects you will receive."
good,"Being a job taken from home on a VPN with a MAC sent to you by Apple, the training was great through interactive chat rooms utilizing webcams and headsets."
good,"The only constant thing in Apple is changing. You will hear this lot, but sadly, Apple is changing to a way it should not be. Apple used to be a place to enrich people's life, bring innovation to industry, making the word better place than we found it. But now, Apple is all about sell iPhone, Apple Care. Create new iPhone ownership means do not repair, trade in you old device, even it is broken, no problem, we want to you buy a new one. No money, no problem, do activation, XR free, you pay monthly. And don't forget, everyone needs Apple Care, literary everyone! When Apple lower itself to BestBuy and Walmart, it lost everything. "
good,I loved working from home for Apple. It was great not to have to travel back and forth to an office.The trainings were paid for and helped prepare me for the phone consults. We had regular team meetings via FaceTime where we could ask questions of our manager or team members. We could also reach out during calls through chats.
good,"The environment is clean and organized but ever changing. Teams and friends may work down the hall for months and get moved. You may move 3 or 4 times a year depending on what they want to do with you and your skills. Break rooms have fresh coffee machines, water and refrigerators. The cafeteria has many food and drink options to accommodate most diet. They also have regular moral events such as food truck days and beer bashes. You might get lucky and have a schedule that lets you attend these events. "
good,As a company apple is not afraid to take risks and explore new ideas. The partnership between design and engineering is what makes the company's products special.
good,The job is great in general. I've seen alot of things change since leadership has changed hands in retail. With declining sales there is more pressure sometimes to hit certain goals. That being said it is a good place if you need a stop over job or you're in college. This isn't a cure all for all ills if you're trying to find a career.
good,"Apple has many benefits and perks, such as stock, product discounts, full pay for bereavement, jury duty, etc. There is a very positive and inclusive culture at Apple. This is a company that some may find appealing enough to make into a career."
good,"They need to allocate morr training to Technical Specialists "
good,"A typical work day for me involves conducting one-on-one coaching sessions with my direct reports, to evaluate performance and discuss goals to fight for excellent performance. Apple encourages innovation and creativity when suggestion process improvements and changes, as well as driving performance. I spend time evaluating surveys from our Developers, as well as creating evaluations of interactions between Developers and my direct reports. I facilitate a team meeting weekly. It is frequent that I assist my peers with various projects, to include interviewing candidates for opportunities within  my line of business. The most enjoyable part of my job is motivating my direct reports to perform, and celebrating those successes when goals are accomplished."
good,"Really enjoyed my time here, love Apple technology so it was easy to talk about and express true excitement for products.  downside was as a part time employee, schedules would fluctuate and getting Full time was difficult."
good,"with larger support groups the benefits and scheduling options are plentiful."
good,"-Great benefits "
good,"Great team, not so great managers. It was difficult to move up if you were not on their preferred list. They would promote based on employee favoritism more than capability and qualifications."
good,"My experience working at Apple was great. I was able to learn a lot about customer service during my time there, having worked in the flagship store in New York City."
good,"A typical day at work includes finding the perfect solution for any customer's given situation. Whether this includes technical assistance, product knowledge, or the sale of products. I've learned a lot about myself working here. One of the most important skills is being able to function efficiently inside of a loud, stressful environment while providing the best customer service in the industry. Apple has impacted my life in a way that words cannot describe."
good,"Great benefits, very tough work/life balance though"
good,"Apple is a great place to work. You have a friendly and helping environment. The culture here is welcoming to all! I have had opportunity to grow and learn, but did have to pave my own path to do so."
good,"Apple is a good company to work for in alot of ways, but it needs to not forget it's roots. They had a solid culture that is going away more and more since Steve Jobs passed. I worked under Steve and Mr. Cook. It used to be employee centric because Apple understood that if you take care of employees they will take care of the customers. Now it's metrics centric which in the short term helps a customer, but in the long term it effects the way a customer is treated. "
good,Cool place to work with really smart folks aligned to deliver an exceptional customer experience.  Customer is always first and the teams are focused on exceeding expectations.
good,"There is very little downtime at work. There are too many call outs and constant turnover. Veteran employees have to learn working styles of new employees and repeat daily processes. The workplace culture is far from professional. Management can be supportive, but don't trust the employees they hired. Too much micromanaging. Hardest part of the job is trying to absorb new technology in an open and loud space. The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie."
good,Each day offered new challenges. We were allowed to work independently on our projects. The project managers and SME's were always helpful when I encountered issues or had questions. I was able to learn new programs and methodologies that will help me in the future. The culture is fun and diverse with many types of people.
good,"Work environment is generally good. Everyone must think and vote the same on cultural issues, making you feel like everyone is brainwashed on politics and culture."
good,"Apple is increasingly trying to do more work with less resources.  In the finance arena, management hires from outside of Apple are damaging the culture.  Increased focus on metrics and decreased focus on individuals has created a much more stressful and less content environment."
good,"My time with Apple was rewarding and fulfilling for the entirety of my tenure, however, it is not without its faults. "
good,"- How to provide various solutions based on customized problems "
good,Would work there again - just needed more hours at the time.  Enjoyed the group I worked with.  Nice option with more than one store to work at in the city.
good,"I got  good training and they gave me time to be able to start working on my own, shadowing at the begging then reverse shadowing an at the end going solo.  Some stress, some situations can be difficult. Work as fast as possible then there were times when you can really focus in the client ."
good,"Fun place to work and learn what career path you may want to take. Exceptional benefits, but advancement does not happen quickly. Managers are hit or miss, I've mostly had good ones but seen unqualified people promoted to supervisor positions as well."
good,"I've for the most part enjoyed working with apple. The biggest gripes I had were when after a time and being trained to support one product you were ""promoted"" ( not an actual promotion no pay increase or choice in the matter ) to support other products with minimal training before continuing to support not only the product you were hired to support but basically every product or service apple offers. Started on ios devices like iphone ipad ipod, then without the same amount of training they put in for teaching us to support the iOS devices we were thrown into support computer systems ie their macs. Same thing after that with even shorter training to then support the Airport apple devices and apple tv. So just without the choice and no warning ahead of time having to support all these things that alot of people had little to no actual experience with themselves without the smallest incentive of a pay bump or at least the option to stay at current pay and support certain products."
good,"Great place to work. Great people,perks and benefits."
good,"great benefit, healthcare and volunteering opportunity organised by employees. "
good,"The job is fast paced and can be fun. The benefits are amazing, especially for part-time workers. This is a great job for a college student as they offer great college reimbursement benefits."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Teleperfomance on the other hand is slightly less than ideal...."
good,"A typical day at work in Executive relations is Responding to inquiries directed to  Executives, often involving challenging and sensitive related concerns or situations. Providing root cause solutions and ensuring internal/external investigations are completed with compassion and adhering to privacy legislation."
good,"Great place to work, as a temporary employee. Not necessarily my career path so i did not last too long, however it was a great experience and most of the managers are amazing."
good,"I work for Apple for almost 2 years. I generally really liked working for Apple. Helping engineers fix bugs was always a nightmare, and beats are terrible"
good,WFH through kelly services .. a lot of overtime was available. They provided all the equipment needed for the position. High call volume during peak seasons like iphone release dates.
good,"As far as tech jobs go, Apple is one of the highly-coveted places to land. You'll do good work, but just know that the competitive landscape is weak compared to other destinations in Silicon Valley."
good,Typical day at work consisted of help desk type support fo 8 out of 10 hours worked. I learned how to work remotely and keep motivation. Management was great for a long time but fell apart quickly once a new manager was assigned.
good,"Apple brings upon itself multiple types of individuals, those that stand out in a crowd and those that do not. Apple made it possible for me to learn and continue to grow as an individual. The customers were mostly down to earth and you as a team member are given the tools you need through training before you hit the sales floor."
good,"I was with Apple for almost 4 years. I worked as a Specialist for 2.5 years and had the opportunity to relocate in another province to work as Technical Specialist where I worked for a year."
good,"I stayed at Apple for the people, the culture, and the products. However, if you have aspirations for anything administrative of want professional development that doesn't involve computers (i.e. HR, culture building, employee engagement, etc) this job isn't for you. They are really interested in developing you if you love computers and technology only. There isn't room for management or admin because realistically, the people in those positions will die there. It's a great gig to have for a short while and you'll make great friends, but it's not a place for internal customer lovers like me who want to add more tone a part of the culture foundation and not just another smiling face in the crowd that is Apple."
good,This company has provided me with a backbone of knowledge to help me grow. The benefits they afforded me have been paramount in my believe and strength within the company.
good,Mis-managed from the middle. Oten talent was overlooked by middle-management. Youth was often preferred over experience.  More high profile work was sourced to youth rather than experienced talent.
good,"a way to get into IT"
good,"Nice company to work for. Compensation is better than most places. Overall people are friendly. Attendance and friendliness is important. "
good,Always Challenging to your skills in apple. Daily you are going to Office and a new technical challenge is in your bucket which helps us to Improve our skills.
good,Apple has a fast-paced working environment and result-driven working culture. It is a good place to advance one's skill...............................
good,fosters creativity and individuals. not much flexibility when it comes to scheduling outside of school schedules. experience very dependent on manager
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Overall it was a great job with amazing perks. I could work from home, pay and benefits were great, & coworkers and the company were fantastic. It is very fast-paced and stressful though, and work/life balance doesn't always work out, even if you are working from home. Customers could also be very demanding, and not very amenable. I would consider going back, all in all."
good,"you learn so much working here, even from the interview process (personally it took 4 interviews for me to get it but that may have changed over the past couple of years). they definitely could pay more considering how much the company makes/is worth as well as how much the products are"
good,Had a decent time working from home. Always changing products and policy means roles can change at any moment. Didn't love constantly changing management.
good,Apple was a great company to work for. I met many influencial people. It was a hard decision to leave after 6 years with an amazing team. I had the opportunity to work in office and transitioned to mainly telelwork. A downfall is that I learned this company is about who you know to advance further in your career. The hardest part of the job was working from home and applying for other positions when management doesn't see you on a day to day basis.
good,"Company shares same progressive values and promotes an open, diverse, feedback culture. It's truly one of the ""good"" corporate companies out there. Probably the best. Culture is not always  reflected by retail management. There is no effort to recruit retail employees for corporate jobs despite the fact that retail is the bread and butter of the company. You may put in the time and give 200%, but sometimes it leads to nowhere."
good,fun place to work. the staff there is great. you meet a bunch of great people while getting to work with great technology. it was a perfect job to gain experince when I was finishing school
good,"Super busy with lots of customers.  Learn to work with creative people and collaborate with them to accomplish various goals and solve problems.  The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with customers, especially the nice ones, and the hardest part is working in a retail setting and dealing with unhappy customers."
good,"Apple was a great company to work for great compensation, remote working, team building. The only down side was that many of the customers were rude or had unfix-able problems at least on the Technical Support side."
good,"The benefits are great, employees have many options when it comes to benefits. Enjoy working for a company that invests in development of each employee who would like to learn and grow."
good,"As retail jobs go, Apple is probably one of the best.  The hours are horrible (like any retail job) and Apple Stores can be really, really loud places to work.  Your coworkers are the best part of your job - they are eclectic and come from everywhere.  You will make life-long friends at Apple, but jumping from Apple Retail to Corporate is very hard, the hours are long, and customers can be the best or  the worst - you'll change a customer's life in an hour by solving a work problem they had no idea they could resolve on their own and the next customer is yelling at you for selling them a $3000 laptop that doesn't work (which just happened to fall into the pool, but they'll never admit to it).  The stock option plans and health benefits are amazing - especially for same-sex couples.  People also like the discounts that Apple extends to employees, but I view them as necessary since pay tends to be great for retail, but horrible for technical or skilled positions."
good,"It was an excellent time working for Apple however poor management and questionable rules, ethics, and procedures make the experience difficult to appreciate."
good,"The job is very demanding and you have to be at your best 24/7, 365. I gets pretty taxing after a while. Depending on the leadership team, asking for time off can be treated like stealing. That being said, I was there for over a decade and I learned a lot as a leader."
good,"As a sales specialist you are here to educate and provide the ultimate retail sales experience for the customers; you assist by putting products in the customers hands, finding out what their needs and passions are, what product is best suited for them."
good,"Apple was a good place for me to work while I was in college and in graduate school. Many people I worked with were actively perusing a career as a producer, actor, or photographer, so working at Apple kept them grounded as they reached for their dreams. The hours were pretty flexible, and the pay was fair."
good,"Enjoyed learning the Apple products and processes."
good,"Work place was very relaxed but we did take lots of calls "
good,The organization doesn't know what its doing. It needed bodies so it hires and hires and then doesn't know what to do with the people it hires. We coach and try to help but then when it doesn't work out they try to push you out. The company just sees numbers not necessarily extenuating circumstances.
good,Contract position held under NDA. Good job but not many benefits being a contractor. Supervisors are great but have little interaction with their employees.
good,"We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital."
good,"WORKED on a 3 x 12cycle shift. A general operativeon a production line  working in accordance to a strict safe operating procedure .Good manufacturing practices ,attention to detail, team player, ISO regulations, Health and Safety."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Job itself is great, however still retail hours which are all over the place. No consistency. Apple Suburban square. My immediate manager was great however management overall wasn't that great. Quick burnout and employees didn't seem supported. Favoritism seemed to happened when promotions happened. Interesting environment. Yet still one of the best retail experiences and that was mostly due to the people."
good,I learned a lot while working for apple. I was extensively cross-trained on nearly every service Apple offers and eventually became a Senior Advisor. The training was good and very thorough. The benefits were great and management was very knowledgable. Employees seemed to have positive attitudes and worked well together as a team.The hardest part of the job was working two chats at the same time to resolve two separate customers very different issues. The best part of the job was being able to work from home and see my kids so much.
good,"I actually was employed through Kelly Services and not Apple so this my be a bit misleading.  However, I did the same job (AppleCare Technical Support Representative) that Apple direct employees did.  I worked from home with a great deal of freedom and I enjoyed the job, helping customers and troubleshooting issues."
good,"Worked as a contractor at Apple, Inc. Typical workflow is stable, if somewhat repetitive. Management generally responds quickly to any questions and concerns."
good,"Overall, Apple is a cool company to work for. In retail, the hours can be a pro or con. It's nice to have a random day off in the week when you need it, but not having weekends is a drag sometimes. The benefits are great, but the pay doesn't usually match the cost of living of areas stores are located. For the most part customers are pleasant, but we put up with a fair amount of entitled and rude people from day to day which can be draining. You don't have to know too much about the products or be super ""techie"" to start; on-the-job training and learning through experience is usually sufficient. Coworkers come from a variety of backgrounds and are generally very supportive of one another. The work environment is inclusive. Uniform is simple, provided, comfortable. Every day is different depending on your role and due to constantly changing services and new products you are always learning. Customer service experience at the store and feedback-driven culture will provide lifelong transferrable skills."
good,"Learning the iPhone iOS software in and out was nice, not many phone problems nowadays."
good,"Apple is a very pro-employee company; they place their advisors equal with their customers. However, a good deal of the managers did not properly follow that policy. This made the job more stressful than it needed to be."
good,Apple is a place Ike no other. It is a very fun place to work that allows for a very relaxed dress code and allows you to ignite your passions and help customers ignite theirs
good,"Very intense work place; great performers can’t always advance in their careers as there’s too much competition. "
good,"Shifts are from 4-9hrs long. "
good,"Worked as a remote advisor in the college program. It was a fast paced environment with intense training and a high level of competition. Fantastic benefits and good work culture. Clear paths for advancement, though it was not in my intended career field."
good,A very competitive fast paced company that there is not one day the same.  I would recommend ensuring you have a work life balance as it is very easy to become consumed in your work.
good,This is a challenging work environment with lots of excess hours required to succeed.  The visibility and fast pace makes this challenging to get a good footing when joining a team.
good,I worked here over 6 years ago and I know it's changed since then. I started in the sales area but moved to the tech area where I had a chance to learn how to fix mobile devices. It was fun but I couldn't imagine going back due to the sheer volume of the types of devices.
good,"Fun, fast- paced work environment. Fun work perks like ""Beer Bash"" days at the main campus (free food & beer/ wine, occasionally with a performer & games. Can come with lots of leeway on how you get the job done, but also have strict & short deadlines that must be met."
good,"Apple was a great experience and place to work, it was a typical call center, fast paced and all about numbers. As long as you meet standards you were good."
good,"Worked in Application Support team as contractor, not an ideal place for consulting. Growth prospects minimal, too many hierarchies, VM policies prevent hiring best talent/discouragement."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Apple is a extremely fast pace company that expects excellence from its employees. The company and departments continuously celebrated good results.  Very proud of their products and customer base. Unique high quality products and high margins was key to Apple's success. Great high-tech company.
good,"Always providing new products with advanced technology that sets apart from competitors. "
good,"Great opportunity, training was excellent and staff was always available...I can always go back to work for them but I want to obtain experiences to advance my career"
good,great environment . stressful due to how busy it gets. overall apple treats you better then most retail jobs. hard to move up in company sometimes false promises are made and can be very discouraging.
good,At fifth avenue the culture has changed tremendously and not for its employees unfortunately. The work life balance is no longer beneficial component.
good,"Creative, works well independently and a team settings are good, supportive and fun place to work. Always enjoyed working around manager and supervisor, always encouraging workers,"
good,Being a manager with Apple was like working with handcuffs on when it came to knowing and having access to the financial information needed to educate the team on what products were profitable to the company and beneficial to the customer.
good,"The work flow at AppleCare was simple, the structure was well laid out; however the training was terrible and pretty much set you up for failure. I was willing to do the work until I had an issue with leadership. You will be micromanaged. Overall, it was a pretty decent job, but paid at half the market value for similar work."
good,"I would much rather not saying anything specific. That is a conversation that should be held one on one, in a private type situation. 17 more letters."
good,"I look after a team of 26, chefs, kp and CA , I have 5000 people in apple whom we try to capture in my men style and food trends, I have learned a lot in the management side of the organisation and how to manage people."
good,Fun Company! Always something new to learn. Overall job role was repetitive. Room to advance if you are one of the top performers. Incentives to do we'll everyday were there.  The hardest part was finding time after a full day to leave the house. Waking up where you work can get lonesome but it is also pretty fun.
good,"Fue una experiencia que a nivel profesional me enriqueció mucho, donde aprendí a desarrollar mi primera campaña de ventas a nivel nacional con grandes cuentas."
good,"A typical day at work can be stressful, but fun and challenging. I have learned a great deal of new information/experience while being there.  The management was and has been fair to some extent. The hardest part of the job is to maintain customers satisfaction on a daily basis. The most enjoyable job is meeting new people and making new memories there."
good,The job was a great job. I learned more and more everyday and I was so happy to go to work. I had great Mangers and supervisors that didn't hold back knowledge to help me succeed. The tasks were pretty easy and they moved quickly. Everyone worked together to make a great team.
good,I enjoyed working from home but it did get a little boring. Being a Senior Advisor is a lot of work and it is very demanding. I felt stagnant and it is very hard to move up from that position.
good,"Apple was a wonderful place to work. The culture was probably the best part. It was hard work, but it felt like it had purpose. The benefits were amazing, but the pay was not heavily competitive in my department. As time has gone on, Apple became more corporate feeling than it was 10 years ago. I'd still go back, though. The career development and overall leadership experience offered was excellent!"
good,"For a retail job, it is the best option out there. Retail work is generally unrewarding and stressful which can be tiresome. I found Apple a fine company to work for. As a sales specialist I was not pressured to meet a quota, and as an inventory specialist I was given the tools I needed to maintain a healthy inventory."
good,I worked there for 6 years and I saw the culture drastically change for the worse in that time. The stores were run like a family and were very fun to work in. All these changes to a platform that wasnt broken were taken to imporve but didnt really do much
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Good company but extra working hours. there no work and family time balance , Good pay, lot of new technology to  work ,I will recommend  to join apple"
good,Nice place to work. Good benefits. Nice people. Good advancement opportunities. Constant on the job and off the job training provided. Good management.
good,"When I first started at Apple, it was great.  The people were friendly and I loved everything about job.  Things changed for the worse in the future.  I wasn't happy, there was tons of micromanagement, full-time position wasn't guaranteed, for the most part my hard work went unnoticed, and overall I've noticed that the culture and feel of it started to dwindle slowly but surely.  I left the company looking to find other opportunities."
good,I had a moderately good time at Apple. Its a very big company and a person like me sometimes feel lost. The company makes great products that was something good to feel about.
good,"A typical day at work as a Technical Specialist consists of helping customers with Genius Bar appointments, creating/checking people in for their appointments, or delivering completed repairs. I learned how to deal with people of all temperaments, backgrounds, abilities, and ages while providing excellent and timely customer service and technical support. The management team at my specific store definitely had some opportunities for growth in terms of scheduling and team building. The workplace culture among your peers is unlike any other work environment, but in the best way possible. Apple retail probably has the best retail workplace culture of any retailer in the world. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and the selection process for employee promotions. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends and being able to rely on a phenomenal support system of your peers."
good,"Decent job easy to maintain recieve incoming calls regarding apple products provide assistance over the phone to help troubleshoot software issues, schedule appointments to the store if necessary."
good,It's difficult work but it's reward to assist customer who love the company so much and makes up for some of the difficult calls and issues you face day to day.
good,Challenging place to work but rewarding. Best part of the job was engaging people in Apples technology and showcasing it through demonstration. The most challenging part of the job was the amount of people you had to help each day.
good,A great job for college students seeking sales experience. However management tend to be bias and had their favorites on who they wanted to promote regardless of sales abilities.
good,"Typically a day consist of taking on new customers and reaching out to the standing customers already with me. As a Sr. Advisor my interaction with my customers is fun, educational and in a lot of ways life impacting. The ability to make such a deep impact on someones life. By being there and resolving their technical issues. I a really good feeling. I have learned so much. Not just the breadth of the OS X , MacOS and iOS operating systems. But also how to interface with others. So as to guide them in the learning of the very same. The workplace culture is actually quite rich. The technicians and the customers have a unique bond with Apple devices joining them. The hardest part of the job is telling a customer that they have lost everything due to the lack of security settings on their account. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction and relationships forged with my customers."
good,"I very much liked working for apple. I have never revived as much flexibility for scheduling in my whole life. For anyone that is trying to get there foot in the door as a customer service rep, I would suggest working for apple"
good,"It's a nice job to have, good benefits. Scheduling sucks if you're a full-time employee. It's difficult to balance your personal life because of this ."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Minacs Peterborough, especially in Tier 2 CPU. I met many people I will remain friends with for the rest of my life. The work can be demanding and difficult and the customers unruly, but it was one of the best jobs I've ever quit."
good,"Overall a wonderful company to work for, hard work/life balance. Great benefits, get to work with a multitude of teams and peers, and have a fun time doing your job."
good,"A typical day at work would include building a relationship with consumers, as well as providing world class customer service. Depending on the needs of the job i would also have to assist in troubleshooting devices."
good,"It's a great company to work for in certain regards, however, there are times where you will be sacrificing your free time to please management in order to move ahead. "
good,"As long as you realize you are not moving up as a career, then this is a perfect part time job. They pay pretty well relatively and the culture is great from management to peers."
good,Great Opportunity to work from home. A lot of opportunity to advance but the hours are late. No many benefits starting off until 2nd year of employment.
good,"THis is a great company to work, there are many benifits however there if a feeling of being stuck when you get passed over for roles. A couple of nice comments go a long place in this place."
good,"It's all about a can do attitude. When going through training they really push a ""you're part of something bigger than yourself"" vision. Once you drink the ""apple juice"" as we call it, you're hooked. It's easy to loose your work/life balance when you're working from home, when you're in a store or on-campus it's a little bit easier to leave work at work."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Excelente empresa, muito importante no mercado de trabalho e é responsável em todos seus quesitos."
good,Positive experience working for the company that is on the leading edge of technology...There is not much room for advancement as people have a tendency to sty forever once the get hired
good,"There is much to learn at Apple for the first 2-4 years. After that, the work can get repetitive and unrewarding. The management structure is unique and not necessarily for the better. It can be difficult to work with other teams when you don't have something they want. The enjoyment comes from seeing the successful integration of your work into actual products such as iPhones, etc."
good,"No days off, poor raises, poor security, very strict, no grace period, no bonuses, but they will pay you for double-time and they do have good health coverage"
good,"Good bult extremely challenging learned new things people were"
good,"I worked as a Senior Advisor with Applecare. Providing a higher level of customer service to all Apple customers globally but mainly in the United States."
good,"I learned how to take and apply written feedback that was given by other Fraud Prevention Specialist. In previous jobs, feedback was given face to face."
good,For retail it is different then any other retail. Benefits are good. It is almost like a second family working at Apple. Easy to understand coworkers.
good,"Professional and diverse workplace where you can meet people from all cultures and backgrounds, however in most jobs there is no much space for development within the company."
good,"It is an enjoyable company to work for, but the salary is not competitive. Job advancement, however, is very competitive."
good,Working at apple was a pleasure to me but the inflexibility caused issues balancing work and personal life.  While the benefits provided were above and beyond the possessive culture made me uncomfortable.
good,I look forward to coming to work everyday. The job is challenging. My managers are very helpful and easy to work with. I like my work hours that require me waking up early but I have most of the afternoons to myself.
good,"Apple is a great place to work and try to keep things fun. Apple teaches you amazing skills and concepts, and training is always available when needed. Apple taught we how to handle very heated customers. The culture doesn't exclude anyone in the workplace making you fell comfortable. The benefits are some of the best in the world. Apple hasn't been offering as much room to move up in the chain of command and that is one downside as they have been hiring externally."
good,"I've worked 5 years at Apple Retail, Amsterdam. Customer Focus was a skill we trained on a daily basis, which I loved the most. If there's anything I love about a job, it is the connection with other people. Besides the great products we offered, it was very satisfying to see things come together from the day I started working. "
good,"Answered phones for iOS and Mac+ troubleshooting. "
good,Company is nice to work for from home bug not enough room for advancement. If you just want a 9 to 5 with good benefits it is just fine.
good,"Very great training program. I was also trained on how to troubleshoot Windows platform software, which was awesome, being that Windows software utilized Apple itunes software."
good,"Very team orientated would start the day with the group of people who just came in. Give us a break-down of how the day has been and what goals sales should achieve. Separately the technical team would speak as well about repairs and how busy the queue was for the day. We would get our device and go help customers and try to achieve success for their issue while holding onto a time constraint. Being able to juggle 6 people, some with complications that take longer than 15 minutes, helped me able to multitask very much."
good,"Apple is an awesome company but there is no advancement if you can only work part-time. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,It feels like your colleagues want to help you improve. However you are also pitted against them to maintain status quo.  Ultimately Apple has taught me how to better improve myself and my image.
good,"Overall, working for the Apple Store is an amazing opportunity. Their entry level pay is higher than most places, and you get plenty of benefits, even if you're part time. You just need to be willing to handle an extremely fast paced environment with a constant flow of customer traffic. Your skills with customer focus, product knowledge, and learning on the fly play a huge part in being a specialist for Apple."
good,"This was a pleasant place to work, as the job was extremely interesting and challenging. There was opportunity to grow as it was a newly opened company. My only problem was commuting a total of 3.5 hours a day"
good,"The best part of working at Apple was helping customers who appreciated your knowledge and expertise. However, management and getting promoted could be very political. Employees were given opportunities to mentor continuing and incoming hires, as well as start programs that contribute to internal culture. While at Apple, I started Old Orchard Magazine, a publication designed to get all the store's news to the entire team, while including light-hearted, health-related content about flu shots and yoga poses."
good,"Apple offers great products in the market place and employees work really hard to make the goals.  There are many excellent managers, and co-workers, but the hierarchy is layered, and quite complex, and NOT the flat structured company as they pretend.  The most enjoyable part of my job was that I got to work with some top-notch producers.  The hardest part of my job was avoiding the political games."
good,"great environment to work with, agile methodologies followed, team is very supportive and encouraging. environment is very dynamic and constantly challenging. great learnings"
good,"innovative and positively challenging workplace, I learned the importance of attention to detail. My co-workers are great team players and amazing people. Management is very professional."
good,"Demonstrated extensive knowledge in the products and services offered by Apple to provide the consumer with a complete solution which boosted overall store customer service goals."
good,"I loved that Apple is always looking to better things. The environment is very fast paced and there is always new things to learn. One of the words that gets thrown around the most at Apple is ambiguity, for we are always kept on our toes both with our co-woerks, new processes and our customers. I loved that fact that there is no judgment on anyone and everyone is welcome."
good,its a good job for training they teach you a lot not only about apple but technology. I would recommend this company to anyone looking to jump in to the tech world.
good,Worked as a part-time associate when needed. Fun coworkers which makes working with difficult customers a lot more manageable. Never felt as though I couldn't ask for help.
good,"Apple is a great company to work for. The benefits are decent, the work culture is good, and the employees are genuinely amazing people."
good,"Apple was a great place to work depending on the leadership in place at the time of your employment (really, just like any job)."
good,"Job was okay, not very competitive pay, job culture was okay and the it was very flexible job for all employees, pretty fun environment and ,management was ok as well as communication."
good,Best part of the job was the amazing connections I made with co-workers. Learned alot about what it takes to recruit great talent
good,Relatively stress free easy going work environment but not a lot of room or direction for growth. The benefits are great. But it can get pretty boring when there isn't any buz around a new product.
good,Working at Apple is one of the most fulfilling chapters of my life. We get to spend time with amazing technology and get a chance to enrich people's lives everyday.
good,Extremely fast paced and changing environment. Only the best survive. Be ready to adapt and change as quickly as possible.
good,"Apple is a great company with awesome benefits. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Worked on a great team of QA professionals who were very knowledgeable and dedicated to the quality of the software. Attended       cross functional meetings and weekly staff meetings. Worked closely with developers to resolve defects found in the releases.
good,"Busy environment that really presses an individual to show ""grace under pressure."" "
good,"Looking to build on my customer service experience, but apple was very limited as far as advancing within the company.  Accepted all opportunities that were available to me, but did not see any advancement in the near future.  Felt as though I wasn't using my full potential in my last position"
good,Working at Apple was a great opportunity. I was hired on for seasonal work through the Holidays. My contract is coming to an end and I'm looking for work else where. Over all it was a fun place to work the culture is amazing. I very fond of Apple's products as well so it made it an enjoyable job that I learned a lot from.
good,"Fast paced work environment that requires a lot of multitasking. Customers can often be difficult but the staff is very friendly and willing to help at all times. Great for developing technical and communication skills. If you want to move to a new position in the company, management does a great job of accommodation the interests of it's employees."
good,Employees are celebrated and properly compensated.  Innovative and fun environment with friendly and supportive management.  You will love the discounts and atmosphere
good,"I am lucky to have this opportunity to work for Apple as a support technician, now I have learned a lot about Mac devices, I learned  repairing the Apple products and I know better using an Apple product such as (Macbooks/iPads/iPods/iPhones) than before."
good,"Working from home is great, and the staff with in Apple Connect are top notch.  Flexible scheduling and providing the equipment was a plus."
good,"Apple has an amazing work atmosphere, wonderful people and is a great place to be yourself. Apple has always been the company at the forefront of technology and being a part of that is exhilarating, however, my heart belongs in film and television production."
good,If you work hard you can have lots of flexibility.  Every day is new and different and I always have a chance to innovate and improve processes. There is always lots of change.  This is a very fast paced company and job.
good,Good company.Been with Apple over 6 years and I am ready to try a different company.  I welcome all interested parties to contact me.
good,"I have had many hats at Apple. When working as a mobile technician a typical day would be mostly diagnosing and troubleshooting customer issues and setting up repairs. I worked as an Administrator for the Genius team where I would do much more in a day; audit repairs, send and receive repairs from repair center, receive and organize repair parts, contact customers about their repairs, organize repair que for Geniuses, troubleshoot system issues with support teams."
good,This is a great company that really cares about the people that work for it. They go out of their way to make sure you have everything that you need.
good,"Overall, Apple is a great place to work! The environment is mostly productive and many people care about the work they do."
good,I worked from home for this company. Really great company to work for. I felt that the training was kind of long especially for the type of job. Its just tech support
good,i used my english degree and spoke on the phone with people having technical dificulties on their newly introduced at that time i-phone i really enjoyed that job
good,"- Very Focused and specialized environment. You are expected to be the best in what you do and in what you were hired for. "
good,There is a great work environment. The compensation is extremely low. The environment is very stressful. The staff is great.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,I've worked here over ten years and have enjoyed it.  The management team is great.  My most enjoyable part were the guests.
good,"Overall, Apple is one of the best companies I have ever worked for."
good,"I appreciate the management at my store and the company as a whole because they are invested into me as an individual. I love that the employer make sure that you have the tools for personal growth as well as professional. My co-workers are easy to get along with, and they help to make the environment less tense. The hardest part of my job is time management and remaining collected under situations that call for extreme critical thinking, but with the support of my peers and the management team, it's easier to conquer. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with"
good,"Overall, Apple can be a great place to transition from survival jobs into a professional career.  It is certainly comfortable, but if you stay too long, you can burn out easily.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, they tend to hire well balanced, creative employees with strong work ethics.  The hardest part, specifically at the Fifth Avenue store, is giving non-english speaking customers the same great service - as their training does not prepare you for on-the-fly translations.  A typical day for a sales specialist is 8 hours on your feet expending all the social energy you have to be as outgoing and friendly as possible. Management wants to keep you on track to make their daily revenue goals, but is always on the employees side in difficult CS scenarios. Promotions are super competitive, and there is quite a bit of hiring from outside the company."
good,"Apple was a great place to learn new job skills, business process, and develop people.  I enjoyed working for Apple as it had this new business feel, had a positive atmosphere, great team building, and a great synergy.   Personal development, product development, and business development was on the for front of Apple and truly appreciated as an employee and stock holder"
good,"There are some things that are great like benefits, being able to work from home, but the advancement opportunities I was promised upon being hired are non existent."
good,Great company to work for. I would highly recommend working here to family or friends. amazing products demonstrated by enthusiastic and passionate employees.
good,"This location of the Apple store is ridiculously busy all the time. I learned to think quickly on my feet, how to respond to a myriad of questions, how to relay information with other staff, and how to deal with sometimes challenging customers."
good,"At Apple, my position entailed handling calls from 50+ customers on a daily basis.  These called ranged from simple product or software questions about iOS products to troubleshooting working with businesses and end consumers.  This often meant working with non Apple client software, research, troubleshooting, testing, and resolution."
good,"Apple was an amazing company to work for, they had clear progression routes and encouraged promoting internally. Over time things changed. There were lots of opportunities to develop, however not many of those opportunities offered any bonuses in terms of money. Due to the long opening hours, it can quite easily take over your life. If you want to learn how to deal with difficult customers, then Apple is the place to be, especially at the Genius Bar. However, if you think it is all high fives, and customer service (which it used to be!) then you will be surprised, it is the same as any other retailer now, it is all about figures and how to reach them. The only bonus being that they do (or at least did) pay a lot more than most retailers."
good,I worked as a Red Zone Specialist where we sold Apple products to walk in customers. I also helped customers who had technical issues with their device.
good,"Work was easy, pay was great. Job security is not the best. Enjoyed the work from home position. Apple sends you the equipment needed to do the job"
good,"Typical day at work was spent handling incoming calls for Apple Products. Solving customer issues and gaining customer trust in the brand. "
good,"One thing that is a constant at Apple is change. New products, great software! "
good,The people and the culture of Apple are amazing.  The job is great for people who love change and love to learn on the fly.  The compensation is good but hours are never consistent and there is very little opportunity for advancement.
good,Typical day at Apple is very fast paced yet laid back. I learned so much at Apple. Management was great. I was part of a big team or family if you will. The hardest part of the job was not enough hours in the day to get it done. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great team and manager.
good,"Nice place to work, great culture and atmosphere.  I work from home and weather and internet connection permitting, I enjoy the technical side of helping customers."
good,"Fast paced environment, a person must be physically capable of standing/walking for up to 10 hours at a time. Working in a restaurant comes with meeting fun people, a lot of customer interaction, and a flexible schedule. Great job for anyone who has family requirements, a second job, or is going to school."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Typical 9-5 hours."
good,"Love the culture and the team. I would love to stay on-board. However, they are not hiring permanent employees right now."
good,"My review is this, That I was happy with my previous job but due to store close i have to left my job.. And I don't want to go out side of my city that's why i couldn't attach with this job, But there experience was awesome...I learned so much that, how to handled all customers, When customer is not interested than how to create an activity so that they can attract with our product and store activity....etc"
good,"Apple is a good company, but it is still a corporate environment. They pay well, but to at the high end. They have perks, but no more than other companies of their size. It is hard to move up your salary even with internal promotions. You will get far more money coming in from the outside. I've had good and bad managers, again very much like like other companies this size. "
good,"Come in for work, log in to computer and phone, log in to the queue, wait for a call, take about 5-6 calls, go to lunch, come back , log back in to phone and queue, take some more calls, do a self training activity, then take more calls til I have to go home. "
good,"AppleCare APAC focused on the Asia Pacific Region. "
good,Engineers are very talented and helpful. Work is hectic but its fun.
good,"This was a dependable, contract position that allowed gain of production experience within a fast working environment with hard deadlines. Handled 3D models for clean up and performed QA on final work. Assessed standards and quality for improvement both in final product and efficiency of the production."
good,Apple is one of the best companies to work for. Gained Management as well as Technical skills at Apple. The best part of the part was learning cutting edge technologies. Hardest part of the job was offshore calls everyday in the night.
good,No matter what your role is a day to day is going to be completely different. There are always new challenges. The culture is awesome although working in stores you do get overwhelmed sometimes due to retail hours.
good,Mac users are just cool people in general. Working with these computers as a proponent of Apple in general makes this job a breeze.
good,"I have held 3 posistions with Apple, two supporting retail and one here in Austin in customer relations. All jobs have taught me a different set of skills. Every posistion came with its own challenges."
good,"Una experiència realmente unica, muy buenos compañeros, muy buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"Excellent place to work. Family environment, get to meet a lot of people. Get to stay on top of the latest technology."
good,"• Troubleshoot Macintosh and iOS Devices"
good,This company is in the forefront of technology and innovation.  Great teammates with a desire to move Education into the 21st century.
good,"It's very easy to get along with the people here, there are some managers/supervisors that need some training in their position because micro-managing your employees and assuming they don't know what they're doing makes them feel as though they don't belong at this place."
good,"Overall Apple was a wonderful place to work, I never really considered it a career path though as it seemed to take much to long to advance in the company with little gain in position or pay. The hardest part of the job is hands down the entitled customers that come in, the best part is your coworkers. "
good,This job was a stepping stone for me and it has helped me utilize the skills and experiences I have gained while working here. 
good,"You feel like you are part of something. I really enjoy helping customers who love the brand as much as you do. I feel like i'm part of a family and have so much support. There isn't a typical day, every day is different with lots of challenges to keep you on your toes."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,good company to work for. I enjoyed working with all the people that I cross. I learned many experience from all the people that i met.
good,"At Apple Online Store my responsibilities were to ensure all reports and daily activities were addressed within specified Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Take full issue ownership, including Customer Outreach, via phone or email."
good,• Triage and Repair of damaged systems
good,Apple is a great company to work for. A typical day entails listening to customers and providing creative solutions for their needs. My co-workers are phenomenal people and make me enjoy my work. The management at Apple Eastview is lacking.
good,A good company all around from a business perspective. Lacking in local social responsibility initiatives.
good,"1) Day is always busy at Apple. But i liked that for keeping me busy, busy and busy."
good,"The objective of an Apple Genius or Family Room Specialist (FRS) is to repair relationships. I specialize in mobile devices, software instruction and data management. We fix mobile devices and teach folks how to use Apple software & hardware."
good,Working at the apple store could be compared to working at Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Apple has a notoriously rigorous hiring process and it really shows in their people. I can honestly say that my store truly felt like a family and I am still friends with many of my former co-workers.
good,There is always more work than time to do it.
good,"Diffrent work assignments, various postions, I learned how to investigate reports and clarify documents. Having the main postions with administration duties comparing data with source documents and maintain logs of activiteis and completed work."
good,"If your looking to work with amazing talented individuals, Apple deserves a look. It is a fast paced work environment that will demand all you patience and focus. It is difficult to get in, even more difficult to move up the ladder to management."
good,Lots of happy smiling coworkers. It was a fun place to work. My typical work day consisted of managing the technicians and making sure work was done on time. Organizing the repair room and keeping everything up to date.
good,You can develop many skills while working here. You learn to deal with many customer issues and how to give feedback to fellow employees. You learned to be a very patient person. There are always new things you learn everyday. You become a very resourceful and a technical savvy person working here. There are new roles you can develop into. It is a great company to work for with great perks.
good,"Apple is a great place to work. I have accomplished extreme technical skills to match ones acquired over my 30 years in Corp. America. "
good,the customers are very passionate about their products so the company is passionate about how they help them. it can be difficult but the company gives a lot of great resources to get through the obstacles a nd create a great experience on both ends
good,"It was great but there is very little diversity and did not reflect my culture or values. As far as jobs go that is a relatively new concept so if you are old school like me, flexibility, good pay and stability are the big ones."
good,"I spent nearly 6 years as an Apple Team Manager for AppleCare  "
good,"Apple est une super entreprise pour quiconque est passionné de nouvelles technologies, on en apprend tous les jours et pour une personne qui utilise déjà les produits que la marque commercialise alors être vendeur ne se résume qu'à présenter les appareils et fonctionnalités qui nous font aimer la société, tout en aidant chaque client à trouver une solution unique à son problème, qu'il s'agisse d'un étudiant, un professionnel ou une personne âgée!"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple was honestly the best company I've worked for so far. I loved the environment and I love the fact that it didn't **feel** like work. The position I held was seasonal, so I was a little disappointed when it ended. I would definitely work there again if given the opportunity."
good,Apple is a good company to work for. However it can be difficult to advance in your career there. The highest positions rarely come available and getting them is hard.
good,The important thing about working at Apple is curating that customer-focused experience. The mindset at Apple is that you can learn product knowledge; but you cannot be taught empathy. Proving that you care about people and about Apple is a positive.
good,Working at Apple has been great. It is challenging but testing. Casual but consists of a lot of business contact. There is an extensive amount of material to learn as it is of course a tech company but team members are seriously kind and patient.
good,"Apple is probably the cream of the crop as far as Retail is concerned. If you're looking to get started in hospitality, IT, or any other consumer facing position, Apple is a FANTASTIC first step. It really gets you prepared for facing people in the world."
good,Arbeiten bei Aplleist Arbeiten in einem tolles Team in einem Unternehmen womit man sich zu 100% identifizieren kann
good,"Wonderful chance to represent Apple for 5 years. Loved helping customers. Made Life-long Friendships. It can become very routine at times but every day you get to enrich the customer experience. In the end, Apple is about enriching people’s live s through its products and customer service."
good,"Good coworkers, definitely feel like a team, however they only promote who they want not always who is most qualified. I’d keep working there if I could afford to. Always get 40hrs/week which is nice, but need something new with better pay."
good,"Working on projects to improve accuracy of data and user experience. Data entry, High KPI standards, working with company software efficiently and with a no mistakes attitude, communicating with customers, extensive researching, data collection, investigating and finding causes of problems and escalating where needed."
good,Working at Apple Inc in Elk Grove Ca was fun and lots of friendly coworkers they all like to work together and gets things done on time  coworkers helping one another’s if you need help getting products done on time for the next day’s shipment
good,"Instant friends with co-workers, everyone wants to learn, get to play with new products including third party toys! The job and the people helped me grow inside and outside of work. "
good,"Apple is a great company to work for, but you have to go in knowing that there is not a lot of room for growth. They create bottle necks for growth by not hiring for long periods of time and making employees basically clamor for whatever growth opportunity comes along during the droughts."
good,"Overall good experience and job environment!"
good,Une équipe de jeunes sur le floor et un grand soutien des équipes
good,"Typical workday would be monitor processing of incoming deliveries from assorted carriers (USPS / FedEx / UPS / Amazon etc.). SRM team has tight window to process and prep for delivery. Our driver teams will do two or three delivery / pickup sweeps through course of the day. We manage customer requests with our online tool and forward new requests to our drivers as they come in  "
good,"Great for people to build their people skills encountering people form all walks of life on a daily basis. Great company motto, culture, and commission-less sales structure."
good,"Apple is a great place culturally and socially to work.  They have a very hard hiring process and very few people get hired to work Apple retail."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Apple is a wonderful company who takes care of it's employee's. I worked remotely for the entirety of the time I worked for them and they always looked out for you. Excellent benefits. Sub-par monetary compensation. Which is why I eventually left.
good,Apple provides you with the tools to be successful. Management is supportive and engaging. They provide a flexible work life balance and encourage team building.
good,its a fun place with high hour paid job in retail environment!  paid over rated almost 19.00 an hour and its a huge store with over 50 staff per shift and no customers waiting for services.
good,"Working for Apple was an amazing experience, The only thing I had a hard time with was trying to get at least 40 hours a week. It’s nearly impossible to do that it’s a hassle to try and pick up hours from your coworkers. For trillion dollar company it’s not too much to expect a living wage. Unfortunately Apple has failed to grant that to its employees that are standing in front of the company, who are the actual face of the company, the people at the store."
good,"I would work at Apple again given the chance.  Great people, great culture, and very positive.  Yes, sometimes there was a lot of work to be done, but everyone approached it with a ""can-do"" attitude."
good,Working at apple is always an adventure.  Everyday can bring new challenges and new introductions.  Training is always on going and it is an environment of continue feedback.  Tact and certainty in communication are always key.
good,"Very good benefits : pension, share, and discounts"
good,"Apple was a fun environment to work in,great teams and all inclusive culture. Always fun and competitive. Very busy and experienced lots of different types of people. Got to talk to different cultures and learn about them."
good,"Its as good as it gets for a retail job. This by no means so be anyones career choice, the benefits and pay are good for working in the mall, but you must work most weekends. you have to plan any out of work activities a month or more in advance to get the time off. Your hours will vary greatly every day, its exhausting telling customers the same things every single day."
good,"Lots of information learned, fun job. Always something new. Lots of customers. Learned products inside and out. Managers were helpful and coworkers were easy to get along with."
good,"The connections I made during my time at Apple have been priceless. There are some very specific work opportunities available to those who are willing to go above and beyond for a specific role. Unfortunately there isn't a defined development path and many people can get complacent. There was rarely any internal movement to leadership positions, and not much effort to change."
good,"Apple has a fantastic Culture, but location plays an essential role. Management is terribly sourced for the most part. Advancement is limited in large locations. A day is basically a standstill until customers need assistance. The most enjoyable part is usually the people you will work with, makes friends, because they will help time fly at work."
good,This is a company that fully develops careers to the next level.
good,"Working for Apple retail in the Natick Mall was fun but there were significant pros and cons. Some of the pros included discounts and flexible hours, while some of the cons were the job culture and the fact that you're working in a mall."
good,"great company great benifits , friendly and diverse environment to work in . Skilled managers that know what there doing "
good,"Was fun working for apple.   "
good,"Researched product's technical specifications and accurately communicated the information."

good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"A great place to work with great minds. I really admire working at Apple."
good,"Great company, especially if you are a student. Good benefits, reasonable pay for retail. No commission structure when I was there."
good,"Apple is a wonderful place to work. The team is filled with motivated, experienced, and friendly members. Most teams are very results-driven and maintain a high level of productivity."
good,"I was hired as a temporary employee with a third party company. "
good,"A typical day starts with clocking in and quickly checking for any important updates or emails before putting yourself into the queue. Most days were a constant stream of chats, usually 2-3 at once, so it can be pretty frenetic, but you learn a lot about multi-tasking to do well here. There's definitely a lot of opportunity to learn and grow if you're looking to, though they place greater emphasis on soft skills over technical skills. Management can be hit or miss in my several years there, as I had amazing managers who listened and were open to feedback, and some who were more rigid about what they expected. Overall the culture is very much focused on getting the right solution the first time, though with layered issues this can be more complex but that's where senior advisors come in, to take ownership of issues that may take more than one contact to resolve. I think the hardest part of the job were the times that your hands were tied due to policy when it came to resolving some issues and the occasional language barrier problems from non-native English speakers, some of whom used automated translation services to try and troubleshoot issues. But I'd say the best part of the job was being able to fix someone's issue and really make their day by getting their project back on track, or their school assignment, or maybe that amazing scrapbook for a cherished family member or event."
good,"I was part of Apple as a seasonal temp. However, when offered the job, I was told that I would be made permanent after Christmas. "
good,"You are expected to sell, but they talk about it in a different way. Ultimately it's still retail, but it's the best retail. "
good,"Great company "
good,"Great company to work for as long as you have a good manager, good pay and good benefits. Lots of employee activities, team builders and discounts on Apple products!"
good,"Genius Admin is one of the most stressful jobs at Apple. I would encourage any roll but Genius Admin. Overall, you get paid great for Retail. Great benefits."
good,It was a good job. That provides the right training for the job. Also when you had to work on holidays the company would provide food for the workers working that day.
good,"Apple is a great company to work for and they truly take care of their employees. Competitive salaries, excellent benefits, and opportunities to advance."
good,Intensive training. There was a lot of learning involved. Worked both individually and in teams. Daily routine did not change much. Meetings were frequent.
good,"Apple is a great way to have a flexible work schedule with benefits. Im grateful for it in that sense but working retail in apple is tough, you cant survive on the salary, and theres really no growth. Its a great stepping stone."
good,"Love working for Apple Retail! Really fun atmosphere, company is filled with contagious happy people who want to support their teammates and enrich the lives of customers!"
good,Working at Apple was a great experience. Most people are more than willing to help you learn and the benefits are amazing. The only downside is that the job can feel extremely demanding at times. The position I worked in allowed me to work from home and this led to a very poor work-life balance.
good,Try to write down everything you learn in training. Interact and ask questions especially if you  are not familiar with most of Apple's products and their functions. If you enjoy tech and like seeing how it works this is the job for you! Get to know your peers and your managers because they are your best friends in this job! Obviously the hardest part of this job is going to be dealing with irate customers and struggling with stubborn issues.  On a good day you will have pretty simple issues that can be resolved relatively quickly (which is what you are graded on and should aim for). Depending on your manager you will be managed intensely on your ability to perform. The slightest mishaps (and bad survey scores) can earn you multiple warnings that eventually lead to disciplinary action so try to be as thorough as possible with everything you do. Be ready for short breaks and constant calls back to back (unless its a holiday). Launch days are always long and stressful but overall this job is a pretty nice addition to your resume.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Great place to work. Friendly people. Amazing benefits and discounts. Learn a lot and provide a lot training and continued development. Great company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed my time working here. I just couldn't handle the commute. Good set of co-workers. At the time they didn't hire NPS so before I graduated and had my first child, I left the office."
good,"I have learned a lot working at apple not just with customer service but for myself as well. I have also learned about technical help and the joy of helping others. Also taught me patients, the only hard part about the job is now management. the most enjoyable is helping the customers and heating the excitement in their voice when the problem is solved. and GREAT benefits."
good,"Very diverse, lots of opportunities for things coming into the company. Management sometimes is hard to follow because management does things differently."
good,"Apple is a really good place to work when it comes to treating employees well. The only issue is it is hard to get promoted here. A lot of outside hiring is done due to the way Apple looks at it's employee base. Apple feels that they hire only the best of the best. Due to this, it is hard to move up in the company. Also just because you are in a position and you did well in it, does not mean you will get promoted if a position in that field becomes available, Other than this, Apple is a great company and has taught me alot!"
good,"Buenos equipos de trabajo, como una familia, buena motivación con premios. Puede mejorar en salario."
good,"Nice Job and People, A big minus because of the inability to work on a permanent basis, a great canteen. And people are treated pretty well. This is a good place for temporary work."
good,"Working there is very good, however management decision sometimes you don't understand but you have to do it."
good,"Great company, culture, and leadership...but opportunities for advancement are very limited as the company look externally for most roles of significant responsibility."
good,"Busy mainly on weekends"
good,"great people to work with. Team focused on delivering great customer experiences, you’ll introduce people to the Apple products that help them do what they love in new ways. Or you might work with the local business community, connecting entrepreneurs and professionals with the tools they need to build success. Whether you work up front or backstage, every day you’ll have the chance to make a big difference — for your customers, your team, and yourself. Roles include Specialist, Expert, Operations Expert, and Business Expert."
good,"Good company to work for. The management is good, base on how performance you did, flexible work, you can do what you like as long as you get the job done (in a good way). Lack of job security, the job is like a seasonal job. Do not expect/hope to convert to a permanent position. Professional working environment."
good,"As long as you get a good manager, Apple is a great place to work. In my case I had 10-12 different managers in almost 6 years of employment. Each one had a different set of managerial skills they brought to the table, some good, some not so good."
good,"Apple, like all large companies only have so many open leadership positions available. They hire great talent, but eventually you get restless because everyone wants to do more, but are unable to move up, in turn causing attrition. Loved working there. They gave me opportunity to think and work outside the box. I learned skills there that will transcend through my life. However, unless you are at Apple at the right moment, moving up will be tough."
good,really great company to work for if you are looking for a part-time job or straight after uni. You'll be well looked after and its a easy company to work for + teaches you great things about customer service and good working culture.
good,"It is a good benefit, good stock option and high pay. About the working environment there.. not sure that I like it. Too much bossy and politic play around"
good,"Although I did not see myself staying at the Apple Store long term, it was a good part-time job for me throughout college. It was nice to see people leave and advance their careers in corporate."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I learned plenty between management, coworkers and customers. Made friends for life. You will have an easier time if you use apple products personally. The rapid changes in operating systems are challenging to keep up with as some changes are not formally recorded. I loved most of the experiences."
good,Very good company to work for and very fast paced. The management team was very genuine and was always willing to lend a helping hand. My peers were awesome and were always willing to put in the work to meet deadlines.
good,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I loved the actual job, my coworkers, and the benefits were amazing. When it came to management and development, it was all politics. They have their favorites, and that is who they focus on for promotions."
good,Great place to work as well a place open to advancement and learning. I would recommend anyone to take a chance on working for Apple if they have the opportunity.
good,"I loved working at Apple. The team was supportive and the atomosphere was stressful but fun. It’s hard to even put those two together. The overcrowding can be overwhelming but eventually you get use to it and zone it out. I’m sad to have left Apple, but I just couldn’t do the part-time hours and the politics. "
good,"They offer great benefits and competitive pay, but advancement opportunities were hard to come by. They kept hiring from the outside instead of promoting from within."
good,"Good place to work as the work environment is an amazing one. However, job advancement and growth potential is scarce to none. Within the time that I have been here, no progress to develop internal talent has been"
good,"The culture has changed a bit since becoming so large of a company. Very competitive, but fun place to work. Great benefits, nice campus and perks. If you find your niche, there is opportunity for advancement and stability."
good,"Apple is a nice company to work for. The people there are typically great people to work with. There is an intangible level of politics that get played there, and the merit system upon which employees are judged is cryptic and vague, yet failure to meet the cryptic criteria can have career altering results. It is very hard to get a promotion."
good,"Watch what you say. "
good,"Great culture, friendly co-workers. Working nights and weekends tended to be a little difficult sometimes for my particular lifestyle but otherwise a great place to work."
good,"Toujours vouloir se développer est un atout dans le monde apple , car sinon vite décourager et certain manager n’accompagne tout le monde a l’évolution ."
good,"Apple is a great company and your work feels like it has a big impact, however the work life balance is lacking. Be expected to work 60+ hours and sometimes on weekends."
good,"your typical call center but, working for a Apple campaign has you fill useful.  Some of the call have you feeling as though you really affect your clienics day."
good,"As a college student I couldn't have asked for more of a work/life/school balance. There are tremendous, although very competitive, career opportunities if ""you are the right fit"". In order to truly succeed in retail/ corporate you must truly embody the Apple culture - it is difficult to ""fake-it till you make-it"". Apple takes this very seriously."
good,"Apple does a great job at over-staffing the stores so that interactions with customers are never rushed or pushy, and emerging projects or feedback with team members can be facilitated"
good,"when working at apple sometimes it can be long. After clocking to start my day I check my work's email for any news, updates ,meetings. Then I began to take a call and assistant customers on what they need. The environment each day was ok everyone seemed nice I didn't really talk to a lot of people. The must enjoyable part was completing a call and the customer is happy."
good,"Fund job. Annoying customers. Most basic technical skills required. Training offers all the knowledge you need, no real IT experience needed. Would recommend this job to get into IT field."
good,"Your life revolves around Apple and not the other way around. Vacation is not given at one time, which makes it hard to plan anything. The hardest part of the job is lack of entry level and advancement opportunities."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple is a great company with amazing luxury items."
good,"Working at Apple is fulfilling in a way because you feel that you are really a part of something special. However, the feeling certainly disappears once you have to deal with management. The problem is that there is not enough managers, and there is no consistent managing style, so there is never really any sense of growth because everything is in a constant state of flux. I would love to continue working for Apple, but the thought of wading through that pool of management disarray any longer is definitely what prevents me from staying."
good,"Apple is one of the most important and influential companies in the world. Working for them was an honor.  The internal culture is like no other. You will pride yourself working for them. "
good,In overal een het een goed bedrijf om je carrière  te starten.
good,"This job was far from boring. As a team we always made sure the shop looked as it best. We supported each other during the sales and always worked as a team together. We had a lot of during our work as well as after work. "
good,it was a very fast past job that enjoyed alot kept me moving on my feet all ways had work to do house flew by in no time i was off great hard day of work
good,Apple is a great opportunity to start a job and rurn it into a career. They offered good hours and i never had to worry about missing work because  they offered overtime frequently
good,"My days could be long, but it was fun always having new challenges. You get to travel and play w neat products all day. Depending on your position you may be providing demos to the public."
good,"A typical day includes staring out reviewing important changes."
good,"A great company to work for. They manage people, not numbers. I enjoy my time at Apple, I just wish there was a way to achieve a better work life balance."
good,Salary was a huge pro and the remote job at home worked fine for the family and business needs. The scheduling and management were the cons of this job.
good,"HBAs wake up at home, start a pot of coffee, brush their teeth, check the clock, and sit down at their desk. At home. No commute. No socializing. All work, but hey, you can walk your dog at lunch or catch up on Netflix. I learnt that working from home is not for me, a social animal with designs on learning and moving upwards in the firm. The opportunities are extremely limited, and once you agree to work from home, the chances you can return to campus are near nil. The hardest part of the job is to not go stir crazy with cabin fever. So, get out. Get a dog. Get a gym membership. Get used to the mundane daily customer contacts, and try to make each one special to the customer."
good,Apple is fund place to work with lot to learn and deliver.  It also has lot of expectation and work pressure and competitive environment.  It allows you to help learn and perform.
good,"Come and work with the best.  This is not place to have fun, it is a place to do you best work and push hard.  The company is large enough that there are varying sub-cultures, so it is important to learn about each team and how it operates."
good,"Very well rounded place to work. Flexible hours of operation, as well as a good environment to be in as well. Learned a lot about software and how to deal with the troubles of customers,and problem solving also. Very professional."
good,"I worked as an AHA.  There's not a ton of advancement available if you don't live where they have an actual office building, but you can move from t1 to t2, from that to management etc. It's fine and their benefits for healthcare were the best i've ever had."
good,"nice company to work. good exposure to latest technology. nice oppurtunity for data engineers as they get to work on latest hadoop technologies like hive, spark  etc"
good,It's a place of divers culture and a person is allowed to just be themselves with out fear of judgement or complaints . Apple is a great place to work
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,It was a telecommute through a vpn. Typically it was a very relaxed job. You get up and log into the iMac they send you to use and get calls via a dedicated phone line.  Calls are tech support issues. Hardest part is to be able to resolve issues without somebody to bounce the issue off of. All in all a pretty awesome job.
good,"Apple Retail is a great company to work. You have multiple opportunities for growth and you learn a lot about a number of areas. It is fun to work and interact with people from all different cultures and backgrounds. Upward mobility is a bit tough/convoluted due to the nature of retail. So if you are in for the long haul it's great, but don't expect to are to get promoted relatively quickly. Overall, Apple is a great company to work for and I would recommend it to anyone willing to learn and work hard."
good,Great family environment but a very stressful job with a lot of requirements for career advancement. Very customer focused with a do whatever will make the customer happy attitude.
good,your day involves talking to customers who usually have no idea how to use their phones. You are timed and measured on every single thing you do. There is no script but you have multiple things that you must say on every call
good,"Campus Rep in school. Provided great perks and a very accommodating schedule. Work coincides with marketing, business, and retail. You also get hands-on learning by visiting campus HQ"
good,Great place to grow. You have tons of opportunity to train and learn new things in a high paced tech environment. Management is fair and wants to see you succeed.
good,Very busy place to work with not much workspace available. Apple does have an amazing culture though and the people you work with are some of the best parts of working at apple.
good,When you clock in for work you have a download of what the day is with other team members ... Then you hit the floor and change people lives for the best
good,"Apple as a company is amazing. They have a brilliant culture that focuses on diversity, empathy, and fearlessness. I felt at home during the on-boarding process. "
good,"Productive workplace and people along with.superiors are very easy to approach.conference room,training room and offices are very beautiful and the space are big."
good,"Apple is a best job retail you can have in the market without formal an education. There room for advancement  but theres a lot of favoritism involved. Theres a lot perks, but part timers get the short end of the stick. My best advice is do things the ""Apple Way"" and try move up to full-time fast as possible because they don't hired full timers right away unless you are some computer nerd or major."
good,"Store culture and Management are the key to Employee  experience. You have a good management team you will have a great time working for Apple. i was in college during my time at apple, and love it"
good,"As an AppleCare Technical Advisor, my role is to support customer with issues both software and hardware they experience with iPhones, iPads, iPods, Watch, Beats, iMac, MacBook Air & Pro, and Apple Tv."
good,"You get to work with some of the most inspiring and incredible people you'll ever meet. I had so much fun making friends with my co-workers and it created a really great work environment. "
good,"Very fast paced and stressful, manager duties are heavy on metrics and keeping employees in those metrics. Pay is a bit low for the area I live in but manageable."
good,"great  job, poor management a lot of things to learn as a genius. it was awesome when customers felt relieved that their computers was fixed. the hardest part was when you needed to refuse  service to customers after work."
good,Positive place to work . Apple does a great job of providing positive energy and everyone is typically very friendly. It's the type of job that makes it easy to make friends. Plenty of social interaction to be had in Apple retail
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Working at Apple , one experienced working with the most intelligent people in the world and was a great professional setting to work in day in and day out. Everyday was a new challenge that helped you grow as a person and professional."
good,"I loved working for Apple. My only issue was that the management team was more interested in sales rather than helping customer issues/problems. The products sell themselves honestly, yet the managers didn't seem to notice that."
good,"Working from home can be great for a lot of people, but some people just don't have the personality type to do it. It can become very isolating and draining. There are so many great people that work for this company and it was a pleasure to work with them virtually. I was excited to move from Tier I to Tier II support, but as in-depth as training is for both jobs, you're never prepared for Tier II. Any upward mobility after Tier II is non-existent unless you're a manager's favorite. Even though the position is considered technical support and trainers will rally to tell you that you're not customer service, you're still customer service with a technical aspect and you're still in a call center environment. The only difference is that you're bringing that kind of negativity into your home."
good,"I loved working for Apple. I had a great time every day I went into work. The environment was very fast paced, but you could always find time & ways to be creative during customer interactions."
good,If you've got a techie heart then this is the place for you. Great training and team building culture. I've made some of my closest friends working here. Great atmosphere for those that are into techie talk.
good,"I have learned so much at this company from more diagnostic, testing etc. The workplace is a nice place that has nice people and with great workers and everyone is all treated the same."
good,"I enjoyed working for The Mac Store. It was a more low key environment than working at the Apple store, and felt more like getting to know the public than hustle and bustle."
good,"Good Learning Experience, Benefits are good for Full time employers."
good,Opportunities to grow are minimal as the company just hires in people instead of internally progressing staff. Lots of great people. To much micro management. A lack of localisation in some areas with the company rolling out on size fits all plans that don’t necessarily work for all teams in all GEOS.
good,"In my 11+ years with Apple, I had some incredible experiences. I have worked in 7 different stores (three long-term, and four short-term) and met some amazing and talented people, and also made some great friends. I learned so many valuable skills along the way (functional/technical, customer service, and interpersonal) that I truly feel have made me who I am today. I was so proud to have worked for the most valuable brand and company in the world, and it was great to stay caught up with all the latest technology. I have owned, used, and sold so many different Apple products throughout the years - computers, phones, tablets, and software - all of which have enriched my life - and the lives of those I have worked with. "
good,It’s a good place to work but it is competitive.  Rewarding though but if you’re looking for more money then other companies pay more but you can believe in the work you do with Apple
good,"I truly loved the people I worked with. My work life balance was not something that I was able to fully grasp until after I left Apple due to retail hours. "
good,"Pros"
good,"Apple is a great place to start your career path. Great training and for the most part the management is there for you."
good,"Apple is a tricky company to review. They offer extremely generous benefits and compensation packages, however, their management style is lacking. I experienced multiple managers at Apple that were poorly trained, and poorly educated in the technical area I worked in. My team was tasked with fairly intricate technical operations.. There were multiple occasions where the ""new"" guy on the team knew more than the tenured manager. Sad. Ultimately left the company due to this frustrating trend. Promotions went to the employees that ""looked"" the part. Not the ones that knew the part. Tattoos and piercings? You're good enough to be CEO here. Dress professionally and know the industry? They'll refer you to Microsoft. You aren't welcome at Apple."
good,"Friendly place with a team that will quickly feel like family. For the most part, everyone looks out for each other and encourages personal growth not only within the company but outside of it as well."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Although I love my time working with Apple it can also be discouraging as a college graduate looking for employment in my field of study. Apple pays well to those young students living at home with parents or who have yet had to pay their student loans. Otherwise it can be difficult to make a living while trying to advance ones career. It is not in any way Apple's fought for running the business the way they do however I would not say it is a great job for someone with student loan debt.
good,"Enjoyable Troubleshooting & Solutions for the Macintosh computer user Also I teach folks how to use their Macintosh computer, e.g., set up, writing, internet, office management, etc., etc."
good,Overall Apple is a great company to work for with great benefits and good solid culture. There are opportunities for the company to develop their employees.
good,"I worked over night fraud and it was no different than working at any other company. There were not real ""Apple"" perks that you could enjoy due to the work days and hours that Over Night fraud had to work. Huge time out black out dates."
good,"As a contractor i had a pretty decent experience at apple. would highly recommend. Team culture was good, manager was really good. Got to learn a lot of new tools, processes."
good,You spend most of the time on the phone troubleshooting technical issue to get various apple products back to working as expected while offering world renound customer service.
good,"Started as a full time technical specialist."
good,"A typical work day at Apple consisted of washing, drying, stacking, and disitributing dishes, pots, pans and all silverware to designated prep area. I was also required to occasionally help with food preperation."
good,It is a great place to start your career in Tech or Marketing. Keeps you engaged with the customers and there is always something to learn about. Must be a people person to really enjoy this job.
good,"Great place and even better people. However, you are very restricted in what you can say about what you do at Apple Inc. Its understandable but frustrating. Its an excellent resume builder but know that there is no room for advancement."
good,"Apple is a great place to work.  I tell everyone I loved the people I worked with but not necessarily the job.  It was fun at times but it can wear on you doing the same thing for 8+ hours a day."
good,"great place, I worked from home so I didn't really communicate with the others. I mean we had different chat rooms set up if we wanted. but I was too busy to be bothered."
good,"Apple was a great job to have! I highly recommend working there, but its not for everyone. You have to interact with a lot of different types of people."
good,"but like any job, its tough to deal with management & sometimes that is enough to drive a lot of people away. I enjoyed the benefits & discounts but it was quite challenging to move up."
good,"The people you work with are great and make you feel supported and welcome. However the job is very high stress and demands that you are fully invested in the company. This can not be treated as just a job, you are expected to eat, sleep and live Apple all the time."
good,"I was lucky to begin my career here. I was surrounded by smart, inspiring people and had managers that actually cared about me. It was a fun and exciting culture."
good,"Apple is a good company however in the tech support department it can get challenging at time. Rude customers but you have to learn to let go. Just do you job and be polite and try to assist as much as is in your power. Pay is good. Some managers do a great job helping you succeed in your role and advance. benefits, discounts (could be better) but other than that a good company to work for. Hey who wouldn't love to work for a company that has the best items on the market."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Can sometimes be demanding in terms of work/life balance. The learning environment is continuous and growth is inevitable. Theres always fomenting going on so you will never be bored at work.
good,Two thumbs up ...  great work life balance; great training; great promotion opportunities;  top shelf work from home program; laugh a lot; good communications with my manager
good,"Initially, the job seems AWESOME! Working from home, great benefits and super nice coworkers! However, after some time, the job tasks become super repetitive. You're able to change departments easily, but moving up in the managerial hierarchy is not as simple. "
good,I didn't work for Apple I worked for Best Buy with the Apple Rep. I did more of the training for the employees and well as the training the rep as well.
good,"Job was interesting and it was a great job while I was still in college. They actually have great benefits and will teach you great social skills however, DO NOT GET STUCK IN THE LOOP. People try to make the store a career and that's not what anyone should ever do."
good,Apple was a great place to work.  A typical day I would review user reported problems using Apple Maps and try to solve their issue using a GIS platform making basemap edits.  Management was very friendly and helpful and easy to work with.  It was all very relaxed environment but work always got done.   My coworkers were great.  Everyone got along and were on the same wavelength it seemed.  One thing I didn't really like were they would sometimes try and renovate something that didn't need to be.  If it isn't broke don't fix it.  This would disrupt workflow and get used to something else.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of helping people out and improving the application.
good,"I can't recall a single person I worked with at Apple Retail who was not a remarkable, passionate, bright, energetic person. Apple takes developing corporate culture seriously. Lots of opportunities to improve personally. Best benefits ever."
good,"Apple is great for someone that wants to add and build their resume, it's a great place to learn culture and the importance of working with others. I appreciate the talent and the constant change in the environment. Apple pays more than most companies on average but I don't recommend it as a place to stay for years to try to advance into another position."
good,"- Learning experience everyday "
good,Very quick paced environment. Great coworkers and managers are very professional. Environment was also very friendly. You get to meet a lot of great customers.
good,"Working ar apple is a blast, I've been here for years and have loved it all. Super fun group of individuals who are all crazy talented in one way or another."
good,"It was fantastic working with Apex. However, the chance for permanent placement is slim. This position with Apple was more of a resume builder than anything."
good,"the training period was  ok, if you are not a person who is proficient with apple to begin with or not a tech savvy person it will be  hard to keep up initially , the training was not as helpful as i would have liked  "
good,Apple has been a great place to work from home with. They have great employees and management who want you to do well for the company.  Great discount on Apple products.
good,"This was the first job and it taught us a lot of things while stepping into the Business World."
good,"working at apple computer made me realize a lot ive learned with sales, the most enjoyable part of my job is talking on the phone with customers.,making"
good,"The organisation has a good work culture and people are very helpful."
good,"retail hours. Work nights, weekends, holidays. Most people work at apple because of the culture. Great products and nice work environment. I would recommend apple"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Retail schedules can be tough to balance with family life, but there's no shortage of pride in product or company. The culture is great as well. The company as a whole strives for not only better products but a better planet and global community."
good,"Working for Apple has been a great experience while finishing IT degree and does look really good for future job growth or open positions within Apple. Working from home is great but does have a limit to advancement and job growth. Overall, I would definitely recommend working for Apple-at-home."
good,"Working at apple has allowed me to learn about the positive impact that technology has on people and businesses. I have learned that when dealing with technology, patience and the willingness to learn something is important. The people here are some of the most inspiring that I have met in my lifetime."
good,A typical day in the Family room is very hectic and busy all day.  You learn to deal with many personality types and how to jungle numerous customers at once.  I learned how to empathize with people and help them restore their faith in Apple.  Most of your co works are great fun and you learn many great life lessons.  The hardest part is keeping up with the demand while still making each customer feel like they have your undivided attention.
good,Apple is one of the leading IT industries and while they do a lot of things well there are a few things that could be easily fixed that have not yet
good,"- work/life balance needs improvement (set/preferred schedules)"
good,The benefits are great working for apple. The 401k match and stock options were great. Felt a lot of pride to tell people I work for apple
good,"Overall I've enjoyed my time at Apple, I made lots of great friends and meaningful relationships with my co-workers.  Apple will give you skills that are useful for future positions; i.e. time management, and organization."
good,Management and co-workers go beyond the workplace and take interest in you as a person. Easy to feel like a close knit community.
good,"Overall, I enjoy working for the company, and my manager and group are great. However, as a contractor, I have no paid holidays, no PTO, and only 3 sick days for the entire year, and that was not the case when I had started. This particularly becomes a problem in calendar Q4 when Tim is generous to the employees w/ holidays, but I have no way to compensate for the lack of pay during Thanksgiving week and the Christmas-New Years shut down. The other issue is the 15-18 month limit on contractors, so if you aren't converted after that, you have to leave for a few months before you can come back, which is not practical. Lastly, as a contractor, I feel like a second class citizen in the company -- there are many moments when it becomes painfully obvious you are not a regular employee."
good,"On a daily basis I repair relationships with customer and trouble shooting iOS device. The work environment is face pace, fun and caring."
good,Working for Apple was an incredible experiance. They really try to help give you all of the tools that you need in order to succeed. I personally was not a fan of working from home. It was nice to not have to commute. However building productive work relationships is a litte more challenging in a work at home environment.
good,"My overall experience at apple has been excellent, however most my my negative experiences such as bad management, over micromanagement, and poor benefits apply to the contracting company Apex Systems."
good,"Overall, an experience with plenty of growth and memorability; furthermore, trained me to work well under pressure and to vastly improve my time management."
good,"Working customer support for Apple is challenging. Being rated the best customer support 15 years in a row means people expect the best. We aim to please and hit that mark about 85% of the time. The senior level role is demanding and rewarding at the same time. I can own anywhere from 15-30 cases at a given time. During releases of products and software our business increases and they offer a lot of OT, they almost make it feel like it is mandatory OT. I like the money but I also appreciate time with my family. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"A typical day at work would be taking calls all day long, helping people and making sure they are satisfied at the end of the call."
good,"Over all Company is really good. Work culture , management , colleague , work environment and the very good thing is ""You can ask them for new task"". Take new responsibility , show them all opportunity and take the opportunity."
good,Apple is a great company but retail hours are not for me. i did not go to school for people to talk to me in a rude manner. It can also be a bit hard to move up from corporate while starting in apple retail.
good,"good hours. training not long enough for whats going on,didnt know i would be working for them until i signed a non disclosure"
good,"Great people, Great friends, Great vibe. However, if you're looking for personal development, be prepared to kiss some manager butt before anyone even cares enough to help you move up in that company."
good,"This job is very fast past and busy on most days, especially the weekends and holidays.  The pay could honestly be better for the amount of work you do whether you're a technician or sales person. You do not make commission which is ok in some aspects but they expect you to hit specific sales numbers.  The days can be long and you have to deal with sometimes rude and angry customers.  The culture however is a ton of fun and the co-workers for the most part were awesome. You get to play with new products and even get some great discounts.  The health insurance is amazing as well!  It is very hard to move up however because everyone in the company is wanting to move up to higher level sales, technician or manager positions.  In three years I never received a promotion but was constantly getting good reviews and taking the most appointments in the store. I would recommend the job as a great fun retail job but not something you would make a living out of."
good,"The typical day at Apple is rewarding in two major ways. You have the opportunity to connect with a fantastic team of people. Apple focuses on their people, which allows for a group of unique, diverse, and highly talented individuals. The second part is providing a fulfilling experience to the customer, and therefore the local community. Apple products have always been known for being able to do amazing things, and to be a part of that culture can be highly rewarding. "
good,"It was challenging .Working in a store that almost never slows down keeps you on your toes and awake. There may be times when the store was a bit calm at opening to the store being packed hours later . We had to keep composure in tough times when things got a little too busy .The compensation was fair , but my favorite part about the job is how much i learned , the skills I walked away with & and the unique and special people I meet there "
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in, clocking in through a program on our computers. Setting up your work station to begin taking calls. Take calls, help customers with technical issues with any Apple device, listen to voicemail, check emails, take breaks and when you're done with your shift, log out. "
good,"The experience so far is good. I have been working on a agile project which give me the opportunity to interact with  business and know their outputs. "
good,Apple was a great company to work for but the management was not very forthcoming about long term positions and advancement. Hired a lot of workers with the assumption of full time jobs just to have a massive down size after the holiday season/ IPhone 6S release.
good,"Very rewarding work in helping students improve achievement levels and student engagement.  I worked with K-12 schools, colleges, and universities throughout Manitoba and Saskatchewan supplying solutions to help with various needs for improving teaching and learning.  We worked with government departments to help implement provincial standards."
good,"I worked as a Genius in one of the retail stores.  It's noisy and hectic and not for the faint of heart.  I loved what I did for Apple but the environment just wore me out as the years passed.  "
good,A typical day at Apple included a very full load of tasks. I interacted with developers on a customer service basis. The workload was heavy with tight deadlines. The employees there were very helpful and were team players.
good,"Apple was a terrific place to work, though upper management had very little concern for work-life balance (thus burnout was frequent).  Benefits were above average, people were outstanding to work with.  Surprisingly, Apple has never really embraced the concept of working remotely (at least not for non-engineering types), preferring its employees to be on location (even during holiday work periods).  Compensation-wise, Apple was about average (actually lower than Dell), but their reputation is such that people WANT to work there."
good,"Receiving Incoming Calls, Customer Interfacing, Product Promotion, Processing Sales, Customer Data Collection and Management"
good,"Apple by far has the best people to work alongside everyday.  You meet people from many different walks of life and learn something new each day.  I my experience, I did find the management to be lacking particularly with certain roles in the store.  If that could change Apple would be by far one of the best locations to work for an extended period of time."
good,"Apple always encourage you to develop your competence and your creativity. The work environment is very innovative."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I go to work to work. I learned that everybody work differently."
good,"Réunion avant la prise de poste pendant le café, définition des objectifs , retour sur les process, rotation de postes toutes les 3h , très grande culture d'entreprise. Contact facile avec les équipes, super teamwork"
good,"Apple is a pretty nice company. Working for Apple no matter what position you are doing you get support from peers, great resources and trainings such that you do not need to be a techy to succeed in your role."
good,"The culture at apple is amazing. Benefits are great. Management is generally really good. I learned a lot of leadership skills. The toughest part of the job is that everyone want to work for Apple, so competition is fierce. Very hard to move up in the company. You have to jump through many hoops. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with inspiring technology and people."
good,A job which everyday you have a vision and targets which become you more and more better in your profession. Challenges are always along the way that you need to surpass and achieve your goals. Lots of responsibilities which I really like as I feel myself very useful.
good,"Overall, Apple was a great place to work. They put so much time and effort into their employees and products its hard not to come to work passionate everyday."
good,"Basic retail job in a specialty store offering Apple products and accessories. Go through a lot of different ""stations"" per shift ranging from mobile cashier to assisting customer setting up their devices. Hardest part is always convincing customer the benefits of purchasing Apple products over other platforms and why. Co-workers are always very helpful and work exceptionally well as a team. Most enjoyable parts are the rewarding reactions from confused customers that now have an understanding of the products they are purchasing and the encouragement of your fellow staff and management"
good,"Apple is a great company to work for! I have a lot of gained skills while working here. It is good but at the time, I need a long term career."
good,"Busy from the first minute to the last."
good,"Its really good work experience being with Apple. Recent technologies and fast moving technical aspects."
good,"I had problems advancing with Apple in Southlake because of one manager. Other than that, the culture is amazing and I loved working with so many great people."
good,"Apple is a fantastic company. In the retail division we interact with great products, customers, and other great employees. The opportunity to move beyond the retail store, however, is limited due to the number of individuals who want to work for the company. "
good,I work with an amazing group of people. I enjoy communicating with customers & helping them find solutions. Management is okay.
good,"The benefits are 5-star, but annual raises do not come close to cost of living. You are hired for the position and are expected to do that role, as they do not promote from within. HR has said ""you need to leave the company to come back to a better role"". Site/Segment leadership (Education) is so badly blinded by reports & metrics, they cannot see the moral or the needs/request/expectations of the customer slipping away. Typical day starts with review of call stat that are expected to build pipeline, based on marketing plays that are targeted to the wrong audience. A good amount of time is spent taking care of activities that support teams should have handled, but instead push the responsibility to others by responding to e-mails ""We are not customer facing""."
good,"Work hard and you will be rewarded, fun team and good management. Great progression and amazing benefits, i've met amazing people and had good training."
good,Apple is a good place to work. There is a lot of team work and generally a fun place to be. The compensation needs to be higher it i rated as about 28% below average alarm.
good,"8 to 9 hour shifts, helped out anywhere between 10-30 people a day"
good,learned great customer service skills from apple and how to deal with very irate customers and how to turn a bad situation into a positive situation
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,A typical day at work for me is exciting and very diverse when it comes to other employees. I get to speak with all types of cultures which to me is very entertaining. I have a great rapport with my managers and coworkers. The hardest part of my job is not being there and the most enjoyable parts of my job is pleasing my customers and knowing that I solved their issue.
good,"Working at Apple is a great experience. Whatever the role you take, you will enjoy the people you work with because Apple hires good people. The days are long but the move quickly depending on the store. Product launches are a blast for the insanity. If you like helping people, take the job."
good,Culture is great. Pay is pretty low. The opportunity to advance is great. Co workers are a true team. You need a lot of energy to work there.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Apple. I loved the people and the hustle, I also really liked the potential within the company."
good,A liderança da empresa no mercado com produtos inovadores é refletida no ambiente de trabalho e clima organizacional. Gestão de pessoas e bons benefícios são pontos fortes.
good,"Very open and lax job culture. However very hard to maintain a proper work life balance, as well as move up in the company. Advancement is more so a popularity contest, and raises are minimal at best."
good,"Systems analyst."
good,"While I have loved working at Apple, the retail level isn't a permanent home. While jobs like Target or Walmart are great for the high school/college kid who need something to last until they find a career, Apple Retail feels like it is for post-grads who just don't know what they want to do. I, myself, am someone who never got a degree and am happy with Apple as a fall-back. If I had a degree, I would not have been at Apple for as long as I have."
good,"Great Place to work."
good,"Working for Apple from home might be one of the greatest experiences. Typical day includes helping out many, many customers with their issues with various Apple devices. It's been such a great experience becoming so knowledgeable about all of Apple's technology."
good,"Apple is a place where the sky is the limit. For those are motivated to learn and be challenged."
good,"I held a position as an at-home Tech Support Advisor for Apple via Kelly Services.  Primary functions include but not limited to customer service, tech support, and troubleshooting and issue resolution for Apple customers with iPhones, iPads and iPods."
good,"Great culture, fabulous products that you're selling with great management teams that really have an ability to motivate & inspire."
good,Upscale retail job with high benefit perks. The culture is amazing and my coworkers are like my family and life long friends. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting all different types of people from CEOs to actors to international tourists.
good,"Typical day is logging in and taking chats or phone calls all day. "
good,"At apple, they placed the customer very high and did indeed want to satisfy their needs and wants.  I assisted customers to track orders and to make new or additional orders. I also assisted with any issues such as returns for various reasons, and gave product information.  I learned how to use a MAC computer , which is a little different than a PC. The management was open to suggestions and prompted all employee interaction and input in weekly staff meetings.  As an extremely diverse workplace, there is no shortage of awesome and interesting people. There was no way you couldn't find someone to talk with and connect with. The hardest part ( which wasn't all that bad ) was the mandatory overtime each quarter that lasted 1-2 weeks. It was only ""hard"" because it meant a 12 hour shift  for each day you sign up for. However they did provide dinner sometimes as well as special treats occasionally.  My favorite part was the fact that they have a cafeteria on site.  No more having to decide what to take for lunch or forgetting it or going out for junk food. They have several options daily including gluten free and vegan options including deserts."
good,"Corporate is great, retail is retail. The problem is, you don't really work for companies, you work for people so it's different in every market."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I absolutely loved working at Apple. One of the biggest perks is they give you the opportunity to try many different facets of the retail world very quickly. I was part of 5 different teams in the 3 and a half years I worked there, and it was simply because I asked. "
good,"What a great place to start a career. This company demands excellence down to it's very core. If you put forth the effort, you will make a good career in this company. Hard work typically pays off here. The pay is outstanding, and only gets better. The benefits only got better during the years i worked there. The insurance is amazing, and the perks are numerous. Don't be surprised or discouraged if you don't get hired. They have the highest turn-away rate of any company in retail. If you get to make it to a hiring event, just be kind, out-going, and eager to learn. Your efforts will be reciprocated. I learned how to manage my time and thrive under immense pressure, The hardest part of this job would be some of the customers. We pull in so much variety. I can say I have met some of the nicest people and some of the meanest people I have ever encountered in my life at that store. Management is usually good, but changes a lot. Sometimes it feels like they push you too hard, but that's sort of what makes a god leader. I trust must of them to make the best decisions in both the interest of the customers and the employees. OH and one more thing; this company is always changing from the ground up. It's one of its best and worst qualities, but if you want to work there, get use to it."
good,"Apple is a great place to work for those looking to advance with a fast growing company. Even if you do not wish to move up with the company, you will gain so much knowledge, not only about the product but at a personal level too."
good,"Helping customers find the best solutions and products for their situation. "
good,"Apple is a great place to work. You meet and work with some amazing people. They offer great perks such as discounts. If you're lucky you will get a great store leader like I did. "
good,"If you want to work in an environment that challenges you and builds you, Apple is a great place to work. Its a great place to build yourself and gain knowledge in not only technology, but also customer service and how to adjust in a face paced evolving environment. It is a competitive work place in terms of advancement, but if you perform well, stay professional, and build others around you as well as yourself, then it isn't as bad. The down side is dealing with difficult customers at times, however the plus side is being able to enrich the lives and create relationships with the good ones."
good,"Great place to work, no complaints. just didn't provide enough pay for my education"
good,"Was a contractor"
good,"As a specialist I use my ability of multi-tasking by doing either multiple transactions at a time or having multiple interactions while still making sure all customers are getting the correct experience in the store. My solutions for Macs and iOS devices have continuously met store requirements. I strive to not only learn the specifications of our Apple products but to learn more about our essentials and accessories so that the complete solution is met every time, no matter which device is purchased. I’ve taken part in the Mentor, Loyalty, Business, and Visual team and have learned several different aspects of what it takes for the entire store to operate instead of just one specific area"
good,"Apple has managed to put together an ingenious matrix for hiring in its retail environment. I have had the privilege to work with some great people. I truly believe a happy workplace starts with happy people.  I'm not sure what the protocol exactly is, but it is a beautiful thing. Having co-workers that are reliable, thoughtful and caring is something that astonishes me daily."
good,"Apple is a great place to work. Every day there are challenges to cope with that makes me stronger.  I have learned how to tell customers bad news and good news.  I have also learned how to work better with a team and to rely on others to get the job done correctly.  During a typical day i see around 15 different customer with issues to their devices.  I have to figure what is causing the issue and try to fix it in a timely fashion.  When there is a cause for a bigger issue or just a Major Customer service issue the management is there to help backup or help come up with a a creative solution.  Apple is a fun place to work,"
good,"Checking emails with incidences, raised tickets with provider, reconciliations in SAP, journals, meeting and calls with HR and provider to resolve the queries in Payroll for the 600 employees who are under my responsability"
good,"Apple has lead me to learn and grow in numerous ways. It has provided areas to learn and excel, but at the same time, grow stagnant. "
good,"Work from home opportunities are great"
good,"Serving Apple as a tech support advisor can be daunting at times, but also rewarding."
good,taking calls from customers documenting and transferring to the proper location
good,"At Apple, they want you to be smart, nice, and patient. At first you work in sales part-time. From there you have a couple of lateral options to become more acquainted with the different aspects of how the store works. I chose the path of Family Room Specialist full time. Then, if there is an opening or you're willing to relocate, you are able to interview for a promotion with better pay for one of the more concentrated roles. The choices are basically a higher tier sales position, training position, technician, business liaison, and inventory management. I, personally, am a software nerd and love to train others on how to use it all more effectively. Yet my personal, unique experience at Apple Retail is that the position isn't available often. Afterwards, if you want to move up further, you might move on to corporate if you work near their corporate facilities or feel like moving near one. "
good,Apple was a good job to work. They had good benefits and it was fun.
good,"A typical day at work as a Genius meant you had a lot of tasks ahead of you. There were several computers that were ready for repair, several that needed troubleshooting, some that needed to be tested, and hundreds of appointments at the Genius Bar."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Gostei do ambiente de trabalho, das pessoas, do respeito pela diversidade cultural e do respeito pelas diferenças."
good,"Apple is a great company and has for the most part taken care of me very well during my 6+ years of employment there... The company has built a strong culture at the retail level overcoming inherent challenges in integrating so much diversity into its workforce..."
good,"Every Operations Specialist has a different role within their store. Some may spend most of their day on the phone with vendors. Others may spend their days inspecting elements in the store. Even more so, others plan the day out for their leadership team, and many do all of these things. But few do all of these things, support their Visual Merchandising teams, work on scheduling, and support the floor sales staff. This role allows each candidate to learn to flex time, prioritize, and work on multiple things at once. Expected in this role is a comfortability with upper management, willingness to train and educate others, and formidable communication skills. Prioritizing is essential, and cannot be taken lightly, since there are hundreds of things that can be done at any one time, that may positively or adversely affect store performance and appearance. However, seeing outcomes of selecting optimum solutions is incredibly gratifying."
good,"The Apple Store is a great place to work if you're in college because of the odd retail hours. The benefits are great as is the pay. However, if you have a family and you want to be able to see them on weekends and holidays I would suggest that you look elsewhere. I have worked at two different Apple stores and the experience at both was about the same."
good,"Wonderful colleagues, decent pay and great brand"
good,"Check updates to policies and procedure. Check inventory levels and pending customer requests. Reach out to clients, ensure relationship is in good standing. Create quotes and provide in-depth solutions. Preform business briefings and exclusive business client workshops. Provide peer/management feed back and develop strategies to grow Business to Business sales. I feel at my best when developing others."
good,Apple manufactures great products and leads the technology industry in innovation.
good,"A typical day on the production line is repetitive, but there is enough to do to keep it interesting and I like to have a visible target on the board to work towards."
good,"Apple overall is great! However as a person with a much more technical background that the position required I was not challenged. Opportunities are there for the right person to move up but to be overly technical you need to live in Austin, TX. or Cupertino, CA. or be willing to move."
good,"As a foodservice intern, I felt treated very well in terms of hourly pay, food, breaks, and having a voice. It is a very fast paced environment, which I enjoy, but can also lead to miscommunication. Still, that is understandable. I loved working with the executive chef! There was plenty of room for employees at CafeMac to learn responsibility, create their own recipes, manage their stations, etc."
good,"A typical day at work is fun and challenging. You encounter a great number of interesting people everyday. People who are geniuses and expect you to answer their most difficult question. People who sadly have a failing device and expect you to fix it without any setbacks. lastly, people who just want to learn and expect you to teach them. I've learned to be a mentor, a friend to a stranger, and support to my teammates at all times. Apple is a company filled with great minds and great people. The hardest part of my job was to support a client with technical difficulties within only 10 minutes. Although this was the hardest part, it was the part I also enjoyed the most. To resolve issues with ease or struggle through, made me happy when the client saw their device back to normal."
good,Apple is a fantastic employeer. Driven and talented individuals can progress and will always be surrounded by a wealth of experience and support.
good,Typical day is marrying the ideals of technically minded young professionals with a proficiency to providing transformational product experiences who are not experienced in Business to Business minded individuals who know little about the technology they need to make their businesses run more efficiently
good,Good company to work for on the corporate end. Lots of fun perks and looks great on a resume.
good,"Apple isn't for everyone. It's a stressful job, with terrible management. But it pays well, and the co-workers were amazing. I met some of my favourite people in the world while working there."
good,"A typical day is very busy a lot going on. I learned to be very humble, I also learned how to be a true leader in my role. Working side by side people who understand you and respect you was amazing. Management, they are pretty good to you. They understand work life balance. Very flexible. The hardest part of that job is accepting in the moment feedback and learning to take it and what to take away from it then learn how to reflect on it. The best part of that job was the people, internally and externally."
good,"Great place to work, great culture, awesome products. Management is very considerate and flexible with the schedule. Launches are so much fun!"
good,"An extremely fun and professional company. They're incredibly efficient and well run, but as with any company has its problems here and there. Primarily with how they promote amongst the company and how they tell you they promote. Scheduling is a bit of a mess as well as they lead you to believe that it will not be difficult to do your thing, but it works quite the contrary."
good,"Typical day for an inventory specialist would include receiving all shipments and processing them correctly. Maintaining all inventory, keeping a very high level of accuracy."
good,"A typical day at work consist of providing life changing solutions. Whether my client buys something or not, if I answer their questions, leave them feeling empowered and with solutions, my job is complete. This job does definitely tested my patience, and there are times when it can be overwhelming. However, the best part is that it strengthens my composure skills. Working for Apple is an experience like no other."
good,I have been with Apple for seven years and cherished my time with this innovative and foward thinking company. I have formed invaluable connections with people across the world and feel truly enriched from my time here.
good,"Apple is a great place to work, the benefits are great, culture is wonderful, it is one that suits a everyday relaxed person like myself. A typical day at work was very fun, not at the full expense of my peers though, it also comes from me doing what I love to do, help people with their everyday portable devices."
good,Support customers questions and concerns through the APPLE steps of service. Welcome customers warmly and ask for permission to further investigate any help we may provide. Present solutions customized for the customers needs. Listen to concerns that the customer may have and provide a satisfactory solution. End the customer journey with a fond farewell and a welcome to return.
good,Its fun working for a company right on the edge of technological advancement.
good,A great and fun company with unique management approach to identify product and service opportunities.
good,I worked there for two years and it was my best retail job to date.
good,Nice job pay was a bit low that’s why I left. If pay was higher I would’ve stayed. Worked from home as well. I don’t have anything bad to say about working there when I was in the office it was a nice laid back atmosphere.
good,"Great company overall, my only complaint would be the obvious culture shift that we have experienced over the last year or so in particular. When I was first hired i felt the emphasis was on customer service and giving the clients a unique experience that is often lacking in a carrier store. Several fellow employees are unhappy with Apples push to be more about the numbers game and ess about the interactions we provide to our customers."
good,"Depending on the team you join, apple can offer decent work/life balance with added benefits for all full-time employees. Although its not like a lot of other silicon Valley companies that get credit for offering free meals and university style work environment, I see apple as being more professional."
good,I worked for a company called Volt Workforce Solutions which is a repair shop for Apple products. My job was to disassemble and repair different parts the iPhone in a work station. I would also scan bar codes of the broken phones and enter the information into the computers.
good,"Got opportunity to learn new things. Good environment to work, co operative colleagues. Wonderful place for great engineers. Good working conditions..."
good,"Its a chance your hours will be cut, however its a great place to work.  I  have learned a lot from the company. I would recommend employment at apple to anyone that inquires."
good,"Overall a good experience. Essentially more work for less pay. Schedule changes are based off performance so that could be annoying. Also, your performance is graded by customers survey as well."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Good support in personal growth and success, the only thing I would say is that depending on the store you work at moving up in position can be difficult as the standard of growth is high and competition for promotions is also high."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Apple, and gained lot of knowledge. Worked with people who were top talent, and took lot of positive from them. Releases were painefull but overall good."
good,When I was working there the people I worked with made it worth coming to work. We would have parties together and enjoy each others company outside of work. Customers for the most part were kind.
good,work as contractor. no benefit but its good place to gather experience ad test automation engineer. People you work with are friendly and knowledgeable.
good,"Benefits are the best. Culture is great however there is no much room for growth unless you can move to one of the  corporate states. After 4 years I was bored and needed something different which the company could not offer me. One of the best job I had as far as benefits, however I grew out the Advisor position and I wanted to do something different."
good,"Very helpful onboarding process, supportive team and opportunities to grow within the company for the retail location. Requires commitment to position and the company to go far."
good,"Loved the company, and dept. great people who are brilliant but also slightly absent of others feelings at times. Overall great experience as long as you understand how to work with people mostly of engineering minds."
good,I had a great opportunity to work for Apple  in unfortunate had to leave for a sudden family tragedy. I hope to continue to work in a similar environment
good,"The company is one of the first that I can see truly do their best to try and make sure their employees are taken care of and well paid. The leadership does micromanage a little too much, but overall they generally have good intent."
good,"The best part of the position was that it was entirely remote with no expectations of ever needing to commute. The hours can be inflexible, however, as shifts can change every 3-6 months and thrust you from a morning shift to a closing shift with a few weeks notice. The pay was excellent, as were the benefits and insurance. There are multiple types of leaves available and the discounts are plentiful. Overall, management cares about you as a person, but they still treat you as an employee, not necessarily a person with a nuanced life needing some flexibility as things arise. There are very few advancement opportunities, even to go into management. After a few years on a the job, the only movements are lateral to pick up additional skill sets within the company."
good,"There is no downtime.  You will always be busy.  You will always be multitasking.  You must take responsibility for your career path, growth, and securing time to learn.  If you don't, you will get left in the dust.  Apple has an amazing product, but in all reality, it is still retail.  Customers expect a lot for what they are paying for, will have complex problems, will be demanding of your time and the volume of product information can be overwhelming.   The biggest drawback to the job is that you sell a lot of iPhones to customers who hate their phone carrier policies and that animosity carries over to the Apple sales experience even though the two are not directly related."
good,Okay environment pay was not great and it was a third party for a company that had Apple Acct . I did learn sales experience from it I also learned time management being on time and I learned about the products
good,"Working at apple is challenging and rewarding. Its a good place for people who are outgoing and energetic and are always looking for a challenge.  Its always changing, always growing and a fun place to be. There are times in which dealing with customers can be tough. Management is fun and caring."
good,Daily huddles before shifts were a great way for everyone to be aligned for the day. They’re big on leading by example and jumping up at opportunities.
good,"Amazing company to work for. Great health benefits"
good,I enjoyed informing them of how the products worked and which ones would work best for there lifestyle. I enjoyed being there but at times it was stressful.
good,overall everything was fine.  sometimes things at Apple got a little emotional by other employees.  there was always a question as to how management would allow so much on-site drama.
good,Days went by very quickly because of how busy it is in the store. You interact with customers on a constant basis and it can be overwhelming and stressful at times.
good,"Perks, amazing benefits, and a culture of acceptance.  Apple is the place to build up your skills. While it is hard to stand out  in the large company, success is still recognized. Highly recommend Apple as an employer"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"People are friendly ( except HR)  a lot can be learned from colleagues, supervisors, and managers are friendly and helpful, work is not difficult but fun."
good,I enjoyed working there.  Employees are required to learn how Apple products function and interact with customers.  You help customers fix issues they are having with Apple products and place repair orders.
good,"New hire training was very thorough and useful, although time spent in transition unto role was not best fitted for the fast environment, could use a longer nesting period."
good,It was a place where you always knew what was expected of you day in and day out. You were required to work and assist people from all walks of life and it caused me to broaden my won horizons.
good,Excellent place to work. it is also one of the best company to learn more and more. Got Excited to share war room with the legends of Technical world in certain  complicated tasks.
good,"Apple is a great company to work for in terms of benefits and perks. I worked as an At Home Adviser for 3 years, they sent me a 21 inch iMac cause of my visual impairment. When you have great management things run smoothly you can improve. However every 3 months we changed management and that's really destablizing. I changed departments 6 times in 3 years!! Also had to work holidays."
good,Travel required of up to 20-25%. Hours are shifted starting late day into night time when working with China. Ramp timing is always hectic. Benefits and RSUs are great.
good,"I was always treated fairly, and paid on time! Apple puts a lot into making sure their community is maintained and the culture is kept alive. They did a lot to keep their employees happy."
good,I got better experience on my interpersonal communication skills while working here. The most enjoyable part of consulting for apple was i got to play with apple devices and better understand them
good,"I have met the quality guidelines. keywords that will probably let me through to the next screen include: typical, day, learned, management, workplace, culture, job, hard, enjoy."
good,"Apple Retail is a great place to work. Co-workers are typically fun, customers can come off as entitled but that is found anywhere that sells or repairs luxury items. Benefits are great. The atmosphere on the floor is controlled chaos; managers are typically hovering around to be sure everyone is doing their jobs UNLESS they are a *favorite* employee, who can pretty much just stand around with management and chat until they're desperately needed. Retail shifts are 9 hours with a 1-hour lunch break or 4 (no break) - 6 (30 min break) hours for part-time employees. You'll be selling or troubleshooting all day long, so you have to be able to hold a conversation. I highly recommend working at Apple, it's an extremely rewarding job with great co-workers and fun technology."
good,"Geniales beneficios de empleado "
good,Lots of opportunity to learn new skills and to work with a wide range of people.  Good group of people to work with. Never a dull moment always changing.  Good support team.
good,At Apple there are so many different type of projects that one learn a lot of skills and technologies. During my time at Apple I got to work with very good managers who gave sufficient flexibility and empowerment to drive projects in decentralized decision making environment.
good,Apple is very much what you expect it to be. Fast paced environment which requires you to be alert and efficient yet the chill vibe of the employees makes it completely enjoyable!
good,"Decent work, but it's a pretty strict schedule when working from home. You are on the phone the ENTIRE shift, often dealing with customers that have no idea what's going on, which can be very difficult. After being on the team for a few months, asking for help is looked down upon."
good,"They have a great culture and when the holidays comes around, theres plenty of staff and plenty of hours to work. Out of all the retailers I've know, it seems only Apple knows how to work a holiday payroll. They staff their floors appropriately and never allow there to be a staff shortage. Although if they see business is slow for whatever reason, they will send employees home. Managers and supervisors are always upbeat and are willing to help when they can. They aren't hiding in the office or on the phone in a meeting all the time."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I have only worked at apple for a year and I can say that it is definitely a great place to work. "
good,This was a fine place to work.  Loved the subsidized food and coffee/expressos.  Not a lot of cross over in departments.  People were very nice and helpful.
good,"Good work environment with good culture. Company has high standards, but is not stressful. People are expected mostly to manage their own workloads and to be self-starters."
good,"I would consider myself really lucky for getting the opportunity to work at Apple, the culture and environment is so friendly and supportive and its a great way of uplifting my career and open lot of doors for myself."
good,"Tons of co-workers leads to you finding new friends, combined with technology that unleashes passion (photography, music, games etc.) makes this one of the funniest places to work.  Training is thorough and you'll realistically be on your own in a month."
good,"I work and my team is amazing and great!"
good,I enjoyed my time at apple but the seclusion and loneliness pushed me away. I also did not like the system they use for taking calls. The back to back calls were also an annoyance as you can be on an hour long call but still have another call 30 seconds right after being on one
good,Apple can be a great place to work.  More often than not you get out of it what you put into it.  The best thing is the culture at Apple.  They truly accept everyone.  Huge supports of the LGBQT community.
good,Apple in the four years that I worked there went through a change from an fun open and environment to more a corporate feel that tried its best to hold on to it's origins. You could sense the importance of selling and meeting certain numbers by the time that I left which wasn't as prominent when I first started. I didn't mind as much as it is a business and I enjoyed all facets of it.
good,"I didn’t have any career before but they hired me. While I was there, I was really happy to work. Sometimes there’s lots of dramas going on tho."
good,"Apple is an amazing place to work. Innovation central. In house technology evolving, but slow to adapt to change. People are amazing - wonderful energy and intelligence. Nature and pace of work results in tough work/life balance."
good,"Its a great job to work from home"
good,"I had no idea what i was stepping into when i got hired, the interviews don't do it justice, between the atmosphere of the store to the employees  that you work side by side with are all small surprises every day,"
good,"I enjoyed working was very organized, and stable with great hours, also I had a couple really cool managers that I got to work with. Although things and people where moved around a bunch it was organized"
good,Enjoyed working at their data center.  Learned about how they stage setup their servers and interconnect them.  Only problem was the job was a 1.5 hour drive way.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple provides many challenges to those willing to accept them. It's a fast-paced environment with heavy demands on performance and accuracy, understandably so."
good,I worked with so many great people who have become lifelong friends. It pushed me to get out of my comfort zone and learn new skills. Great experience
good," is a great place with a culture that is second to none. You are placed in a demanding atmosphere that pressures you to be your best always, and to rise to levels of productivity and creativity you never thought possible. The retail grind is a realistic factor, and can make scheduling in your personal life difficult."
good,"A typical day is fast-paced, unpredictable, and sharpens your mind. The people have a lot of self-drive, are willing to help, and are more like you than you think."
good,"great company, super fast paced, a lot to learn. Apple gave me a chance being 18 years old as a self made entrepreneur repairing and replacing apple devices myself at a young age. They hired me on the flip of a coin put me in a tech role, and within 6 months explore my sales side to only better me by positioning my title as a business expert. Because of my ability to patiently focus on one person at a time individually but collaboratively & simultaneously work in a group they moved me up so soon. I left to marry my newly wed tech skills and drive for learning to the Code and developer side and become a Full Stack Web developer. Thanks Apple for helping me explore my passion."
good,Try and find parking buzz in out my stuff in the locker wipe down my station clock in  log in to the phones and start taking calls help customers one by one might take a bathroom break or a snack then get back on the ones for a couple more hours then lunch that’s 45 minutes the log back in take calls till it’s time to clock out
good,"I enjoyed working at apple.  It has opened the door for other opportunities.  Other employers also think pretty highly of Apple.  They are a very hard company to be hired for, but once you do, you will certainly benefit from the job."
good,"This job was interesting and stimulating. I always felt that I was at forefront of new technology and new methods of problem solving. But honestly, the best part of this job was the amazing cafeteria."
good,"Work from home"
good,"Il y a plusieurs points de vue concernant plusieurs sujets."
good,"Apple is a great place to work, if you're working with the right team of people. It's easy to get caught up in the social aspect if you aren't focused. Finding a work life balance can be difficult, but the opportunity is there if you work hard for it. The best part of the job was having the ability to turn someone's day from a negative to a positive. The hardest part of the job, for me, was managing it while also trying to manage responsibilities outside of work along with my social life. The culture is a little different in every store.  A typical day involved assisting customers with their device needs and making sure they knew how to use said devices. I have nothing to say about management because each store is different."
good,Working Remotely helped me evolve as a parent having the time to spend with my son was truly the most amazing experience. Even though we had a at home office experience team work and senior leadership was never far away.
good,"I can not begin to explain working at Apple it was awesome, I did not know that much about the computer world prior to working at Apple they taught me everything I needed to know."
good,"Don’t hesitate to ask for more when they make you an other! "
good,"As a company, I enjoy being an employee of Apple and am even proud of it at times.  I get paid well, my benefits are great and the policies are, for the most part, understandable and typical of an inbound call center environment.  It's difficult to move up but it's not impossible, but with so few positions for so many employees one can often feel stuck.  And in this job, that can be so mentally exhausting dealing with end users as we do, it can put you in a real rut."
good,"Outside of the normal retail issues, working at Apple Retail was an amazing experience. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Apple for over 10 years.  If you're giving them what they want from you, they love you.  If you make a mistake, there's 0 tolerance and you're quickly treated like a leper or outcast."
good,"Since this is a requirement, I will only say that I am only doing this because I am required. Thank you but you can skip to the next review for possible insight."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,That it was good pay 8hours 13.50 five days a week n Saturday was over time I work night shift 8pm to 4:30am in the moring was told about it from a friend
good,"I was responsible for managing computer parts for repair. The bad parts were sent in we turned around and gave customer good parts to repair customers PC. I worked for distrubtion and sales sometimes. I helped set up warehouse, drove forklift, and helped ship parts to vendors,"
good,"lots of multitasking at a decent pace. encourages honesty and feedback, with lots of support. it is retail so the customer service issues are the hardest part of the job but most of the people who work there are nice and understanding."
good,Working for Apple is fantastic. You get wonderful perks! However working for AppleCare is a bit different. Some of the benefits only applied to corporate and not applecare. AppleCare is very strict and very disorganized. It changes your job contantly. I was moved from manager to manager. I had a new manager every month for the 1st six months I was an AHA AppleCare Manager. This doesn't build you for success and makes it hard for you to advance because no one manager knows you or your work well enough to recommend.
good,"I was very fortunate to land this job through of course constant applying and I never regretted it. It is a friendly atmosphere, always something to do and learn and if you love technology this is your place. You are mostly encouraged to buy the new products not because they verbally tell you or indicate it in anywhere, it just due to your employee discount and just the way the product is designed."
good,"The pay was well and the hours were plenty, with opportunities for overtime. Typical working hours (8-5 or 9-6). If you don't want to work weekends then this isn't for you because you are required to work at least one weekend day (Saturday OR Sunday). But you will have opportunity to work at least 40 hours"
good,"Responsible greeting and helping Apple Employees catch the right shuttle/Coach at the Transit Center"
good,"Wonderful canteen with many food choices."
good,"- On-the-floor training"
good,"I received some of the best training while working at Apple. The skills that I developed while working there, have, and will continue to help me succeed in many other areas of my professional career."
good,great place to work. Great people highly qualified. Anyone that is looking for a great opportunity this is the place. Takes a bit of time to get promoted.
good,As a developer support agent I provided assistance to developers from Europe and the UK with documentation processes completion. I also resolved and advised on issues developers would encounter during the developing process using Apple technology.
good,"After working in Apple Retail for over a decade, you get a lot of benefits including nearly a month of vacation every year. The challenge is that it pays too much for a retail job, but not enough for a technical support job."
good,"the workplace is very good. "
good,Plenty of opportunity except the department team managers are really not up to date with their management skill. But it is a great place to start career
good,"Its a nice company to work for it just wasn't for me, I didn't learn anything in training, you are pretty much on your own, No help at all"
good,Apple is an excellent company to work for. It is challenging and high paced but rewarding. You can really learn a lot both professionally and personally
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Morning staff meeting to go over task’s at hand and any safety issues"
good,"Loved my team , we were always helping each other in our tasks and I enjoyed that."
good,"Apple is an excellent company to work for, and I can say that with confidence. However, it's also very difficult to negotiate with management once you're in. "
good,"Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. It is considered one of the Big Four of technology along with Amazon, Google and Facebook."
good,"Being frontline defense for all inbound calls for apple it can be a bit stressful. However, they give you plenty of tools and resources to solve the problem."
good,"Great job overall filled with great staff. A great learning environment for not only new and improved products, but also for life lessons. I definitely enjoyed my Apple experience!"
good,"Apple is a fun work environment that can be stressful as well. "
good,This was a temp job that shot a commercial for Apple in Gillette Stadium. Production was made by 3rd party company. I was not directly employed by apple.
good,"Fast-paced, loud, but often very fun!"
good,"The overall work quality is great, and there are a lot of benefits you can receive. Coworkers are nice, and get along mostly. I was seasonal even though my numbers were great, they first picked referrals to keep. The training is a month long and there's a lot of information to take in."
good,Apple maintains a family employee environment. Management is great to their employees and accommodating to work life balance needs. The the team was great during my employment. Good benefits with an acceptable work life balance.
good,Working for Apple through Volt inc was great because it was fair pay and we were able to do everything that we needed to understand the job functions in the Apple environment.
good,As an Advisor for Apple and iTunes Department I was the first point of contact for an expanded variety of customer types including end users and educational institutions. In this position I took inquiries from our customers to assist with diagnosing issues and handling account and product questions. I resolved issues typically focused around specific product segments addressing both hardware and software issues. I also was responsible for reporting/escalating issues and problems through appropriate channels.
good,"great job to work with. great managers, support their employees and great benefits. the only thing it was hard that i was at home and needed to have the face to face interaction."
good,"I enjoy the role and the team that I worked with, No one day is the same. lots of ways to improve while working there - courses that can further careers and knowledge plus Apple gifts"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Great company, nice people and good management."
good,"Apple was a fun place to work. It is full of energy and creativeness and ingenuity.  However, the hours for a family of nights and weekends do not give a true life work balance. If I was single and had no family it would be great, but with family not so much."
good,"Plein d'avantage, bonne première expérience, mais beaucoup trop grand et compétitif pour pouvoir se demarquer"
good,I would work here again. Fun work environment. Gym on the grounds . Cafeteria was good. Management is good. You can really grow in the organization if you put the time in
good,"-Macbook products validation."
good,Great culture and lots of opportunity for learning and advancement. Poor work-life balance due to retail schedule. I learned a lot working there and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is starting out and trying to figure out what they want to do with their life.
good,Apple is a family oriented atmosphere where you the care and concern of your superiors provoked a desire in you to work. Based on my experience at apple  I believe the flourishing of a business starts with caring for the needs of your employees first and then meeting the  needs of your customers - apple knows the art in doing that.  They also care genuinely about the needs  and concerns of their customers and take urgent and percise measures in meeting their needs.
good,while apple had its fair share of problems I learned the value of what true customer service is and how to put the customer first in everything I do. I was able to be thrown into different situations where problems solving was a must. and thinking outside the box. it helped expand my views and my mind set for the work place and how to handled problems in the work place not only with customers but employee as well. I have been able to cultivate that in to the energy I put in to my work at my current position at Chestnut hill hospital.
good,My typical day at work is a breeze. I love helping the customer that call the lines.Management is cool and they work with their advisors. There is really not a hard part about this job.
good,management is so so.. no face to face everything is done over face time or in chat . very fast pace and somewhat stressful. training was very good and organized. its done through a virtual classroom
good,"Apple is really focused on people, whether it is their employees or the thousands of customers we welcome into our doors everyday. It's really nice working in an environment where everyone has your back and encourages your growth."
good,Good culture good balance.  Managers and Supervisors made sure everyones voice is heard.  Went out of way to make sure people where comfortable in the work place.
good,was so long ago i cant remember much of the typical days but the role was very engaging and proactive. the management was poor but it didnt distract me from the task at hand and i excelled in my role for my time there.
good,"- Very collaborative culture "
good,The Supervisors and Managers seemed a little too intimidating.  The work was simple and was not hard at all to carry through with.  They are pretty persistent with making no errors.
good,It was nice to sit at home to work.  Management was nice and was always willing to work with you. Lots of help when needed. Sometimes being forced to work overtime was not fun but think about the extra money in your check.
good,"Good services"
good,"Day to day responsibilities included break/fix, sales, management of 10 employees or less during an 8 hr shift. "
good,"Enjoyed my time there  Learned extensively and appreciate the culture "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Provided user support on OS X and iOS platform and assisted customers with finding the right product for their needs at home or work."
good,"Great job. Work in production work long hours assembling computer chips, testing that they actually worked. Warehouse work standing for 8 plus hours a day."
good,"Superior customer service and education on products. Apple is well known for high-end customer service and every one I worked with displayed enthusiasm in their roles, management was great and flexible with schedules, the workplace culture was diverse and interesting to learn about everyone of my colleagues. A typical day of work varied from sales, teaching workshops on Apple products for customers, inventory, and making sure appointments for device repairs, setups, and diagnostics were on time and accounted for. The most enjoyable part of my job at Apple was the people I worked with, the extensive technical knowledge I learned, and meeting customers from all over the world! The hardest part was sudden shift trades or changes, even though I was still able to manage this with my schedule."
good,"Its a great place to work, you get to learn a lot, its diverse, depending on the management, there can be lot of politics involved when it comes to playing favorites"
good,"The most difficult things about working at Apple are common issues with retail in general: often understaffed, variable schedules, and very busy holiday seasons. Excellent benefits, discounts, and promotions for employees and a great culture help make it worthwhile. The managerial styles, however, can be quite variable from one store to the next, creating either significant opportunities or roadblocks to personal development within the company."
good,If you are a tech savvy person and you like Apple products this is the place for you! The culture is one of a kind and the people are great. Learning is a must! Become the best you can be!
good,"Apple is a great place to work.  It is a positive environment that encourages their employees to do the best they can in a supportive environment.  Although I felt that I did feel that my position was not ideal for me, I did enjoy my time there and have nothing negative to say about my employment there."
good,"Get benefits, even for part-time employees, and great company culture! Make sure you take advantage of all the perks and take care of yourself it will make work easier."
good,"Great company! NICE PEOPLE! Hard to network at home. Have to preform every day!"
good,"Apple is a great company to work for. Day to day was easy and they are supportive. But if you don't live and breath apple, you could have a hard time."
good,It could be little hecktic and some customers are computer literate.  This can create issues if they are unable to follow basic instructions. The training was easy and they had mentors that helped us along the way. There was always help when we needed it and it was easy to communicate with superiors.  The customers may blame you for problems beyond your controle.
good,"I worked here as a contracted employee through an agency. Though I was treated fairly well I did just feel like just a number...a basic cog in the machine per se. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of people I met while I worked in the warehouse. I have mixed feeling about my experience working here so I believe it is safe to say that it was okay working here."
good,"Apple has an environment of learning to assist and progress."
good,"Great place to start, if your looking for entry level work that will give you meaning and be a great starting point on really developing your resume. I would recommend this as a top 3 place to work in Austin."
good,"- Fun environment "
good,"Pay"
good,"I had a great time working at Apple, Learned a lot about their products as well as assisted customers the same. A great and innovative company to work for."
good,Great role and company. Can be hard to navigate and highly political. Low ceiling after you rise to a senior position. Lots of ego from people that should be humble.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"The job is great, its just like working in a call center or office except you get to work from the comfort of your own home. All the benefits of not having to travel to work. The hardest part of the job is just working alone and being at home all day. In this position you need a quite room or place with a closed door. If you like being at home and not having to meet or talk to people in person, this job is perfect for you. Overall this is a good job, great company to work for with plenty of benefits and opportunities . Just wish I could work away from home once and a while and meet ppl."
good,This is a great company to work for. The training are available for each person to take their development in their own hands. This company is full of resources for professional development and growth.
good,"Apple offers outstanding benefits and works with great products. However if you are going into a technical support role and are not a people person, keep in mind that a apple is a very large company. There are a lot of customers. This translates into a lot of social interaction with so many different types of people that for someone severely introverted his could become a problem."
good,"When starting at Apple, everything is amazing. When you're there for a few years and you have been talking to people that work for ""the others"", you feel left out. Salary is usually lower, benefits are worse, perks are a lot worse, but you're expected to do the same or more. The benefit they keep dangling in front of you is: you work for Apple! That only carries you so far."
good,Apple is certainly a great place to work.Even if you are working from home you are still connected  to the culture and expansiveness of the Apple culture
good,"Good Benefits, Culture is very positive"

good,"lots of exciting things going on at Apple. "
good,"Professional Training is provided"
good,"Everyday was pretty unique in its own way. Never really had the same issue, and if it was, it was easy to fix and quick."
good,"Not going into detail, but a proud company, that has it's ups and downs. Most if not all days are hectic as it is a still a retail job but it does have its cooperate benefits."
good,Easy and fun. The work day is really simple. Basic call center position. One hour lunches and two thirty minute breaks. Managers are helpful and want to see you succeed.
good,"A good place to work, and get a promotion, lots of benefits, and a good place to grow, I would recommend this company to anyone who want to go place and improve their skills"
good,"There is always the good and the bad about every place, but apple has a veery supportive culture, great stock and benifits.................................."
good,Apple retail is okay for a retail job. Very chaotic and the managers are probably overworked but the people you work with are great for the most part. The pay isn't great so jobs there don't really work out well for those with families or those who live in expensive areas. The benefits are pretty good for retail though.
good,"I worked at Apple a long time ago, when I first moved over to California. Work place was fun and productive, it provided a good learning experience. I would gladly go back to Apple if given the opportunity."
good,"Apple was a great company to work for. Met a lot of amazing people there and the benefits were amazing. Only thing is, they claim to want to help you move up and have better opportunities at Apple, but they make it near impossible for you to do so unless you suck-up to the right people. Well this was applicable to the specific store I worked for."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple est une boîte américaine, avec un management américaine, qui est quelque chose de très différent de tout ce que j’ai pu commettre en France."
good,"typical day it work is busy and loud."
good,"This company near my house,convenient and appreciated to join the same as company again if got chance. I am considering with the job relate inThai speaking."
good,I worked for apple and it got me through college with good pay! They do provide ways to grow but you own that development. Most days are hectic but it helps to learn how to work under pressure.
good,Working at Apple had its ups and downs and it was a fast paced call center environment. I loved assisting customers and trouble shooting different Apple products. It was a different issue daily and I learned a lot.
good,I worked there for years. It was awesome until i started getting harassed. Reporting to management did absolutely no good. My poor attendance (didn't feel comfortable at work) ended up being used against me by management to over shadow my complaints.

good,AHA college program provides maximum amount of untaxed tuition reimbursement yearly and provides a solid source of income with a very flexible schedule for college students.
good,A great place to work if you’re a patient person. It could be stressful at times but all customer service positions can be. It wasn’t hard but I don’t believe they provide adequate training.
good,"Best at home job to work for. Very relaxed. Good money, easy to work with. The job sent me everything I needed to complete all task. Never had a problem. Was in school at the time."
good,"The job is fun and the people you work with are amazing. "

The only part of the job I didnt like, was having to up-sell a certain amount of applcare plus to customers."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

good,Great place to work if you are a student or have another job. They're so flexible and supportive. Easiest job I've ever had. Unlike any other retail job seriously.

The store are split in sections Genius bar for technical support , family room to assist the children and parents on defining they needs and also of parental control information on how to protect they kids while using IOS devices by creating a Apple ID to be able to connect to App Store application . In overall a beautiful ambiance while working ."

good,"It is and was fantastic to work with the largest Tech Company in the world. It was a job in retail, but unlike any other retail job I had worked previous. "
good,"I learned how to manage different products such as Imac, Ipad, Ipod, Iphone, and Beats By Dre.  With this experience i will go far in the world of tech."
good,"High paced and high stressed position.  Benefits were excellent.  Limited opportunity for advancement in the home based agent role.  For an improved chance for advancement or parallel move to another department, need to move to a corporate location."
good,"Its good company to work, got to know about how the system work in Apple so it is nice experience."
good,The company was an outsouring for apple project. The salary and work-life balance overall is good but the management of the company that I am working at is not stable and create confusion for the employee.
good,"For some reason, your system thinks I worked at Apple, Inc. I did not. I worked for Apogee Networks as a field services coordinator. I am not sure how to correct this in your system. Thanks."
good,"My experience was to work on lot of integrations as i was dealing with Customer relationship management, lot of things change on the fly and there would be a need of support for the tickets, not that relaxing!"
good,It was lovely meeting customers from all over the world walk into the apple store. Friendly team. If you are a people's person I would recommend the job as you get to meet people from different walks of life.
good,"It was a good experience, working with the brightest minds at work. Learning was good since working on latest technologies was the core focus and it has a very good working environment"
good,Daily its a fun to work in a big company.Here i learned many things like having interactions with clients coming from different countries.We get rewarded for our work and there is recognigition.
good,Apple is known for their design and innovation. They are a big company with lofty goals and lots of smart people. I have nothing bad to say about my time at Apple.
good,No one can argue with the quality of Apple products.   Managers ranged from OK to GREAT.  Supporting systems at the time were OK at best and wanting most of the time.  Work Plant at the time was entirely inadequate (just too small) and the customers/ambiance suffered.  That has now changed for the better.
good,"Had its ups and downs.  Apple overall was a fun place to work.  Coworkers were cool and very helpful.  Management was pretty good.  Pay was not up to par though.  Also, they limit how many discounts you get per year which I did not like."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

good,"Overstressed zombies alert"
good,"Typical day would include at lof of meetting, there's a big focus on culture and performing the best customer experience possible. Not alot of establish process and documentation."
good,Apple is a good place to work with great people all around.  It's a fast paced company but it understands that people are people and have lives. Usually.
good,"Most of the time is spent providing technical assistance to customers rather than selling the products. The products sell themselves, so the main theme of your work is to provide the atmosphere and quality assistance for customers."
good,A typical day consist of helping customers decided which product they want to purchase by explaining specs on each product selected. I learned how retail businesses are managed. I learned how become a better salesman. Very diverse culture. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the inventory. there were so many products flying off the shelves at high demand at one time. the most enjoyable part of the job was setting up the showroom floor before a big release.
good,"This was a temporary call center set up to handle inquiries for Apple products during the holiday season.  There were 2 divisions, one for iTunes and one for iPhones.  I was fun while it lasted!"
good,"I love working with this company and client. Work culture is too good and work and personal life balance is very well maintained."
good,Apple was a great company to work for id love to do it again I didn't work directly for apple though I work for alorica a call center agency contracted by Apple
good,Great benifits. You really don’t need to know technology you just need the drive to be a people person and connect with customers. Open and friendly people.
good,"Challenging work environment with opportunities to contribute in a variety of roles including consumer and business sales, inventory management, technical support."
good,Must be willing to constantly be ready to learn and work with customers that feel more entitled then they should be. Very fast paced and can be stressful at times with customer request and product knowledge. Must have strong verbal communication skills to succeed at the job. Team atmosphere with great employees and managers.
good,"Fun, multi-culture and Dynamic Workplace. "
good,Productive and good work life balance. Fun place to work with and to learn new technologies and to face the challanges which helps to improve the overall work experience
good,"It taught great customer service and time management skills. It also taught me to be mindful of how time goes by so fast and to set timers to ensure I was in compliance,."
good,"I like Apple, Managers have their moments but I've been in worse retail spaces. Benefits and attendance policy is great. Very chill atmosphere and cool ppl to work with."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Former Genius (a retail position) it's a great job, but it's still a retail environment. Pay was OK, manager's could be better, and the work/life balance could be improved."
good,"Great company. Top innovation. Smart, teams. Great pay, bonuses and benefits. A very cool place to work. "
good,Great company and a very good job culture. I am enjoying every single day work at Apple. Both colleagues and the management are just like own family. It is a pleasure to wake up every day and get to work at Apple.
good,"My experience at Apple was unlike any other. I learnt many skills, mainly the ability to adapt to new and unique working conditions. I was able to keep up with the ever changing technologies. Apple taught how to quickly absorb new processes and programs. I was lucky to work with some of the top industry leaders who were interested in my profession growth and continue to provide leadership and mentorship as I progress in my professional career."
good,"I just finished a 12 (turned into 18) month contract and would recommend Apple to anyone who has a chance becoming a full time employee. The contract positions, however, offer no benefits, job security, and have mid to poor compensation. Work/life balance was great because you literally can only work AT the office and never take it home, much less any stress. Again, it's a fun place to work - challenging, with a great culture surrounding everything you do - if you're offered a full time job here, take it! If it's contract, maybe look elsewhere for something more permanent."
good,"Overall, the job is very exciting. It is a great opportunity to work for one of the best companies in the world. But ""you own your own development"" this is what our leadership tell us all the time. So if you want to look for further development, you need to find your own way to do it."
good,"Its Apple, what can I say...great company but as tech support the phones stay busy. But is a fun, fast paced environment and the clients are an interesting mix of people I recommend it for a young person who wants to learn about a great product and help people."
good,"If you like working at a fast paced environment with a constant of things to do, this is the job for you. Its a hectic job but has its own way of organization that still makes things feel together. The culture is about family and relying on one another."
good,Could able to learn latest technologies and had a chance to work on challenging environments where demand for high quality work .Pleasant environment to work.
good,Apple is a place good for young people. You can learn a lot things. The work is very challenge and everyone works very hard. But I don 't thing there is much room to move up. Because the system is pretty much matured and rigid. The only way is to wait for the new department comes out. But very unlikely.
good,"Apple is great. It;s a fast a fast paced environment. I worked in the store on 5th Ave, so it was busy every single minute of every hour. But the stock and healthcare options are great."
good,"Great benefits with company. Flexible schedule."
good,Good company and good people to work with. They help you overcome the bottle neck and hindrance in your routine working. Good place to work and learn new and challenging things.
good,"• Assisted new owners to become familiar with the Apple brand and current owners to get quick and efficient support"
good,"It was a nice enough experience. Career progression average. A lot of perks. Nice colleagues. A single very annoying management decisions made me leave. However, to my best knowledge, this decision was reverted lately."
good,"AppleCare is what phone tech support should be. They invest in their employees and provide all the training you could possibly need. They pay well, but I feel that half of my pay was in experience and learning how to handle calls and better my skills. If you are looking for an entry level position, like helping people, and are at all technically inclined... then you should seriously consider applying at AppleCare."
good,Apple as a company cares about its employees and will do whatever it takes to help when help is asked. It is never boring and an excellent place to learn new skills. Management changes from store to store however and will highly influence how you enjoy working there.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Ambiente agradable para laborar, y los supervisores como gerentes siempre atentos a su equipo de trabajo"
good,"I worked as a sales specialist and a back of house specialist.  Back of house is less stressful than selling on the floor, but still has its moments.  One thing that occurs often is a lack of coverage.  It seems Apple is trying to save money, so work that is meant for 2 people is placed on one person, especially if you work in the inventory part of the store.  Apple places a lot of emphasis on personal development, and offers many ways to do this.  Pretty good pay for retail.  Management tends to be slow to respond to complaints/suggestions.  There are multiple managers and they all have different styles of leading.  Some are more effective than others.  Some are not effective at all."
good,"Working at the Apple iStore has been a great learning experience. I have learned many things, starting from customer service to stock and finance management.  A typical day at work involves dealing with high value stock which requires accuracy in stock control, finance, etc. The management team is very helpful and always willing to help. The team as a whole is very dedicated and hardworking, there is a lot of positivity and encouragement from all."
good,"Fun project and get to understand the work of apple. The environment provides a very conducive place to empower work excellence and security. "
good,"My first day started with instruction with workplace, the safety feature, in and out time and other aspect of worked related matters. overall they have fantastic work culture."
good,Great job! Learn a lot being there within the year I was there...I got to really dig deep in my passion...and made me see what I am capable of doing a
good,"Great place to work if you don't mind retail hours. Great Benefits, fast paced environment. Turn over rate is somewhat high because it's a retail job."
good,"Apple is a company that cares about its employees and is always looking for new and more innovative ways to better both employees and customer experiences "
good,"Mooie winkel op het Leidseplein"
good,i worked at apple for some years. great place to work and amazing people. a few of the managers are not so good and will play favorites. i speak other languages and bring more to the table but they did not pay me more for this.
good,"Set up and configured hardware and software on company equipment."
good,"Amazing people, great culture. The retail side is a great opportunity to build life skills as well as professional. Career advancement is extremely tough, and transfer into corporate realms is virtually non-existant."
good,"A typical day at work with my co-workers is a good day, and they make it worth going into work every day.  I have learned so much from being with this company it has helped me in my interactions with others and lead me to have two amazing experiences within corporate and further develop those relationships and how to interact with people cross functionally.  The workplace culture is demanding and you have to be able to handle multiple things at once or you're going to fall behind and struggle.  This is the hardest part of the job, but the most enjoyable is that if you're willing to learn and eager to better yourself, those resources are there and your co-workers are the ones to help you.  Not leadership."
good,"Typical day was working with many teams and going through the release process, it was a good and fast paced environment and a steep learning curve. The motivation to work every day was good."
good,"A typical day in an Apple retail store is a busy day on your feet with very minimum sit-down time. Problem solving is a constant so stay on your toes. The benefits are excellent when compared to other retail jobs. Leadership is a mixed bag, but for the most part are good people. The toughest part of the job is something that cannot be helped - a retail schedule. Be prepared to give up on full holidays and set work schedules because you will be needed on an open availability basis. There's always room for negotiating preferred shifts, but its not a guarantee. The best part is working with such a complex and talented group of people. You will learn so much so fast because everyone wearing the blue shirt is a resource for something and everyone is working to make each other better at what they do."
good,"Apple was a challenging, but yet rewarding place to work.  There was always something to learn.  I would highly recommend to work there if you ever get a chance."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"This is a very focused place to work.  You will have many opportunities to learn new skills and to learn from some of the brightest minds on the planet.  You are expected to hit the ground running, and there is no hand-holding to get you up to speed on the job you were hired to do.  I highly recommend young engineers to seek an internship here.  The people were great to work with."
good,"The company as a whole is great, they seem to be all about ""Their People."" At the retail store level though things are not always as Apple makes it seem. In that department, the company could definitely use some major improving."
good,"Great place to work for anyone who has a passion for cutting edge technology as well as a pension for enriching lives through engaging customers via tech. Work culture is light-hearted and informative, always motivating employees to reach for greater. Great emphasis on the customer experience, but just as much focus on the experience of the employee. Multiple avenues for career advancement."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for.  Even through a contract experience my time with the company was enjoyable. One of the greatest assets is the ""Apple culture."""
good,I love the diversity and culture at the workplace. Definitely made me feel comfortable. Gym as well and a variety of stuff to choose from in the cafeteria. Also felt very safe with security and badge access to the buildings.
good,The job was easy and fun with excellent benefits. It was convenient with the time shift an the location was also Ideal. All the staff was friendly and co operative
good,I worked from home and it was not a bad job. They do however treat their tech position like customer service and not tech support. Left for better offer.
good,"Apple is a great place to work, but hours make it difficult to spend time with family. The people that work there are some of the best and brightest that I have ever had to opportunity to work with."
good,Good Work Environment and able to learn new technologies and study up in Network Engineer. It's a cool work and there are certain protocols to be followed.
good,"The job had a great culture, worked with great people with decent pay. Good discounts on products. Management was very fair and worked with you in areas where improvement was needed. Working as a technician is definitely more challenging and emotionally stressful than working in sales.  Company looks closely at your performance and numbers."
good,"I have been with the company for 4 years, and have had a primarily positive experience. Honestly they are one of the best companies i have ever had the pleasure of working for. The management takes the time to help you succeed.  My only complaint is that being in a  work from home position with long hours makes it very hard to wind down after my shift, and this is only compounded by getting off between 9 and 10 PM."
good,"Driven to always offer the best solutions for our customers"
good,"The compensation and benefits for a retail job are among the best you can find. However, working at Apple can be incredibly demanding and hectic. Additionally, doesn't all ways ""walk the walk"" when it comes to company values and culture. Although they preach about customer service, and don't mention any quantitative assessment during training, once you get on the floor you find out about metrics and targets related to sales numbers, Apple Pay, and business engagement."
good,"Trabalhar na apple foi um aprendizado muito grande, eu sempre gostei de tecnologia e aprendi muito"
good,"The people here at Apple don’t just create products — they create the kind of wonder that’s revolutionized entire industries. It’s the diversity of those people and their ideas that inspires the innovation that runs through everything we do, from amazing technology to industry-leading environmental efforts. Join Apple, and help us leave the world better than we found it."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,I wish I had stayed but the position I was gunning for was not available and I had a job opportunity elsewhere. I would recommend working at Apple if you are ok with being in a retail environment.
good,Working here was fun. Motivation level is high because you can expect positive results. Fun place to work and play.  Smart team members and leadership team. Some days tend to be long but well worth it.
good,"Apple is a very fun but challenging place to work, I was close with a lot of the employees. I learn a lot about Technology and myself. It can be stressful at times."
good,Very chill and great place to work. For the greatest tech company in the world. I always love that each day is completely different. My coworkers are the best people in the world.
good,"Management is fair and friendly if you have a good connection with them. Favouritism is an issue here, but if you work hard and connect with the managers you will do well"
good,"The hardest part of the job:"
good,Typical day at work is fast paced and goes by quickly. Management varies by store but is generally helpful and seems to want to help you in your growth with the company.
good,"It is a very good company to work with, perfect for those who love technology.learning process is very good they also provide lots of soft skill taring."
good,"Its a great experience where i learned a lot and engaged with multiple project. Amazing and massive training courses where i developed myself."
good,"Low turn over rate, employees are treated well. Management does everything it can to help advisors succeed. If you want to advance your career, they help you meet your goals and provide opportunities to help you gain experience in the area you want to advance to."
good,"Everyday can be different for me. We are zoned in different areas and in each area, we learn new things constantly. I am always up for a challenge. I get along with everyone at work, try to make them comfortable around me andI'm always available to help them when needed."
good,Working for Apple was an amazing experience. I learned so much about so many different things including myself while working here. The people that are drawn to this job are some of the most amazing people I've ever had the pleasure to meet. I highly recommend this demanding yet rewarding job.
good,"I will say that apple taught me how to work productively with a team and the people that apple hires are some of the warmest individuals that I have ever met. I worked as a genius for apple and found that the hardest part of my day was probably dealing with the loads of people that enter the door, but as I stated above, the people that apple hires, makes all the difference and not to mention the training is top class."
good,"Great people, great environment and faced paced career for the beginners our of school. At the ""C"" levels, they are consistent, but the lower ranks have problems collaborating."
good,"Mission driven, but great culture.  Collegial and friendly.  "
good,I've  had a good experience working at Apple because managers are friendly and do not make employees feel uncomfortable with extra pressure to make deadlines or not make mistakes.
good,"In de jaren dat ik bij Apple heb gewerkt heb ik mij zelf ontwikkeld op vele vlakken. Het gaat hierbij dan voor al om het nauw samenwerken met de diversiteit van het team. In een dynamische omgeving van de retail, techniek en logistiek is altijd een uitdaging om alles goed te plannen. Met trost mag ik zeggen dat ik voor Apple werkzaam ben in een internationaal bekend bedrijf"
good,Guaranteed 40 hours with at 1-2 hours of overtime every week average. Average starting pay. paid training thorough. however work-life balance for a parent of young kids is almost impossible
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Every day was different working at this Apple Store, and as a Concierge I was one of the busiest people in the store, making sure appointments ran on time and our guests were happy and taken care of by the Specialists (sales persons)."
good,"IT Support is not usually a fun environment, especially when taking calls all day from people of varying but usually low tech abilities. That said, Apple mitigates that by adding in several different benefits such as working from home, very generous sick and leave benefits (you never have to hope and pray someones approves your vacation request; if the time is available, you can have it), and of course great discounts on Apple products. "
good,Excellent employer. I have nothing to compiling about it. My coworkers were excellent and resources were available always.
good,"Being a Home Advisor for apple gives you the ability to work in the comfort of your own home office, while being able to work very closley with others within your team and department"
good,"Good Job Work/Life Balance"
good,"Productive and fun workplace."
good,"My typical day at work consist of taking in chats and helping customers with their iTunes account. Services could range from simple download issues to missing apps. My co-workers were amazing. Since, we worked at home the chat rooms were all we had. We made he best out of it when time was available. Even though the job was work at home, it still had its busy and stressful days. Especially around holidays and he release of new products. However, I did enjoy not having to physically talk to someone on a regular basis."
good,"It was as good a company as any, don't know if that's saying much. Nothing glamours at all. People are are people. Salary was cool and the holiday pay pretty nice as well."
good,At first it was hard to get settled and after that i enjoyed a lot at work.  learned a lot from the company. It was good experience overall. There was friendly environment between co workers.
good,"Very highly recommended work culture. Opportunity to lean new things, Very understanding management. Very helpful and understanding co-workers. Supportive and nurturing seniors and leads."
good,"I have been working at Apple as a contractor."
good,Working as an apple specialist is very rewarding. You meet different types of challenges everyday and you try to overcome those challenges by providing the best solution that benefits yourself and the customers.

good,Good benefits and room for advancement. Encourages a healthy work life balance. You can meet a lot of great people and offers many career opportunities.
good,"-good training"
good,"It's too good"
good,"Selling products, set-up of new products, trouble shooting, iPhone, iPad, and Mac computer workshop teacher.  So much to learn that I gained a lot of technical experience so as to educate customers of their best purchase choice and get them started with workshops."
good,"Fun place to work, where you meet so many amazing people. Its a very good part-time job especially while going to school. Max federal tuition reimbursement even for part-time employees. You will develop excellent communication skills that you can take with you the rest of your life. Not much opportunity for advancement in the retail sector."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Great place to work and fun.  Getting hired is long but once you are on you are in.  The job can be very hard and frustrating at times cause you are treated like a retail idiot but you have to know a lot of stuff which makes you want to get paid more.  Speaking of pay it is okay but for a company that makes the kind of revenue they make they could pay a little better.
good,"My avaliation of Apple is based not only in Apple, otherwise I would have given five stars on all options. But actually it's based on the two third-party companies in Brazil that I worked for in my time as an Applecare advisor."
good,I had a great experience working for Xerox on the Apple account. The pay is good if you don't have a college education. The training is a little short but the main focus is on the soft skills needed in the customer support role. The computer systems are a little difficult if you have never used a Mac but are easy to learn. A lot of activities go on as incentives for more pay and give away drawings for best stats and some things just for fun. The shift bids are far and few between but if you get a good schedule it works out well.
good,"Working from a home is a convenient and great opportunity. Home environment is just like a work environment. I've learned more about apple products since starting here. Management is the coolest, they really work with you and give you the tools you need to succeed. Co-workers are always ready to help and reliable team players. Hardest part about the job is not having any physical contact with anyone. Most enjoyable part of the job is being to stay home and still get your work done"
good,Fun environment with great staff. Their training program is absolutely phenomenal. They treat their employees very well and there is opportunity for advancement.
good,"I've had a great time at Apple, I started as a lowly phone agent in 2007, but in 9 years have increased my salary by 4 times and am doing jobs I never thought in 2007 I'd be doing now. Management is great, (keep in mind there are 10k people in this campus, and I've mainly worked in the operations side of things without a degree) albeit times the culture seems to be shifting from the bottom up worship of the past to a top-down middle manager methodology."
good,Apple is a wonderful company to work for with great benefits. The culture is unique in the industry.
good,"Working at the Apple Store is not for the faint of heart. Those who choose to work there will without doubt enjoy how upbeat, and fast paced the environment is. On a regular basis you will face both excited customers, as well as deal with all sorts of adversity from distraught customers who aren't happy about having to pay to repair their phone. Working at the Apple store taught me more than I could have ever hoped for. I now know how to make a customer extremely excited about a product they wanted to walk out with, as well as calm down those who come in less than upbeat."
good,"• I learned a lot about trouble-shooting my Apple iOS product"
good,"Its very challenging place to work, I am an Oracle DBA with 4 years of software project Management.

good,I love Apple! Working for this amazing company has blessed me in more ways than I could imagine. The culture at Apple is like non other!
good,"I learned a lot about myself, other people as well as more knowledge on Apple products. I learned how to communicate with people and to listen well in order to understand what people need and are asking for.

good,"A typical day at the Apple Store isn't typical at all. There's something new to encounter everyday there. New challenges, new experiences, it never gets old or monotonous. Learning there was a huge part of working for me, given that this was my first ever retail job. Therefore dealing with customers everyday and learning there personal needs and then trying to meet them was quite the challenge but yet enjoyable. And you could always count on your co-workers and store leaders to help you whenever you needed it."

Everything in constantly in flux, what with new products announced fairly regularly, to customers walking through our door with their own unique set of issues to be resolved.

As a chief physical therapist, I was given full freedom to contact him at any time regarding treatment of patients. He used to discuss about every patient before and after surgery which helped me sharpen my knowledge and perform the best."
good,Apple is very selective at choosing the best employees. I have never had a manager that wasn't polite and cared about your well being. Each manager wants you to prosper and grow that they meet with you every quarter to talk about goals and how you can improve. Their pay is great for a retail store. They are very considerate about your personal life and will accommodate you with emergencies and family issues. It is a very rewarding job.

Luckily I found this starter career early in my life, and while others I worked with chose to stay with the company for extended periods more times than not, I found myself growing bored with each promotion after a few months.

good,"In my time at Apple I worked with their inventory division. I learned a great deal with in the lines of leadership, structure, ambiguity, and etc.  I made a great deal of friends and what to me feels like family.  We dealt with many obstacles at Apple, but in my position we learned to work well together under pressure and the demands of the stores operations."
good,"Apple Retail is an incredibly fun place to work, although definitely demands the most out of you. The culture is absolutely amazing, and the benefits, even for part-timers, are great."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"From the time that we sign in using the computer based time clock, to the time we clock out using the same system, I am taking inbound calls concerning accounts and general information. My clients rely on me to retrieve accurate and relevant information. I have a supporting management team that I can rely on for support and information. My coworkers are an invaluable asset,  with a well of resources. Throughout the day I am challenged with multi-tasking and even wearing many hats (as needed, taking over other supervisorial and management duties)."

good,"I learned that I need to take fear less feed back because that is that only way I will improve myself. Not only did I learn how to work in a wonderful work environment, I learned how to use that skill in real life."
good,Just about everything concerning this job is great.  You get to meet a lot of great people(customers and employees).  Plus you get to play with all the best electronics.  The only problem is that management isn't very good at placing people in positions where their talents best suit the company.  They start everyone out in the same position but won't always position them appropriately after some time spent gaging their particular talents.
good,"Responsible for trouble shooting customers computers"
good,"A typical day in the Apple Store would consist of clocking in, checking and responding emails, and constant business with bilingual customers for the entire shift via phone or in person. Working with Apple allowed me to learn a great deal about electronics and the customers challenged me to always find a solution to multiple problems through out each day. The staff couldn't have been better, from the new hires to upper management. Everyone knew and performed their job while also helping others learn day in and day out. The hardest part about Apple was the inconvenience of work scheduling. The most enjoyable part was being able to help the most distressed customers and watching them leave relieved and satisfied."
good,"good team members to work with, a typical day at work is to learn something new, we learn about technology use, procedures, customer service"
good,"Working for Apple has been one of the largest drivers in both my personal and professional development. I have worked in 4 different roles within the company and have learned and developed in each of them. Management has been outstanding in helping me to develop and grow while driving unparalleled results. Working for Apple resets what it means to be good at your job. Being great is merely expected by leadership, at times this can cause you to push far beyond what you thought you could accomplish. While not always easy or enjoyable at the moment the reward is worth it."
good,"Apple Inc. is a wonderful corporation. Learned customer soft skills, product knowledge needed to be successful at job. Constant customer correspondence."
good,it was a good day with a lot of work to keep us busy I learned hoe to scan a product there

good,I am an Apple fan girl. I love the products and the services. I didn't even own a mac when I started there!!! I was a complete convert.
good,"There is no dull moment in Apple store. Once the store is open people flock inside the store to get an appointment or get to know the latest craze in town for technology. Being with Apple for almost 3 years is such a rewarding moment for me, everyday you learned new things and meeting interesting people along the way. We, as a team, we rely on each other. I can say that Teamwork is the key word for us. Our management always making it sure that we know the business acumen and whats our main focus for the day. They are always there for you whenever you need someone to talk to even on a stressful day."
good,"Working at Apple means you're in an environment with a very rich culture. Some people like that and some don't. For example, there are certain words that everyone says and gestures that everyone does without knowing it."

Although there were times where it could be stressful, it was always rewarding at the end of the day to know that you were able to help others, provide for their needs, learn something new, and build new friendships/relationships."
good,A great place to receive one on one tech support and bypass those horrible lines at Apple Computer Company.
good,Learned Squish and Python. Team is supportive.

good,"Nothing ever stays the same, it is a very fast paced, dynamic, ever changing environment."
good,"I was an over achiever, always exceeded expectations. I learned to work in a fast paced, constantly changing, dynamic environment and I thrived in it."
good,"Working at apple teaches you many things about life in general. It pays well for a retail job and is the best retail job. There are job politics, especially inculding management. However, what job doesn't?"
good,I answer questions to prospective buyers. I try to understand there needs and provide them with the best solution. If they chose to make a purchase I complete the sale using a device called Easypay. It's all done right on the sales floor without a register unless they pay cash. I also help answer technical questions for people who are already own apple products. The culture is excellent in comparison to other stores I've worked at. People there generally get along. Apple provides first class service and I have learned how to go above and beyond the usual retail experience.
good,A typical day at work would be assisting customers with iOS problems. This job also consisted of customer service and sales.
good,A typical day at work would include slow morning production to eventual fast production as the day progresses. I learned a lot about responsibility for your own work and interfacing with the boss about certain aspects of the job. Co-workers were hard working as well. Hardest part of the job dealt with having to deal with the hot weather and being able to adjust how you worked in order to get done without slowing down too much.
good,"Selling apple products is generally fun and exciting, but can become repetitive. The transition from retail to corporate is almost impossible making it difficult to find a career level position within apple."
good,"Apple Retail is probably the most rewarding retail experience that I have had in my career. The culture there is of it's own and the people that you work with are some of the best in the business. That being said, trying to move up in Apple from the Retail level is exceedingly difficult for most, and can end up with a glass ceiling situation."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Apple is a great company. I love working here. I have been able to grow so much both personally and professionally while working here. It's an enriching place to work. I have moved through a few stores in my home state and have had the honor of being recognized and promoted 3 times during my post-collegiate career at Apple. I have held my current position of Lead Genius for about a month and am still undergoing training. Apple is awesome!
good,"A typical day of work included talking to a lot of people, smiles, and constant challenge of making things go a bit better. The coworkers were nice, like a big family. I enjoyed how the company really seemed to pay attention to one another. Management was conscientious of it's employees."
good,"• Answer user inquiries regarding computer software or hardware operation to resolve problems in Iphones, Ipods Ipads and Macs."
good,"The training was fun, but did not provide complete tools for doing the job. The Apple Knowledge Base was also incomplete in its information. You are very much left to the sharks after your training, sink or swim."
good,"Apple is one of the best companies to work for. Enriching the lives of their customers is the ultimate goal, and they value their employees immensely."
good,What can I say? Apple has created an empire on quality and simplistic products which get the job done beautifully and right the first time.
good,It is a great place to work specially if you enjoy meeting people from all walks of life.
good,"Great learning experience, job advancement and a fun, friendly environment"
good,This company was a great place to work for. Awesome supervisors... interesting customers
good,"It is a fun place to work. The people are very nice and open to coaching. However, few opportunities exist when moving to higher paying roles. The benefits are great and the culture is based on mutual respect between employees and management."
good,My other issue with apple is that the work life balance is not as balanced as it should be. I work most weekends which means I am unable to spend time with the people most important to me.
good,Great place to cultivate talent and communication skills.  The co-workers are highly motivated with generally great people skills.  There are multiple opportunities to advance.
good,"work hard, get paid a lot, best resume builder there is, expect not many perks or cushy work environment. Will learn a lot but potentially spend quite a bit of time in CHina"
good,Apple has very supportive team that allows you to grow and learn more about the people and the company. Apple cares for the employees especially those who are in school
good,"The job and people here are great and all the activities make it easy to keep a high morale. The management, the coworkers and the upper management all respect each other and it shows."
good,I like Apple One because it's vwell organized and I was assigned to temp positions that reflected my skill. I would like to have been sent to evenore challenging positions.
good,Although no two days were the same. the job became very cut and dry and no place for growth. The same customer issues everyday makes it hard to really connect with people and become disinterested in the customer service piece.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Great place to work. Every manager is different. Lots of people and can really be soul sucking if you don’t pace yourself. They let you be yourself and allow for mistakes. You learn a lot about being a better person.
good,"I was an At-Home advisor.  It was great; my hours sucked, but that's because I am not a night person. Would recommend this position; great room for advancement."
good,"The culture at Apple is by far the most pleasing aspect working here."
good,"Management was good and they had a great culture inside of Apple  the job Israel’s could be draining and sometimes it didn’t feel like it was going anywhere, but Apple taught me how companies should be treating employees"
good,"you can learn a lot here, but a lot of stress, you must be the best to stay,ZERO ZERO ZERO work/life balance. Execs have been saying for YEARS that they understand and will make it better. But in actuality, it gets worse every year! It is obviously top management LIP SERVICE because if they meant it, they could fix it tomorrow. They have hundreds of BILLIONS in the bank. If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance, they could bring aboard the right number of folks to make that issue dissolve. Sick of hearing the lies. Just don't lie about wanting to fix it, when they clearly DON'T care"
good,"overall one of the best places to work, great management and organized. I require nothing but the best on their campus so half hearted efforts will get you know where here."
good,"As an advisor, your day will consist of taking phone calls for about 60% of your day. There are growth opportunities to work within different areas or groups, but no advancement opportunities anymore for management growth."
good,"i liked work there, its nice environment. good management and good friends. providing nice benefits. collaborative work place. you can promote there. there are many option to have more experience even corporate side of the apple"
good,I used to be in charge of the merchandising and technology at my location. This included that all technology both customer and employee was always working.
good,"You haven't worked in retail until you have worked at Apple Retail. This is so true, because of the traffic flow into the stores and the customers you get to help. You will learn how to work with customer and finding them the right solution for the technology needs and get to show them how to take full advantage of their tech. "
good,People here are engaging in team work and very beautiful working environment. Process may be tough But working is fun.Great teams which are helpful for newly join employers.
good,Apple is a great company to work for. The problem some may face is the fact that you're home all the time and it becomes very isolating. At first its the greatest thing in the world. After awhile you start to feel like a hostage to your home. I believe Apple tries to make it manageable for people knowing this is a common issue-*at least sometimes*. What doesn't help for AHAs is that you're micromanaged by AUX codes the entire shift. Basically if you want to step away for 1-2 mins you have to switch into a away aux. If you're in this AUX too long they will reach out to you. There is a AUX for everything and its counted towards you or against you to the very second.
good,I learned how to operate on I phones customers would send there broken phones to the company my production line takes the phones apart peace by peace apart and work on it fix it after fixed send it back to the customers.
good,"great part time job while in school, more room for growth to corporate. Create real opportunity in your Career experiences but overall best part time job i've had during school."
good,"Too much of anything can be bad. This was my problem when working at Apple. My work life balance was awful due to the random scheduling and very very very demanding work. "
good,"Working at Apple was a challenge, but interesting. I left because I wanted to go back to school and get my masters in accounting. If you have worked other retail and was getting slightly burned out. Apple will burn you out faster than other places."
good,"I work as a Genius on the retail side. I was able to progress to this role within 2 years, but it's all about the politics and opening positions. I love my job, great pay and benefits. You have to be great at problem solving and an amazing people person. We can teach you to troubleshoot, but not how to interact with people."
good,Great culture. Everyone is typically upbeat and positive. They stick to the credo and core values and try to make the workplace as fun as possible while still putting the customer first.
good,"A typical day of work was talking with friends while prioritizing customers. It was fun, relaxed, but not super gratifying in terms of growth...depending on what your goals are"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,I am a very approachable & dependable individual who enjoys fast paced environments. Building & sustaining customer clientele is something that I thrive on!
good,They want smart people but the price of admission is steep. They expect you to generate a ton of ideas to get to the one that they deem worthy. Too many layers of management so it's tough for things to survive all the meetings.
good,"It was a great experience for learning new skills and getting into phone sales.  I achieved to be the 27th agent in the EMEIA (UK and Ireland GEO) department globally, however pay was very low."
good,Working at apple was a great learning experience. It was challenging and diverse. The pay there was great and the work environment was fun and educational.
good,"Working at Apple requires a lot of energy, patience, and effort. What definitely get what you put into it, but movement within the company is very competitive."
good,Loved the pay and benefits! The level of customer service and training was excellent. Working at home can be challenging. Would work with them again but not at home.
good,"Be prepared for controlled chaos in a fast paced business. Even if you have experience in customer service, working for Apple is an entirely different environment. Training for the role is so comprehensive though that you will feel like you've always worked there and there is nothing you won't be able to answer or solve. You'll need thick skin sometimes to deal with the customer base. But they train you on that too."
good,"Tiger OSX 10.4 was launched when I began with Apple, they had parties and vendor fairs, tons of free swag.  The products that Apple offered at that time surpassed everything else in the market. Steve Jobs was at the helm and it was fun place to be. When the iPhone came out, everyone in the company got one for free."
good,Working at Apple was a great experience from lunch breaks where they played the World Cup to the training that you do in order to be ready to deal with customers over the phone.
good,"It’s awesome place to nourish your skills and knowledge everyday, my colleagues were really friendly and helpful and even the store manager gave me full support when I first joined"
good,"Great benefits, challenging work environment. Run the risk of being over worked during peak season. Company would benefit with more labor hours to help support customer demand."
good,Apple is a great place for students to get a variety of experience with a flexible schedule and other incentives.  Tuition reimbursement and career experiences are better than any other company I have worked for in the past.
good,Love the outdoors I work with but due to the economic climate and the cost of living rising there is more needed as far as compensation. The team feels like family and that's a plus and rarity in a retail environment.
good,Apple is a great company! Although there are many things I want to see change in management and the company I would go back for two reasons: my coworkers and the benefits. It's a great opportunity and allows for growth! Our management wasn't the best with support and acknowledging or rewarding hard work but overall good experience.
good,Great environment if a little stressful at times. Corporate vision and meeting atmosphere is a bit cultish. People are generally fun and easy to be around.
good,"A great position for those who are not only creative, but proactive too.  Everyone within my team was friendly and supportive, and the work/life balance was perfectly suited for my university schedule too."
good,"Stores are filled with amazing employees, opportunities to advance. Fast paced environment and builds networking/social skills quickly. Great benefits and perks, however make sure you get lots of rest, your day can be filled with nonstop talking, emotional distress from customers and conflict management"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple really thinks about their employees. They focus on employee advancement, benefits, and over all peer to peer culture. Only downside is that management usually picks favorites to move up in the role and work life balance isn’t the best."
good,Apple was a good job given it was a AHA College Program. Worked around your school schedule and had great pay and benefits. The only downside is I had a new manager 6 months into working with Apple and he wasn't a delight to be working for (under) and you have to work a 8 hour shift on Saturday/ Sunday and you can't choose the times for those days
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely the people. It feels like I'm part of a family. The customers for the most part are very understanding. Apple makes sure they train you for the job before putting you on the floor to help customers.
good,"Spent 9 months as a technical advisor for iOS devices. Good experience for dealing with customers issues. Strictly adhered to metrics, warnings given if metrics slipped."
good,"It can be very over whelming the amount of traffic that the store gets. You are trained very througholy to make sure you follow all of Apples mission statement. The company as a whole is great I would recommend anyone who is looking to start out or is looking for part time work. You do have to work nights and weekends, like every weekend. I find it easy to be my self and that I am in a safe environment, comfortable getting help or talking to anyone that enters the store. Overall working for Apple is really great, you get paid training and benefits even when working part-time."
good,"Typical day was working with multiple customers in set appointments, practicing time management and empathy in a fast paced environment. Hours were a retail environment, making work/life balance a welcome challenge."
good,"Apple puts a lot of time and energy into the education and training of its employees.  I would recommend working here regardless of your career aspirations, as an opportunity to become more highly trained in a multitude of business and customer relations roles."
good,"Working at apple was a great experience I was able to learn a lot about Apple products. For the most part  the management was great."
good,"The company takes its initiatives seriously. It’s consistentlt focus on preserving our environment, not only with product service but even how it powers its retail locations. Customer experience is the biggest focus wether it’s in sales or technical support! The team is always filled with diverse people both backgrounds and creative backgrounds."
good,Good for tech support work because you get great benefits and a lot of flexibility. The managers are helpful and they really try to help you succeed. There are constant perks given and contests to be won.
good,"A typical day at work is an 8-10 hour day, shifts based on quarterly bids; taking phone calls from customers world-wide. You will provide technical support for iOS/Mac devices and troubleshoot iCloud accounts. I learned how to isolate issues and gain agreement on the resolution. The culture is very Apple oriented, Apple think, Apple speak. The hardest part of the job is dealing with disagreeable customers and inability to control survey results. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with valued customers who have respect for what you do and your ability to help them resolve their issues."
good,"Apple is an exciting place to work at, though it is also very demanding.   In a manufacturing support position travel is frequent, and involves long hours. Most individuals are open and willing to help if you ask."
good,Great place to gain experience and learn more about the company afrom the inside. Has a lot to offer as an employer. Great employee discounts and benefits.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Fun, they take care of their employees, very busy but multiple breaks to refresh yourself, great benefits even for part time employees, pay is good compared to any other retailers."
good,"I loved the people, the atmosphere, mangers and advancement opportunities. It was also a great place to learn. I use the skills and training I received from Apple now, years later.  I could have stayed and advanced to full time and even into management but I did not. I think I would have liked it better if I did. I got burnt out on the hours, stress of the busy Saturdays and not making that much money."
good,"Apple provided alot of culture and job information.  I actually miss working for them, yet at the same time, I've ironically missed alot of time with my family being that this is was an at home job."
good,I loved working at Apple. It was a very friendly place where you are free to speak your mind. Everyone is welcome and there was no pressure to sell anything.
good,There is a reason everyone tries to get in with Apple and tends to stay for long periods of time. With the right management this job can become a life long career in Retail. Apple’s pay is very fair in retail. They offer amazing benefits and I had worked as a part time employee and let me tell you that I have still to see benefits like the ones I had at Apple working full time positions for other companies! I would have stayed but we begin getting some interesting managers after the really good ones left our store and this was one of the reasons I left. The second reason is that while part time was great I still needed a full time position and in Apple retail that was very competitive. I got offered a full time job at another company and kept my part time for a few months until it got to difficult time management wise as the other company began to require more time. Apple as a company itself does have a really good work culture but be warned they I’ll spoil you for any other company that doesn’t treat you the same!
good,Fun and really interesting people to work with.  Some managers are better than others but overall there are some really cool things to do. Just dont expect anything to come easy. hard work never hurt anyone. And they look at more than your technical skills. being friendly goes along way.
good,Apple has been a great place to work for the past 5 years.  My only complaint would be the lack of advancement opportunities.  There is not much room to grow as must positions are considered lateral moves.
good,"The benefits are great, the management depends on location, CS skills a must. It is still a retail job, you deal with the life and struggles of a retail employee."
good,Apple is a really good company who allows people to give their opinions. Good working day period. Good management and benefits. Good company in the overall.
good,"good place to work , friendly      "
good,"A lovely workplace with great benefits. The job can be a little stressful, but it makes up for it in good employee culture. I would recommend this job to someone that is interested in quick advancement!"
good,"For the most part, Apple Retail is a great place to work. As with any job, you only get out what you put into it. I formed many great friendships and learned a great deal of customer service skills while there."
good,"Enjoyed being surrounded by the creative type however, the clientele at this particular location (Century City, CA) are very demanding and make the job more stressful."
good,"Awesome perks, coffee shop and full cafeteria menu for breakfast and lunch. They also have great networking events to learn more about other departments within Apple. But like most (huge) corporate companies, it can be strict and super official - not suited for the creative souls."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Overall on a busy day my staff and I work as a team, we make sure our patients are taken care of  and get are patients in out as fast as we can with the best service"
good,"データ関連の部署なら、仕事の複雑さに心の準備が必要です。"
good,Cultura es buena aun que administracion regular. Aprendi a generar pronosticos
good,Excellent place to learn and grow. Apple encourages the input of employees and allows you to be who your are and bring your positive attributes to the table.
good,"Loved working here. Fantastic experience. However, there are not enough hours and it is retail. Let's put it this way it is the best retail job you will ever have. However, you likely will work weekends most of the time and you will also have to be on your feet and talk to customers. "
good,"Your typical day as a sales professional at Apple would begin with a short store meeting to inform staff about new changes, upcoming promotions, and various ongoing developments. Throughout the day, you would be assisting customers in discovering what Apple product was the best fit for them, all while making their experience in the store transformational instead of just transactional. I was also a technician and workshop instructor within the store. This meant I would diagnose an array of issues with customers' mobile devices, and teach Apple software workshops to groups of 10 or more people. The part of this job I enjoyed the most was fostering personal relationships with customers and working in an environment that required you to be continually learning."
good,I’ve been at Apple for over four years now with three separate stores. Advancement seems to be very difficult due to the massive amount of competition. Apple prides themselves on development but it is definitely not at the level they sell it at. It’s your basic situation where it doesn’t matter your work ethic and achievements set you aside but the personal opinion of the managers above you. So people who are buddy buddy with managers tend to get more than others.
good,"If you have a career lined up after Apple, this job is a great stepping stone. If you have no plans, this is a great place to develop skills that will be helpful in any industry."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"I had a computer provided by Apple that I set up in my home office. I would get up in the morning to start my day, go to my home office and work. My scheduled breaks were a quick break t get coffee, drinks, etc. Lunch was an hour and there was time to make my own lunch and relax."
good,It was a great place to work and an amazing place to meet new people at a work environment! A lot of self growth working here and I had a lot of work benefit!
good,"I have had a great experience working at Apple through Volt. The contract position was described accurately and they provide you with all the information you need to succeed. Management seems to communicate well with both the staff and other departments. "
good,Apple stores are one of the best retail places to work on the planet.  Fun environment dealing with technology and helping people make the transition from PC to MAC.
good,"Employees that I've worked with in two different sectors of Apple have been wonderful. All friendly, and all of them willing to help during a time of need. Originally coming from AppleCare, which is the over-the-phone support line, and into a retail store position can be daunting."
good,"My time working at Apple Computers was very educational in my growth towards technology. It expanded my knowledge base as well as how to troubleshoot technical and nontechnical issues that presented itself. The management team ranged from excellent moral boosting team mentors but there were some management members that favored employees. Within this favoritism, the unfair advantage was placed on those who have earned either a new role and or an upgrade in pay."
good,Working at Apple was fast paced and full of energy. They encourage you to truly get into the products and build relationships with customers. They spent a good TWO WEEKS training each employee before setting them free.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Apple, the work culture is very easy going and everyone is eager to help you learn and progress. They also provide a lot of opportunity to move into other roles."
good,Yes it is a great place to work and there are a lot more positives than there are negatives.  If you can get in it's a spring board to the next line of work.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"while working at apple, there were many opportunities to learn the technical and personal approach to helping a customer, I found very helpful though management and other colleagues sharing their successful approach and wording to properly assist the customer in their decisions."
good,"Great place to work with lots to learn and do. Working close with the teams makes all the difference in world. "
good,Apple est une pointure en management et culture d'entreprise. Valorisation et suivi des capacités des employés. Opportunités d'évolution et de formation en interne. Chaque employé peut y trouver son compte et se réorienter.
good,Great place to work with awesome set hours and great pay! I don't really have any complaints other than there isn't much room for advancement. Weekends off and no night shifts was a huge plus.
good,"It's a good job for Retail with great benefits and competitive pay. For the most part they hire well so team is diverse, talented, and a joy to work with. Environment can be overwhelming for some."
good,"Fun place to let your personality and love for learning prosper."
good,"The people take care of each other, and you will meet your best friends working here. The smartest and most welcoming teams you will ever be a part of and the culture is consistent across stores."
good,"It's an extremely fast paced environment, which is the best and worst part of the job. The day goes by quick, but at the end of it, you're quite tired. You must be a 'people person' to enjoy time at Apple."
good,"Cutting edge products. Smart, young team members. Constant innovation, constant change. Tons of customers. Little time to ever be bored. Decent pay for retail, but this isn't your average retail job. You'll earn every dime, plus some you won't get. Take advantage of all the benefits -- great healthcare, stock options, tuition reimbursement, etc.  Be ready to learn, to grow, to deal with ambiguity and to build a lot of relationships."
good,Empresa dinamica com formacacao inicial e bom ambiente
good,Grat place to work. Tons of fun. Lots of opportunity to grow. Great cafeteria and cheap lunches. The campus is great with tons of outdoor access     .
good,"I love getting the opportunity to fix Apple products when they get broken or need software repair. The management could be better at developing talent instead of playing favorites. Culture at Apple is pretty cool and you get to wear jeans to work. Overall, it's a cool place to work, but that depends heavily on whether or not management favors you."
good,"Provided support for MobileMe by chat. Apple required us to talk to 3 customers at the same time without letting them know. The queue would build up with 90 people waiting. They would be really frustrated by the time they came into chat with us so some would give bad surveys. Apple changed our support and made phone support available. Once we could talk to customers by phone the position was fun. Managers were very supportive and understanding of the stress that we all went through during the chat only support. I learned how to help very frustrated people leave our support feeling like Apple was the best company at helping it's customers. I also became very good at multitasking and lightning fast at customer responses. Learned to research material and find answers for the customers very quickly. The tier 2 position was very rewarding to be able to directly resolve customer's more complicated issues. It was terrific working directly with the engineers and learning how the individual systems worked. The troubleshooting challenge is something that I really thrive on so it was definitely something that I truly enjoy. Apple also put on a lot of activities that were very unique such as beer bashes and we had almost daily food goodies brought to us. We had catered food for big events such as Beer Bashes, Christmas, New Year's, and Thanksgiving. Unfortunately we had to work on holidays, but they made it more enjoyable. There was also a fabulous Mac Cafe in our workplace available to us."
good,Fun and inspiring place to work. The technologies used are at the cutting edge. Great opportunity to learn and grow. Great teams and good workplace culture.
good,"Great place to work and experience."
good,"Fantastic job for an amazing company. Lots of opportunities to grow within each store, not very easy to transfer and grow within the company though. Pay is high for retail, but work / life balance is awful. Compared against all other retailers, I'd say they are one of the best. But if you want a family and free time, this is not the place."
good,"Company definitely holds up to is standards, assisting customers that are just as passionate about Apple as you are makes your time at an Apple Store worth while."
good,"The company follows an open culture and collaborative working environment. At work, you will be aided by highly supportive intra network tools which can make your work more efficient."
good,A typical day starts at 5 in the morning.  Getting the line set up for the start of the shift.  I learned to multitask and not wait for others to do the work needed to be done. The management is always available to help.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple is providing one of the best support and training to its employees to make them highly skilled in different tasks."
good,"Come work in a fun, collaborative environment with our friendly team of self-starters. We greatly pride ourselves on our company culture, and every aspect of that culture is designed to bring out the best in our employees. Each and every team member embodies our core values of being positive, self-starting, and supportive, and we’re always seeking to hire remarkable people to uphold those values and join our family."
good,"Apple was a great short experience.  Fantastic benefits and working environment, good management and overall happy to be part of that company...sadly I had to move for family reason."
good,"help repair customer relationship"
good,I enjoyed working from home as a team manager for Apple. The experience was a great benefit to helping me move forward with what my goals were in the future.
good,"The workplace is fast-paced, supportive, and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming up with solutions to fix clients products."
good,Good job for a first job. Interesting people. Can be hectic at times and customers are ungrateful. The company stands for great things and you can feel good about working here.
good,Everyone I worked with was a dream. I would have preferred an office environment instead of working from home but still could not complain.
good,"A great place to work for a short amount of time, if you are looking for stability then no. Other then that great environment and people."
good,"A day at work is to come in, check your emails, voicemail, and text messages that may have released overnight with a new product or troubleshooting step that may of came out. Then jump into the queue and start helping out customers and co-workers with any problem they may encounter or need help with. "
good,"This place has great culture. policy and procedure is the best I have ever seen. "
good,"-Working from home from an iMac provided by Apple. "
good,"As a specialist, your duty is to help customers. Whether that is purchasing Apple merchandise or helping them trouble shoot. I learned more about communicating with customers. How to figure out more than one solution to one problem and to always keep the customers interests ahead of mine. Hardest part of my job was dealing with tasks that I was in no way required to do. Some customers would come in with issues that you had to resolve despite it not being an Apple app problem or software malfunction. But keeping Apple loyalty among customers is very important, so it had to be done. "
good,It was great working there. I learned a lot about myself here and how to work remotely from other employees. There was an extensive amount of knowledge about apple products that needed to be learned and being able to help someone with their products without physically seeing the problem with a customer's product.
good,"The title says it all. I worked in Best Buy as a sales rep for apple. I worked for apple and not best buy. I loved it. The Job was pretty much just talking to people all day about what works for them and how we could make that happen. Unfortunately, when my seasonal contract was up they didn't offer me a job (one wasn't available)."
good,"For Retail there is no other company I can find that compares to the understanding, care and attention career that is with Apple Inc."
good,"Culture is great, compensation is sub par however. Advancement is really how far you are willing to go. Overall not a bad place if you want to make a career in retail."
good,"Working for Apple was a challenge, but it helped me grow in a lot of aspects. It pushed me to meet goals and to always be concerned about the customer's happiness and maintaining their trust in Apple. Apple takes great care of its employees and offers great benefits!"
good,Apple provides employees with great benefits but the work culture is not always comfortable to be around. Management do a great job can be a little tough to approach sometimes and it can be difficult to advance your job role here.
good,"Apple is a fin work place where  there is a balance between work and personal life of the employees."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"This is one of the best companies in the world to work for. Hours are decent, benefits are outstanding and the people are great!"
good,"As a customer service representative among 7000+ employees in the same job role, it take a great work initiative to stand out and advance."
good,Apple is a very understanding employer with good benefits. I have enjoyed working there. Typically I help customer with their phones and computers.
good,Very easy job they have you prepared and trained before you go into the field. The management is very lenient. Wasnt something i was into since your job is dealing with customers and helping them with their issues.
good,"Typical day at work includes checking guests in our Ages system and making sure they belong on Apple property. We would turn away solicitors and anyone trying to drop off their resume. I would go above and beyond to provide them the information they need to apply, in order to make the guest feel as though we were not kicking them out of the building. We had to work closely with security to keep an eye on anyone that has been banned from Apple property. Management in my particular department was pretty amazing. My boss was very supportive on any moves I wanted to make in order to better my future. Most of my co-workers were with a temp agency rather than with Apple. Its a very friendly environment so I believe because of that it brought the best out in everybody. Hardest part of the job was advancement. A lot of my co-workers have been stuck in the same position for about 5 years or so even though they consistently looked for better opportunities within Apple. Most enjoyable part of my job was the connections I made with the guests and Apple employees. Its a good feeling to make someones day better with a smile and genuine care to do so. Also I utilized the gym on site daily."
good,"Apple is the leader in high end computers, phones, etc. Their company's culture is consistent in every store. Their hiring practices are uniform and competitive. Management is great and professional. The benefits are incomparable to any other company."
good,"Working at Apple is an amazing experience. Everyday is always different in regards to the different customers you meet on a daily basis. I've learned many things but my biggest take aways would have to be patience, time management, and composure. It requires a lot of patience and time management to be able to balance multiple customer appointments at a time while also having to tend to a waiting queue. The hardest part would have to be making sure that every customer walks away satisfied, even if the solution isn't the best thing in the world but the only one that can be given. The most enjoyable is definitely the people that work there and family you build while working there."
good,"Working at Apple gave great customer service skills with every customer situation. Typical day for a Specialist included creating a customer journey, keeping yourself up to date on product, and maintaining the Apple brand. The environment was great for customers, and employees new to the customer service role. Management struggled. They hire outside managers often instead of training from within which makes advancement difficult. Getting a promotion at Apple is like winning a Nobel Prize to them. You must be worth to the managers. If not; you will stay a Specialist forever. I loved learning about customers, and creating friendships that will last a lifetime."
good,The passion of the team and Apple's attention to detail in designing the most complex chips in the world make Apple the best company to work for in hardware design field.
good,"Where to begin with Apple. Great place to work. Loved my team that i worked on and the Aussies and Kiwi's I talked to every day about Apple Products. "
good,"Great place to work part time, but there is little to no real advancement despite proving yourself. All of the people you work with are awesome and there is no competition among peers."
good,Apple Inc is a growing company that offers a lot of growth within. I loved the high volume calls because it kept me busy until the end. There were always management willing to help in the time of need. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone looking for growth.
good,"I worked as an At-Home-Advisor. The training I received there was great. I learned so much about Macs and iPhones, even though I've been using Apple products for many years. The company definitely encourages growth, however expect you to master your role and exceed your daily metrics and performance goals. The benefits were great! But some of the customers you encounter can be extremely rude and difficult to deal with. The biggest drawback for me was the scheduling; not very flexible and ended up turning into a problem."
good,"Apple provides a very exciting, fast-paced work environment with an excellent team-oriented dynamic that is focused on personal/professional growth. While this is an extremely demanding job on all fronts, Management is very supportive and understanding. "
good,"A typical apple store vibe.Everyday you have to face new challenges  ,solve and listen to new queries.Maintaining a good rapport with the customers by building long term relationships and adhering to their requests.You end up being a good team player and acquire good interpersonal and communication skills which is an added advantage towards fulfillment of your personal goals."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Working for Apple is great and everyone there is always open to helping each other out whenever the need arises. When coming into work everyone greets each other while getting ready for the day ahead. Management is always making sure that you are taken care of and that all of your needs are being taken care of. There is so much information available to the employees to help them better themselves and move up in the company. So much information can sometimes be overwhelming but the trick is to focus on a specific career goal. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be the joy of knowing you helped someone out and provided them a valuable customer support experience.
good,Everyday at the Apple store is a learning experience. Everyday you walk in and you have a scheduled staff meeting to discuss the companies goals or new information that with help you give your customers a better experience. After you check the work board to see where you will be placed in the store and begin your day.
good,"This is a great company to work for, I spent about 6 months there and enjoyed every minute of it. It was very busy which made the shifts go by very quickly. The training was very in depth so you don't ever feel like you get thrown in the deep end like some other companies I've worked for. The management team is absolutely fantastic they encourage everyone to be the best the can and really support whatever role you decide to go for with in the store. My only complaint is the hours, I was only allowed to work about 25 hours a week so I really didn't make any money which was ultimately the reason I had to leave"
good,"A typical day for my position I assist advisors, or speak to customers directly for more sensitive issues."
good,Love the people I work with along with the clientele. Apple does great things for its employees!!
good,A great place to work especially for students. Good benefits and very flexible schedules. Management very understanding and co-workers are amazing!
good,I love this work environment.  The people are great and very supportive which is important at a 24 hour operation.
good,"The building is clean and fresh, coworkers are competent and trusting, management is efficient and fair, learned many valuable interpersonal and intercultural skills, hardest part was trying to relate to people with Apple products while not owning any myself. My dad worked on the same site, but different company so we were able to have lunch together."
good,"Problem solving approach with best practices. Best Agile practices in terms of handling tasks, versioning and quality deliverables."
good,"I worked at apple for 7 years "
good,"Overall I love the company. Great team to work with, great culture, and a leadership team that is interested in my development. You can learn a lot about just about anything here. Sure its a technology com nay but I have learned so much more than that. Great experiences that you can take anywhere. "
good,"The typical day at work is generally fast paced and hectic, but manageable yet extremely challenging. I work in a very well organized structured manner and get projects completed. The hardest part of the job is finding time to work on and complete projects between supporting internal end-users and ensuring SLA consistently."
good,Amazing place to work. Can be an overload of customers at any location. Great co-workers. Hardest part is getting to all the customers.
good,"A typical day for me would involve technical support and the odd sale here and there.  In my time there I have had the opportunity to learn all about the Mac operating system, along with some of it's Pro Applications.  Before I started here I knew nothing about the Apple culture or even the hardware itself.  In the time I have spent here I have learned a lot and very quickly.  The people that work there are second to none as they are probably some of the most supportive people I have ever met!  The most enjoyable part of the job is how your fellow co-workers eventually begin to feel like one big extended family!  It's a great place to work!"
good,"actully it was amazing when you work with active, ambitious, hard worker team and good management"
good,"It's all fun and games in the beginning but, as soon as you get comfortable, your schedule and manger get switched and you end up finding out how you are just a gear in this huge machine that is Apple Inc."
good,Fifth Ave store is great. Very busy and energizing. It is open 24 hrs.
good,"Le poste consiste à interagir avec les clients du site internet toute la journée, nous les conseillons sur les produits les mieux adaptés à leurs besoins. "
good,It was always clear what work should be done each day.  Goals were ambitious yet achievable.  I like that though it was an at home environment never felt I was alone.  I could turn to my team.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"One of the best retail companies I've worked for.  Very fair environment.  Tough attendance policy, but very clear."
good,Meeting lots of new people everyday asking for different electronics products.I learned a lots of new things like types of customers.My management is dual so nothing much to say because the people who hired me expect different things from me and the management i work under expect exact the opposite from me. the hardest part is to please the management .The enjoyable part is dealing and handling new customers everyday.
good,"My days were certainly never the same twice. Apple environment is very fast paced. I could be right in the thick if things with sales/service teams, interacting with customers at one moment or on a strategic planing calls for the division. My most enjoyable part of the job was leading my team. I was so fortunate to hand pick every individual on my team. To see them all learn and grow so quickly was a blast! The toughest part was trying to maintain a great balance between family and my role with retail schedule being what it is. Overall an amazing experience!"
good,"As a Relationship Manager for Apple Business I am the main point of contact and liaison for Apple's top spending business accounts. My clients include TED Conferences, Droga 5, and Foursquare."
good,"I have met and made many friends in all of my coworkers and managers while working at Apple. They do a good job of making sure that employee skills are not wasted and that people properly apply themselves to the positions. There are constant opportunities to try new things and move to different departments and challenge yourself. Keeping up with demand in certain departments is difficult because of the high volume of orders and customer needs, but overall we are well staffed so teams don't get overwhelmed."
good,"Excellent work environment with intelligent, friendly co-workers. Better than average retail job."
good,"A great company to work for. You meet many people in the job from all over the world, get to meet the occasional celebrity, and challenge yourself continually. The company will encourage and assist where possible for personal growth in the company, but for those wishing to go beyond retail, there is little opportunity within Canada for this."

good,This company has great values and really wants to see their employees succeed and advance. Cheap Healthcare!
good,"If you're looking for a fun place to work, this is it. If you want to be in retail that is becoming similar to Best Buy and others, this is also it. Work can become very boring if not seeking other opportunities."
good,"I loved changing lives, but in the end, Apple Retail is like any other retail job. Discounts were great and salary was amazing compared to previous job that required me to be just as knowledgeable about what I was doing."
good,Amazing environment and organization to learn and develop technology best practices---it's Apple.

good,"I learned a lot of interesting things, coworkers were amazing people.  Facility was nice looking, Desks were comfortable they were the ones that stand up with you."
good,"Remote work basis saves a lot of time on traveling, but can be rather depressing sometimes being physically alone in your own home. You'll need a strong mind to be comfortable working alone. Working for China market means not having time off on SG public holidays most of the time. You'll be compensated with off-in-lieu instead. I find time with family sadly restricted with the work schedule. Support with colleagues almost non-existence, as everyone would be busy clocking enough calls to hit productivity targets."
good,"Apple est société ou l'on peut avoir la meilleure expérience de sa vie comme la plus mauvaise "
good,"Awesome company across the board.. OT available, average pay compensation, training always available addition benefits and bonuses are on going. Remote working allows for work/life balance."

good,"succesregels van Apple:"
good,"Productive, tons of good people to work with,  the management team is great, you gets paid for what you work on,  benefits but lack of work life balance"
good,You can learn a lot of thing from this company that can help improve your self in many area like creating daily report and maintaining and tracking your sales in right manner. And can set goal to achieve.
good,"Working at Apple is an amazing part-time job. I believe it is most likely one of the best jobs one can find. However, I quickly found it is not a career. Job advancements are slow and highly political. If you're a student or want a job to supplement your art career, Apple is the place to be."
good,"Working for Apple was amazing. Experiences in store will always depend on the management but most managers are truly there to support you. "
good,"I was able to learn many skills working at Apple, beyond retail. It was very fast-paced, but the training allowed you to succeed and move forward. However, retail can get tiring and makes your schedule difficult but it definitely helped me learn how to interact with coworkers and customers and provide exemplary service which has been beneficial in all my jobs following."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"The 4th Street location during my time of employment had management that felt like mentors, and a store culture that wanted to see you win. Pushed you to excel and improve upon your weaknesses."
good,"Very relaxed setting but also fast paced based on the business needs daily. A great group of people to work with. The hardest part about the job was the number of customers often versus the number of employees. It could be very overwhelming some days, coworkers make the day alot better"
good,This is a great place to work while in school or  after school and overall. The culture that the management has with empowering staff and the staff genuinely likes one another.
good,"My time at  Apple completely changed my perspective of the typical workplace/company. It was a very productive environment, which encouraged creativity, expression and overall difference. The Apple culture speaks to all of this. The management was friendly and supported all type of feedback involving personal and professional growth. Would aways recommend this company for both employee and consumer."
good,"pay may not be as great for technical positions but the culture , and benefits are amazing. Great medical plans  even if part time, great medical plans for families with kids."
good,"At the beginning of each day we would have store meetings.  We were updated on the latest news and products.  During the shift itself, we would provide recommendations and solutions to customers.  Our management team would assist with questions in an appropriate manner to both employees and customers.  The culture of the store was very open minded and full of self expression.  The most enjoyable part of working at Apple were the customers and co workers you interacted with everyday.  Each customer had a unique story, and each employee was fun in their own way."
good,"Apple treats their employees like family. There’s always room for improvement if you want it for yourself, Apple will provide the means to get you there."

good,Apple is a great place to work in order for you to build skills like multitasking and being an effective team player. You also have the opportunity to give feedback as well as receive it.
good,"You will love your employees, but the amount required from you can be mentally draining. Customers can be rude, and you have to love working with all personalities, expectations, and attitudes. You're required to learn a lot and be responsible for continuing to self-develop."
good,"Apple is an incredible company that really takes care of their employees."
good,Amazing company to work for. The hours were a bit inconvenient and can chip into your social life especially as a full-time student but overall I loved my time with apple.
good,Apple is a very fun place to work from interaction with colleagues to customers. After some time things start to get repetitive but not in a mega negative way.  It is the setting stone and expectation you want when you walk into a retail store.
good,I am beyond greatful that I had the opportunity to work for Apple when I did. I do regret not staying longer and seeing where my path would have take. Me.
good,"It was a great company, lots of training, world class products and services. Great pay and benifets. Management was invested in you succeeding. Lots of opportunities to promote and we were able to work from home."

good,I had a wonderful experience working for Apple.  The only thing i did not like was pay but that was not Apple's fault it was the area we lived in.  Advancement is very encouraged and management supports all development to get you where you want.

good,"Taught me everything I know, really have an emphasis on their employees being happy which allows them to make the customers happy. Management varies from location to location, but you will always feel welcome. Allow for stellar personal development that stays with you."
good,"Loved my employment at Apple however, once they started to carter to the general public and got to be huge I lost interest in working for the new standard quo company. I wish they had kept their ""Think Different"" Campaign edge. I do however love the culture and people who work there."
good,"Typical work day as a Apple Receptionist is to come in with a friendly demeanor and always greeting and assisting everyone whether its an employee to a visitor. Contacting the correct person for those whom have interview candidates waiting in the lobby you reside in. Knowing your building like where conference rooms are, restrooms etc."
good,"Great teamwork work environment, fantastic corporate culture, excellent benefits. If you love customer service and technology this is the right environment for you. It is always busy and there is always a positive buzz. The team are like a family and support each other."
good,"low income but amazing work environment, co workers and management are great, amazing tram support and culture, discounts could have been much better."
good,Apple is very focused on the development of their team while still maintaining a high level of customer service and support. Every member of the leadership is evaluated  heavily before moving into their role to guarantee the success of every team.
good,"Apple is definitely the pinnacle of retail. The managers are very supportive & the team is very dedicated to making you feel at ease. I would say that it can be draining from a mental stand point, but overall an awesome job & great career experience."
good,Not your typical workplace. We are a diverse and unique environment with much more to provide then a 9-5 job. There are many opportunities and advances among the company which depends on your desire to achieve such a thing.
good,"90% of the calls that come in are from customers who have a problem and they are frustrated with the product and looking for someone to blame."
good,I enjoyed working at their Data Center though it was brief due to my contract being cut short because I was offered a position that paid more and I couldn't turn it down.
good,"Gestores não são claros com a estratégia, ou seja tudo muda a toda hora, projetos não tem começo meio e fim."
good,"Working with apple as tier 1 tech support my job consisted of answering phones and building a short term relationship with the customer, and doing a short report on the customer issue, an doing what’s necessary to keep our apple device holders up and running"
good,"-Work like:  You have a set schedule every 6 months"
good,"Great work environment! Apple has an amazing ability to attract amazing people, which in turn, creating an amazing work culture and environment. The leadership has a established a place of learning and that includes mistakes, that you inevitably make. They care more about your growth as an individual."
good,Apple loves to empower its employees and see growth on both a personal and professional level. My tenure there was always challenging and I learned quite a bit about customer service and people in general there.
good,"great place to learn and develop but it's every man for himself. although they tell you how much ""team effort"" we are, several ""bad apples"" appear to only cover themselves and throw blame for shady actions or take credit for things they did not do."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"it is great they truly care for their employees and extended family. it is a truly amazing place to work for hands down. no complaints at all if you get in appreciate it for what it is, no other company like it."
good,Apple has lot to give a student to learn and I would recommend to at least do 1 internship here. Apple is good at presenting new and good roles to work for a project.
good,"Great work environment, excellent and brilliant staff. Great work culture. The pitfalls of retail will catch up to you after a couple years. Working long holidays and weekends."
good,"I started in 2008. After Mr. Steve Jobs passing Apple inc focus shifted. New management did not have knowledge of apple product or good solutions for customer creating new ground with new updates that cause a large amount of issues with no one to help. So the stress comes from iOS Update that cause a ripple effect of issues. When your expected to have the answers to issues that are new to everyone including higher tech support."
good,Love my job and love Apple.  Unfortunately have a very bad manage.. I have reached a point where I am looking for opportunities to enter into management and to travel more.
good,I was already seasoned in the customer experience but Apple gave me tools to take a good customer experience and make it a transformation one. I have gained many more tools for my tool belt.
good,Depending on the customer traffic this company can either be very calm or very hectic. Apple gives individuals an opportunity to grow personally and professionally through organizational structure and the culture. During slower moments employees can use training resources available to innovative within their role or within the company. Faster-paced days can train employees to work professionally as a team or autonomously while dealing with ambiguous situations.
good,"On the surface not much different then your average retail job. Weekends and Holidays can be stressful but you have support from your team that makes it bearable."
good,In regards to AppleCare..It's fast paced and sometimes can be stressful.  They acknowledge this through awards and pay.  Healthcare benefits are the best I've ever had.
good,I enjoyed working with the staff. The apple culture was always top of the line. They made sure to continuously train and present with any challenges you may have. It was fun environment and enjoyed coming in to work.
good,"Amazing place to work!! Loved it! Best job thus far, but my aspirations in life were in direct competition with Apple. So if you want to create anything tech, work here, but don't stay here, unless you want to create tech for Apple at Apple."
good,"I was one of the first full time corporate employees to work from home supporting the online Apple store. this position was remotely based. "
good,Apple is a great place to learn about yourself and others. It is an environment that encourages communication and feedback as to facilitate building relationships and growing and a team and as individuals.
good,"Assisted clients with product issues; diagnosis, repair work, set-up, and answering general usage questions of apple products and programs are included in the daily duties. The work environment is very team focused; management is encouraging and supportive with an open door policy across the entire company, throughout all the levels. The most enjoyable and difficult aspect of the job is stepping away from the role of helping people at the end of the day."
good,You take calls from start to finish. They will allow you to have team meetings and occasional trainings 1-2 times a week. Overall a good place to work.
good,I had worked with Advance Technology Group. Everything we do are R&D for future products. It's a bit boring because I don't see any real products yet.
good,"Days spent working at Apple are spent on the phone with customers.  Most of the customers are easy to deal with, while a few are difficult.  You get a discount on Apple products which is great!  There is always the chance to move into a different type of role.  All in all a good place to work."
good,"Its Apple, so you kind of know what your getting. Its competitive and at times very corporate but they treat you well and have good benefits. A lot depends on management whether or not you have a good time."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I worked for Apple for 3 years actively before having to take time away and eventually resign due to health issues. While I was there, I had an amazing team manager who worked very hard to take care of us, but the actual work was stressful and demanding, often working with multiple customers at the same time via chat. Upper management didn’t seem to want to hear what we thought would work well, so often changes were frustrating and made our job tougher. Even so, though, we were given a good bit of freedom and great benefits, so it was a good job and I would have enjoyed working my way into management myself."
good,Fun place to work if you like helping people. Apple works hard to give their employees a healthy work life balence. Awesome benifits and lots of opportunities.
good,"Working at Apple was mostly great. I was a trainer there and got to meet all kinds of people from all sorts of backgrounds. There is real racial diversity at Apple, and that makes working there a treat. Overall, the people were great. They are friendly and want to see you succeed."
good,"My time at Apple was overall very enjoyable. They take care of their employees and make sure you are compensated fairly with a plethora of benefits and deals. But they also demand a lot from you, joining the Apple team was bit like checking in at Hotel California, they have everything you could ever want, but it feels like you can never leave. I did Applecare. The job itself isn't too difficult, although I'd think again if you don't do well with technologically illiterate customers and answering the same dull questions over and over again. But I did get to work from home, so who can complain. They don't do well with schedule flexibility and are quite strict when it comes to the rules so understand who you are working for. I would recommend this job and this company to someone who intends on working for Apple for a long time and want a way in to climb that Applecare ladder."
good,"I loved working for this company, learnt a lot, i was able to grow as a person the sales specialist role taught me a lot about myself. i enjoyed meeting and talking to new people."
good,"Although it is an engineering culture, everyone thinks heavily about design and the end user. Which makes it great to work there as a designer. The people you work with are very responsive, no matter how busy they are. No ego, no hierarchy, and everyone is just focused on delivering a great product -- whatever it takes. Sometimes the demands are challenging and can get a bit overwhelming, but it is great as it helps you to grow professionally."
good,"as an apple employee there is much support from corporate and upper management.  plus, there is great communication from other directors in other facilities"
good,"In a typical day you will take 30-50 Calls"
good,"pros: fun, exciting, different experiences every day, supportive management and coworkers, room to move around within the company, continuous opportunities that allows us to always be learning"
good,"- Apple is great place to work with strong support and an excellent culture"
good,"Work Environment, "
good,"Desde mi vivencia dentro del grupo Garbarino pude encontrar un grupo humano que busca constantemente la superación, de manera creativa, inclusiva y con la constante capacitación por lo cual es realmente fácil aplicar la política de la empresa. "
good,"I worked at Apple retail in the halcyon days before the iPhone when the culture was very different. It's more production and metrics driven now, but back then it was pretty easygoing and all about the product and excellent customer service."
good,Nice job and good pay checks. You get to meet all kinds of people. Also if your a tech person you will love the job. Good job for someone living on there own.
good,"Apple is a great company to work for -- amazing, fun culture, with awesome products, incredibly intelligent and capable coworkers. However, I was working in a retail environment which was often challenging."
good,"Effectively solve customer problems with Apple products & software related issues."
good,"The Apple Eco-Sphere is second to none. Excellent Training and lots of great colleagues.  I had prior experience in Apple Sales and Technical Support; this job allowed me to work directly with the end-users, and felt the honest satisfaction every time I was able to help a customer."
good,"Overall Apple is a good company to work for. The environment is relaxed and fun, there's plenty of parties and events to attend and the benefits are amazing. But there's no specific processes set in place to help you when you're providing service to a customer. Everything changes constantly which makes the job a little unstable sometimes. The management is nice but there's a strong sense of favoritism."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Excellent training. Work from home is difficult. Isolating but also rewarding. Lots of benefits and great discounts also.
good,Apple is a fast passed environment for the work itself. But the culture behind the scenes is very laid back. Your communication with leadership is often the same as peers. Very relaxing environment. Hardest part of the job is the constant stress of being a busy and popular retail chain.
good,"A typical work day was usually fun. You learn an awful lot about apple products, and they always have more training for you. Management was great. They focused on making you improve at your job. Co-Workers were great. Always friendly, and always helpful."
good,Apple has a unique culture and an astonishing commitment to excellence in product and customer experience.Great work environment. Excellent benefits. Perfect place for self development
good,Challenging and not for everyone. Management is good but you are bounced from manager to manager/team to team quite often as opportunities for other positions pop up quite frequently both on the managerial as well as the advisor side.
good,Wonderful supportive and passionate environment. Apple only surrounds you with the most knowledgable and caring individuals. There was considerable variation in tasks and little repetition.
good,"Working at Minacs was great for a number of reasons, but the best thing there was the management and other employees, it was like a family and made going to work worth it."
good,"Great place to work, good team. But slow progression and sometimes difficult to get initiatives off the ground to gain new experiences."
good,"From your first to your last day with Apple, expect to be pushed to your limits in your knowledge and ability in several ways. Your team and your fellow coworkers are great at supporting you and keeping the environment cheerful and positive. Plenty of opportunities to grow as an AppleCare representative and in administrative positions. That in mind, you will need to be more than proactive in reaching out to additional hiring managers if you want to be anything but AppleCare."
good,"Apple really strives to develop people. I have seen countless new hires go from borderline entirely introverted in a social setting to blossoming into a whole new version of themselves after 6 months of working in Apple Retail. "
good,"Apple helps support at-home development beautifully.  It is perfect for those who would rather telecommute, or are otherwise benefited from an at-home position.  Great benefits and great support."
good,"Apple is a great place to work, one of the best retail spaces. The environment can be overwhelming at times, and the work life balance can be annoying. However it is amazing!"
good,"Amazing company, total compensation package could be better. More opportunities in the U.S market as compared to Canada. At times, management does not have a clear vision for Apple Business."
good,"Great culture and great company"
good,I would answer calls from customers and trouble shoot there phone or apple device. As well as schedule appointments for them to take into store to get repair
good,El ambiente de trabajo es muy pesado pero es buen lugar para trabajar
good,"- Great management who provide support throughout your career"
good,"The training was tough, but educational. There was a level of stress to this position, but management was extremely supportive. A typical day at work was taking phone calls, providing customer service, and technical support. I learned everything I know about Apple products from my time at Apple."
good,"On a daily basics I received approximately 50 escalated calls I took ownership of and resolved."
good,"Great because I was able to utilize my IT skills and also attend to customers. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple was a great place to work overall in terms of the people and the environment.  Every person was quite easy to get along with and relate with.  Every day the job consisted of assisting customers over the phone to get their iPads, iPods, or iPhones working to their satisfaction.  This, to me personally, was the hardest part of the job as being on the phone for 8+ hours a day really tended to wear me down.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was simply being able to surround myself with great people that were friendly and incredibly helpful when assistance was needed."
good,apple is the best industry work and learn it is the best possible industry which makes its own invention and never survive on others technology
good,"I have learned a diverse set of competencies working at Apple in the past two and a half years. Since technology is always changing I am constantly dealing with ambiguity both customer facing and internally.  What I've learned is how to reconstruct and improve my approach to customers and peers. "
good,"Era un posto di lavoro molto stimolante , normalmente dovevi aiutare i clienti a trovare i prodotti che più potevano esserli utili per la vita lavorativa o comunque privata. I colleghi erano preziosi all'interno del lavoro quando eri in difficoltà ti aiutavano e davano spiegazioni per continuare al meglio il lavoro che stavi svolgendo . Non c'erano parti difficili nel lavoro , basta ascoltare buttarsi sbagliare e rincominciare da capo quello che stavi facendo , prendendo gli errori come spunti per migliorarsi sempre."
good,Benefits start immediate and are premium.  The environment in laid-back advancement opportunities are available for motivated and qualified folks.  Apples are always free at Cafe Mac!
good,"Apple is a very good company"
good,"Working at apple is a great experience. I have a great fun relationships with my peers as well as management. I never feel like a fish out of water because training is always provided to keep all specialist on their toes. Everyone at apple came from somewhere creative or work on a lot of creative ventures outside of apple, so its pretty great to have the motivation and inspiration to achieve success."
good,"I loved working at Apple."
good,Apple is great about helping you with developing yourself in and out of work.
good,I loved working or Apple the only thing that made me not give it 4 stars is the fact that they based your performance on surveys from customers that may not be returned.

I have learned many facets of Apple, including training, management and the administrative aspect of the company.  "

good,"Assisting client’s to find the right computer to serve everyday needs, including personal and business aspects. Learning something new everyday about different scenarios in devices and how to solve those issues. Trouble shooting was the best part of working with Apple, It gave me excellent knowledge of the product."
good,"Working at Apple Retail is incredibly fun and a great place to sharpen one's interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. It'll most definitely teach one how to remain calm and composed at all times, a great skill for anyone looking to become a leader. "
good,"Apple throws a lot at you, but it allows you to grow and develop into a tech expert.  The hours were good, but advancement seemed to be an issue as it seemed as if progression was stagnant for much of my time there."
good,"Great pay, "
good,"Apple Retail is ever evolving and looking to continuously improve the way Apple works for its people and it customers.  There is never a dull moment.  The company supports the development of its employees.  But like in every job, politics does come into play when promotions are available.  The company provides excellent benefits, the team members are fun to work with."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Working for Apple was an amazing experience that helped me develop certain traits and improve on weaknesses. I learned to be patient with customers and provide the top most service. Management was very welcoming and cool. They always had something new to teach. Best part of the job was my co-workers. They made it enjoyable for me. Very friendly atmosphere in my opinion. The hardest part I would say is humbling yourself with the customers.
good,some really great things but also not so great things!
good,"Some of the best colleagues I have worked with, with good benefits."
good,Apple was a very fast pace and fun atmosphere. You always had to have a bunch of energy and be ready for all types of people. It was fun because you were around so many people for all of the shifts. You got to know a lot of the people you worked with and become friends with them.
good,Great co-workers with in a large corporate company. Always new and interesting projects to work on and something new to learn everyday.
good,"While working for Apple Retail I provided insightful advice and friendly, hands-on technical support to Apple customers in need - quickly diagnosing product issues on the spot, explaining situations with patience and empathy. After determining whether repairs could be done or a replacement was needed, I offered solutions to quickly get users up and running again. When juggling more than one customer, it was very important to stay conscious of their time demands as well as my own."
good,"work load was heavy as i had to look after the day to day operations of the business. I learnt many skills like presence of mind, finishing scheduled tasks in time and most importantly maintaining Human relations. The proprietor of the organisation was always supportive and gave a chance to present new ideas and respected the views of the employees. Never felt frustrated or stressed at work even with heavy work load as employees were friendly and hard working. Though had problems with few employees at the beginning they were resolved in the long run. Staff were honest, reliable and loyal to the organisation. The most enjoyable part of work was recruiting people as it introduces different ideas, views personalities and exposure where there is chance to improve knowledge about different mindsets and people. Overall it was a very good and memorale experience with the organisation."
good,"On any given day I am a student, teacher, salesman, friend, consultant, and technician to our customers. While at the same time I am a key resource to my co-workers and an exemplary mode of the Apple brand and it's core values."
good,"Every day in our lives comes with different challenges and working at a retail store for Apple it definitely is, helping customers at the Genius bar and performing In-Store Repairs were main parts of the job responsibility. With every new product or software there was always opportunity to grow and learn more about how to best provide customer service."
good,I love working for Apple! The company is fun and energetic and they care about not only their customer but their employees as well.
good,"During my time here, I was introduced to very unique and productive work environment. This setting allowed me to gain a unique perspective and provided insight into how such a hugely successful business sets goals, and provides employees the tools necessary to surpass them."
good,"Great job out of college and best place to work if you must work retail. As you age and priorities change, the retail grind and pace will begin to wear on you."
good,"I worked specifically in the college organization, which is meant to work around your college schedule as an advisor, and I had the added benefit of being able to work from home. As long as you stay within privacy guidelines, it's a great and convenient experience for anyone looking to receive soft skills and an experience of working with Apple!"
good,"I loved working for a company with such strong mission. Biggest challenges were working retail hours, loud environment and difficult customers when their devices weren't working."
good,"The experience I had at Apple was great. The employees were helpful and supportive, the management team was always there to assist and make sure breaks were taken, and the atmosphere of the work space was high pace and always changing, which was exciting. The only downside was the fact that moving up within the workplace was slow-moving, and almost non-existent. That reason alone was ultimately why I moved on to another job with higher potential for growth."
good,"Enjoyed working there. Felt welcome and supported at all times. Great bunch of people and solid team ethos. At times I felt that I couldn't serve the customer's interests fully due to time limitations, but I reckon as time goes on in the role I was in, you learn to meet their requirements with more efficiency and learn that in some cases you cannot do everything in the time provided."
good,"Works effectively within a team environment to achieve specific tasks or projects such as Develops constructive working relationships with co workers as an effective team player as demonstrated by willingness to help out and contribute as required to use industrial dishwashing equipment.Is proactive in sharing knowledge, skills and expertise with other team members.Could demonstrate more of a team focus by helping others achieve tasks to complete the overall project."
good,"Apple has ton of benefits to offer, and training is great,  it you have to perform and grow you you want to advance in company. Apple is great place to learn with lists of careers promotions."
good,"I moved up very quickly and he training was top notch. We did have team restructuring and it was a bit too much but other than hat I had no complaints as. Had great opportunities and I worked from home . If I had the chance I would gladly take a position with them again. All benefits were great, customers were our number 1 focus with metrics coming second . The culture was amazing and I could always count on teammates and other employees for help with difficult issues. The  coaching was great and raises were fair and regularly offered. I still check regularly for open positions so that I can work for such a great company again. One of the best working experiences with amazing benefits . If i get the chance I will attempt to become apart of the company again as I love he products, the atmosphere, the customer focused support groups , the job variety , opportunities available and just everything as a company."
good,Wonderful Job! Apple takes care of its employees and provides a sound work environment. The job is competitive and fun. A lot of great relationships are made and good experience is gained.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Apple is a great company with boundless of opportunities. The best part is the benefits. Apple offers tuition reimbursement which is for me the greatest perk.
good,"I loved working on campus for Apple at the Austin Location. My team was like my family! Apple always provided fun and new things on-site for the employees. "
good,A typical day at work is greeting customers and provide them with great customer service. Always be ready to provide solutions and right products to offer to the customer. Great opportunities to learn different apple products and educate the public when customer comes to the store. It can be very busy at times to address the needs of the customers.
good,Das Team ist einfach unglaublich. Das ist der Spirit des Unternehmens.
good,"I worked at Apple as a Product Zone Specialist for a year. In my specific store the best part of working there was the people. Apple truly works hard to create a good working culture. Of course there are protocols that come with any job, hitting specific metrics and holding yourself accountable and being an A+ brand ambassador. I enjoyed my time but they didn't really accommodate specific things I needed to be an employee, so that's why I no longer work there. They want you to love working there and to dedicate your life to Apple, so keep that in mind."
good,"Pay and career advancement could have been better. However, no typical workplace politics made it an enjoyable place to work. A great place to work your way through college."
good,"great and memorable team."
good,Loved working here for the time that I did. Took care of their employees. Always room for growth and development. Fun work culture. Call center atmosphere.
good,"Great benefits available working with the business, plenty of opportunity for progression but hard work is required to get there."
good,"Awesome company great to be there, would recommend it to any body because hiring process isn’t difficult and once you’re hired there’s all types of great benefits"
good,"Everyone was very helpful during my training and work time at Apple. I was an At-Home Advisor, they supplied everything I needed to complete my work efficiently. Co-workers, supervisors, and even other departments were very supportive when I needed assistance handling customer issues. Training was also informative as well, my trainer ensured that I had all the resources necessary to understand everything I needed to know about the job itself. If I had the opportunity, I'd love to come back to work for the company, I had family issues going on at the time where my ex mother-in-law was gravely ill. That interfered with my work, however they were very understanding of my situation."
good,Apple was a great job and offered good benefits and discount and treated employee great. I worked from home it was great for awhile. but i would have loved to see what it would be like to work in the stores
good,Overall a good company to work for. Your experience with the company will highly be reflective with your management team. The work in the retail stores is fast paced and at times a little crazy.
good,"Apple has a fantastic workplace culture, a thorough training plan, and great benefits. I liked all the managers and felt a genuine sense that they not only did their best to be everything they needed to be to upper management - but in meeting OUR needs as employees and people. The demand for excellence they set was a high bar but they provided most of the tools to be successful at hitting that bar. The only reason I left was because I had other ambitions outside of the job and had to eventually make a one-or-the-other decision. Even though I was a PT employee, I felt the demand was great, especially because Apple would require temporary FT schedules during Apple's peak seasons. But that said, and to Apple's credit, I've also never worked for a company that was so generous with benefits as to provide the same FT benefits as a PT employee. Just be prepared to fully dedicate yourself to the position and constantly educate yourself on their products and services. In the end, I didn't just learn a lot about Apple - I gained important insight from the people I helped and grew a little bit in the process."
good,A typical day at apple is very welcoming and promising. I learned how to handle the smallest to biggest customer complaints and was able to use my resources there to figure out a resolution as fast as i can. The management was very supportive of your needs and will stretch miles in order to secure your happiness at the store.
good,"I most typical day that I had Multimedia is, one day I had a customer and she was from Japan and she was not able to speak English and she was willing to buy few things that she need in urgent."
good,"Apple prepares you for the position with great training that you can carry through into your future, however, without above average organizational and time management skills you will easily get overwhelmed. It’s also a call center position where you will need to understand every call is going to begin negatively every day."
good,Apple computer refurbishing distribution center is a fast pace business alot of problem solving and customer relations issues addressed due to water house accessibility and convince. I recommend that anyone seeking full-time ware house work should consider and apply for a position it was an excellent experience.
good,"Great Culture, great people. You have to really ooze corporate culture. With that said, I did enjoy my time at Apple and would highly recommend to someone looking to spend some time working there."
good,"Apple is a great place. Everybody wants to help people and it shows. Everybody cares about everybody else succeeding and is always open for questions. The pay is great for retail work and the work/life balance is wonderful. The schedule can be a pain, but it's hard to have a good schedule in the retail world."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I worked from home as an iOS advisor. Phone calls were fast paced, and sometimes stressful at first. Management was great, and always available to speak to."
good,"If you are skilled enough to pass the interview process and training, it is a great place to work. Very customer oriented rather than solely concentrating on numbers ."
good,"Working at Apple was an invaluable experience. There were plenty of opportunities to work with brilliant people. Set schedules rotated every few months with lots of overtime available. "
good,"Most days were the same in and out, could be very repetitive. Management seemed to truly care about us as individuals not just as an employees. I learned to multitask very quickly and effectively, it was a necessary skill when helping several customers at once. I met some really great people, both co-workers and customers, and learned a different side of customer service. I was problem solving all day long and loved doing it."
good,"Only a contract position, but would absolutely work here again. I've heard horror stories of how some contracted people are worked, but overall part it is an awesome place to work."
good,I enjoy the company. But retail is not a career choice for me. That's the only reason why I would leave. Everyone strives to be better and support those around them.
good,"Great people to work for, but the stress of a call center is one that I could not handle. The people who work their are great but customers can be very rude sometimes."
good,"I was employed with Apple for six months as an AHA IOS adviser."
good,At AppleCare you have to assume responsibility for your work as you're not micromanaged. People are there to help you but you are responsible for making sure that you reach a resolution with customers which directly effects potential bonuses. If you do a good job then the bonuses are worth it. Training was very helpful and well done.
good,"Apple is a diverse company great place to grow, the people are great and helpful your always updated on new and what to look for thats coming to the company great training and benefits"

good,"Amazing place to work at, good benefits, talented peers, many development opportunities. The culture is amazing, it is consistent throughout the whole company."
good,Apple was a rewarding company to work for. The hours were difficult and they were inflexible in scheduling. I enjoyed learning about the needs of various customers.
good,"As an ""At Home Advisor"" there aren't many advancement opportunities. If you're wanting to work from home, Apple is definitely the best company to be a part of."
good,"like any retail job, it has its ups and downs. great benefits, good amount of hours for part timers. lots of perks and good work/life balance."
good,"Mostly technical support, working customer service upon calls with hardware or software issues with most Apple products. I had learned a lot about the products and customers relations itself. Co workers were great. Hardest part has to be difficult customers. Most enjoyable was the"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,The management was very nice. I got to learn a lot during the internship. The whole culture of the organization is centered around delivering amazing products. Attention to detail is in the DNA. I got a chance to meet some really talented individuals.
good,"the job consisted on welcoming the customers via phone, it wasn't that hard. the hardest part of this job was convincing customers to purchase from the online store when it wasn't really needed. i learned a lot, i learned simply how to deal with all kind of customers."
good,"Apple has a rigorous hiring process which is fantastic for finding the best of the best employees. Lots of opportunity for movement, both laterally and promotions."
good,"Challenging place with nice people. Feedback from management was quick and helpful. The most difficult aspect was getting consistent information, but it was a very good experience."
good,"Apple is Apple, no matter how you slice it. If you want to do well, you will. While the corporate ladder is long, it's very competitive. You will be fighting against the best of the best (Apple doesn't hire just anyone)."
good,"Since it was GITEX shoppers it had to be an active environment with 12 hours a day dedicated to the job at hand , that being sales."
good,It's fun to work in startup environment along with lot of learning and innovation. Individuals' knowledge matters a lot for the company. It's always good to work with an organisation with abundance of energy. Also employees' new ideas are always matters to the organisation. Every day activities and interaction with global team members helps person to groom himself. Good work life balance and other cultural activities organised by company is an added advantage.
good,"Usual day starts off checking emails, then on calls for the day with 2 breaks and a lunch between this."
good,Never boring and is always busy.  Fun friendly staff and everyone works together as a family.  Managers and staff work hand in hand as equals and we are always improving one another to become better workers and people.
good,"-Fast pace environment with new challenges everyday"
good,"I worked with their summer program for 2 months.  Training is intense but you leave feeling equipped to do the job.  But with any over the phone customer support job they can't prepare you for everything.  Calls vary day to day, minute to minute.  Very rewarding job."
good,"I'm usually first in the door and hit the ground running. I'd check-in with co-workers and see what was ""hot"" and if I could assist. Management was brought in from outside and it made it difficult for any long time employee to advance. I enjoyed seeing the job through and ""catching the bad guy."""
good,"I worked till 1997 and it will be different now."
good,"Despite the many various reviews from outsiders, this place really does believe in its product. The work they put into making the experience a pleasurable one for the customer is outstanding. The person that is responsible for the hiring criteria is a genius and it definitely encourages some unique and beautiful people to work alongside. It's an open, trusting, and loving environment that truly encourages you to do your best at any & all times. They encourage you to have a life outside of work so as to come to work fulfilled and ready to enjoy another day, which helps out more than you can imagine. There is LOADS of training that you can take at any time, the benefits are great for anyone that enjoys Apple products, fitness, technology, uses public trans...the list goes on."

good,"Provided technical support to iPhone end-users. Telephone support for iPhone, iTunes and workstation."
good,"My days are spent with both customers and employees, instructing them on how to use Apple software and products.  I also work with the employees on building presentation skills and techniques.  The management team at Apple truly cares about the well-being of all employees and ensures that everyone has the opportunity pursue their own goals."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Great software development team, lots of incoming work to write internals tools for the marketing team. Great to collaborate with creative clients."
good,"Each day at work was lovely, i love the atmosphere of the competitiveness and teamwork. i learned a hand full of skills working for Apple, A great sales acumen, quality customer service, being goal oriented, and most of all having fun while working hard. The management/co-workers are the best you can possibly find anywhere."
good,"Typical Day at work consists of:"
good,Great work environment where you are expected to be yourself.
good,"I learned how to communicate with my co-workers, how to use a computer to print the production labels, and how to package Its."
good,"I live Apple, they are great to work for. That is unless you love your evenings and weekends as an AppleCare Advisor,"
good,Depending on your actual job title at Apple it can be a very stressful job. Great place too work though just can be draining.

good,"Productive and fun place to work, always very busy. Very positive atmosphere, always looking for the bright side instead of the gloomy side. People willing to help and answer questions from technological newbies."
good,Apple Retail is a great place to work. There is a very positive environment which sets up each employee for success. Comprehensive training is provided prior to starting to ensure employees are comfortable with the products and services offered at Apple. Each shift includes a wide range of tasks and area of the store to work at which does not make it mundane. The benefits offered are great! Would definitely recommend working there.
good,"They care about their employees! "
good,"The benefits are amazing, considering this as a work-from-home college job. The job is demanding and requires a lot of mental energy to deal with customers and requires lots of time too if you've got lots of classes (and can become stressful on top of everything). Management was great, environment was great, support was fantastic, benefits were incredible, and customers were almost always really kind. Overall loved the job!"
good,"The retail experience at Apple is unique in that it provides an all-in-one shopping and support experience for customers buying into the Apple ecosystem. The team works closely together in order to efficiently manage all areas of the business, and the company leverages technologies to assist in day-to-day activities. The workplace culture is one of continued learning and development, and it encourages employees to empower themselves to learn from peers in order to create the best customer experience. Metrics are reviewed regularly in order to provide an overview of performance as well as to demonstrate areas of opportunity in growth. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about a diverse pool of customers daily and building life-long relationships with teammates."
good,This role is not for people who are afraid to interact. Not an easy job but worth all of the hard work. You'll meet a lot of nice individuals who share the same love for Apple just as you do.
good,"I have worked at Apple for more than 3 years, and I have enjoyed my experience. There is a lot of opportunity for career development and growth within the company, and management is very good at helping you along the way. There is constant self-guided training to keep you up-to-date on new procedures and issues and I never felt out of the loop. They make sure you are well-prepared."
good,"If you love being around energetic go getting people it’s a great place to work! The tech world is always moving forward and Apple has plenty of training to help you as you go! You get what you put into it though, so work hard and you will gain a new family to work with."
good,A great company to work for who treats you well in many aspects. Many perks to the business but you will have to get a job to find out.  It can be intense as you are expected to be constantly talking an approaching people. From my experience managers are really great and helpful some watch you and can be on your back if your not actively approaching customers
good,"The callers loved Apple, maybe 60-80% were happy, which is amazing. Very challenging, extremely steep learning curve. iLog software worked fairly well. It was impossible to find a customer's notes on previous calls, without customer providing information first."
good,I have nothing bad to say about this place everything was awesome and I met some of the best people at this place only downfall is it is hard to get full time hours
good,I worked on the phones doing customer support. Management is awesome and you can really be yourself. Everyone is nice. The only thing is that career advancement in technical support leads to more technical support unless you shoot for a management role.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"$15 an hour starting- for customer service specialists in Boston. Great for young people who want experience somewhere reputable. It is very cult-y so be careful not to lose yourself. "
good,"Same thing everyday, but get to learn the basics of an apple product. Very fast pace, they try their best to think about the workers concerns in any situations."
good,If you enjoy working in a fast paced environment where you will have an opportunity to learn about new hardware and software technologies this is a place for you. The pay is competitive but a lot is demanded in return. Overall fair work environment
good,Not cut throat sales! Empathize with the customer and recommend the best solution. Easy stuff. They actually care about your growth and advancement here. Definitely recommend working at Apple.
good,I would come into work and make sure all the counters were clean. I would also prep my coffee station. I learned how to how to work very well under pressure. I also learned how to make all sorts of coffees. The management team was very helpful and would always be ready to encourage and teach. The workplace culture was busy and very clean as well. Hardest part of the job was not ever messing up on anyone's drinks. The most enjoyable part of the job being able to talk to and meet all of the customers.
good,"Implementation, and integration, and managed services. It also offers data and transaction processing services, website hosting, and outsourced services for such functions as customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning. Company targets clients in the financial services, manufacturing, retail, and telecommunications industries, along with governments and utilities."
good,Its ok i mean just i dont like being Store Manager because you really dont do anything just sit in your office but i wish i was a Apple Spcealist i love meeting new people
good,"One of the best companies to work for if you don't tire from the annoying customers. Dissemination of information is really good, typically good managers"
good,"It was a great company to work for, but the schedule is too hectic. The staff were great and friendly. But the schedule was conflicting with my school"
good,"Had fun working for Apple, my position was home based and I just do not think working at home is best for me. I love to get out and meet people, however, the training received is very beneficial for other call center and technical careers."
good,"A very employee-centered company. They took care of us: good benefits, work/life balance, empathetic managers, inspirational and motivational place to work."
good,"I have greatly enjoyed my time at Apple thus far and continue to look forward to the many more things I will learn and all the laughter I will share with my coworkers. "
good,The workers and management were all great at the Elk Grove building. The perks aren't great as far as swag but there is a cafeteria and they do sometimes giveaway old computers. The work can be stressful because I was in Customer Service. Some people can be mean. You can't let what customers say affect you.
good,"It is a good job to do, I like to work with apple, we can learn a lot by working with apple, management is very friendly and strict, good co-workers."
good,"Work for the experience, stay for the people. The culture of Apple is unmatched to other companies I have worked for. Their only flaw is communication with their corporate HR department."
good,great work but not meeting my salary.Looking for benefits then a average salary.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"All team members are friendly and very very supportive, they have your back if you feel stuck within a situation. The company as a whole has the mentality of learning together."
good,"Working at this company will help me greatly and will give more experience about the company, and I will sell very well for the company. People will come to buy goods there every time."
good,"Pros: "
good,"Apple is a great place to work for, good management and great teamwork overall, the job was temporary but I would love to have a permanent full time position in the near future."
good,"It's a great place to work if you're a badge employee. Apple treats employees great. However, it is difficult to get badged in. Going through the temp agency can be tough. On average you will spend a year with a temp agency before getting hired"
good,"work life very good, extra benifits are too good, always motivation you will get. ther provide training everytime. apple gadgets are too good to work for"
good,Wonderful place to work.  I would have stayed longer but moved.  I became apple certified in a lot of different areas.  I love to be challenged and I'm very good worker.
good,Apple is one of the best retail franchices you can work for. It teaches you so much about technology and makes you believe in the awesome products that they have. The ability to move up in the compnay in any directions is always there. This is a great place to work.
good,"I learned how to communicate technology in the simplest way possible. I also learned how to help people solve their problems."
good,"Me gustó mucho el trabajo aprendí mucho janitor "
good,"Good company, bad pay. The money wasnt good enough to justify the hours that you worked and the management didn't understand how to run a business properly."
good,"Management here is a joke. If you're hired in as a part-time employee, expect to sell your should for full-time. Unless of course you magically become a favorite. Then you will skyrocket to the top. But, you'll probably get fired for stealing. All of their favorites seem to get fired for theft."
good,"All inbound and outbound logistics"
good,My overall experience with the company was great. However I did come in contact with management who approached me in a way that no employee show be approached.
good,"If you want to soak up the zero-sum, no prisoners approach to technology, Apple is great! I recommend such a company once for each person in their life."
good,"Beyond making great products, Apple is also best at delivering one of the greatest customer experiences within retail. Apple employees are trained to deal with any type of sales or service interaction in a manner befitting a manner the respects the person, the employee and the Apple culture."
good,I loved that I always had something to do. It made the days go by fast. The breaks and lunches suffered however. Assisting in the repair of Apple products was fun and helped to be able to fix your own products.
good,"I take calls from customers, product support,advice and billing.I have learned many skills including how to problem solve and help customers resolve issues to satisfaction. I love contact and interaction with customers but I would prefer face to face contact."
good,good company good benefits.  I was with the company for 5 years and it was a great experience.  Most admired company in the world and it showed. People and culture are strong
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Specific store created a culture of micromanagement and lack of trust. Incredibly stressful and unenjoyable. I would recommend apple as a company. stores would be on a per location basi
good,They treat you like property they cuss at you they yell at you they judge you they blame you for their mistakes they fire you without asking anything about what happened
good,"While you may be working for one of the world's leading technology firms, understand that from the perspective of your customers and your managers you are a retail employee."
good,It is a great place to work and flexible.  Great benefits and a very face-paced environment.  The hardest part is working through abiguity. The most enjoyable part is working with the people.
good,Overall better work environment than their competitors and they make sure to compensate employees fairly. Managers make or break the store. Sometimes what is asked of sales team is not taught in training
good,It’s one of those jobs that you can’t get emotionally attached to in order to do it right. They watch your every move and they really wait for you to mess up which is why you have to keep your head in the game. Managers in Apple are supposed to be considered resources but they really don’t like you “dumb” questions and they are very arrogant at times. So it’s best to Google things first before asking them for help.
good,Work for home was the best part about this job. I would return if the pay was better. I worked doing technical support over the phone. just troubleshooting
good,"Apple offers a ton of value to their employees- healthcare is the best I’ve had, the culture is fun, but competitive and very high pressure.  All employees work Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  This is criminal.  The hours and holiday work demand is less than desirable."
good,"Nothing bad to say, only here because I am required.  Not sure why they want me to review them, it's a great place to work. they bring beer trucks on to campus, management is cool."
good,All white around the pantry area and aesthetically pleasing. The computers we use are all Macintosh same with phones and gaming tablets. the whole working space is modernized and simply white.
good,The job was very laid back. It was a work from home position. Therefore it was very convenient. There was a great deal of pleasure and independence in working from home.
good,it was a nice and fun environment for work unfortunately the leading system was so weak and their behaviors were not good with the employees v weak management
good,"They matched  up tp 4% in my 401k. We also got yearly stock grants. The company culture changed from store to store. "
good,Enjoyable environment to work. Very professional that motivates you to go to work. I like how flexible they are and always work with you. Always opportunities to move up in this company.
good,Great experience for a 1st job out of college but little to no room for moving up as a contractor. Someone who works hard gets paid the same as someone messing around all day. Apple Beer Bashes are a great time.
good,"great place to work I loved my time here, great culture great smart people. great vision, amazing company to spend your time at. I would reccomend to anyone"
good,"its all in the title!"
good,"After you are trained and learned in your project, you will perform fairly monotonous work for the entire contract. It is best to learn one project very well and move onto the next to learn as much as possible. The best part about the job is that you mostly work by yourself, and there is no boss hounding you to complete work by deadlines. The atmosphere is very relaxed and stress free. Collaboration is encouraged and everyone is willing to help each other out. "
good,"its been fabulous 3 years 8 months with Apple, but now is the time to move for my own further future."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

good,"10 hour day"
good,I was wrongfully terminated due to being put on a thirty day performance evaluation and failed due to technical issued caused by the company. I clearly followed all rules and procedures required to document and or fix the issues and was told by the companys   own help desk who advised the reason why your perfomance is failing due to technical issues is because my manager had took all my normal work permissions away. These permissions were taken away prior to my review. None the less I was still terminated. Other than that I Apple Inc is a wonderful place to work for and I live by their products. Til this day I would still recommend Apple products over any other products.
good,"The work is steady and the hours remain the same. My position is contracted, so there is little opportunity for advancement. The management treats us well, but we are replaceable, and are often treated as such. Pay and compensation is not too great, and contracting for positions that are ongoing projects with no set end date doesn't make sense, as it stifles our pay and lowers our incentive to work."
good,"Well time spent knowledge gained was priceless"
good,"IBEX Global seems good on the outside, but in retrospect, it is very disorganized and they hire just about anyone. I would love to work at the actual Apple company if I had the chance to."

good,I do not wish to disclose the details of my work or comment on the culture or relationships I have at Apple. What I find most enjoyable is how Apple is able to make such a large company feel so small and intimate.

good,Was able to learn from my challenges.Couldn't have done it without the cooperation of team members because they were willing to learn and grow. They allowed me to do my job as a servant leader.
good,"Great company, very busy pace which makes time go by faster. Staff was diverse and prides itself on inclusion. Management was thoughtful towards staff as well."
good,"Apple underpays on average for mid and lower-level jobs because they offer the cache of the company name.  If you're not in Cupertino, your experience there will be like any other tech company."
good,Working at Apple lives up to the hype. There are plenty of benefits and my managers were all very supportive and wanted to see you grow. Hardest part for me was working remotely from home and at a desk all day.

As an Apple customer service agent I am tasked with going through a month long training course, graduating, from Apple in product and policy knowledge of all internal workings of the online and physical retail stores,  We were also tasked with creating a completely unique and delightful experience for each customer while at the same time, solving all of the customers current and future issues.

good,"I worked in the Genius Bar. I helped customers. It was a nice experience, as everyone who works there is also awesome. There were many changes since I last worked there, so my information isn't the current state of affairs."
good,La experiencia como tal en el mundo Apple es única

good,"Esperienza positivissima,formativa,molto piacevole "
good,Fine company just the managment was not professional and we needed more support on the floor. The team leaders did not act in a professional manor and acted more like your friend
good,No movement within the company for the 2 years i was there. Met wonderful friends with a wealth of knowledge. Very mindless work for the most part. Always use your Kbase
good,"Everyone was always on the same page and knew where they stood--working toward one common goal. Even though they have hundreds of billions of dollars in the bank, it always felt like a start up. everyone striving for the best they could do."
good,"It was a big pleasure work with them. Good staff, structure, parking, atmosphere, i have sure that some day if i have an opportunity, i'll return work there."

good,Really enjoyed working at Apple. I learned so much about customer service. Always be empathetic and understanding and never assume the worst from people.
good,"Securing buildings and protecting personal and providing excellent customer service. I learned secrecy is a very big deal in the tech industry.  My workplace culture was very inviting, everybody got along with each other. The hardest part of the job was night shift."
good,Overall a great company. Working in a small store means less coverage & makes it difficult to request days off. I found it hard to move up or even around in the company even if you’re doing great
good,I worked as a student AppleCare Advisor and it was great! You can work from home via the iMac that's provided to you. Everyone is very eager to help you learn about new issues as well as the exciting new technology coming out.

good,"I enjoyed every minute working with my specialized team. We designed data centers and had very intriguing work. I felt included even though I was a contractor.

good,De nombreuses opportunités d'évolution quand on se donne à 100%.
good,"Compare to other F.A.N.G companies, Apple is very work related friendly to employees. There is no cut throat competition nor fire people because they could not be the best. But the lower level management is bad. Because they are so afraid to fire people, the promotion is mostly based on friendship and pulling the strings. If you could stay with Apple for 10+ , you can get to different place different level even though you have no education nor continuous education for that duty."
good,"Great environment, great hours, and great people made apple a relaly fun place to work, not to mention the great discounts and benefits that we were offered."
good,I learned how to solve any and all problems with Apple devices. I learned to run a team of fellow co-workers and to balance the challenges each day of doing so.
good,"Apple itself is a great company. I had a terrible experience at the store level, but that was just the nature of that specific management group, nothing to do with Apple, Inc."
good,"They trained me very well.  I was busy from the time I walked into work until quitting time, Great experience. It is difficult to pass the interview process. I especially loved the management style there, they were very positive and encouraging!"
good,Apple is fast paced and will require you to learn a lot of information in short periods of time and then turn around and apply that knowledge well. I learned a lot at Apple. Great place to work.
good,"Although a very fast-paced and high-energy work environment, it was the greatest challenge and the most enjoyable company that I have ever worked for. Management did their very best to eliminate politics from the workplace and focus on what the ""right thing was to do"". Apple has a fascinating culture and work ethic and I felt as though I never worked a day in my tenure since I enjoyed it so much. Certainly, there was pressure to meet deadlines and stress to get tools to work properly (like anywhere else in my career), however, people worked together as a team to overcome obstacles and get things done in a professional manner. The only reason I left the company was to retire from the semiconductor industry after 40 years!"
good,Working for Apple is amazing I love working there because the environment. The peers are and managers are an amazing supportive people who motivate you on a daily.
good,"The team spirit energy at Apple is second to none.  I learned more about customer service in the two years I worked there than in my entire career.  The only reason I left is because the role I performed did not reflect the entire of my experience and skillset, so I left for a more compatible position."
good,"Apple hat echt eine legere Arbeitskultur, man wird so akzeptiert wie man ist, leider eine Seltenheit bei nicht mal halb so erfolgreichen Unternehmen."

Apple sells their products all around the world.[5] Apple Inc. used to be called Apple Computer, Inc.,work here"

good,"Productive and fun work place ,a lot of hardworking people .easy to work to this environment ,a lot of overtime no hassle and friendly staff..I like working to this kind of job and very easy for me"

good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

good,Few jobs are better! You meet great people there and it's a very supportive environment where they allow you to flourish and not just in skills related to the role.
good,Flexibility is not there. They always seemed short staffed so there was never an option to do overtime. It was pretty much you take the overtime or face the consequences elsewhere.
good,Apple is a company that really focuses on personal growth and development. It genuinely feels like management always has your best interest at heart and is always working to make you a better person/employee.
good,Eu definitivamente nunca trabalhei na apple e provavelmente nunca irei
good,"It was fun to be able to tell people I worked at Apple. But in all honesty its a retail job with little to no career advancements. When it comes down to open positions every employee acts like a hungry piranha and everyone applies for the SAME 1 position. I was passed over for newer employees even when I had years of experience in a certain role. Moving up into management is even harder. Apple cut off their internship to harvest corporate employees from the retail stores 1 year before I graduated and that cut off that inside track to a REAL career at Apple. "
good,"it is a great company to move to management quickly. If you are career minded, the rigor of Apple may be for you. It is a very strict environment and not everyone can handle being micro managed."
good,"great company to work for , excellent and level headed top mgmt. takes care of employees and invests in them for long term."

good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Its a hard labor job that was interesting into learning better and more of work. The enivorments that varity of locations where good areas and where suitable.
good,"great place to work, benefits are great even for part time employees, management can be a bit mis understood due to lack of communication because of products launches. but overall a great company."
good,"It's just good place to work "
good,Good people wish I could have worked there longer but the temp contract ran out due to the battery program being canceled nationwide. Extremely difficult to get hired though Apple even with a foot in the door

good,"It is a retail position don't have high hopes of having a family life and succeeding in this company. Great for benefits, and as a side job. Not many opportunities to make it big or have it as a professional career."
good,"The knowledge and training that I received working for this company, I would continue to apply those experiences to any part of my future opportunities in careers."
good,Couldn't ask for a better job. Wouldn't even consider leaving if I wasn't relocating.  Working at Apple was a phenomenal experience. The people you work with all work as a team to accomplish a single goal. The work/life balance is understood and culture is great! I would highly recommend working for an Apple retail store if you enjoy the retail environment. There is room to grow with the company and your professional development is a responsibility all Managers take seriously within the Apple culture.
good,"I helped with a store opening, and this was an exciting event. They're very helpful with providing knowledge before you start, and make sure that you feel responsible working on the floor."
good,"Liked work just a little slow paced"
good,The job was fantastic and I want to go right back. The managers care about your work and life balance along with your personal life. Hard to get into but the store is unlike any retail you have worked before.
good,"There's more to this job than meets the eye. Quality is definitely job #1, but productivity is important as well. Some people thrive in that kind of environment, others have a tough time. I was one who was able to thrive. However, it was a temporary job, lasting from 2 weeks to a year, depending on how valuable you turned out to be to the company. I lasted the full year."
good,Never a dull moment.  The best part of the job and the most challenging are the same.  You will have to navigate your job with minimal information and the change direction at the drop of a hat.
good,Apple gives you every opportunity to succeed whether its help with your skillset or listening to different opportunities you are interested in. They give you every opportunity to grow within the company

They let me review resumes and pick a few applicants I thought would fit into the culture.  I got to schedule employees weekly, but I also got to help run product launch days and help with the planning of those events...it was neat to see how much thought and energy goes into something of that magnitude.  I also helped out our business team, which at that time had one of those highest revenues in the company. I did data entry with them and constantly ran their numbers and helped with presentations.  The hardest part of the job was working some weekends and late evenings.  The most enjoyable part was the freedom that I got from my supervisors - they really helped me develop as a person and an employee.  It was a fantastic opportunity."

I perform other roles within the store too, whether it’s maintaining visual merchandising or assisting team members. Always curious, I stay on top of news about products and initiatives, ready to apply learning in customer interactions.

I had 5 different Managers over the course of a year and each was different. My co-workers were liek minded and enjoyable to talk to. Hardest part was being at home and not having a direct manager/supervisor to ask for help or ask questions to.

So all I can say is that Apple was a well run machine that was super busy when I was there. I felt like I needed more help and didn't see that happening.

That was not the same I could say for leadership. A few managers were great, but the vast majority were terrible leaders and needed a crash course in leading a team. As for moving on up... think again. It was a popularity contest and did not give you the will to apply for a new position when you were at the top already."

I develop long lasting relationships with my customers because of my sense of urgency with their needs, open communication and a willingness to learn about them."
good,"It was really hard to get through the interview for this job but eventually i did get a position. very good company to work and learn for. I have learned about new techniques to count stock or find out waste. programmes like tumbler, SAP were used which are really helpful and accurate. every one in this company is very helpful."
good,Good place to work and gain experience. Colleagues are very helpful
good,"I have been fortunate to move up steadily within a small (200+), locally owned company."
good,good place to work
good,"I worked as a sales associate here. It's a small company, but has loyal customers. It was difficult to stay based on the pay. There isn't a lot of room for upward mobility."
good,"I managed a small group of individuals. Here I built my leadership skills and managerial abilities. The most enjoyable part of my position was working in an environment where creativity was not just welcomed, but expected."
good,A great place to work...they care about keeping their employees happy and healthy!
good,Great Company to work for with excellent benefits. Fast paced environment. Management was straight forward and honest.
good,"A typical day at work would be filled with phone calls, emails, communicating with internal co-workers and external partners."
good,Working for Apple was an ever changing environment that kept me on my toes. I had to learn to adapt to changes quickly. Working from home for Apple made me a self-starter and driven to exceed expectations with little supervision. The most rewarding part of the job was resolving my customers problems.
good,Great place to gain experience in sales and customer satisfaction.
good,Learned about the world's greatest products and loved working on visuals team setting up the infamous store window displays!
good,Great place to work with a large number of talented people.
good,Management is cool and treated us well. We always had fun at work but also always got work done. Store meetings were hilarious and different.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,A fast pased working environment in which clients need agent support at the ring of the phone. As agents we need to help them since at the end we are happy that we could help another in addressing urgent needs.
good,"One of the best companies I have ever worked for I learned about my strenghts and weaknesses, and get place to build leadership skills!"
good,"Excellent employer. Handle incoming phone, call, or chat customer contacts. Best part of the job would be the gratification of resolving a customer's issue."
good,"A typical day at Apple consists of meeting new people and enriching their lives with amazing products. Every day I learn something new, whether it is technology related or it is something about myself, every day I am growing. My management encourages a creative environment and puts great focus on personal development. My co-workers are extremely supportive; we give each other feedback in the moment so to make a more cohesive work environment. The hardest part of the job is having conversations with frustrated customers, however, knowing I have the ability to turn the situation around into something positive is something I strive towards. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I am surrounded with: co-workers, management, customers. It is a great environment for a people-person like myself."
good,"Working in the Apple retail store is a challenging and exciting opportunity. I am surrounded by the most talented and interesting individuals who are all working together toward enriching people's lives through technology. Management is highly approachable and gives me the tools in order to further my personal development at Apple. This job has definitely tested my patience, and there are times when it can be overwhelming. This is mostly due to the small size of the store and the crowds of people we see every single day. It is extremely noisy at times, so giving the customer undivided attention can be difficult. Knowing how to utilize my resources to find answers for customers is an integral key to success in my role, and I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to work with such amazing people."
good,this job is hard fun and alot of work people were nice and had alot of energy.
good,Although it is very busy and it requires a lot of talking it is a great place to work.
good,"if you like apple, youll love working there. others have tons of knowledge and youll learn something everyday."
good,"I truly believe Apple has one of the most amazing collection of talented individuals among companies. My development has been fast-paced and I've quickly accelerated through the retail chain to one of the more coveted positions in an Apple Retail Store - an Apple Genius. The training and skills I've developed in this role have prepared me to take on so much more responsibility. I'm thankful for my time with Apple, but at this point, the opportunities are not available and the pay is way below average for the amount of responsibility entrusted to me. I simply look forward to taking the amazing development I've seen from Apple and channel my skill set in another company who values a self-motivated, intelligent problem solver."
good,I found out his job was fun but you needed to make sure your internet at home worked with the Apple VPN. If you had issues with this your boss would not care.
good,Apple is a great place to work. The benefits are better than any job I've ever worked. They even pay for you to go back to school. The reason I left was because I could not do retail. The work life balance was difficult for me the older I became. I work there for 5 years. It was just time for me to chase after my dream and become more focused. other than that I would still be there.
good,If Apple paid their employees enough to enjoy all the discounts they received it would be worth it. The culture is great though. You have real support if you have questions or struggling. I learned how to lead more effectively being in the Apple culture.
good,"Voor een student is dit goed als opstap, na 1 jaar moet je wel omhoog geklommen zijn in functie anders gaat het al gauw vervelen."
good,Saved plenty of money during the yr I was there. Decent work environment. High security. Not much of a customer service job. Work on your own most of the time.
good,"Does this matter? I obviously don’t see the relevance of this question because it is in the past, where it will stay and I’m looking towards my future."
good,I learn lots of skills it was very nice and friendly environment and i really enjoy from my work specially at the team working with specialized people.
good,The work culture was pretty flexible and working from home option is also available sometimes. The enjoyable part of the work is good co-workers and good learning curve
good,"Nice place to work, but the hours were'nt as flexible as i needed them to be, or as they had advertised them to be. And i worked from home so it was harder for me to learn as quick as i usually can without hands on training"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Apple is a great company for nearly anyone that have a passion for technology. I enjoyed my time working there. So much growth in the company. A lot of enjoyable work to go around.
good,It’s “Apple” so you can rest easy knowing that they have the $$$ and don’t be afraid to take the promotion!!!!!!! Depending on your managements maturity level & self values; your experience with Apple will either be Good or Bad!!!!
good,"Beerbashes are awesome. "
good,Usually I would come to work around 10 am. I was in a room with a coworker and we both were doing similar projects. Twice a week we would all have meetings to discuss the trajectory of the project.
good,"Long story short, the corporate ropes are getting more and more tightened.  It used tone you could help anyone with any solution.  Now only apple provided solutions can be discussed, even if none of them fully fit the needs of the end user."
good,"Enjoy the time at Apple."
good,Great place to work. The easiest/most challenging job I’ve ever had. Great times great people great benefits! Interview process is intensive so they only pick the best.
good,Every person that i've met that worked for apple has loved the company. Unfortunately working for an apple contract is not the same. the floors are merely boiler rooms where the employees do not matter. fortunately the training is apple and you can learn a lot.
good,"Wonderful people and life long connections. "
good,"Apple was a solid company to work for. Just like any other place, there are downsides. But I would assume not as many as some other places might have."
good,"Work with the best become the best. Your career is what you make of it. Perfect place to work for go getters. Do not expect management to take interest in your career. It is up to you to have experiences, promotions, raises and advancement."
good,"It's great for entry-level call center work. However, contracted individuals are managed by outsourcing firms who micromanage and treat associates like numbers. I would not take a pay cut by $5 to work for the middleman."
good,"- I start my day with a group meeting which lasts about 30mins, giving info on how the day will run."
good,"Depends on how I start my day (good/bad) "
good,The company is overall great especially for part time employees. There is opportunities to advance but does require a great amount of focus and overall excessive working hours.
good,"Apple provided me with all the tools to be successful at work and even in life. "
good,"It was a friendly place to work, with welcoming staffs. As, the position was for Christmas Temp, I voluntarily did not mingle much but they all seemed pretty close and easy going."
good,"This place is a great place to work great family involvement there are opportunities for advancement but be aware sometimes there is an amount of politics that plays in. While we may not focus on the numbers all the time they are strongly considered when you are applying for advanced positions, which is something you may not hear. The overall culture corporately is great sometimes it does not get to the local level like it should. A typical day at work consist of certain various tests that are primarily driven by a customer base in a retail environment. The management there as a general philosophy that is good however on individual levels may not be seamless."
good,"Apple retail is a tough place to work. It’s great when you are in college and young but the older you get, the tougher the job gets because of lack of growth and respect. The entire culture of Apple has changed and the expectation is now to work with minimal resources. That isn’t the value we used to see. I was with Apple for roughly 7 years. Never grew within my role because it meant leaving the knowledge base that I had."
good,"Je ne travaillais pas directement pour Apple, à mon grand regret mais pour Telecom Assistance, qui était prestataire d'accueil pour Apple France."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"working for apple was and has been one of the most rewarding jobs i have ever held. that being said. the turnover rate is rather high, and some of the people that are hired are completely incompetent on basic troubleshooting issues. and with company policy focusing on the customer instead of their issue it does get rather tedious not being able to do your job the way you expect yourself to be able to do so"
good,"I learned a lot, people are helpful and exposure to many interesting projects.  Its a fast paced environment but flexible to accommodate life/work balance."
good,"A typical day at work is mostly fun."
good,"I was able to experience the transformation of Apple and to be part of its meteoric growth. The learning is like no other and the skills developed are transferable to other careers.  I am who I am because of Apple.  I am not saying it was easy, because it was not, you were expected to do your job and do it well.  The company has grown to be gigantic (100k+) and when I left it had become difficult to get things done, took longer for management decisions,  the sense of teamwork was diminishing, and politics were at an all time high.  I guess that is what happens when a company becomes gigantic."
good,"The site is awesome!"
good,A day at a call center is not the best I would prefer to work from only simpy to only have to deal witht he tools I need and assisting the customer affectively. Not in to call center restrictions on how many times you can use the bathroom or when their technology fails they dont pay for the time locked out of their systems
good,Apple is a great company to work at.  The diverse nature of the work and the support system they offer customers is number 1 in the industry and they strive to maintain that with each and every interaction.
good,"What I enjoy about Apple is the culture.  The company thrives off of staff being different and creative.  During my tenure at the company, it is more-than-okay to not know all the answers, but to find a way to get it."
good,"Its a good place to gain professional skills ,to advance and move on ."
good,"- co - workers were hard working and no one backed out"
good,"A typical day at work includes working hard to ensure you are successful at work, coming to the office with a positive attitude and doing it again the next day! Hard work pays off."
good,"very delightful company to work with. The people are positive, the work environment is laid back, and the customers are very loving toward the assistance provided."
good,"excellent job, little advancement opportunity. Recent changes in leadership make high commissions more difficult with large deal reductions and gates on income multipliers. Everyone has dropped in income sharply across the board."
good,Heavy call volumes on a daily basis
good,This is an amazing opportunity for someone who wants to challenge themselves to work with and learn how to connect to almost every personality type under the sun (with both internal and external customers).
good,"Amazing company.. fun place to work for. The hours are great and the technology is up to date, if not advanced and ready for the future."
good,This is a great job if you have the time and have an open schedule particularly for students coming out of college more kids coming out of high school. However if you do choose to have kids apple does assist you to the utmost with that also they offer tuition reimbursement along with a slew of other benefits
good,"Apple was a great company to work for. I was an at home college advisor, this is apples customer support. My managers were great and approachable. Would love to work for apple again some day."
good,"Good company but needs  better work/life balance for at home agents. Management is adequate but had issues with consistency. Great team environment, however, could use some revamping in regards to on-going training and support."
good,"I learned a lot at apple, including how to manage my time, team work and the value of a dollar! It was an excellent paying job with great managers and leaders."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Great salary for a student "
good,"I worked at Apple for 5 years and had a mostly-great time there. The hours of the job are completely random, and planning life around your work schedule isn't easy. Depending on the store where you work, your management team will either support you and back you or they'll leave you high and dry, but I guess that's everywhere you work. Great job, no matter what you do there, horrible work hours."
good,"Every day I miss my colleagues, the environment and perks of working at Apple and hope opportunities open up there for me in the future! I would highly recommend it to someone who has the chance to get in."
good,Easy work great employees and managers were fair I enjoyed the time here it was a journey too bad the pay was not liveable hopefully there’s better opportunities
good,"Amazing work environment. Great staff, management is encouraging and helpful. Coworkers have a team based ideology. Downside is career development. You work hard as a salesperson just to get full time. Hard to become manager and their isn't much opportunity after that. Wonderful place to work, but not a great place for a career."
good,"If you have the ability to work in a fast, timely manner with a loud environment, this is the place to be. It is always a crowded environment from the moment the store opens until it closes. Filled with lots of energy, you have a great time and numerous resources to turn to when unsure about how to accomplish something the right way. Management at times cane be more on the micro-management style but overall, managers are fun and easy to talk to."
good,"Tons of discounts through other retailers with this job which is great. Cult like culture and environment definitely made me uncomfortable. They have WAY TOO MANY managers, & when you have a bad one there are SO MANY WAYS they can get you to quit or get fired. Another reason why I left."
good,"•	Provided phone and email support for customers with Apple iPhone and iTunes software. "
good,"Working at an Apple store comes with tons of benefits, the main one being the exposure to new tech and discounts on expensive products. But it was also a great opportunity to work on personal development, and the benefits were pretty good."
good,Retail is retail and it might not where you want to be but starting at Apple Retail gave me great experience and access to tools other retails jobs might not have.
good,I didn’t really enjoy the overall experience of working at Apple. The hours were untimely and usually later into the night almost morning and the pay was small for the call volume and knowledge they would like us to know.
good,The Apple ASC program is great. There are some advancement options but the portions are getting even more competitive and the company gets more popular and successful.
good,Loved working here in 2009-2012. Management that was brought in has no knowledge of the company or technology. The culture changed a lot as well as it feeling a lot more corporate but overall a great job if you can deal with the job being busy 100% of the time.
good,Great place to work with great people. They didn't pay enough and I went out for a the same role 5 times and didn't get it although I was always a top performer.
good,working for apple was a really good job i unfortunately got stuck with a manager who had been apart of the company less time then i had. they hired him from outside of the company and he was not at all knowledgable. he was unhelpful and very rude. definitely had favorites and you could see it.
good,"Great job. Easily made money. Sometimes little bit stressful, but not much. No benefits, but well paid for not to much work to do. You will meat people from all over the world. Job can get interesting and fun sometimes."
good,It was a very nice job that i couldnt even believe i got. All you had to do was answer phone calls and listen to peoples problems and go by script to fix it
good,Very good learning experience for a young undergrad but sometimes management was a absent and gave unclear goals. Overall i would recommend working here.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"They will hire you as a contractor pretty easily. Compensation is like tech industry minimum wage, enough to live on in such an expensive area, but not much else."
good,I love working for Apple and would recommend it to anyone. Awesome benefits and team of people to work with. Company really cares about their employees
good,"At my age, the pay and PART TIME position are a bit low. The thought of waiting years to become FULL TIME makes it very difficult to see a future with APPLE. The sad part is, I love the job!"
good,Fun and  dynamic work place keeps you on your toes . Process of advancement and compensation can be difficult to navigate. Training and advancement very self directed. Opportunity to connect and meet. People from all walks of life and give back to the community
good,"This is a great place to work but can be very stressful. Goals and dead lines need to be meet. "
good,"Apple is super fast paced and always seems to have some fire going on.  There was loads of travel to Asia, which, luckily, was in business class.  My direct manager was wonderful, but the upper limits were not as supportive."
good,"This was a great place to work for, I worked with mentally challenged individuals. I was responsible for three houses and nine employee. I enjoyed seeing the difference I made in there lives.The worst part was being responsible for replace your houses when someone called in..This was a great place to work for."
good,The company overall is a awesome management is not so great! working from home you're dealing with mangement via email or phone and they will not respond or take action fast until it is too late.
good,Working for Apple is cool. You get benefits even if you're a part timer. You spend most of your day talking to people so don't work there if you're not a people-person.
good,Typical day would be assisting tier 1 and customers who had problems with their devices. learned how to effectively assist customers with trouble shooting several devices through the telephone. very upbeat workplace culture. Hardest part was solving every ones issue some had no solutions.Most enjoyable part solving a tough tech problem.
good,"Mi occupavo di assistenza tecnica prodotti Apple."
good,"Great People. I learned something new everyday.  I wish they still allowed New Genii to go to Cupertino to get their certifications. If you are not used to dealing with upset customers, then this job is not for you."
good,"Good place to work with good senior management. Positiveness but less opportunity to learn more. Also, less hikes. Nothing much negative to think of ."
good,"The Apple Store was a really fun place to work. It requires you to be on your toes because the stores are always busy. Working behind the Genius Bar sure had its pros and cons, but overall- awesome place to work."
good,J'ai parcouru toute la France car je faisais les grandes surfaces
good,"I love working for Apple at its retail location at Station Park, Farmington, Utah. It's by far the most fun job I've ever had."
good,"Challenging tasks everyday."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,There is a lot of focus on creating new technology and processes. Great work culture and enjoyable colleagues. Work can get stressful during certain periods of the year but the perks are great.
good,"This job came from an opportunity given to me by APEX, a recruiting company. This year long assignment came with no benefits, and horrible hours, and a recruiter who basically just bailed on me after 2 weeks of working here... No follow ups or anything. It is what it is."
good,"Fun place to learn, not much in the way for growth or moving up as this store no longer exists and is now owned by simply mac, which i believe is a terrible place to work."
good,Maintaing database. Using excel to validate data. Meeting with application teams. Hardest part of job is getting teams to respond to emails and getting valid data from them.
good,"-Exposure/hands-on to the most recent technologies."
good,I loved my time at Apple. I broadened my horizons and worked with some of the most interesting people I've ever met. I didn't enjoy the lack of flexibility in regards to scheduling.
good,"Customer Relations position, assist Apple customers with products and services and possible purchase of new products"
good,"Working from home has its perks , like no commute. But there is a flip side,you are always in the same environment, there is a disconnection between you and your co workers, this can cause the position to be more stressful than it is to start with."
good,Excellent place but the working hours are too much and too much of work pressure. customers appreciate the work and are satisfied with the results
good,"Great coworkers, lots of education and development, supportive managers.  Easy to stay busy all the time. Great benefits."
good,"Very appreciative of the opportunity, great place of work, awesome management, great co-workers. Fun atmosphere, would recommend it."
good,"Amazing Experience and lots of fun with targets to achieve"
good,I talk to customers about their i phones and how to fix them if i can otherwise i would set them up with a appointment to have the phone repaired at a apple store
good,"Great job however too much importance is placed on upselling and add-on sales, also a seasonal position"
good,I enjoyed being employed by Apple. I worked both on-site and as a Home based agent. There were perks to both!
good,Apple is a great company to work. I feel very privilege  to work here. The management and the employee who work for Apple are very knowledgeable and willing to help you understand and grow. I Will miss working for Apple.
good,"its challenging profile when you are representing world most admired brand & frequently come across local price cutting of the product."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Apple is one of the leading handset company across the globe.
good,Apple is a very progressive company which empowers its employees to drive for new innovations and perfection in the tasks that they support.   Work/life balance is difficult for most employes to achieve.  Has a great cafeteria which supports vegans and vegetarians as well as multi-cultural requirements.
good,"November 2012 I was appointed my current position as Lead Technician. Apple Certified Support Professional (ACSP) 10.7/10.8.  August 2011-The Greenwood MacExperiece become APSP. We become the only organization with two APSP stores in our region. This was accomplished primarily by myself as previous tech’s didn't reach this service level. During this time, I was the only technician present at our location. Apple Certified Retina Display Technician. Apple Certified iPhone Technician. GSX Administrator. Proficient in API PIMS inventory and service level application.  Apple Certified Macintosh Technician (ACMT).  Apple Product Professional (APP). Sales Professional Recognition (SPR). Mac Integration Basics 10.7 (MIB). Lead Specialist."
good,"One of the most successful companies makes you feel like one of the jigsaw pieces, necessary to make a picture complete."
good,"Apple is a great place to work at, but with so many people wanting to work for Apple advancement can be difficult."
good,"Overall a great company! You work with the smartest people, who are driven and always strive to be the best!"
good,"The environment is noisy. Upper management do not enjoy their jobs. As result, they take out their stress on their employees. The hardest part of the job was overtime. By law we are suppose to get three day's of if we work 120 in two weeks. However, apple did not follow such mandates. As result some co-workers fainted, had mental breakdowns, and just walked out the the building. Felt like a sweat shop!"
good,A lot of creative minds swirling about in this flagship store.
good,Apple is the most widely recognized Tech Companies in the world. I worked in the retail environment including product launch of the iPhone iPad and Macs. Bothe the hardest and most enjoyable part of this job was the fast paced multi-task enviroment to provide world class service to our customers.
good,"However, it is still a retail job. In the end the pay is what will keep you here, until you find a career."
good,"This seemed to be a catch all position and has probably since been revamped. There is no work life balance at Apple, you work. Which is the reason I left."
good,"Excellente société pour le développement de connaissances et le partage, mais l’agence de Dijon est mal dirigee"
good,Working at Apple gave me some of the most rewarding experiences of my career. I would recommend this company to anyone interested in applying. Work from home options are popular.
good,One of the best places to work. Will teach you how to interact with different types of people. However if you don't like standing all day then i would not recommend it.
good,"Working at Apple is an opportunity of a lifetime; you need to enjoy every moment of it! "
good,"I learned so much! I new nothing about apple products when i started but i was willing to learn."
good,"It is a good place to meet really great people and they hire you based on this fact. "
good,"They start with a phone interview from someone from corporate. Then you wait two to three weeks. Then you schedule a group interview. If you get passed that then you schedule a interview with the store manager. And if they like you, then you get hired."
good,It's a tiring job but it's one you can leave at the end of each day. The people you work with are great but the management can often seem like they're doing something to do something - not because it will enrich your life or get you anywhere. Don't stay too long and don't stay in one position more than a year.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple is correctly known for it's tech innovations, but be aware that it values customer and company privacy as number 1. Whatever you see at work is confidential."
good,"I thought it was a great learning experience. I learned about Apple the company, along with its products and systems. I met new people and formed new friendships."
good,Daily duties include maintaining the various repair queues to keep up with quoted hourly turnaround times.  Ensuring that staffing levels are adequate to meet turnaround times.  Order supplies as needed.  Work directly with customers on repair outcomes and other issues.
good,"Best to be very politically on the left, very pro left everything and if you disagree or don't brown nose to management then you won't go anywhere unfortunately. Management doesn't care about you"
good,"I really loved the culture at apple. I just wish they would have given me more of a chance. I worked at the retail store, and I was very sick at the time of employment and never had enough paid time off to take the time I needed for doctors visits and sick days. The highly competitive sales-driven environment wasn't great for me either. I was stressed out ALOT. I ended up calling off to often and they fired me because I wasn't eligible for long term leave through their benefits partner as a part-timer. Totally sucks, but was beyond my manger's control. Now I think I have tainted any opportunity for hire at the call center which is even more of a shame because I currently live walking distance from. I think the call center environment would have been better for me anyway, I've always leaned more towards technical expertise than pushy sales environments. But anyway, maybe my future will look a little brighter and I'll get a second chance. The company is great as a whole, and I definitely recommend it. Just stay clear of the retail store if you can't operate under high-stress."
good,"If you like to keep busy and are able to do the same thing repetitively without slacking off on your work, you will love it. It can get competitive if you want it to be."
good,"Apple is a wonderful company to work for.    They have excellent benefits and growth if you are willing to move to advance.  They are constantly reworking how everything is run so you do not feel very repetitive, but their part-time to full-time model is askew.  You could work years at being part-time and not “be ready” for full-time. They really care about your opinion and will change policies and procedures around it"
good,Apple has create culture and cares about they're employee's. apple has great benefits and great minded and good vibes employees at apple are really what make the experience they're all worth it.
good,"This is a retail work environment, despite the technology focus. Sales goals are the most important for advancement/doing well. Opportunities for growth are plentiful if you can fight for yourself. A great place to work if you know what you're getting into."
good,"The management I had at my store was top notch, they were always available to help with any and every situation. The store is very customer service oriented, which allowed us to make special exceptions to resolve customer issues."
good,"There are tons of people to partner with that are willing to help"
good,"This seemed to be my personal experience as an at-home advisor, but it was difficult to feel a part of Apple while working so far away from Apple -- despite living/working in the same city as one of their campuses. But it was still great for me and would recommend it for anyone wanting to work on-site or remotely."
good,"It is a LOT of hours and low pay, but the experience is great. Some of the managers are pretty clueless as to Apple's history, which can be disconcerting, but overall Apple is a great place to work at least once in your life."
good,"The people I worked with were great. Its a very crazy, none stop work environment. So if you like that sort of job you will love it. Customers can be hard to deal with sometimes."
good,I loved my crew And my boss overall experience of apple dumpling deli was phenomenal. I couldn't had done a better job myself well excellent restaurant and people
good,"I liked the company it just wasn’t enough hours a week.I was fortunate enough to have a short route and the kids were manageable.The only reason that , I left was for a full time job with great benefits."
good,More like a family. Mall is stressful everything else good.  Very hard to be let good. But also hard to move up. Lots of out of work opportunities that can be fun.
good,I performed training and system assistance to my peers. I learned a lot about the inner workings of Apple and how advanced the technology can become. It was exciting knowing what was and what was to come for this powerhouse of a company.
good,"Very competitive pay for work at home company. Job was high demand and needed much attention on the work. So, although you work from home all attention must be on the workload without any distractions"
good,"Somewhat halted progress, in career development, cloudy updates. Very high pressure on numbers, even when rationale is invalid."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"i love to work on sale, but the thing is i am open minded person about time. i usually not follow time to reach at office but also not limit of working hours, i like to maintain my work quality. and customer satisfaction and relation is main part for me. i feel very good when i get huge order from corporate the bill amount in Billion."
good,"I do not have time to right a review right now, but it's a great company to work for! Maybe later I can edit this and add more but I have to run out for an appointment and indeed is requiring I do this before I close."
good,"Posto di lavoro dinamico, divertente e stimolante."
good,"The chances of moving from a temporary contract employee into a corporate permanent employee is very low. On average 6 to 7% of the contractors are converted over to permanent employees. The pursuit of being an Apple Corporate employee is a relentless one. We push ourselves and volunteer our spare time hoping to get noticed before one of the two interviewing opportunities we might get. Stressful but rewarding if you are selected. Actually quite genius from a recruitment standpoint. A pool of professionals competing for a few available positions. Not only does it drive competition, in return the employees once selected will appreciate the position"
good,"I worked through Kelly Connection for AppleCare as a tier 1 advisor and then was promoted to tier 2 as a senior advisor quite quickly. Even though I worked from home I never felt alone, like I didn't have the support I needed. I adored the fact that you could take ownership of an issue and call a customer back. Not a call center in the quiet of your own office. Loved working for them."
good,"Busy, busy, busy.  You stay busy.  I learned a lot about technology and about the importance of corporate culture.  Apple has a process for almost everything.  I still use ""Fearless Feedback"" to this day.  It was really like a big ""Apple family"".  Truly value my time spent with the company."
good,Apple is an great place to work for. I had an great time when i work for the company. It was positive some of the time and some of the people that work there were great as well.
good,"Great colleagues, positive and uplifting environment while helping customers solve problems or fulfill needs!  Amazing management and working relationships."
good,"I had a good time here, It was a good job through college.  I enjoyed the high paced atmosphere and the social aspects of working in a mall.  I would go back there if time in the day allowed it."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Apples call center and appreciated the time management took to help me grow. Although the customers made it difficult, I would recommend this place to a friend. The pros heavily outweighed the cons."
good,"As far as retail it’s foesnt get much better.  The starting rate is good, there’s growth opportunities from within, it’s a culture that’s close knit but professional and there are plenty of work perks!"
good,"Work days of gitex 2016 was fun and exciting with bunch of team mates and counters arranged in rows and with banners specifying the brands and offers.Working with a team on any kind of works makes the work enviornemnt as well as the stresses go easy and turns the burdens into simple divided easy works.The managment at the gitex place becomes friendly and easy though theres no much burdens and to go and pressures,when it be festivals."
good,"My lasting memory of working at Apple will be the incredibly smart, talented, and hardest working individuals I've ever met. The best times were when there was no typical day at work."
good,Great place to work in retail but corporate leaves some room to be desired. Lots of opportunities to eat for free and go to free events. Lots of smart colleagues and a free shuttle to work if you preferred to live in SF.
good,"Apple does a great job hiring the best people for the type of job it is. Great culture, genuine excited employees, huge opportunities to learn and grow"
good,"Great company, management is ok, overall a great culture. Very nice office environment and flexible work from home in some positions. Great product discounts."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"grat place to work and pay is excellent for someone who is in their 20's and just starting out without a mortgage or are looking for a second part time job. Culture was good, discounts were great. Retail on a holiday or launch day was always nuts. Managment on a store level was prone to mostly petty kids however who played favorites."
good,Work life balance at Apple is not really an option. When you're not at work you are expected to be on conference calls. The day is meeting heavy with little time to get work done
good,"Huge amount of diversity and level of expertise. There is something different to do every day, so it stays interesting unlike other retail jobs. When you are actually solving customer problems, the work is extremely satisfying. Benefits are good, and really good if you're full time. Management rotation doesn't happen enough and they become blind to store problems. It could be a lot worse, but it could be a bit better too. I still recommend it to anyone looking to work in retail."
good,"This place was awesome. Great co-workers, great management, tough dealing with needy customers. Sometimes work was all over the place and very unorganized, but overall a great experience."
good,"A B2B in a retail store. Lack of presence of Business Manager leads to more importance placed on retail work. Often pulled from B2B responsibilities to support retail store. Hours changed with little to no notice to support retail store. Lack of awareness of needs of B2B from management."
good,"Great place to work for a retail job. However there is a ton of info to learn and you have to deal with a lot! is definatley different then any other retail job you have had but there is so much expected from you. (mostly from the customers) With all that being said the company trains you well, pays you well and treats you well."
good,always felt supported by my leadership team and had a great deal of faith in their ability to lead. lack of resources is rarely an issue. and it is usually easy to find an answer to a question.
good,"It is great company. Amazing product, culture and people. It is fun to work there, you learn every day something new and get the opportunity to help people with their devices."
good,"Apple was an extraordinary journey and a fortuitous one. As a result of the many intense roles I held, I accumulated a tremendous amount of knowledge. The roles included Inventory Planning, Product Technical Marketing, Product Launches, Software Launches and the coveted role of being the Apple Canada PR spokesperson. The unlikely merging of these diverse responsibilities showed the faith Apple had in my skills and capabilities as their employee. I, in return, loved the experience that working for Apple provided. It remains one of my most rewarding chapters in my career."
good,Read my earlier bio. it can be stressful at times but it does teach you effective time management skills. Co-workers are great and they really do care about you which is a relief and it is incredible.
good,"Awesome company to work for. Just don't have a disability that makes you take a leave of absence, and don't have any issues with your ISP. Even though these are things you can't control, still control it if you want to keep your job."
good,The At Home Advisor position is a great opportunity for those who need a part time job. As a college student needing to work this job was a perfect opportunity for me to learn a lot about Apple products and services.
good,It's all about the people! No work/life balance. Great benefits. Awesome for early career development. Leadership cares. Company does what it says. Recommended.
good,Apple is a great company to work at. My only concern is that as of late there has been a culture change in how customers are being treated. It seems as if employees are not as dedicated to the brand as they used to be.
good,"High pace environment never a dull moment working with enthusiastic customers and knowledgeable coe-workers. I was never afraid to say ""I don't know"" and then I would follow it up with ""so let's team up with someone that does so we both learn together"" and that is something in corporate america that is nonexistent. It was a great place to work and great people to work with. The workers really do make the place the best place to work."
good,I enjoy the customer and my coworkers and some of the management but the potential for growth and advancement is limited due to retail culture.  Not a career focused environment were people would plan to stay and grow for years to come unless you completely conform and hope the right people like you but its still only going to be a $45 to $50K level job even if you worked overtime and met all expectations.  Management is very much in place to keep people inline and pump the workers up they have to real power to pay people what they are really worth.
good,"Agréable et convivial, un cadre parfait et propice au développement des salariés"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I love my peers and my job. I truly enjoy going to work everyday. "
good,"Lots of hard working, driven peers.  Work can can take over your work-life balance easily. Some of the best in class products and processes."
good,"Apple is a great company for bringing people together. We were a team of 300, and for the most part we were all into having big group events and hanging out together after work. Coming to work was a positive experience every day, and you learn a little bit about your job every day. Even at 2 years in the same job position, things change constantly and I am never bored. "
good,Fifth avenue is one of the toughest stores to work in due to the high traffic. And it being 24 hours makes it a non stop party. however the store itself is massive compared to a lot of other apple stores.
good,"Apple is a a great place to work, be mindful of the atmosphere. Drink the Kool-Aid and fit in with the culture, if you don't you will not last long."
good,"Every changing days.  The only constant is change."
good,Apple was an unbelievable company to work for.  Apple is all business but Fridaya they know how to let their hair down.  We work very hard and business is very important.
good,"I went into Google with my own filters and expectations on what the experience would be like and what I would end up doing."
good,"Problem station work is totally based on international and retail iphones and apple product based. There is a alot to learn and do like research, discussions, customer care dealing, management suggestions and retail problem issues. we have to research via Fedex and UPS tracking too. It's a pretty much busy but fun and enjoyable job."
good,Apple was a great company to work for. The only problem was the work life balance and the compensation wasn't great for the company being the largest and most profitable in the world.
good,Always good! I had a great time working at apple and would gladly do it again if it had the opportunity. Always buys but a great group of people who always looked out for you!
good,I joined apple with great hope and love for the  technology and the company. The culture is phenomenon and managerial courage is superb but there is little room for growth and advancement esp. highly educated minority unless you are in engineering section.
good,"Everyday I get a chance to enhance a customers life with one of our produces. Somedays I might spend three hours helping someone get through a difficult phone activation or fifteen minutes helping someone find just the right app to help their autistic child better communicate with them. Other times I will help customers find the right accessory for their mobile device or help them set up an AppleID."
good,"Staff are great atmosphere is great, I learn't great customer service. Handling demanding customers can be tuff but it's great when you can help them out. I covered sales and basic trouble seeking there were opportunity's to change to different roles and career experience roles which are great. Many companies try to copy the culture but just   can't get it right."
good,"As a Specialist, I help create the energy and excitement around Apple products, providing the right solutions and getting products into customers’ hands. I am dedicated to delivering a customer experience that’s unlike any other. It starts with me discovering customers’ needs. And with the support of my store team members, I match those needs with the right products. Every day is an opportunity for me to turn another Apple Store visitor into a loyal Apple customer. My success is measured by team and individual productivity as well as overall store performance. I am proud to represent Apple, and get a great deal of satisfaction from helping customers develop lifelong relationships with Apple products."
good,"Management:"
good,"Apple Inc. is a fantastic organization to work with.  A typical day includes multiple opportunities to reflect and provide feedback amongst management and peers.  Customers are truly grateful for the help they get and are always eager to learn more, which pushes you to constantly search deeper for answers to the many situations you may encounter.  The coworkers are extremely supportive of each other and constantly strive to make each other the best specialist we can be.  The most difficult part of the job is the ambiguity, and not knowing exactly what is coming next, but for obvious reasons.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the networking possibilities and sharing the collective knowledge amongst so many talented individuals all working towards a common goal."
good,"Working for Apple is never boring. You're always working towards the next big thing, regardless of where your job sits in the corporate hierarchy. The opportunities for personal development are intermittent - they're often the first thing to be removed in busy times - but those that exist are better than any other company I've heard of. The people are simply amazing. Everyone you encounter will be kind, friendly, and interested in you and your work - because the company encourages people to build strong cross-functional relationships. It's simply a culture of community-building."
good,"I worked for the company for several years under several managers, the ones that came from Apple were some of the best I ever worked with, the ones that were hired outside the company, Gap specifically, were not good at all, the focus was no longer the customer but numbers. The management is now more focused on their own execration through the company, and no longer the customer, customs focus will drive sales."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Focused on enhancing the quality of life at Legends Hall, one of UNT’s upperclassmen dormitories. Provided on-going academic support, and assisted in the administration of campus wide rules and regulations to the three hundred students living within the dormitory. Prepared and executed multiple resident events that created a venue for residents to bond and establish both professional and personal"
good,"Pretendo alcançar uma semana de testes para adquirir a aprovação na empresa e  conseguir um estagio pela minha idade e pretendo desenvolver aplicativos ou testar , também saber um pouco da rotina da empresa ser amigável e atencioso."
good,"I am a self starter with energy to overwhelm my managers. I come in ready to get to my customers and complete their needs in a prompt, professional way and never leave until the job in done to there satisfaction. "
good,"I typically spent most days either taking appointments at the Genius Bar for mobile device repairs or assisting customers with purchases."
good,"- Provided a welcoming environment for customers."
good,Great company great people but run in a poor fashion depending on store management.
good,"Apple is a great company to work they offer awesome benefits they have great salaries once you become signed on with the company "
good,"If you love the fast pace environment, helping customer come into the world of technology and get excited with the customers as they learn how Apple products will enrich their lives, then this would be a great company to work for."
good,"Dynamic, fast-paced environment where expectations are high and where only those who can skillfully self-manage and prioritize their time survive."
good,Having great experience working with Apple. Lots to learn on a daily basis.
good,Very good learning experience with a lot of experienced web developers around.
good,Apple has so many positive aspects to it's benefit. I would say this
good,I worked their for four years i had some great experiences and enjoyed everyone i worked with! i think some of the management can be crazy which creates a lot of drama!
good,"Apple is a fun, fast-paced environment and has great benefits, but advancement is difficult unless you have the know with people who can help you advance."
good,"Responsibilities included but were not limited to: Inventory control, auditing of inventory by both hand count and use of electronic scan and count devices. Filling of part orders by communicating with the company warehouse and various venders. Instrumental in the launch of new product. Initiating more effective loss prevention and security measures."
good,"Apple in Education was always a hard nut to crack, since this is not the area where Apple predominated. IBM clones available at far lower prices always made it a hard-sell, even though Apple computers were always far easier to operate for teachers and students."
good,I loved my job for 18 years then a new manager changed my well-being. I still think it is a great place to work for and would go back if it was a new manager.
good,"I liked the feedback culture, if you get stuck your team members would help you out. At the end of the day its still retail, so not the best hours. I also liked the one store mentality, people really cared about putting the best work forward. Some difficult customers, but most people you interact with really enjoy apples products. Highly recommend working for apple."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"It's relaxed and chill, the customers don't know anything so make sure you have patience to deal with really dumb customers but other than that its all good plus the pay is nice and above minimum wage"
good,"Fantastic experience, if you can, give it a go. A very different organisation to work for. Recruitment and hiring can take some time. It's a very different hiring process compared to most corporates!"
good,"Excellent benefits"
good,"This is definitely not a career. Unless you are seeking upper management and have the means to stick it out for at least 5-10 years before seeing management, I would definitely just keep this job for the experience. The way they train you to handle customer interactions is amazing. I have learned so much from this company about both technology and just how to treat and talk to people."
good,"Operations/ Support Leader"
good,"Working for Apple was in a lot of ways a departure from the other jobs I had previously to working for Apple.  The biggest difference was working for a company that you truly believed in.  It was challenging, informative, exciting and enriching.  I got to work with and meet some of the most interesting, intelligent and diverse group of people that I’ve ever had the chance to meet.  Would highly recommend"
good,"I don't have much to say about working with Apple through GC Services. The company had a strange atmosphere, and the employees didn't seem very happy when coming into work."
good,"As a contractor this is a bitter sweet position.You work for the greatest company in the world but your pay not reflecting that can be a bummer. Company hires internally as well as externally. Great opportunity to learn new skills, great bosses, great team members. Even greater if you are FT."
good,"Apple is a great place to work, but it is a grind. Just be prepared to work long nights, calls at off hours, going IN to the office on weekends during product launch (not just working remotely)"
good,"Apple has a great and supportive internal culture. I learned a lot and grew exponentially as a result through the extensive experience exercised there. Management is so/so, and getting promoted is most probably not based on much except favoritism. Although it feels like one big family, I did feel invisible despite daily meetings, extensive feedback shared on all levels to and from.  A melting pot indeed as far as peer, which can get difficult but fun nonetheless. If you are looking for a good home base to find yourself on a professional level, Apple is a great door to open if you get the opportunity to."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for, especially for students and young adults. Almost all jobs are part time though and getting promoted to full time is nearly impossible. Benefits, co-workers, work environment, and pay are amazing. Would recommend for someone with little to no work experience and or college students."
good,"Great company with a strong ethical stance. Very secretive, protective of new products. Contractors have limited access, but they get respect. Wish I could be perm there."
good,Working for Apple was a wonderful experience. The management was fair and knew how to motivate workers. The benefits were very balanced. Training programs were very well organized and thorough.
good,It is almost a cult.  Go in do your job leave.  There are opportunities to network but it definitely depends on your department and limitations.  The culture is like any other corporation.  You just have know someone that knows someone in order to get to the top.  If you're shy uyou will not survive the sharks.
good,"First thing in the morning after you've put the till in the register you stocked the shelves with whatever needed stocked. Then you sweep the floors and await the first customer. There was plenty to do while not interacting with customers, but being able to use the in-store computers and iPads came in handy often. As a student it was being able to do homework on the side which made it a great job for a college student."
good,Good place to work and great fitness facility. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the executive. Benefits are great and flexible time off.
good,"Perfect, enjoyable, exciting working environment, great employee wellness, highly efficient, compensation is competitive, access to learn or involvement to high technology and uniquely internal operational tools developed by APPLE."
good,"What a great place to work. Everyone was always friendly and very laid back. I wish I didn't have to leave when I did. The work I performed could be very stressful, because at the time, there was not enough people performing support for the sales staff. But the extremely busy periods were very short lived, and followed by long stretches of slowness."
good,"Working at Apple means more than a job, but embracing a philosophy that taps into the mythology and stories history of the company. You'll be asked to go above and beyond because the the ultimate end result of the work you do is to enrich the lives of Apple's customers. For me, the best part of my experience at Apple was the feeling that you are part of something greater than yourself, and as Steve Jobs once put it, you were able to put your little dent in the universe."
good,"Your responsibilities are very crucial in the quality of the product.  You have to be passionate and highly skilled to perform.  Overall I will recommend this company to anyone who believes in a dedicated, team-work environment."
good,"This was a great opportunity to work for such an established business. The open inclusiveness and peer reviews were amazing. Apple provides successful tools to improve life and culture geared towards their business. There are a multitude of positions with-in the retail environment, that anyone can transition to any new opportunity. This includes international retail support, corporate internships, and educational funding. Apple is an experience either working there or as a customer."
good,"Bonne entreprise, belle expérience. Certains collaborateurs ne mesurent pas le confort qu’ils ont..."
good,"I learned an immense amount about being an adult with a ""real"" job during my six years at Apple.  The culture was incredible, the opportunities to learn every aspect of the retail business were readily available, and the benefits are unparalleled (even for part-time workers) in the retail world.  Depending on the store leader, it was fairly easy to have a schedule that worked around your life despite the business requirements of covering 12-14 operating hours, seven days per week."
good,"Great company to work for, I did for 6 years.  Great benefits, product discounts, tuition grants, new father maternity leave, stock grants, stock discounts... just a really good company overall."
good,Retail hours can be hard on the body and mind but it works for some and doesn't for others! Learned a lot of competencies to help with dealing with conflict and positioning skills. Culture is positive and fun. Hardest part of the job is the negative attitude customers will came at you with even though its not personal.
good,I feel that Apple nails it when it comes to launch days with on site food and  accommodations for employees and rest areas to recoup and preparing us for long days
good,"Great Experience overall."
good,"When I was with Apple, it was as a Mac Genius in one of their retail stores; inarguably, this is very different from working at Apple Corporate in Cupertino. Nonetheless, the company always strove to make you feel like a part of the greater whole. It was always fun to be on the cutting edge and a part of a company that was truly innovating. At the same time, the retail environment simply isn't for everyone, and it wasn't for me - I was happy to move on when the time came."
good,"I loved working for Apple and would still be working for them if it was not for the schedule that I was up against being an owner of a marketing company. Now that I am seeking new employment opportunities I would welcome working for such a great company."
good,Great opportunity to advance your skills. A lot of pros for the environment working from home. Very nice place to grow and lean more about yourself and your strengths.
good,Always a great fast paced environment. A lot always got done. Management  is always there to support you. All employees are helpful and give valuable information.
good,"Enjoyed working among friends and family that you start to make while working there. "
good,"While I'm sure that many people's experience will differ from mine, I had a very positive experience. I transition out of academic life and found the atmosphere to be as personally engaging as teaching. And there was always the challenge to grow professionally. Many of the development, training, and organizational skills I learned as a Specialist and then as an Expert have served me well to this very day."
good,"Since leaving Apple and working for other companies, I can honestly say Apple has it all together. They have strong leadership making good decisions. They also have enough staff to cover all duties."
good,"Job culture is fantastic! Training also amongst the best I have ever experienced. The issues for me were with lower management and access to support outside of your immediate peers. Very stressful job for the amount of money available. Working from home was a nice change, but the novelty quickly wears off."
good,"Fast paced job, hours are very low if part time. Hard to become full time. Managers are cool  just likes to sugar coat things. A lot of gossip and tension."
good,"Si on oublie le côté salaire et les facilités d'évolutions, Apple est la meilleurs société dans laquelle j'ai pu travailler jusqu'à aujourd'hui"
good,"...its retail at the end of the day."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"It was a productive and learning workplace. Also, a wonderful opportunity to be part of a great team. The hardest part of the job was the probation period in which there was no sick leave or even unpaid leave. The most enjoyable part of the job was the changing assignment which provided me the opportunity to learn new things."
good,"You make your own schedule around your school schedule. You work from home and can make $15+. I loved it. The medical insurance is great. I was out for appendicitis not only was I compensated with my short term disability, my insurance paid for the surgery as well."
good,"A wonderful company with excellent benefits for part-timers. I worked at Apple for 2+ years on the retail end and loved it. It was a wonderful environment with an eclectic mix of talented people."
good,"A typical day for me was helping customers with their technical difficulties over the phone."
good,"Apple was a great company to work with. the pay could be hire, but it was through a temp agency so i understand. i would of really liked to work for the company straight through with no temp involved"
good,"By far one of the best retail jobs around. You get the same benefits as Apple Corporate, and have some opportunity to advance to a corporate position."
good,"Don’t waste your time if you are working for apple through a third party. The work ethics of the company are the same but the benefits are not. Direct hires receive health care as well as stock and retirement options, PTO and other benefits. The pay also is much better. If you can, keep applying for Apple until you can’t apply any more."
good,"i was appointed as a trainer through a consultancy called V5 Global and then also had to focus on sales of the products."
good,"Apple is one of the few prestigious places to work whether it is corporate or retail. "
good,"is Netherlands based company is a leading provider of location, routing, mapping and address management technologies and intelligence which power enterprise applications world-wide. AND data sets are widely used by corporations in many industries to increase the functionality and reach of their customer relationship management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Supply chain Management and Logistics activities"
good,"Tier 1 work hours can be grueling when working At-Home, but rewarding when you know you have helped someone.  I had the pleasure to help many who's only source of communication with deployed loved ones were their Apple devices."
good,"Very balanced workday and looked forward to showing up to work everyday. There was always teamwork from the time you walk in the door. If you do not know something ask, and if you want to grow find and seek others on how to get there."
good,"At Apple, you will spend a lot of time working 50+ hours but you know you are working a good product for people who want to it. Quality is important as well as features which are nice but do not expect free food or lots of parties."
good,Apple was a great stepping stone in my IT career. They taught me how to troubleshoot apple systems and gave me more experience working with customers. A typical day was getting up and getting on my computer and having a meeting with my coach. Then id take calls for however long my shift was for then log off.
good,Fun and loving place to work just be you because they have people from all kinds of backgrounds from which they pull all of your experiences and just love of the product
good,"Great job , big focus on peer relations , not everyone is your friend so you Have to fake your way through things , great company tho. I’m sure each store is different. I would recommend anyone to work here. Just focus on what you have to get done and don’t get tied up in the politics."
good,Apple hires so many creative people! You don’t need to know about technology to be considered a position in apple retail. The retail locations look for people that have integrity and are passionate.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Good company with an awesome work environment. Excellent customer Service and excellent team.
good,8 years flew by. I was getting too comfortable and had to grow. I miss the Steve Jobs days and they hired many people very fast that don't fully know the culture. Still awesome. Once you leave you will miss how much Apple spoiled you. Politics definitely gets in the way of every workplace and you will have those managers that will drive you crazy. Overall...life changing for the better and very inclusive and your voice matters.
good,"I enjoyed my time at apple started as a contractor and enjoyed my  10 years. I was given the oppertunity to grow and be pushed to develop news skills and knowledge."
good,"-Relaxed and fun working environment"
good,Most of the time you're on the phone facing customers and have to help them with whatever issue they are having. You're in customer service so you often have to deal with bad attitudes and a strict policy of conduct with little room for failure.
good,I recommend working for Apple. The education division is a good place to start. I felt like I was making a difference for students in K12 and HiEd. Products are second to none.
good,Apple taught me about what is was like to be apart of a team and work for a company that strived for results. It taught me the power of feedback and how to be better about receiving that.
good,"The company is exceptional and organized, It take pride in their employees and also in the benefit of the Company. I have nothing to say bad about the company beside the time off and the point for attendance."
good,"Place and people are great to work with, there is lot of things you can learn from the people and company itself. A typical day at work is doing overtime work for us to deliver great services to the clients"
good,"Great place to work with a lot of great people but at the end of the day, it's retail. I enjoyed working there a lot but I have a full time job and my work/life balance became difficult to maintain"
good,Pay and benefits are great. Work with great people. You learn a lot from peers and customers. Terrific place to work if you have side hobbies related to the arts.
good,"Apple is a company that provides you with every benefit under the sun and you don't actually realize that until you leave to ""advance your career"". Its a great company to work for and looks great on the resume."
good,The Store will become like another family.  Learned a great deal about technology and had a great time mentoring others in the importance of being genuine with customers.  The key is treating people like people and not dollars.  One of the  wonderful things about working there was resolving issues  and making friends with people who came in. The benefits were phenomenal.
good,"Apple lives up to their mission statements and commitment to their consumers. They really care about their employees and benefits alone could keep people around for a long time. Because of low turn-over in corporate positions, competition is extremely tough in many situations and advancement opportunities are not readily available."
good,Nice benefits. Food environment. Loved the products and customer service. I loved working for apple. I would recommend this to anyone as a great opportunity
good,It was a good job but it still was retail. After awhile I got jaded because of it. It can be a great job for some but there are always flaws with any company
good,"Cool people, cool gadgets, cool culture. I am glad I made the choice to work at apple. The people really make it what it is. Learned a lot ad this job has opened more opportunities."
good,"Good place to work, great benefits and discounts. The work culture is pretty good but the pay is okay. They do have stock options which is a great added benefit."
good,"A typical day at work was usually easy-going if you can ignore the workplace drama that goes on between the older vets in the store. I learned so much more than I can put it words from working at Apple and I do plan to continue to work on specific core competencies. Management, I will say, was not the greatest (maybe at this specific location) due to favoritism being played. Workplace culture at Apple was unbeatable. The hardest part of the job was being able to do exactly what it was that your connection leader wanted; however, the most enjoyable part of the job was the socially expressive freedom. The fact that it was the type of environment where you could really be yourself undeniably and still push the culture which was instilling knowledge and intuition into our customers."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"The culture of the company is great, but if you're working at the retail level, each store culture is different. Newer stores tend to have a much better sense of culture than more established, older stores."
good,"My time there was productive and I had a lot of self growth. The route to move positions is limited, though. While I appreciated the compensation and health insurance benefits, getting time for training at another store or another city was difficult to obtain."
good,"Fast paced, low stress. Not much opportunity for advancement. Most managers were competent. Great teamwork amongst colleagues. Most customers were Apple fans and easy to work with, but it's retail, and you will encounter customers with major attitudes who will vent their life frustrations out on you."
good,I greatly learned in supply chain management fields from Apple. Speed and details are the 2 important areas I felt much at Apple. Very challenging environment.
good,"Job was good. Manager and co-workers were friendly. Job was fast paced. The more I picked apples, the more money I would make money. It was seasonal and it ended when the season ended."
good,"I really enjoyed my time there, all the suppervisors are really kind and supportive. paid trainning lasts for about 2 weeks, good call center to start at."
good,"molto positivo, si impara ogni giorno. Il contatto con i clienti è molto edificante."
good,"I can't say anything negative about Apple. It's a great place to have a career if you are interested in technology and problem solving. They give great benefits and healthcare to each employee, full time and part time. Tuition reimbursement was a great addition as well. Apple takes care of its employees, but the only negative thing is career advancement is a slow and long process, and can eventually never come."
good,"Let me start with saying that I don't believe that I am not a proper judge of character in this matter. The job itself overall was a bad fit for my personality type. I find that I like to be more active in movement. As well as, face to face interactions. However, Apple as a company was awesome to work for. I did learn a lot and felt it allowed me to grow professionally."
good,"PRO"
good,"meetings process orders check inventory interface with Suppliers and Vendors meet with Engineering specification review"
good,Very willing to work with workers of all stripes and making sure the work environment is comfortable for all. Has extensive programs and positions to meet almost any need.
good,"Needed to have the rules for helping a bit more relaxed. You can have outstanding survey scores, but good customer service and handle time need to be more lenient."
good,I am in a great team with lots of action. Manager is amazing - very involved with the team effort yet not a micro manager. Give a lot of opportunity to think out of the box.
good,"You definitely learn and grow from this job. It's an at home service which makes it much more convenient. A typical day would be get up in the morning, make coffee, get on computers and start answering calls from Apple customers all around the world."
good,"even though the company itself provides the resources to succeed at your job, management sucks at theirs. they expect you to always be working on something, project etc.. advancement opportunity will turn into pleasing someone  to get somewhere or you will be stuck at current role forever"
good,"This job was good for some young professionals, good pay and relaxed work environment. "
good,"The company is fantastic in terms of what it has achieved. However, in my particular team there was no room for development. It always felt as if the company felt it was a bit too big for its boots and relied heavily on reputation to get its own way. There was not as much room to put your own stamp on things, and the company is so strict with managing its reputation"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Working as a Technical Advisor, could have easily been my favorite job that I've worked. My particular employment ended abruptly, but the experience was wonderful. Every few weeks we were taught new things about the job to make it easier to relay to the public. There were articles about any and everything that the customers experienced. Though, at times there were difficult task. There were no verbal scripts, unless someone absolutely did not want to deal with Apple anymore; Which was not often. Customers can be difficult at times but what CSR position didn't. Honestly, If was hired to work from home again then I would in a heartbeat"
good,"残業は本当になし"
good,You learn a lot of skills that are transferrable to other fields. Great coworkers. Very good to have Apple on your resume when applying for jobs in the future- a very respected company.
good,Apple is an awesome company to work for! I love working here. I've had a lot of fun working from home and meeting new people. Like everywhere it has its ups and downs.
good,"this is a fun company to work for. even in retail. "
good,"Great company, with amazing products;"
good,Love fun environment and diverse culture working with very talented people. Have a great retention rate in our teams. The best team ever!
good,I am just their campus rep. Apple is very generous to our students. But their management team isn't as creative as I expected. Maybe because the company is too large to do anything risky.
good,"Part of the technical team was very busy, and draining but enjoyable, challenging customers, in fact at times very rude customers but management would always support you. No progression as everyone thinks they are management material. Great work culture and management teams, very motivating, but you would expect better pay for what the store staff achieve for Apple."
good,very good to work with apple inc and i have a good experience with this company and i learned a lot from this company thanks for the management.
good,An incredible and supportive team with a breathable working environment. Supportive of all staff and their diversities and personalities. A team of leaders who put the needs of their people first before anyone else. A place where feedback is appreciated and accepted.
good,"Apple make it there mission to offer happiness to both employees and customers alike. There mission is to blur the lines between the arts and technology, create the most innovative machines and offer the highest levels of protection."
good,Lavoro fantastico per chi è veramente appassionato dei prodotti del marchio
good,Typical day of my work is to schedule multiple interview while also monitoring day to day schedules (up to 4 - 5 a day). I also send out offer letters and on-board new candidates. I learned how to juggle all these things at once and how to handle work/life balance. Working at Apple as taught me how to use Mac software as well. Management is great! They always made sure to communicate and never point a finger. Just get the problem fixed if it ever raised. My workers are really dependable. Everyone wanted to help and so did I. Hardest part of my could be the last min updates to interview schedules but that was usually day to day so it did not become a problem. The most enjoyable part if when I get to on-board new candidates that I scheduled. It can be so rewarding to know that all your hard work was a life changing to someone.
good,"Apple is a great company to work for, even as a contract employee.  The facilities, equipment, food, teams, activities, co-workers were all wonderful.  I learned a lot while working here."
good,"Apple is a fantastic company to work for, and the employee benefits awarded by the company are far better than any other retail employer around. Great management team."
good,"A typical day at Apple is fast paced organized chaos. Hour to hour you, are immersed in an upbeat and moving environment that demands quick technical and learning on the fly skills for solving problems and resolving conflict. It is a wonderful place for developing outstanding customer service and communication skills while developing your own career path."
good,"I spent most of my time driving on the streets to repair or install computers. My typical day would start reviewing the work orders, calling customers, providing technical support, and ordering parts and generating a scheduled visit if needed. Co-workers were fun, management was very professional and supportive. Continuing education was abundant, and we were encouraged to take them for advancement."
good,"I had a good feeling about being part of the apple family, when my managers made me feel comfortable and being understanding. being excited to come to work everyday is a pleasure."
good,"Excellent team, great exposure, keeps you on your toes all the time."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,I love Apple. Would simply love to get paid more. The culture at Apple is very supportive. Their Retail Operations continue to try new and creative ways to provide customer all the benefits of owning Apple products and using Apple services.
good,"Great place to work and you gain new skills everyday. You find that while working at apple your ability to learn on the fly, deal with ambiguity, and problem solving skills are constantly being used and making you a better employee."

good,Great environment to hone people skills; work as a team and share in the successes of other team members.
good,"Apple's greatest asset is their customers. This is reflected in everything they do be it products, services, or experience. Obsessing over the customer experience lends to the extreme success of the company. To be a part of something so grand can be overwhelming however always rewarding!"
good,Apple is a great company to work for. You're able to witness the latest developments in IT and it is a fun place to work.
good,"Normally, I come in and speak to few co workers, then i set down to log into my computer. I check my email for related Apple information needed to know to better assist customers. I log into my system and go into available. I take calls for Apple customers who need troubleshooting their devices, may have general questions, set up repair/replacement services if needed, and schedule appointments for customers to go to Apple Retail Stores located near their location."
good,"Le salaire n'est pas très motivant, mais c'est un réel plaisir d'avoir pu rejoindre une grande entreprise comme celle-ci"
good,"For a part-time job, I was able to sustain myself while going to graduate school full-time, living comfortably in the city."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for depending on the specific department. Typical work days in my department are high-stress, high demands while working in office. Stress is reduced when working from home due to a more comfortable, personal environment. I've learned an extensive amount of administrative work, including the understanding of handling all types of customers on a case-by-case basis. The management within the company differs but can be challenging and/or difficult to develop a healthy employee-manager relationship. Managers within my department often lack good communication and experience. They often take action to assist their favorites with advancement opportunities over employees with knowledge and experience. Managers also often lack in taking action against employee complaints related to system issues or other employee toxic relationships. Their micro-managing skills often conflict with employee and company needs."
good,Excellente entreprise où l'on apprend beaucoup sur les autres et sur soi.
good,"A typical day at work was start training new and existing employees for the department I was working for."
good,"I loved working for Apple because I love the products and services I could offer a customer. "

good,"Just line up as a group and work on computer as long as computer are tested and label. I learn to cooperate the rules because it deal with Apple computer and Ipod. My co-worker and I work together and we eat lunch same time, we get along just fine. I don't think I have the hardest part of the job here because is easy process. Its was interesting assembly I learn to work with."
good,"Apple is amazing. Great culture, great benefits, sometimes great customers, but overall a great experience. The benefits may the okay pay worth it. There's even tuition reimbursement. It's great. But it's so many amazing people that everyone is super qualified for each job position. Oh well. If you're going to have a problem it better be that one."
good,"I have work with all country people with different working system . "
good,"Great place to develop yourself, i recommended everyone to work here"
good,"As a Store Manager, directly supervise staff of 80+ employees. Managing Sales department, Human Resource Dept, Technical Service Area and Operations. I have had the opportunity to lead in an environment that matches my personal and professional values. At work and at home I value the same things...trust, integrity, respect, pursuit of excellence, and relationships. My goal is to stay connected to the people that have been influential in my personal and professional development over the years. "

I like the management team I just with they were a little more engaged in their employees work. I love my co-workers because Apple looks for personality and we all work well together. the hardest part of the job is trying is the fast work pace because we really care about our customers and want the best for them and it could get exhausting at times. The best part of the job is the people you work with, everyone is so nice and I have made a lot of new friends."
good,"support staff to sales organization. Very high paced. Managed comprehensive schedules for the entire department of over 200 people. Co-workers very helpful and friendly. Learned the apple way; relaxed with their attire, but hard working to the end.

Running confidential reports and tracking them was challenging but enjoyable."

It is extremely important to build relationships with customers as well as work hard to meet the business goals as well.

good,"At the time I wish I was able to give my full attention to working at Apple, but I was working full-time Monday-Friday in addition to working at Apple Thursday evenings through Sunday, so I really didn't know if I was coming or going. Management was really cool, some weird but overall amazing and really encouraging."
good,Very balanced work / life company. very fast paced and dynamic environment. Always meeting new people and getting the opportunities to change lives with technology.
good,Great place to work in terms of learning and being stretched. It's fast paced in one sense but also very relaxed. They are in a bit of a bubble and the culture is very very strong. It's definitely about finding the right fit for both them and you. It may not work for everyone.
good,"Amazing place to work, if you drink the kool-aid you will enjoy it more. They work hard and they work a lot. Expectations are high, but the salaries are high as well. I would often work 10-12 hours a day and I traveled to Asia multiple time. The time away was tough, but it was a pretty cool experience."
good,"I actually miss working for apple but after 4 years at the retail level I would only be able to work for apple corporate."
good,"Great management, flexible hours and good benefits. "
good,Above everything else Apple really gave me a chance to learn new skills and grow skills that I already had. The team at my store made coming to work fun and engaging.
good,you have to be one of the best to move up after you hit a certain point. Promotions only come once in a blue moon. you answer between 20-40 calls a day. Management is great at times.

good,"Absolutely loved working at apple. I was told I was rehire-able in January, have been reapplying since and haven't heard back since. I'd definitely go back in HEARTBEAT I got the opportunity to meet many people from all over the world and got to learn so much from them as well, everyday was a new experience. I went through a miscarriage that left me in depression when I worked there and I can honestly say being there was so helpful to me, I would forget about my pain when I was there with customers and coworkers."

good,"Apple was a great company to work for. While the work was challenging, the company culture supports team work and positive attitude. I would recommend working at Apple to a friend."
good,"If apple was a Monday through Friday job, it’d be amazing. Positive culture, positive atmosphere, teaches you about yourself and how to interact with other human beings. Would definitely recommend."
good,"They gave me extensive training (two weeks) before they out me on the floor.   I greeted customers, helped them find what they were looking for and rung them up on our handheld devises.   I would have stayed there forever if I hadn’t gotten sick.  After two months in the hospital they sadly let me go.    I loved working with the products and helping the customers.   Hardest part for me was learning the tech stuff."
good,Excellent benefits and career opportunities. Friendly and fun place to work. Must be ok with retail hours and working weekends. Program in place to help you succeed

good,I enjoyed working on the work at home team I was selected to be a part of.  The team that I was a part of was excited about work and also very supportive when assistance was needed
good,"This is lame I really do not feel like doing this at all, it was retail, fast-paced, but all around still retail. Your experience is completely contingent on your store, your store leader, and your connection leader. Those will make or break your work experience"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,I was enjoying the work environment and the friendly atmosphere. Very light coworkers and great flexibility. Recommending the job is Moore than just a consideration!
good,Never worked with more passionate individuals. Apple continues to create opportunities internally for cross team cooperation. Pleasure to be a member on a high performing team who have been there a long time producing great work.
good,Working in starbucks for many years and bringing that experience to apple made it successful. but it been a real different experience when i recieved a review like I have never expected. as my starbucks attitude brought me down to be more heart felt reviews ive never expected. I was guarded and prepared but instead i was brought down in tears. it can be stressful but apple does it great job to look after.
good,"Apple was great, just couldn't work for my life. I am a married man and I had a young son when employed. Scheduling was very inconsistent due to the college age employees. If the scheduling could have been more beneficial for me I would have never left. Pay was very good for a mall location, I started above minimum due to experience."
good,Wonderful company to work for. Can be taxing on your personal and mental state. Fast  paced and very rewarding. Great pay and a great culture to be apart of.
good,"I can't disclose many things. But overall, it is good environment with great coworkers. But there are still hierarchical atmosphere since it is a big company."
good,"I was an At Home Advisor. Able to work from home, shift changes occurred every 3-6 months, but hours/shifts could be traded if you did not get something that worked for you."
good,It was a wonderful retail job. They give you a lot of benefits as a part time worker. The hardest part is working with a lot of customers and it get hectic sometimes.
good,it was a great job the management was a bit off most of the time and played favorites. Great place to meet and network with other like minded people. I would recommend
good,"very little advancement is available depending on the store. The company as a whole does not care about its employees that much. That being said, it is the best part time retail job you could get. Doing it as a career will burn you out, as only the favorites advance."
good,"A very fun place to work. Corporate is very hard to get into. Retail level is very competitive. Always have to be on your A-Game because everyone is competing to be at Apple. Amazing benefits!!! People are high energized. Constantly busy, but it makes the time go fast."
good,Fun and exciting to work at Apple. Very fast paced environment great  technology to showcase. Absolutely amazing teams inside of Apple and most people care about your development and show it.
good,"The role of a specialist, though in reality mosting sales oriented, was really a consultative sales position. Since so many Windows based end-users were making the sometimes stressful decision to migrate to a macOS based platform, it became very important to put there minds at ease, even with something as simple as showing them how to activate a ""right mouse"" click."
good,"All of Apple is not ""Apple Proper"". A data center in Maiden, NC is not the same as working in Cupertino. It is different. The culture of Apple depends on where the DC is located."
good,"Very good place to learn customer service skills, work life balance was important to the company. High volume traffic, spoke other languages more than English daily."
good,"Love this company and how they build their culture and people. Great to work for."
good,Great environment. Management seems to treat the employees well. Payrate was acceptable for entrylevel. The training could have been better to be honest but overall it was quite a thrill working for Apple.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Wonderful experience as a temporary contract position at my tenure at Apple. Training was incredibly informative and interactive. The correct tools were provided to help provide an environment that always thinks about the customer first. Constant guidance and assurance was always present to always promote personal and professional growth. Employee/Peer recognition was always there to help build motivation and morale.
good,I was a seasonal worker here this past Christmas. I had to learn alot quickly and what I didn't know that I didn't know wasn't taught to me much other than when it was in my face. I felt that I did a good job but yet they chose someone more qualified.
good,"Apple Retail is a collaborative work environment that offers continous in-store training for all employees in all positions. "
good,"Apple is a very fast moving environment to work at but also very supportive and great at training. Most everyone is polite and caring. The managers are amazing, friendly and supportive as well."
good,Apple has large amounts of capital that enable engineers to work very hard without the burden of budget stressors - this atmosphere enables employees to be creative and do their best work.
good,"We will get flexible timing to do the job and the collegues and manager are very friendly, so that itself we will get self motivated to the job and we can achieve the sales targets."
good,"Working at apple was better than any retail position i've ever been in. The people, the customers, the stores, they're all apart of what makes Apple amazing. I feel like as long as youre early and on time for your shifts and you're good with people this could definitely be the start of a great career opportunity for anyone looking to be dedicated to providing exceptional customer service."
good,Would definitely recommended to someone. Exciting place to work at. Great atmosphere as far a retail goes. Work life balance is definitely a plus when it comes to a job which they definitely promote.
good,"Apple Retail is one of the most difficult jobs I have ever worked. But it is an amazing experience that I wouldn't trade for the world. The store was very busy and required a-lot of hard work to maintain. I was rewarded and praised for my hard work, but after 4 years I realized that I needed to move on and see other opportunities. I wanted to get into Enterprise IT."
good,"They really take care of their employees. I wish instead of the bells and whistles (10+ new uniforms a year, food-provided-events, etc) they just put that money in your pocket but it is the give and take of a large corporation. Overall happy with the time I spent at Apple."
good,Working for Apple was an amazing experience. Management was amazing and the culture was pretty relaxed. Hours vary as in most retail positions. Training is on point and is offered abundantly.
good,"Overall it’s a great company to work for. The only issue is that everyone wants to work here, so the company really isn’t worried about retaining you. They know 1000 people will apply to your spot if you leave"
good,"Pros: Good pay, good benefits, good culture and atmosphere. Great place to work if you're passionate about technology or the arts. Great place to work if you're not passionate about those things and just want to pay your bills. My store was the busiest ones in the world(no exaggeration), as a result, management tried to create an atmosphere that makes you feel appreciated."
good,Apple is a great place to work and the culture was outgoing. What I learned was to use your resources and listen closely to what a customer needs. The relationships and experience were amazing to be a part of.
good,"No complaints, best retail place to work! Often supplied lunches and breakfasts. Very collaborative place, often high paced, a lot of opportunity to grow for full timers"
good,"I wish to not comment directly about my experience at Apple. It was all positive, I learned a great deal and it helped to position me for future opportunities."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Nice working condition and environment."
good,"Assist customers and come up with viable solutions to their issues whether software or hardware related. Learned the core Apple values to provide the best Apple experience, learned how to communicate and be empathetic with various types of customers, and learn how to communicate and support your teammates and the overall team. The management does tend to micromanage at times, which plays as an obstacle for the overall Apple experience for the customers that we serve. The workplace culture is quite welcoming as the team welcomes everyone with open arms and an open mind. The hardest part of the job is when a viable solution can not be determined or the customer, or when a customer does not agree with the solutions that are provided for them with their best interests. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding the perfect solution(s) for the customer and having them not only look at you as their technician, but as a trustworthy friend, and they leave with a huge smile on their face."
good,Apple has a fast-paced but rewarding and supportive work environment. I enjoyed working there and being able to assist customers with their technological problems.
good,"I learned so much about the product, and the staff are some of the best people I ever met. The discount was amazing, and I met interesting customers there daily."
good,I enjoyed working for apple support through a third party company. I was any to get unlimited over time where i worked about 20 extra hours overtime. I was then laid off due to apple not needing much people to work. I felt as if i was laid off due to taking so many hours in over time each week.
good,"I LOVE Apple as a company. You will not find a better company to work for. The benefits are amazing, hands down. FMLA, paid vacation and sick time, discounts on Apple and non-Apple products, reimbursement for internet and gym memberships and college education, the list goes on and on. "
good,"The job was amazing, the culture and the staff were all so supportive and had unique talents. It is more than a shop. The customer service skills you gain are like no other too."
good,"Apple the company is AWESOME.  The company is great as long as you are an actual employee.  If you are a contractor then there is a noticeable difference in how you’re treated.  Apple is one of the few companies that will hire you for contract, but won’t convert you to a full fledge Apple Employees ."
good,"By far, the best job I've had. Contact jobs at Apple are less than ideal because it will end. My manager was very ""hands off"". We hardly saw him. If you are a contractor, part of your day should be looking for a full time position with the company. If you want to stay."
good,"Working with Apple has changed me as a person all around for the best. If you ever get a chance to work there, you will not regret  it. They are careful to place you exactly where you fit in and no matter what make you feel supported in business and life choices. "
good,"- Very good company to work for"
good,Apple was a fun work place filled with equal minded individuals who pushed for success. Everyone was interactive and the work was stress free. I appreciate the relationships I've built.
good,I enjoyed what I did here and learned so much as my first real Administrative Assistant position.  The environment was fun and collaborative.  Events were planned with the other Admin and he taught me a lot of what I know today.  Management was encouraging and always fair.
good,"Great place to work. travel. The work was always stimulating. Working with teachers all over the world was amazing too."
good,"Apple was an incredible company to work for. My only complaint (and it's minimal) was my shift starting at 3 AM. This could have been changed with time but with a newborn son, I was unable to accommodate these hours."
good,Excelente ámbito laboral sin embargo conforme va transcurriendo el tiempo necesitamos más oportunidades en las cuales macstore ya no es posible cumplir
good,"One of the best companies I have worked for. A open culture of togetherness. You were never out of the loop, when it came to learning new things. Which made it great to grow as a person."
good,It was a great experience working at apple . Easy going management and great work life balance. Reccommend this company to anyone who is willing to do fun and easy job.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"En general mi valoración es muy buena. hoy en día cuesta encontrar trabajos que te ofrezcan estabilidad, buen sueldo y conciliación con tu vida personal"
good,Fast working place. Very Tech oriented. Learned how to take care of customers and learned how to go above and beyond the situation to make things better. Hardest part of the job was that you had to be personal but not too personal as it would take too much time from other calls that had to be taken and made.
good,I would have loved to stay with Apple but we did not have that option because of their relocation to Ireland. I also did not want to move to Cupertino CA due to the high cost of living.
good,worked in a very large lab with a great team and manager for a specific project. highly secretive but everyone was motivated to get the work completed.
good,"I felt like an outcast in most jobs, but Apple is so diverse of a company that I fit right in. They literally have every job you can think of available and will work with anyone that works for them to make it the best place to work."
good,"Great environment, Great Benefits, Great Management. Would recommend. Was a great place to work. Team members knew their roles and executed flawlessly. Everyone was will and able to do their jobs. Hours were flexible, management allowed the freedom to get the job done."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for. The pay and benefits are great and I have found many of my managers to be supportive. There is opportunity to advance within the company. The best thing about Apple is the people. The coworkers make that hard days seem better, and everyone seems willing to help out."
good,"While at Apple, I had the pleasure of working with some of the best team members and customers. The job was stressful, but very rewarding. The benefits were amazing, but at the time, the pay was too little to continue working there."
good,It has a Very Competitive Environment. It provides one of the best learning places. Projects are completed in half the time them might be done elsewhere.
good,Best company I have ever worked for. Must be willing to change with the environment. Best technology company out there. I loved my time here. Best benefits all around.
good,Una marca que cuida mucho a sus empleados con muy poca rotación en donde no se preocupan por la apariencia de los vendedores y se enfocan más en dar una excelente capacitación.
good,Decent job and pay . Competitive and always room to move up in the company. Works with your schedule and peak season means extra money for your pockets
good,"The benefits are superior to most companies. So is the 401k. Management is great. Must be a team player, that is the easiest way to progress. Most enjoyable part is the people."
good,"Working at Apple has been a wonderful experience. As my first full time job, they've given me times of opportunities, and provided me with the training needed to do my job well."
good,Environnement du travail très désagréable Car tout le monde s’entraide dans différentes difficultés au niveau des connaissances ou pratiques personne ne se retrouve seul
good,"First of all, I have to Thanks Apple that give me an opportunity to work with the awesome team, There are a lots that I have learned  bout the Jobs inside out about the Technical support  and  greats team work. Although there are a tough times to deals with, But Apple has good culture and I love the events that they has organise."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,If they hired their Customer Care Advisors directly paying them better instead of having another company to do it for then which on the other hand had a recruitment Agency do the job..people would want to go to work more..and never look for other options..
good,Great Company to work for. i started this company and have been running it for a few years now. great products and serves with on time delivery and innovative operating ideas
good,"Loved the energy at work. Everyone is so passionate and enjoyed what they are doing. Colleagues are all so talented and helpful. "
good,"Really fun company to work for, if you love the products you will get on great there. The staff are all really friendly and genuinely want to help you progress your career."
good,"Working at Apple was such a blessing.  I was able to make money by providing customer technical support at the comfort of my own home.  However, with those numerous benefits come its downfalls.  A strict work schedule accompanied with having to meet monthly metrics consistently can lead to terrible stress if one is not prepared mentally."
good,"working in apple is great, can know inventions and new products, though it is a challenging job we can come to know our capability, i am really happy whenworking here"
good,If you are looking for a competitive work place this is the one. Management are very upfront with the expectations they are wanting from you. Numbers are very important here. advancement come very quickly. BUT here is the stickler once you have advanced in your department there is no where else to go. So you are kinda stuck.
good,My father worked at Apple when I was a child and I followed in his footsteps. It is a great company to work for if you are creative and have a passion for technology and learning.
good,"I liked working at Apple. If you have a good attitude, you don't minds working hard, you  understand people can be mean or grumpy anywhere at anytime and are willing to take that on occasion, then you'll do great. The weekends and busy time around holidays get old, but the benefits really make up for it. The benefits are amazing. They are so comfortable that it makes it hard to leave when it's time to leave. Promotion is also extremely competitive and always takes way longer than you hope or imagine it would. Stick it out, and you'll eventually get it in many cases, but it might take serious tenacity and time. There are some exceptions, but they are rare. "
good,The methodology followed by apple is totally customized but the beauty lies in the same. AS how their products are unique their process is also unique which is flexible for customers .
good,"Great place to work. So long as you are punctual. Paid training in Cupertino -with per diem, rental car, hotel accommodations, etc.. With weekends off. Great support staff."
good,"Working for Apple has legitimately been the most enriching experience in a job I've ever experienced. The company culture allows for its employees to grow and to feel empowered in their roles. Our leadership team both in store and on a corporate level are supportive and real for the most part. I would say the hardest part about this job is the work life balance. Being a single father, it has been difficult and emotionally draining having to miss out on large chunks of time with my kids because I'm working retail hours. The company as of late has started to shift away from the people focused initiatives, and focused more on metrics which in turn has started to breed a transactional type environment. Not something I'm pleased with."
good,Apple is a fantastic place to work. Flexible management and the benefits are killer but the life to work ratio gets hard even working from home. After two years it's hard to not appriciate the quality of life they provide to their employees.
good,Great place to work with great people. Teams are very responsive and collaborative. Great work/life balance and flexibility. Very training/career development forward.
good,"Apple is the best job I ever had when it comes to the people, benefits and the jobs you can do in store. Apple trains you not only for the job but as a person."
good,"Great company to work with. Can be extremely busy, Have learned alot about how to change the way I am to be a better leader, about how to position with people much better"
good,"Apple est une entreprise parfaite pour se former. Le call center n'est pasvraiment un endroit d'évolution car on évolue rapidement en passant d'un poste de conseiller à superviseur (le superviseur conseil le conseiller), mais ensuite l'évolution est lente et les places deviennent chères. "
good,It's not the easiest way to to deal with management when they want you to go fast but also help them love the experience of the store. I like the appl
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I'm a people person, I love working at retails socializing and helping customer personally. a typical day at work for me will be at a retail store helping hundreds of customers and still giving your 100 percent with your service, i love the hype, i love to hype people specially with new products. "
good,"Apple is a great place to work and they are cooperative with many school schedules. It has been a delight working for this company and now that a BSE has been earned, an Engineering position is desired."
good,"Great opportunity for anyone to enrich lives and your own. Fast passed, fun and healthy work  environment. Always something going on. Never a dull moment"
good,"Buena opción para laborar, el ambiente laboral es bueno."
good,"The Apple Store is an amazing place to work, with better benefits than I've ever heard of. 401K, Life Insurance, Stock Purchase Program, insane discounts on products (not just Apple), and amazing insurance."
good,Working at Apple helped me grow into a more well rounded employee as the fearless feedback culture was taken seriously and helped to create strong individual contributors who are able to excel in any other fields that value interpersonal skills.
good,"I worked at Apple on casual basis (few months)"
good,"Working at Apple is such a different experience. With constant feedback and understanding, Apple helps you as well as the people around you to advance and better yourself. The customer experience is important, but the employee's experience may even be held at a higher standard."
good,"Best thing is that you are working from home and they provide you with a computer and a iPod, so that you can serve the customer in a better way. Left because of personal issues."
good,"Working at Apple has grown me significantly as an individual. The compensation is excellent, and the company intentionality and culture is wonderful. My role was rather stressful due to the amount and nature of negativity I had to with all day every day. However, I love that it was never boring and worked with a magnificent team."
good,"great job, great salary, great management"
good,"Great company with amazing corporate culture. Coworkers are always fun, interesting, and generally creative in some way."
good,"Its great if you are a ""badged"" employee which you will hear a lot of working at Apple. If you work at the campus and are contracted please do not fall for the ""there is a possibility of getting hired on""."
good,"I received world-class, customer-service skills training while working with Apple, and became the top-selling employee. I conducted Beginner’s workshops for new and current Apple product owners seeking training to maximize their Apple experience."
good,This is a great place to work! The team culture is awesome and great and the benefits are off the chart! The option to work from home and the company advancement are great!
good,"Working for Apple was one of my best job experiences. The only downside was that once I was determined to be a ""rock star"" in sales, it was almost impossible for me to move into a different position within the store. I was only able to recieve my technician liscense after having surgery, and not being able to be on the sales floor, which allowed me time to study and pass the test. Even then, I was only allowed behind the genuis bar when they were shorthanded."
good,The training was excellent and there is a very positive vibe there. My manager was very good and helpful. The company has good policies and supports customer very well.
good,"The grove is a popular destination, so theres always an array of clientele. Dealing with technology and people can cover a spectrum of emotions haha. But working for a company like apple who really believes in what they are doing to help the world is awesome. I've learn to value a brand with integrity."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Good company, great people."
good,"Working for Apple requires me to be ready for change at any minute. Looking around corners and dealing with ambiguity are core values in my role. My co-workers are the most supportive and intelligent individuals I have ever worked with. We constantly push one another to think outside the box, and create innovative learning systems. "
good,"Il m'est impossible d'écrire et raconter comment se déroule une journée type. Mais c'est bien différent des autres entreprises. La prise en compte de l'individu est un modèle de management, c'est tout ce que je peux affirmer."
good,"Great company to work for. Great people to meat, in and out of work. And great on the resume. I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,Apple hires on the brightest and smartest people. They somehow manage to hire those without ego. It's a real joy to work in an environment where everyone is focused on the great good of the company instead of the great good of their careers
good,"Worked in a highly engaged, valued customer service position. Enjoyed learning about Apple Technology and programs and worked with like-minded individuals."
good,Not much to say here. If you enjoy people and a fast paced environment with limited flexibility in your schedule then this is the place for you. Its retail. You work hard and feel good about it.
good,"Everyday at Apple is different from the next. Every customer comes in with various issues, that others may not have. You learn the job as you go, and the reason for that is because there are many variations of a similar problem. "
good,"Apple is both one of the best and most stressful places I have ever worked (at least in the retail side of things). They expect a lot out of their employees, but have a tough time meeting them in the middle when it comes to work-live balance. On the one hand, the benefits and salary from Apple are exeplary and I wish other companies could follow suit, but on the other hand you are almost expected to bend over backwards to meet the businesses needs. Time off is difficult to acquire, and scheduling is absolute garbage when it comes to even the day by day operation. There are times where I didn't come in to work knowing when I actually had a shift because a change was made the night before and I wasn't notified, then received a tardy because I was late. Come on Apple! Friendly atmosphere and team, most of the time because Apple really treats you like a family member, and if you need time off for family or health issues it is regulated but plentiful. I had 6+ weeks of paid paternity leave as an example!"
good,working shift hours was the hardest part but the opportunity to advance within the company was very rewarding. 12 hour shifts four days a week.
good,Apple is great place to develop on a personal and professional level. Apple provides resources that support the customer and employee experience.
good,It was a pleasure to work for Apple.  I learned much about their products.  Management was encouraging and supportive.  I enjoyed my co-workers and found them knowledgeable.  The hardest part of my job was keeping up with their products.
good,"A typical day is working on images that are used in World Wide Sales and Training material. I coordinate photo shoots, models, locations, etc., to suite the desired message, and then photograph and retouch all images for use."
good,"Very friendly environment and great people to be around. Learned allot to apply to my life and enjoyed the people I was around. Co-workers was the best and people are always willing to learn and take direction. Hard part about the job was nothing, everything you truly learn by just asking a peer to help out."
good,"A typical day at work for me is answering anywhere between 20 to 30 plus phone calls in a 10 hour shift. The majority of my phone calls right now consist of setting up and troubleshooting wireless networks created by Apple AirPort routers as well as troubleshooting Apple TVs which are media streaming devices. "
good,Fast paced job totally revolved around sharing your passion for their products to spring interest into a new generation of apple consumers.
good,"I loved working at Apple, but at the end of the day you will be often reminded that you work Apple's retail arm, and sometimes that can make you feel unappreciated and unimportant. You will feel like a battering ram trying to protect your favorite company from time to time, but you will learn so much about technology, people, and communication from working there. Public speaking, troubleshooting, problem solving, and leadership are some of the other skills I picked up or strengthened while working here, and the benefits and discounts are great. Apple also has a knack for hiring some of the coolest, most interesting, and passionate people you'll ever meet, so more likely than not, you'll be developing a second family if you decide to work there, which was one of my favorite parts of the job."
good,"• Always fun to be around technology and be with great people every day"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"The best company I have worked for to date. We have wonderful benefits, perks, work environment, and work space. "
good,"As a sales specialist, I could always count on my colleagues for support throughout my period of work. The difficult thing though was to quickly acquire as much knowledge about the products I was positioning to customers. Whenever I got stuck, a colleague was on hand to bail me out."
good,"- Nice place to learn new technology things"
good,"Na iPlace - Apple Premium Reseller, coloquei em prática meus conhecimentos e técnicas de vendas, e adquiri grande conhecimento sobre os Produtos Apple, o que me fez abrir novos campos de atuação na qual estou focado no momento, Desenvolvimento de aplicativos para iPhone e iPad."
good,"typical day at my work is that one day i went to office in an auto when i was working in aircel company and auto person e charge 550/- INR from saidabad to hitec city and i was shocked whn i get down frm auto "
good,"Nothing is more exciting than working at Apple. Being part of the growth of the company was both personally and financially rewarding. I am very thankful for my time there. They do have problems with upper middle management who try to take credit for everything,"
good,"Amazing experience.  Had the benefit of working for both the corporate, and retail programs.  Has given me great perspective."
good,"You'll love working for this retail company it has the professionalism of the office with the pace and grit of an exciting new bar. Management is always looking out for you and your coworkers are young, smart, and hungry. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on the face of the person in front of you, whether its a coworker or customer."
good,"Good place to work. We can learn lot of new things here and co-operative colleagues. We will be given good responsibilities, which will give us exposure to take new initiatives."
good,Working at Apple is one of the best things to ever happen to me. Not having a degree in IT they've launched me into this field headfirst and I thank them for sparking such interest and intrigue into the world of IT.
good,Spending time talking with customers without the pressure of making a commission off of sales is the best part of the work environment at Apple computer. Having several dozen coworkers at any time is a great help with getting customers the best advice on questions they have.
good,"Best environment to be in your 20s. Everyone are so supportive and willing to help at any moment. Management is about growth and development. If you are good, there is always room for advancement."
good,bonne écoute mais petit souci au niveau de la confidentialité sur mon dossier médical
good,"Apple was a great place to work, great people too work with always had something too do, a little strict on the rules of bringing in electronic devices, even if it was on accident."
good,Enjoyed my time working at Apple but felt that the work wasn't as challenging as it used to be after being there for five years.
good,"Apple Inc, One of the best companies I have ever worked for. Its a very diverse and fun place to work. The most enjoyable part about the job, is meeting new people everyday."
good,"work with customers. Learn a lot, new challenges everyday. Work with good people. Good health benefits, gym reimbursement, good discounts."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Apple has a great work environment with a diverse culture and attitude. The campus is very advanced and nice making for great work atmosphere.
good,"I enjoyed the set shift work, 8 am to 8pm 3 days a week.  I learned that team work is vital when hitting daily targets and in my last contract I enjoyed the friendly co-workers within my LCM Section.  The hardest part of the job is the uncertainty of the week to week basis. If your healthy fit and can follow safety regulations as everybody is trained on an individual basis with face to face attention by a supervisor, then any employee should enjoy working within the Manufacturing Section in Apple."
good,Loved this job. Everyone was very nice to me. Fast paced. I would totally work here again. It was a dealership so management was hardcore but over all it was a nice experience.
good,"Exceptionally talented people working together to make apple the number one handset dealer in India."
good,"Very great co workers, Team work is a normal routine, balance in everything, Great Management, Solid learning curve.Great Facilitie and Modern Buildings"
good,"Working at Apple, you're surrounded by people who enjoy being themselves and have no problem showing it. The company has contunied to set the bar for customer experience and innovative ideas."
good,I love working with unique individuals as peers and Apple is full of them.  I also enjoy the mindset and the things that separate themselves from everyone else.  I wish they were more clear about positions applied for vs what they interview for.  I applied for leadership as I am qualified for such a position.  When i was hired I was offered a position we never discussed and took the job for additional income as a part-time job.
good,Apple is a great company to work for.  The culture created at the store level is one that is supportive and challenging.  The management understands the demands placed on the workers so there is always someone in your corner.
good,This is by far the best retail company that I've worked for in all my years of customer service. From the co-workers to the customers.
good,"*Fast paced days "
good,hard work is rewarded - managers really care about you - Apple really tries to have fun and keep employees happy
good,"A typical workday includes -"
good,"Possibly one of the best parts of working for a company like Apple is the environment you work in and the people you work along side with. My role with Apple was mainly off of the sales floor and managing the ""behind the senses"" functionality of the technical half of our stores. Every day at work was exciting solely due to the employees and leadership teams you get to work along side with. I have never had a job where I got to work with so many unbelievably skilled people who simply love what they do. In addition to these employees was a leadership team who was always available and willing to help you succeed and grow both professionally and personally."
good,The managers are understanding of a student's complex schedule. Perfect for college students that possess troubleshooting skills. Co-Workers are welcoming no matter the experience level. Resources are readily available and the job environment promotes learning.
good,"excellent place to work"
good,what could be an extremely stressful work environment seems fun and uplifting thanks to my coworkers and leadership team.
good,Managing the sales of computers and peripherals is a nice enough job.  Training sales staff to be attentive to the needs of the customers is also fun to make happen.  The people are the best part of the job and help create satified customers is always a joy.  The problem is that in the long run it isn't making a difference in the world.   It is time to do that.
good,"Not bad job. The benefits are insane when you think of the savings in Gas. Social interactions drop to a new low, but its awesome"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

good,Great management that always encourages development that gives you the right tools for success.
good,"My day consist of recording,collecting, and reconciling over 700 active accounts. "
good,"Responsible for scheduling, inventory, displaying merchandise, employee reviews, interviews for the store. Also, gained certification on various Apple certs to ensure knowledge level was well above par, paid at store's expense."
good,"Had a lot of fun interacting with customers on a daily basis about their needs with technology.  Explaining how a particular product works, and how it can help them were common.  Troubleshooting was an essential piece of how to help the customer in from of you.  The traffic was immense, but fun.  A great time!"
good,"Receive and respond to emails from iTunes Store customer's who experience trouble with their iTunes Account, purchases, billing, gift cards, /certificates and downloads. "
good,best company to work for. To be passionate about what you do for a living while working under the leadership of Steve Job and to vision ahead is what the took the most during my years with Apple.
good,To work at Apple is to work with a family team of coworkers who worker together to encourage and enhance one another for the betterment of the complete Apple experience for our costumers.
good,Got a lot of very useful and helpful experience. I would like to work for a company like Apple which is a very big company and I would have more opportunities to improve my career.
good,"Working for Apple is amazing to say the least. Typically you are your own boss to create and figure new business strategies to help push better products, experiences, and services. "
good,The work environment was relaxed an made talking to people easier and less stressful. Co-workers where enjoyable to be around and also was very helpful if there was information you needed help finding. The hardest part of the job was hearing the customers on the head sets it was a little difficult to hear customers explain the issues they were having. The most enjoyable part of working there was helping people because the satisfaction that i helped someone means a lot to me
good,"My typical day would start with overviewing channel partners performance all over india and have a birds view on business expansion plans from sales, so that i can put service infrastructure in place well before they reach the market."
good,"Great company"
good,Apple is a role model for how a company should treat there employees and the positive fun work place encourages hard work and ownership in employees.

Additionally, the training provided by Apple management was world-class, and I acquired exceptional customer service and technical skills from this position."

good,"Working for Apple was a terrific move! By doing so, I was able to learn the culture of one of the world's leading companies and see how their culture is formulated. As a people-driven company, I've been fortunate enough to learn how important it is to build lasting consumer relationships, the right environment to create an efficient staff, and how to make success contagious. "
good,"Apple is a fantastic company to work for.  In the retail stores, employees enjoy an environment that nurtures every individual's personal growth in communication skills and interpersonal savvy."

good,An exciting place to work.
good,"Enjoyed working for Apple very much. Interaction with fellow employees was great, and operating as a team oriented enviroment was fantastic."
good,"I loved the position I held at Apple, Inc. It was centered around customer service, but also required the ability to research and troubleshoot customers' issues ""on the fly"", with every call different from the previous."
good,"Going to work everyday has its ups and downs but for the most part, being at apple doesn't feel like a job, its a way of life, just being around people and helping with products that everyone loves. Its just a great feeling. I love those guys!"
good,hard working days and too busy.
good,Worked from home tuesday thru sun 1Pm - 11PM
good,"Test iBooks application (ePUB and PDF file formats) on iPhone, iPad Touch and iPad running iOS 5.0.1, 5.1.1 and 6.0."
good,"Apple is a great place to be. Its pretty demanding though and you will be doing a lot more than any other retail store. Make sure you build a solid relationship with management or else you will never get promoted. There are politics, just as with any other job."
good,"The best retail job. Overcrowd store. long hours, Best paid in retail"
good,"A typical day is busy and never dull. I learned to plan ahead, multi-task more efficiently and what to say when giving feedback. The hardest part of working here is everything constantly changes, so be ready. The best part is how often you get positive affirmations of what your doing right."
good,"I will come in early, usually 6:30am. Log into SAP, run every report manageable to prepare for the incoming shipments. Reconcile any issues from the previous day, including negative inventory or loss of product. Meet with the entire staff to get ready for our day. My co-workers are amazing. They come from all walks of life, speak every language imaginable, and treat our customers like gold. We at Apple are never afraid of change. We are never afraid to take the next step."
good,"There are not to many jobs that consistently challenge you. This this job keeps you on your, A game."
good,"I loved working for the Apple Store. I would work with everything I loved and sold and troubleshot products and services I truly believed in that I used every day in my own personal life too. If I hadn't relocated to Japan to seek higher income, I would have been very content remaining an asset to this incredible company, however, free living and work in Japan was the only thing that got me to leave."
good,"Working for Apple has a prestige that comes with it but on the floor can be a very difficult experience. From day 1 you're expected to figure out where the answer your looking for is, not that you already know it. Personal growth is another fantastic strength the company helps you foster not just professionally but personally. Tons of benefits and perks even for part-time, but don't expect a steady paycheck unless you're full-time, and getting that full-time if you're asking for it is incredibly difficult and can take literal years for the store leader to have an opening to extend your hours and benefits to FT. Work-life balance if you're in it for the long haul can be very tiresome. You can absolutely be a clock-in/clock-out employee but they take very close notice of your work and your metrics absolutely count as well as your attitude when you're there for promotion/advancement, so take care if that's your endgoal."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,I love the culture and the camaraderie we all shared.  The management was always there to motivate us and the perks of working for the company were amazing.
good,"Training for use of tools and call taking is minimal. There is a brief overview of each and live call taking is very immediate after the first week. However, resources and tier 2 assistance is available."
good,"Working for Apple will push you to do things that you never dreamed you could. You will dive into a world where you can be anything you want and do whatever you want. There are endless opportunities and an incredible bond between employees. However you must have a clear head and a good grasp on your life outside of work because you can easily get far out of balance and start to feel distant. Life moves fast here and you need to keep up with it. If you can manage that, you will love working for Apple."
good,"Apple is a good company to work for, because it offers flexible working hours, as well as a pleasant working environment. Also, the management at Apple is supportive."
good,"I love the job it’s amazing, always enjoying myself. Meet new people everyday and have fun everyday. Working with Apple is a great experience, helped me better with talking to people and getting them to laugh."
good,"Working at Apple sent me into a learning curve that taught me more than I could ever imagine. How to truly be a part of a team, how to be a better person and how to feel inspired and give that inspiration to our consumers. I was a seasonal hire and at the end of my contract with Apple, I cried (happy tears), because I had never felt so at home and so welcome in a work setting. The leadership, team and everyone involved in your development are there to push you to your greatest potential. I will forever be thankful for what I learned at Apple and recommend this job to anyone looking to become the best version of themselves and contribute to the amazing changes we are trying to make as a company. Unforgettable experience!"
good,"as a student working 20 hrs a week, i was offered PTO, stocks, 401k, and health insurance. Apple offered a lot of employe engagement, and i enjoyed being able to work from home."
good,Got hired as a seasonal employee. It was a great opportunity to work for Apple. Unfortunately they didn’t have any positions available to be brought on as a permanent replacement.
good,"I was a part time seasonal employee and enjoyed my time there. All the managers are nice and easy to get along with."
good,"Everyone is very supportive, and everyone is open for constructive criticism and feedback so that we make working together as seamless and easy as possible"
good,"Great place to work at "
good,I enjoyed my time at apple. It was a great job that I wish I could've kept a little longer. I only worked there for a few months because it was seasonal. Outside of that it was a very open place to work.
good,"Apple as a whole is an amazing company to work for.  The management team is definitely something to be re-evaluated, very inconsistent in what organizations you are part of."
good,Wear some comfortable shoes because you’re gonna be on your feel a lot. Time goes by very fast when its such a fast paced environment but the friends you make there make it go by faster.
good,There are no typical workdays and the diversity of the workforce keeps you learning from new and different perspectives. Change is a given and the people are amazing.
good,It wasnt a bad place to work at all. Sometimes it can be stressul but you arent pressured to sell anything but at the same time u are if you want to be made permanent.
good,"Living in New York, I find it very hard to manage a work life balance on my current salary. I can barely afford rent, let alone child support payments, car payments, and other life expenses like groceries. I need a second job just to get by. Not fun. However, the benefits are strong and worth keeping the job instead of finding something else entirely. I love working at Apple, I just wish I made more."
good,They invest in you with training as well as creating a sense of community. Usually the hire part-time so great if you want a second job with benefits to help pursue other career goals
good,Great atmosphere to work in and supportive management and is a good place to move up and expand your skills. Work culture is fun and easy going and inviting !
good,"A typical day at Apple consist of engaging with customers to help find their needs with a solution. I would often be the first person a customer sees to greet and help advise or sell a product. I also performed other duties within the store such as maintaining visual merchandising and assisting team members. Always curious, I stayed on top of news about products and initiatives, ready to apply what I learned in customer interactions. My success was measured by team and individual productivity as well as overall store performance. I was proud to represent Apple, and you get great satisfaction from helping customers develop lifelong relationships with Apple."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Such a great job while finishing my degree up. The management was supportive and caring during transitions in my life. I love the culture it produces and I’ve really enjoyed the diverse group of individuals I have been able to work with.
good,"Great place to work. Everyone I worked with was really great. You get lots of discounts, so If you like apple products it obviously the place to be. It is a retail store so prepared to be rushing around from the time you get there. till the time you leave.  It is very fast paced. But it does make the days go faster."
good,"Relaxed place to work but not a jumping board for the corporate position I would have liked. Maybe it was just the market in my city. Great place to work, though."
good,Working at Apple has taught me so much. This place was honestly the best place I have ever worked at. The staff was awesome and I loved going into work. The culture at Apple is diverse and trend setting. The only negative I had was to balance work and family life. I wish there was more flexibility for weekends.
good,"Apple really values its employees and shows as much by providing many opportunities! Their maternity leave was unlike any other I’d ever seen, and their other benefits were also phenomenal!"
good,"At Apple you work with some of the smartest, most creative people around. Stores become families, and you truly enjoy the people that work in your building."
good,I was very impressed by my experience working for Apple. I believe they really do care about their employees and their customers. Their training and management is phenomena!
good,"Une superbe première expérience dans le monde de L'It et de la vente dans le secteur Retail et BtoB."
good,"Love the culture"
good,"Great job, good people fun working experience, substantial pay,  just needed more hours. Overall it was an awesome learning experience with a lot of diversity"
good,Good job. Great atmosphere. Always on top of their game. They also supplied all tools that were needed for the job. Benefits were some of the best around.
good,"Working for Apple through Apex was great, the people around you are wonderful but keep in mind you're a contractor. You don't get PTO, and there is no ability to move up. Other than that though the management was great and they really understand the need for a good work-life balance. You're able to get days off easily if you need them and the folks around you are easy to get along with."
good,I worked here as a younger man. The pay and everything is amazing but i would say this is job better suited for someone who is settled or beginning to settle in they're life.
good,"Apple is a phenomenal place but it's also a very big place. One person can make a difference but it's not a great place to try to navigate a career. Great benefits, trying hard to improve on inclusiveness and competitive salary"
good,"I would say the only downside is advancement . It can be tough to move up due to all the employees that are there. Extremely competitive. The people you meet working are honestly the most down to earth, intelligent , caring people you’ll ever meet at a job. We all helped each other succeed. Great for a college job or part time opportunity"
good,Apple is an amazing company. Management is constantly encouraging you to be better and find new opportunities within your department or elsewhere. Love working here.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,ya its great atmoshphere.....want to learn more things in apple .....it is like a great retail atmoshphere.thanks for giving opportunities.in retail i learn more customer experience.
good,You will work with LOTS of interesting coworkers from all over the world. The work was interesting and the culture within my team was very professional but relaxed.
good,"Work environment was ok always over time available. The supervisors were nice, management was always open and available if you and a issues and were good with resolving you issues"
good,"Learned a lot about using Apple technology, fraud prevention and customer service. The environment was very friendly and very nice office space and cafeteria. Plus free parking."
good,What a place to work. There is nothing else like it anywhere..Lots of travel to Asia. Good perks at the home base. I wouldn't trade the experience for anything.
good,"Wireless testing and software QA for iPhone and iPads from 3G to 6.  "
good,"The people, the company the mission, the man. Great products. We loved every day. You knew you were appreciated and you felt comfortable in the job. The mission was clear"
good,"Every day was new and fun, employees were all so amazing to work with. Catered to me being in school and having personal issues. Managers were sometimes a bit dismissive of me when I needed help but I could always get advice from other employees."
good,What I admired most about working here was the constant feedback and push for improvement. Everyone was willing to help out each other so we could all be our best selves. Mangers would consistently interact with everyone making it easy to approach them for any help or problems that may be occurring in either work or personal life.  I was able to grow and strengthen all of my skills with plenty of opportunity to learn new things and become a stronger asset to the team.
good,I haven't worked at Apple for 15 years. In that time the CEO has changed so my experience there probably doesn't matter at all. The company seems to have completely changed.
good,Apple cultivates a culture that allows its employees to learn and grow with the intention to help others in the process. It has provided me opportunities that I didn't think I'd have.
good,I have never worked with a more intelligent and conscientious group of people. I loved working at Apple. I would highly recommend the experience for anyone who ha a passion for Apple Technology.
good,Working at Apple was one of the most enjoyable experiences while working in retail. The environment and the people are amazing and collaborative. Management is very forthcoming and will work with you through anything.
good,Apple provided me with an opportunity to learn about myself and grow both professionally and personally. I was able to have competency driven chats for training and development purposes geared to personal and career growth.
good,"Great, respectable company that treats its employees better than any other retail environment. Facilitating purchases and empowering customers to get more out of their devices, scheduling repair appointments and consultations is the general bulk of the day."
good,"I loved working for apple and the challenges it offered me, on a daily basis. I was on Contract but would love another opportunity to work there. Lost contact with people I worked with after break for my heart surgery. But next time I will be looking for an opportunity to make this place my new home."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"I've been with the company for eight years now and can honestly say its a great company to work for."
good,I was a contractor for the 5C launch. We were trained for 6 weeks on SAP and I am forever grateful for the experience as it's not every day one gets to be that close to a world leader in manufacturing of a device that has changed the world in the ways humans communicate with each other for the better or the worse Apple is an awesome place to work.
good,"Working at Apple is a great experience and an opportunity that I wish didn't end, granted the job can be fast paced and you have to deal with ambiguities but it is the same with any job and life in general.  The management is awesome and has the staffs best interest at heart, working there helps you learn about yourself and how to help managed things around you.  But you are not going through that process alone the whole store even management take this process.  The workplace is vastly cultured, and presents another level of customer service with the many personalities.  The most enjoyable part to me was the job, the staff, and the people that we serviced, my position required repairing the relationship and build rapport with our customers.  Being a technical expert, the first priority was to listen and if there was any kind of technical issues that is what I will repair.  Whether it is fixing software issues, or are taking their modular device to the back opening and repairing any hardware issues.  I can say I was fortunate to be apart of an amazing company, not only that but you have opportunities to visit other store, and go for career experiences that can help move up in the company"
good,I worked in Apple for 8 Months. Very good company in terms of adopting world class technology. Good opportunity to work with world class engineers in maps division
good,"I was given the autonomy that I craved, while still being held accountable. My managers were great and invested in my success. I enjoyed that no two days were the same, but there was a lot of structure too."
good,Apple really values their employees in turn will give much better customer service. Benefits were great. Working from home for apple was not the best. Tied to your desk nonstop and was very call center like. Working in the retail store was a much better job if you are the type that likes to interact with employees and customers.
good,It was great working at Apple. Be sure to be ready to work because they truly work their employees. I worked from home and did not have much flexibility to use the restroom for too long because every minute is recorded.
good,Great culture and makes sure everyone buys in.  Great benefits and plenty of perks. Hard interviewing process but all for good reason. Helps pay for education and wellness.
good,"jolly environment to work with very good team and under"
good,I wouldn’t be the person I am today without working at Apple. I’ve been here for 8 years and have built so many skills that would be beneficial in numerous positions. It’s been really nice.
good,"Great company to work for  very fast pace, but fun atmosphere. I learned a lot about how to run a successful business based on providing excellent products and excellent customer service."
good,The hardest part of the job was maintaining composure with very unhappy customers. Management always supported me and we always had a great time. I learned to hone in on my customer service skills and personal development. I'd go back.
good,"Great culture, Great people, Confused management that try to dominate with an iron fist yet also try to befriend staff with highly un genuine kindness."
good,I love working for Apple. It is very diverse and a judgement free zone. Everyone gets along and we all work as a team to get through the work day. The management is great and they don't come off as micro managing. The hardest part of the job is telling a customer that their iOS device is out of warranty followed by the repair cost.
good,"Apple is a great company to work for, they have a strong culture of feedback, communication, work ethic, and customer focus. On a typical day I would take about 30-40 appointments in the Genius Bar troubleshooting software and hardware issues, discovering the best solution for the customer. Not only was this my responsibility, but also ensuring the customer was provided with all the other services that Apple has to offer. Management was effective in employee delegation. The culture is amazing in that there a so many people with different backgrounds and different expertise that they bring to the company. The hardest part of the job is giving a customer bad news. The best part of the job is making human connections with the customers."
good,"I had the great opportunity to receive paid training while working at the Apple Store. I was sent to Cupertino for 3 weeks to learn more about software and hardware repair, which was invaluable for a beginner IT professional."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,it's a good job overall.   the lunch room is the best with the whole cafeteria. The job offers a lot of opportunities to grow. i would recommend this job
good,"Nice Place to work but no permanent contract is a big minus, Some people have to work hard there, I had lucky I insect monitors the whole day. Ith easy and comfortable work"
good,"Day to day culture: Focus on selling, repairing, teaching "
good,"Good company to work for. "
good,Apple is a competitive work place if any employee want to get promotions he/she have to know about all the works is done in Apple and improve the information and their educations. then he can apply to the hire positions.
good,"The premier place to work in a retail environment. Apple makes it hard to leave due to it's competitive salary and benifits package."
good,"The experience alone is worth working at Apple"
good,"Loved working there, the atmosphere there is awesome. Very chill and relaxing work enviornment but very fast past as well. Loved the people i worked with including my team. Pay was ok but could be better."
good,Crazy environment but great company with truly wonderful people to work with. No experience like it! Learned so much about the company and products. I loved it!
good,An extremely fun and open company to work and work through the ranks. Being part of a such a global brand can demand a lot of high expectations and stressful encounters.
good,"Great place to work, amazing opportunities to progress into any sector of the company."
good,Working for Apple in college was a growing experience helping me gain strong customer service skills as well as technical knowledge. I cannot recommend this experience enough. Cream of the crop of retail.
good,Working at Apple was a dream come true and I wish I would have been able to stay. Very fun atmosphere and everyone feeds on being the best. The best culture Ive seen in any working experience.
good,"I'm not allowed to go into detail about my views on the company, but I can tell you in short that it's an excellent place of work. The quality and craftsmanship of their products match just how much Apple cares for its employees and each individual's personal and professional advancement."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for.  Sure there are ups and downs  because you are working with people.  Overall though, the atmosphere is great, the people are fun & the pay and benefits are pretty good."
good,"Agilidade, inovação, ser você mesmo, sinceridade e comprometimento fazem toda diferença."
good,"Apple is a great company to work at if you are are interested in changing the world.  Work/Life balance is sometimes a challenge and most advancement is in Cupertino, CA."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Fast paces, friendly, great environment but too little pay for such a competitive job. I appreciated the people and customers but it was really difficult to move up and get hours."
good,In receiving it fast paced and daily goals were set. Overtime was available. It was high pressure and competitive. The work was very mundane and repetitive.
good,"third party company for apple , they forgot to pay me a check and this caused for me to relocate do to bills that could not be paid.all in all this company was a wonderful experience still to this day i know how to trouble shoot all apple products ."
good,"I feel supported and provided with the proper resources to learn and grow within the company. As a result, I have grown as a person inside and outside of work."
good,"Amazing place to work, always fun and makes you excited to go to work each day, Nice to be able to help people and tell them the truth. Hard to move up into higher roles as so many people are also trying."
good,"Very fast paced place to work. You get to interact with an abundance of people which really gives you a diverse set of people skills that many employees do not always get the opportunity to obtain. It's a very creative setting, and everyone is super supportive."
good,"Apple is an incredibly supportive company to work for. There is an incredibly strong workplace culture and a very strong sense of unity among the employees."
good,"Apple is an amazing place to work. Its fun, fast paced and has great benefits. Management could be better. There is a lot of micro managing. They have fair breaks, hour lunch, and fair pay. If you don't like crowds this isn't the place for you."
good,"Peaceful start to everyday, with a catch up via your managers. Personal Huddles were always happening, so every employee was set up for success. I learned how to interact with customers of all temperaments, and personalities. Our managers were well trained, and eager to teach. There is no culture like that of Apple, besides maybe google. Everyone got alone, and enjoyed each-others company. The most difficult part of my job, was the sheer number of guests in our store at any given time. Management of your time, and capabilities was absolutely huge. some people were just looking around, while others were there to purchase. I was a big part of the store, as I was the first contact for guests as they entered. It was my job to probe, detail, and accurately designate specialists, who could cater to their needs. The most enjoyable part of my employment at Apple, were the long lasting relationships I still have to this day. I didn't work at all when I was employed there. I just enjoyed the loving company I was surrounded by."
good,"Things are always changing at Apple, including how they want to manage -- it can be tough. But the atmosphere is great. Very willing to work with you."
good,"Was very special to learn about leadership at Apple, talk to customer and help then was my target. All IT information shared between customer and colleagues I will keep forever."
good,Great pay for a retail job with TONS of opportunities to grow in all areas of your life.  Management was amazing when I was there-totally cared about everyone and sought to understand each of us and any challenges we may have had at or outside of work!
good,"Apple makes great products and challenges the status quo. This is evident in their retail space as well. No other retail space have I seen that compares the the high level of care, concern, salary and growth opportunities Apple affords. "
good,"I loved the people I worked with! My managers always had my best interest in mind. Career advancement is a possibility and changing rolls once hired is not hard to do, as long as there is the position available. Working with customers can make or break your day. For busy season or special holidays where you have to work, food is usually provided."
good,great place to work if you are young and tech savvy. the management is easy to work with and deeply care about your time and effort at Apple. its very fun to work at such an innovative company.
good,Apple has been an excellent working environment. I've learned and grown both personally and professionally. Cross functional collaboration is executed well and the teams all work towards the same mission.
good,"lots of things to do never a dull moments stays busy, co workers are involved routinely on every day of work and duties on and off the floor , exciting"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"A typical day at work you will meet a lot of people, and if you are in the family room it's not always happy people, but you have the tools at your disposal to turn frowns upside down. You can learn a lot from Apple, but the best tools for your life you will get from the first week or two going through training. They are steps that you will use everywhere, in every relationship, and they just make life better. The culture of Apple is apparent in everything you do with your co-workers, and if you get negative, remember everybody has those days, and that everybody is trying to advance too. Don't let negative feelings get in the way of your progression. Management cares about everybody even if they don't always show it, they are just super busy too with all the operations they have to take care of. They are running the store, while taking care of all the areas that need help, cut them a little slack if they don't always pay 100% attention to you. The hardest part of the job is you may not have a life outside of work, because people expect Apple employees to be superheros and make everything better, you may spend more time on the clock than initially intended, but Apple does everything to make sure you are still getting the best balance you can. Best and worst part pt. II, Holidays, tons of free food in the break-room (best), TONS of customers coming out of the seams, I mean like cocroaches tons, like climbing over the walls tons (worst). Hope this helps! IF you can work for Apple, THEN DO, they are the best company, you may interview like 7 times before they hire you, just know"
good,"In the end i quit the job because the manager that replaced the one that hired me was horrible and created a hostile work environment for me, i would go back to work there if I could, but the manger i quit on has put out bad word on me"
good,"Apple is a workplace of enjoyable nature, but one that should be taken into consideration when doing something like technical support.  Be mentally ready for this."
good,I sincerely enjoyed working for Apple. The in depth training and consistent motivations were a plus. Would have continued working there is I hadn't had to relocate.
good,"Fun, fast paced environment working with people all day. The company and leaders put a lot of resources into employee development and empowers us to be our own leaders."
good,"While it was fun and exciting to work for Apple, keep in mind that this is a business and profits are part of the sales. If you don't like selling, this isn't the job for you. If you like helping people and enhancing lives through technology, it really helps to know how each of the products work with one another. Product knowledge is key."
good,Great work environment.  Everyone respects everyone.  Good opportunities for growth and development and over all just a fun place to work.  Great perks.
good,Fast working environment where I get to collaboriate with a number of various talented beings which I get to learn from every day. This allows me to grow and further my knowledge on things surrounding me in the work place.
good,Always competition not alot to do in the way people and alot of drama between coworkers alot of fighting between managers about placement of the employees
good,"This was my first job fresh out of college. I wasn't excited about working in retail but quickly found I could develop, was promoted 4 times, and it led to my next role, which I now excel at because of the high standards of Apple. The work/life balance is amazing, because you clock out and you do not work until you clock in again. The only downsides were the difficulty in advancing past a certain point, and having to work nights/weekends."
good,"Fast-paced learning environment with a good team."
good,Great place to work if you are hired permanent. Managers are great and they keep you busy.  Always be willing to learn because someone will love to teach you.
good,"Very fast paced, especially during the holidays! It was filled with laughter and a great team effort. I loved learning about the new products and watching peoples faces light up when the unwrapped their new device."
good,"Apple has many amazing and creative people working there. I had a  commuting issue,so I could not stay on. My team was the best. If you can get with Apple , I would recommend you take that job. They really take care of there associates. You will be putting in long hours , but the pay scale, benefits  & training is  very progressive."
good,"- Great place to work"
good,"Like with Disney, there's not too many better companies to work for than Apple. Demanding and tough but oh so worth it. Fulfilling and fun. Stressful at times, but again at the end of the day - felt satisfied. Perks were available but not the reason to work at Apple. The pride came from Apple products and its Retail Stores. We were treated very, very well."
good,"I loved working at Apple, I wish to sincerely go back someday as I worked so hard to gain respect from employees and managers. I was known in a role I wasn't in.  I worked hard to get things done."
good,Working at Apple was fun and fast paced. The culture was very friendly and family oriented. Everyone was always helpful. Management was always understanding and friendly to speak with.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,While it is not the easiest place to work--there is a lot to learn to start and always more to absorb--there are many rewards to working there. It is inspiring to work for a company with a mindset of constant improvement in their products and processes. Apple does a great job of candidate selection so your co-workers are generally top-notch. The company truly cares about its employees and works to find ways to keep them happy. The schedule for retail employee at Apple can be challenging for some.
good,"Excellent company with great benefits and work life balance. Pay is great; people are friendly and courteous. You are given the opportunity to work remotely. Overall, a great company."
good,The job definitely tested your ability to think on your feet as you became accustomed to generating a unique customer experience based on the individual specs you would learn about the customer.
good,"Apple is a very forward thinking organization, as well there is no competitive nature to any position that you fill for the day.. I am a Technical support engineer and receive and provide technical knowledge and instruction from each and every employee that I work with.. "
good,"It was a great part-time job for me because hours were flexible and I was always up to date on the newest technology. Not much advancement opportunity if you're starting out from retail, but you get to meet a lot of cool people."
good,"Breaks were awesome. Got an hour long lunch, which is way more relaxing. the cafe on site was amazing. management definitely cared about us and our advancement. "
good,"Apple is a great place to work.  No place for slackers!.  Left because I needed a full-time job.  Fun, exciting, stressful, and challenging dealing with customers who sometimes are angry and combative."
good,"I loved Apple, I also learned a lot working here. They treat you with respect, pay well and provide benefits and 401K. I would suggest working here if you can"
good,My very first work experience from Apple was my first glimpse into the IT industry which made me decide to start my long career in sales in this industry.
good,"The ultimate thing everyone must remember is that is a retail environment.  We sell stuff for a profit.  So if you don't like the retail mall hours, then this is not the job for you."
good,"Well, I was an app developer, so I was a third-party ""freelance"" worker, which means I was not officially an employee hired by Apple. I did get my certification in SWIFT and C++ and obtained my Apple Developers License. But even at that, I had so much fun doing what I did. I collaborated with companies to create their product. I thoroughly enjoyed my work here."

The best thing about Apple is the people. The coworkers make that hard days seem better, and everyone seems willing to help out."
good,"Working for Apple was one of my all-time favorite jobs! A sense of community, appreciated (though stressful at times) and the benefits are unmatchable."

good,"The Best job I evedr had. I mean that the best boss, everryone was kind, helpful and welcoming. I am a wordsmith and that's what I did there ands I learned a great deal about the Apple culture and their products and trhey are the best. I hope to get in there full time soon, Most difficult is making poeople understadn the worth of editing, and the best."

good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,But apparently I have to fill it out so I am just taking up space at the moment to get passed these screens and that's my answer. But I think my opinion is not a factor because what may not work for me may for someone else.
good,Une superbe expérience avec une vision globale qui comprend l'humain avant tout.
good,I loved the people I worked with and would go back part-time if I could. The training was fun and was always ongoing. We always had something going on to help keep employee moral up.

good,"Great culture, room for growth and amazing work environment. Made sure the employees had the best benefits and pay. Worked well around specific schedules."
good,"Working at the Apple store was a great experience. I learned a great deal about conflict management, efficiency, and Apple products. As a technician, I found myself regularly overwhelmed by the sheer number of customers and lack of resources. It is a rewarding job, but can be challenging when the expectations set by the company and developed by consumers clashes with the immediate reality of each appointment in a front-line environment."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for. Do your job, and do the right thing and they'll take care of you. Work schedules are very inconsistent though. It can change every three months. You may work 8-5 PM Mon-Fri, or you may work 12-8 PM Saturday-Wednesday."
good,"Great company to work for, it was very statistic based but if you followed the rules you moved up very quickly. Loved working there and loved the people i worked with."

good,"love my job because people care about me as a person and about my professional growth. There is a genuine spirit of cooperation and shared goals all revolving around helping the customer that I have not found at other corporations,"
good,"Fun, innovating, and probably what one may expect from working at such a company, and than some. Project leads are quick to assist anyone if questions arise, work is simple and not necessarily as repetitive as one may figure, and they have their own onsite cafeteria, so you needn't have to go far if you choose not to bring a lunch or dinner."
good,"Love the Culture & Environment, great learning experience. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Amazing place to work for, just don't expect to be paid or compensated much or monetarily. Enjoyable people to work with, a bit of a Disneyland ""everyone is wonderful"" feel, hard to advance but your job is insanely secure."
good,The culture and the way this company gets you prepared for the day to day work is the best I've ever seen. It allowed me to gain great experience as Mac is valuable thing to be familiar with as an IT professional. My coworkers were amazing and they were always willing to work with reasonable schedule adjustments.
good,I've been employed with apple for almost 3 years. Each year it seems that they enhance and make changes that are beneficial to employees and customers. I would recommend this job to anybody out there
good,"Apple is a great company to work for. Benefits are offered from day 1 for the entire family and the pay is decent. Schedules are rotating and based on performance so your schedule is determined by you. If you're not great at commuting to work and would like to work by yourself, an at home job like Apple would be great."
good,"I love the culture at Apples. The autonomy given to employees and their encouragement for employees to grow is what I love most about the company. "
good,"Working for apple was amazing, so many things to do so many different calls to help with. There was lot of energy and effort you had to put it but at the end of the day it was awesome working for apple."
good,"Great environment, management, coworkers, etc. However, very little flexibility when it comes to scheduling. Hard to get days off and must work weekends. I have been denied days off even if I've asked more than a month in advance. For almost a year that I have worked there, I have never been scheduled a Sunday off, and only have had one Saturday off. Shifts are also long and all-day commitments (11am-8pm, 12-9pm, 1-10pm), which makes it tough to balance anything else going on in your life."
good,"Since I was a contractor I wasn't able to really grasp hold of the essence of Apples business workings. However, as part of the IT team I learned a lot in a short period of time. The people were very sharp and shared information willing to get our jobs done."
good,Nice company culture  will enable you to gain professional skill and friendly working environment with respect in all -level of management. Great benefit for employees.
good,Working for apple has been really cool. Being able to represent a band like this is cool. The Benefits have been great. The Work life balance is okay as well.

good,"Great work life balance and benefits. I would recommend this company to others. Overall great place to work , easy transfer options if needed, even worldwide."
good,Apple provided a great learning experience.  My work ethics and job skills were greatly strengthened during my time with Apple.
good,Working at Apple has been a great pleasure. The typical day consists of communicating with customers along with problem solving on the go. There are times when a situation arises that may test your technical knowledge of systems outside out Apple's scope and realm. However the company has provided us with the training and proper tools to handle any issues that may occur.
good,While working for Apple my shift was three days a week working twelve hours a day.  A normal day would consist of a morning meeting with our supervisor to talk about our targets and goals for the day ahead.  Supervisor's were easy to contact incase of an emergency or if a situation occurred.  Majority of the day I worked as part of a team running machines on the factory floor that would put Imacs together.  Other times throughout the day I worked on my own to speed up the process of the Imacs being ready to get tested.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"The company had great benefits and compensation. Most managers were eager to help with with job development if you were looking to exceed in your role. The company hosted different events to keep the employees happy and provided different service there on campus like a gym, doctors office with a pharmacy, dental office, and therapist. "

good,"Jobs at Apple Inc. are highly sought after positions, and for good reason. High paced and always changing. This job keeps you on your toes. You constantly have to learn. Interact with people and deal with ambiguity. I love the people I work with. I get first access to the latest technology and get to solve complex issue."
good,"Excellent company overall. No stability in schedule  no matter position or pay your schedule will change every 90 days. Great benefits, all equipment is maintained by the company."
good,Hands down management was amazing it didn't feel like a dictatorship. Rather then just give order management worked side by side with the workers.
good,"So far, the greatest team I have ever worked with. We are focused, efficient, and most importantly, caring for each other and customers and their needs. I have grown more here than anywhere else. I've learnt more about business and more about myself here too."
good,"A nice campus that has pretty much everything you need to get through your day!"
good,I love current position as a specialist. There's a large amount of clients that you help throughout the day. It can be very rewarding but also very tiring.
good,"It was an excellent opportunity and growing experience! The training was grueling and you really had to think outside of the box, but if you did not pass the tests you did not have a job. I had a work from home position and everything, including my training was done in the comfort of my own home office. They provided me with the equipment, I was responsible for the internet and phone. "
good,"A fantastic year working for Apple, huge amount of passion about the project and a great multinational team to be working in."

good,"Apple Inc, was an excellent place work for. And the challenges there were limited to how much you wanted to learn. If the supervisors and managers saw something in you. You'd would be approached and asked, how would you like a team of engineers and start on a special project. This was awesome and challenging, because you didn't get to pick who you wanted. But it made you see what the managers see in a person from the outside looking in and see the strengths and weaknesses in individuals and help them into a direction that will help them to do better at there jobs and build there confidence. it's a satisfying reward all by it's self."
good,"This is a ice home job. the company i went through makes sure you are equipped with a Mac computer, Mouse, Keyboard, headset and phone to take calls successfully at home. you must have your own internet and phone line. BasicTalk is the best at a very low price. The training was informative and it taught a lot of how to operate the computer quickly. learning all the features and short cuts that will be helpful that Mac offers, then how to navigate through Applepedia to get all your information to assist customers. The calls are pretty easy to handle and a test is done at the end to ensure knowledge of the material in applepedia. the task varied from processing an online order to assisting customers with accurate shipping information about their product. By you working at home, the managers have access to take over your entire screen and with the camera given to you to chat in class, is used to see you as well if needed during work, only when log into the VPN. They are always assuming that you are not working, even being aware of all the computer of phoe issues that come about. having to restart your computer cause something in applepedia isn't coming up, or having to end a call because you can hear the customer but they cant hear you you voice sounds muffled, or trying to change your mac mini out with another they set you and still getting paid as they said you should do. other than that, the job, the hours are 24hours, plenty of overtime available, great customers to deal with, managers just are really hard at trusting and fire quickly because of not being able to prove their"

good,"loved it the customers, the co workers, the ceo and management was awesome. only part-time had to work every day so really didn't have a social life. Coming in every day had huddle meeting before hitting floor about specials. Before the new apple product comes out big meeting that morning because you didn't know when it was going to happen the excitement of getting ready was awesome talking to customers while sale of the apple product I got to know the customers the personal life and then I knew what to sale them to help there every day living. if you closed the store at night you had to clean up mop and restock for the following day. Apple customers was awesome to provide for because the apple product is true to its word I loved it and to see your investments in apple stock was great only had to pay half of the amount of the price of the stock that the public was paying for. You was able to apply for other positions pay was great"

good,Rare is the opportunity that allows you to bring your knowledge to the table and express yourself-within reason. I spend most of my time talking about the products and helping people with issues. These are things that I would usually do if I am in a store as a customer. I like that this company encourages you to be personal with your customer. Every supervisor is always helpful and considerate. Great part-time job.
good,Learned how to lead a group of people where i put all my effort to attain the target.The management where so adhered to me and work pressure were not that high as we where doing all works properly.very friendly co workers who helps each other in work.The hardest part was that i need to control a group of 6 workers where if they didnt do the work properly i could hav got negative marks.
good,"- High achieving team members"
good,I love apple retail the people are fun and I love helping people but I feel that the corporate is so much better than retail. The hardest part of the job is repairing relationships with people that may become very heated but the satisfaction of making their day really makes it very rewarding.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"- busy working with team mates"
good,"Great place to work in the SLED space.  My day would be a mix of sales calls, setting meetings and doing onsite visit to account to plan projects.  I learned how the SLED space works regarding funding and what options school districts have with their MNO funds and using grants to aquire new technology.  My management was there on a weekly conference call for the team to help with any issues or needs that may need to be addressed.  My co-workers were always helpful and willing to help or answer any questions that I may have had during my time.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of funds available to the client and trying how to estabilish a yearly technology budget.  I enjoyed being around the client and establishing long term business relationships with them and earning their trust."
good,"Ho perfezionato la mia capacità persuasiva come venditore."

good,"Excellent place to work, Great staff, helping each other out.  Great management."
good,"Apple is a great company to work for. They truly seek to take care of their employees and show them the path to achieve what they want from their position. "
good,"•	Inspected items for any type of physical damage, checked if items were counterfeit."
good,Good job but management needs to recognize their best people instead of the people who regurgitate corporate sayings and words.
good,Working on both the floor and in the back as giving me a perspective of front of house work and inventory stock.
good,"I loved this job the most! I never worked for a call center before, the management made me feel welcomed and secure to ask for help."
good,"it was a great working experience, lots of fun & ne people every day"
good,"Energetic job with good benefits and environment. Hardest part of the job was to remain serious because the atmosphere was laid back but the customer service skills needed to be at its best, and im all about having good customer service skills."
good,Apple is a good company to work for. The customers are happy and the advisors such as my self is very experienced.
good,I worked every day and worked on customer service and helped people understand products and services. I leaned about the products and also about what my co workers did on the side - the hardest part of the job was learning about the things I didnt know but then the most enjoyable thing was finding out the solution and passing my knowledge on to the the customer.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"As a Creative at an Apple retail store, I am responsible for performing multiple training sessions through out the day.  In this setting, I work one on one with the customer, developing their skills in subjects from an introduction to their product, to Apple Professional Applications.  I also conduct workshops, which enables me to work with a group of people, creating curriculums on the spot.  Apple’s training, both in store, and out of store, has majorly developed my public speaking skills, and my ability to convey technical information in a more simplistic form.  Part of my job is not to just teach someone how to use an Apple product, but to be able to teach themselves."
good,Great Environment & great employees to work with. Enjoyed my time while there. Training is a tad bit hard but my best advice would be to pay close attention.
good,If you love fixing apple products and have a niche for explaining to people how to get their equipment working from over the phone this is a great job for you.
good,LOVE THE COMPANY but when your in retail you have a little more issues than company ties
good,"I enjoyed each and every day that I was employed with Apple Computers. Each day was different which made it exciting. I learned so much about the Brains of a computer, and how customizing them is differently essential. Management was great, the classes, the teachers, made learning fun and enjoyable. All of my co-workers were there to help every step of the way, which made my learning easy. The hardest part of my job was leaving, the company moved and distance was further than I was willing to travel. I most enjoyed receiving calls from clients that wanted items that I hadn't had the pleasure of ordering or wasn't sure of, this broaden my knowledge."
good,"Every day at Apple is new and exciting. Apple chooses some of the most unique and outgoing people to work there which creates a strong positive environment. The knowledge gained from employees and customers it outstanding. I have learned how to interact with all types of people and I have put in the position where I had to give negative feedback which was always a challenge for me. Apple is not just about the iPhone or the iPad, it's about providing customers with the greatest retail experience. Apple customers know what they want, its the relationship they build at Apple which makes the product even better."
good,"Apple was a nice place to work most of the time, there were many perks and the wages were good. A lot of responsibility and independence is given to testers which allows you to work efficiently and make deadlines. The down side is that you can not have a life outside of work. If it requires many days of working with only breaks for sleeping and eating to finish a product, then that is what you do. Fortunately this was not every quarter, but it can have a  negative effect on your physical and mental health."

good,"Daily working with friendly co-worker. Quite environment and working at your past. "

good,"If you like working from home, then this could be just the job for you!"
good,I did not like how the scheduling worked but loved my coworkers and the work place environment and culture
good,Typical call center metrics were off balance in some areas.
good,Apple is a retail environment where one can get to know customers and probe to discover and fulfill the customer's needs. One is encouraged to be yourself and friendly but at the same time to be diligent in exploring our customers needs so we may best satisfy those needs with the incredible products we had to offer. In short we gave customers an experience that was transformational.
good,"Apple is a great company. In this position I ran my own business within a reseller environment. I have 60 employees who I influence & coach for top down selling within multiple departments. I ensure the highest level of customer service and how to close the sale. I am responsible for analyzing and reporting business results and trends, merchandising over all operations of the Apple Shop. I created and implemented persuasive account strategies by understanding people. I have been given free rein in how I choose to run my business and develop the team. Have been allowed to be as creative and innovative as I want with in reason. I truly like working for Apple but the hardest part of this job is the work life balance. The most enjoyable part of this job my co workers at Apple as well as the Partner and of course the customers."

good,"Sincere culture, rich history, brighter future..."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

Apple also focuses primarily on the customer. Make sure you treat the customer how you would want to be treated. Create a fun open environment where you come to learn and share your own experiences."
good,A typical day at Apple sometime makes me forget that I am working. I love meeting new people and learning/teaching new things.
good,"Apple puts a lot of focus and effort into employee morale. They nurture a culture of constructive feedback. They are excellent recruiters. The people you work with are friendly, fun, and hard-working. There is never a feeling that you are picking up after somebody else. Leadership is open and available at any time. The benefits are second-to-none. Great medical/dental, matched 401k, and stock options!"
good,One of the best environments for a productive team! Management looks for top talent.
good,"Very great company to work for, with good pay and benefits. I worked with fun, enthusiastic and smart individuals. Everyday I learned something new about the current and upcoming technology, therefore I was constantly learning. Also completed Apple's Management training and was then in charge of team building, coaching and hiring events. the only challenge I had as an Apple employee, was the harsh holiday and special release work hours."
good,"A typical day consisted of reviewing store news, touching base on areas of improvement, and acknowledging successes."

good,"Never have I worked with a group of people who care so much about not only their jobs, but about each other and the betterment of the company. Apple is a phenomenal place to work with greeeat benefits and such a casual environment, you can just be yourself! Not to mention you are a part of the best company to work for. They really value their employees."
good,Working for Apple has you focused on your individual development. They focus on making you the best in the industry. I find that if you dont focus on your development you will regret it later on.
good,Meet and review daily objectives with 4 department heads.
good,"I learned a great deal from Apple about how to maintain a high level of unit accuracy and low shrink. I began as a team of one and ended leading a team of ten. A typical day at Apple retail is receiving of shipments and receive them into SAP. There are always counts going on, company initiated and started by ourselves. Built relationships with other teams in the store to build inventory awareness. The most enjoyable part of the job is how we are always on the cutting edge of technology and always have answers."
good,This company was fast paced and fun to work. The people were awesome and they were always having a great time between phone calls.
good,"Great place to work! Loved the location, loved working for the company and enjoyed my time there."
good,"As a Genius, YES, you work for Apple. The greatest company in the world! I was proud to wear the title! I worked for STEVE JOBS! But... I worked in a mall, wore a ""uniform'' and a name tag. I learned more about computers than I ever did with my college degree and I am completely in debt to the training of Apple. Apple Retail, however, is god awful for someone who wants to advance into a higher paying and more prestigious career. Managers do not encourage going into corporate, nor do they ever promote or assist you in advancing beyond a genius/manager."
good,Apple was an employee centric place to work what valued each person who was on their payroll. It set me up for success not only at the retail job but I was able to advance to a corporate internship that helped me land a job outside of the company.
good,"Apple is a good place to work with great perks, but for the amount of money they make, their employees are under paid unless you are a genius or manager."
good,"Great cultures, friendly co-workers and managers, great potential opportunities for internal transfer positions worldwide if you’re qualified, great benefits and focus on people"

good,"The Apple Store is a very fast paced environment, but it's also extremely exciting."
good,"For a retail job, this is one of the best out there. The pay is very competitive and the benefits are great. A lot can be expected of you and you will frequently feel drained. Meet the metrics and you will have no issue being kept on and even being promoted."
good,"It was a fun experience working at Apple, quit the job due to country preferences. The environment is pretty relaxed, smart intuitive and helpful colleagues."
good,"Pros: excellent benefits, work from home, good discounts, shift differential, split shift options, 8x5, 10 hour shifts, "
good,I felt that it was a great place to work but there are its challenges as well. It is very easy to adapt to the culture. Please communicate as much as you can with peers and management. That would be the best advice I can give.
good,Fast paced and lots to learn but lots of support from other staff and mgmt.  Training is excellent and company culture is collaborative.  Highly recommend
good,Overall it was a great place to work with wonderful compensation packages. There is an abundance of opportunities to work on exciting projects and help shape the latest greatest products. The biggest drawbacks would be the work life balance.
good,"Truly the best job experiences Ive ever had. Definitely proud to be apart of a company that caters to bettering the world and inspiring innovation."
good,Everything you would expect from working at Apple is exactly what it is. Highly competitive in getting promoted but the cream always rises to the top. Work hard and you will advance.
good,"Good benefits, reasonable pay, good working environment."
good,"I learn something every day at Apple. It's a great place to work if you like dealing with people, learning about tech and can cope with large crowds of people and lots of noise. Workplace culture is the best. We all help each other. Hardest part of the job for me is learning to do phone contracts for iPhone devices. Most enjoyable is meeting our customers."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

good,"Apple was a good job its been a few years since I worked for them,I moved to the construction life,but I was there head porter for some years a very nice and clean place to work cause of me lol"
good,"I was employed through a third party hiring agency, but as Apple Care Associate, I enjoyed being apart of a collective mind of agents with one goal in mind, assisting customers with their challenges and coming to a resolution. It takes some adjustments to adapt to the concept but Apple provided all the tools needed to be successful."
good,"Mi experiencia en Apple fue estupenda. No puedo mas que recomendar esta empresa por su gran profesionalidad, ambiente laboral y magnificas condiciones contractuales."
good,"Great management, company culture, and collaborative workplace. They also provide many leadership development programs throughout my experience at Apple."
good,If you’re in a store that has 200+ employees there is little room for movement. 100 employees or less your chances are much better because the management to employee ratio is better.
good,"Loved Apple Retail. I was recruited out to a higher paying job, otherwise I don't know if I would have ever left. I think it is the best place for a college student to work because you learn incredible people skills and tech skills really fast."
good,I had a great time working for Apple. The management was amazing and I have great coworkers. The pay was good and as well as the benefits. I created a lot of great memories.
good,My job was amazing and I worked with some of the most amazing and talented people. The ability to meet so many people from so many different backgrounds was great and made the job so much better. The fast-paced environment made the day go by quickly and the efforts of everyone on your team made you feel like you were never handling something on your own.
good,"It's amazing to work for them, the team members are all very sharp and resilient when it comes to pursing new challenges. Team members are willing to help each other out instantly with customer or IT system problems via phone call."
good,"I enjoyed the freedom of working from home. However, it does take discipline and focus to meet your metrics set by team leaders. Management is so supportive and there to help whenever I need them."
good,"I had a great time ar Apple and made some lifetime friends there. People are very talented and also generally very cool and collaborative also. There is no sink-or-swim culture there. People generally help each other, especially since it is a no-commission environment."
good,"I had an awesome time being an At-Home Mac+ Advisor for Apple. I worked there for the better part of my college years, and loved most of my time there. Coworkers were great, even if we were just virtual coworkers, and the culture and environment were always friendly and helpful. I had some issues with bad management, but it mostly came down to management style."
good,"Amazing company to work for! Great location, benefits and salary. The work is high volume/demand, but worth the experience and career growth. Recruiter interview was mild to difficult, and technical."
good,Apple is a fast moving place to work . A typical day with an hour of time to catch up on communication like email. Everyone is paid hourly except the Store leader.  No one can view company information unless you are in the store.There is a huge leader presence to support a very large team. The mission is to bring technology to meet humanity to improve the lives of many. The hardest part of the job is keeping on top of all the changes. The most enjoyable part is woking with a great team and working with customers.
good,I enjoyed working for apple. It was a good work environment and there was a steady work/ life balance. My managers were helpful and they rarely left me to figure things out on my own
good,Apple was a company that treated its employees like a family. The training was paid and they have paid vacations after a year. the hardest part of this job was the training exams. Management taught me how to take initiative and helped me develop my leadership skills.
good,The typical work i have  done in my company was mentoring to the new employes  about the work what they have to done.i learned so much from the company towards the work how much quality we have to give to the client.The management  was so good towards our work and dedication.workplace culture was so good with my team members. every day we have 10 minutes fun session to reduce the stress of our work.coming to hardest part of the work was doing all steps at a time like doing production and again i have to do quality also etc.enjoyable part of our work was in a some project  the work will be done in a 2hours.
good,"Solid management team and team members, understand the importance of details and clear communications.  Members I work with very good out communicating opportunities and making sure the group as a whole was focused on the key deliverables"
good,Management has to be more open to “others! “ Co workers speak in their language to management and speaking of me and I understood. It was swept under the rug
good,Leadership at Apple is top notch. There isn’t a sense that being junior position doesn’t mean you don’t have a say. There is room for employees to grow if you take the Apple specialist course.
good,They do there best to help you advance within the company. Benefits package is great. Pay could be a bit more but its still very competitive. In my current position I get to work from home which is a great benefit to me personally.
good,"Apple was a great place to work. The only reason that I could not continue to work there was because they needed me to work at night from home, and have a quite space with i could not do because of my kids"
good,"Easiest the best Retailer to work for. They have fair pay, awesome benefits and perks. Apple is one of the companies taking over the world and its a good thing to be part of it."
good,"Though the company is amazing because of its innovation and products, the teams and culture behind its people is what makes it all worth it. You will be challenged to do your life's best work and it will show in the work you do and the relationships you cultivate with your team."

good,"I got a great experiences working with Apple Products, the environment was so friendly. was working comfortable. learnt new things, over all it was a good experiences."
good,It is a great experience working for Apple overall. The culture and environment is meant for you to thrive and be successful in your job role. The life and job balance is the main part that began to become more intolerable over time. Having to always work a weekend day and shift bids rotating causing a inconsistent schedule was draining. That is my only complaint or dislike for the job it self.
good,"AppleCare was great, remote work is not for everyone but Apple is a great company to work for. I truly enjoyed my time in the AppleCare college program"
good,Loved working here would love to work here again I just had some health issues reasons why I couldn’t work for them any longer. Definely will try to get back on
good,"Good place to work and can learn many new things and helps to gain knowledge and new technologies, Work culture great and helps to balance personal and professional life,"
good,"It's Apple. You're going to be selling products, but for a company where the product is worth selling. No commission, so you sell purely because you want to, and not for an incentive. Makes it a lot easier to be honest with people, and they appreciate that."
good,Management was great and awesome workplace culture. A typical day at work includes working with customers to solve their iOS related issues. The most enjoyable part about the job was working with people.
good,The work from home program was nice and I recommend it to anyone looking for this kind of environment. Time away was nice when the call volume was low allowing you to use some PTO to enjoy your day.
good,Great company to work for. Management is wonderful to employees. They make sure they provide home/work blance in your life.they make sure you receive the time off the floor traning to help you too achieve your goal to advance to another position within store.
good,The company demands 200% of you and gives you 300% back. You will build a new family and friends for life.  Work is stressful and very demanding but all the benefits that are given really show you how much the company cares for its employees.
good,Excelente experiência com possibilidades de crescimento !
good,"They dont give you a lot of info on why youre doing the things you do, but overall fun nice and welcoming place to be, plus good pay. Staff is a little weird, but otherwise very good place to be."
good,"Miss it everyday, unfortunately it was hard for me to have a FT back then, had amazing friends/colleagues, did lot of fun activities outside work... can’t wait for them to open one where I live now!"
good,The managers allow me to grow and learn from interactions. I have grown so much than when I started. The managers are all so involved in the evolution of their employees professional image.
good,Great place to call home. Working remotely is not always the best but it definitely cuts down on travel and day are costs. Love working for Apple! This type of job is not for everyone
good,It’s a good place to work if you get hired permanently because through the agency you don’t get paid as much which is why I had to find a higher paying job.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience for me, a typical day meant communicating with a lot of customers for a range of reasons; whether it's interest in a product or someone just curious about the store and wanting to learn more. "
good,"Great place to work while you go to school or even try to pursue a career there(though unlikely). Lots of great benefits are offered to you such as healthcare, fitness, school reimbursement, stocks, etc. You will learn valuable professional skills there if you really take it seriously. "
good,Apple is a good task doer place to be. If someone likes to be a creature of habit. Apple retail is the place to be that of which will take you if you also have a very drawing positive personality

good,"Apple was an amazing place to work. They sincerely are concerned with work/life balance."
good,"The culture at apple was great, the staff really cared about customers and the managers were some the best I've ever worked with. "
good,"One of my favorite places to work hands down. I thank Apple for all of my life long friendships, experiences, and opportunities to grow personally and professionally."
good,"Working at Apple was great.  The culture was amazing and working remote was comfortable. There are many opportunities to try new things, but the scheduling was not ideal for a single parent with a small child.  But on the opposite side, they allowed me fully paid time off to take care of a sick parent for 6 weeks - Stress-free!  There's not much I would say bad about working there.  It just didn't fit my lifestyle at that time."
good,I am not a very tech literate person but apple trains their students very well. Throughout all of my experience my managers and lecturers were very kind and super fun to work with.
good,I enjoyed my time with Apple. I just wanted a change of pace. Which I received. I would love to work for them again if the opportunity was presented. Especially the benefits. The healthcare was amazing.
good,"Apple is an amazing company. You learn so much about yourself and others. You grow as an individual and obtain the best skills, like empathy for example. At the end of the day it is retail, but with the greener side of the scale. Hope to see you join the ""Big Apple"" team."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple is a great company to work for. They don't begin with the highest pay, and they often leave out details regarding future expectations, but they have a seemingly good culture and promotions are highly likely."
good,"Working at Apple, you receive a ton of support from a large team.  If you want to advance within your role or to another role, there are many options given to employees.  Apple resources for everything and everyone."
good,c'est une entreprise très avant-gardiste qui inculque des valeurs profondes à ses collaborateurs
good,Apple was definitely an immersive experience. Apple is a company that is truly dedicated to it's clients as well as employees. The hardest part of working with Apple is the quick pace environment. Apple never slows down. The most enjoyable part of apple is the diversity of it's employees.
good,"start the day with a daily group meeting, hit the sales floor and start the day. depending where scheduled, a day could look like sales or back stock."
good,"I worked for Apple while in school and it was great! Through the College Technical Advisor program you can choose your hours and it includes all full time benefits (401K, Stocks, Tuition Reimbursement, Healthcare, etc. ) It was a great opportunity that helped advance my communication skills Due to working with many people with different backgrounds/personalities. This is a skill I can use in any other job/position moving forward."
good,"I love working for the company. Doesn’t really feel like a work at all. Working with virtual teams in retail, and a team of my own. Helping people in their daily lives while providing company culture."
good,"fun and the people I worked with were the best, I've worked at many jobs and this one was the best which made it difficult to leave. but the exigence was worth it"
good,Overall the benefits far outweigh and negatives. The culture is what you make it. The more you put in the more you get out. The culture can be a little be goal oriented and metric-focused in a way that can be frustrating.
good,"full of talents and passionate colleagues, work-life balance is great, a place to show your skills and full of competence. sometimes need to meet a tight deadline."
good,"Apple was an amazing experience,  I learned so much in the time I worked for them.  The knowledge I gained from apple helped boost my resume and made more more desirable for other employers."
good,"My office was in Austin, TX which is filled with a lot of young people. Most of my coworkers were around 25 years old and that played into job satisfaction. The job was great, I didn't have any complaints, and it was easy to get promoted but you have to work for it which was a foreign concept to a lot of my coworkers. Overall though, if you are smart and willing to work, you'll go far with Apple."
good,"Great company with some challenges, but shows that they care for its people and tries to promote internal advancement."
good,"Apple AHA is good for people looking for part time work. Good pay, good benefits and nice management. A typical day at work includes answering calls and assisting customers with technical issues."
good,"I was given a sizeable budget to work independtly on a few projects with high degree of autonomy. Received valuable input from my manager in a timely manner, who only gave high-level guidance and zero micromanagement."
good,"I enjoy this tech support position."
good,"Enjoyed working at apple for 4 years, fun job great perks just a shame about management. Would recommend anyone to work at Apple, but be prepared to grovel if you want a career."

good,Workplace culture is great. People become great friends with each other very easily. The job is usually quite fast-paced but will have slow moments. The job is very engaging with the customers as you are required to provide the best service possible.
good,Apple is a fast paced and loud environment. The system is always changing and requires you to adapt. It is a great place to work if you are up to the challenge
good,Apple is one of the best organization I ever worked in my career. Great experience and fun from the team. Colleagues are very friendly and can able to complete our works on time due to great team work.
good,Apple was one of the best jobs I ever had. Until they brought in a new manager that didn't know anything about tech support. Great benefits. Good overtime.
good,Apple Inc. treated me with respect and dignity the 4 1/2 years I spent with them. I was able to travel across three states while employed with the company. They consistently introduced new ways to create stronger interpersonal connections with co workers and customers alike.
good,Everyone is very supportive! Place has a great culture and you get to meet a variety of customers. Management is very accommodating during busy times of the year. Employees are treated well including pay and benefits!
good,"Great company to work for. Great environment of people genuinely wanting to better themselves. However, managers there truely to need to care about their people and to invest in them not the job."
good,"A great place work"
good,A great place to work that isn't cutthroat. They strive on hearing feedback from any individual no matter your title. The difficult part I would say is dealing with unruly customers but that is with almost every retail job. The benefits are great but the pay for a part time / full time specialist are not going to sustain you in a place like NY.
good,Everyone was great at working together as a team. The management and training we’re top notch. I really enjoyed working at Apple. I would recommend it to anyone.
good,"It was amazing to work on Apple Project under Infosys Ltd. Its a good platform to learn the basic work culture that adds up balances of life too. Customers were friendly and interactive. Learned how to properly manage work flow system and to develop further of my skills. "
good,"Great company culture with opportunities to develop and grow in a sales, business, operations, education, or technical driven environment. The benefits are unmatched for the retail level, and the work environment gives off more than just being a retail store. It's a hub of smart and like minded individuals that cooperate and collaborate to give a much smoother customer and peer to peer interaction."
good,"I love the atmosphere in this company, especially with the support from the coworkers and the management. They were very supportive in our professional development. "
good,"At Apple, you are given opportunities to learn and grow. You are constantly pushed to be your best by leaders and coworkers alike. Every working day is different from the last, with new experiences, customers, needs, and struggles. Everyone will always have your back and look out for you to make sure that you succeed and are happy with the work that you put in."
good,"The At-Home positions are now only for college students, but it was very nice schedule.  Pay and benifits were awesome, I wouldn't have left if I could have kept up my internet speed that was required, when I relocated to assist my family."
good,"I loved my time at Apple. I learned a lot about the products, enjoyed my co-workers as all who were hired were excellent individuals, and felt like I was taken care of."

good,"Within the Apple ecosystem one will find that it’s challenges, incentives and opportunities will summon skills and assist in personal development unlike any place else."
good,It’s a fun work place to work at downside is once you hit a point it’s hard to further you carreer. When the day starts we are non stop go. We see close to about 700+ people daily and as a tech I see close to 30 people a day. Basically we figure out what the problem is and then we try and resolve the issues within a certain time.
good,Everyone supported each other to make sure we were all successful. Everyone was friendly. The staff was understanding and made going to work exciting and fun each and every day.

good,"The best job that i've ever had!!  I left Apple to pursue a full-time position, but I wish that I had kept it as a part-time job.  The culture was magnetic and the managers empowered workers to be better individuals before being better workers."
good,"I still work for Apple as an At Home Advisor.  The work can be tough and challenging, but the job is perfect for someone who can work from home. Working from home is not easy, as the only interaction you have with people is over the phone."
good,"It was great working at apple. People are great, atmosphere nice, and food was great too. I don't know if this is going to help anyone's opinion, so I'll finish up here."
good,"By far one of the best companies. Depending on the store of course, will depend your advancement as management will vary. But everyone is great for the most part, it’s a great job to start off with. Great experiences, great way of training you. Definitely not a place I would have ever stayed long term."
good,"The Apple store was one of the best places to work, as you got to be part of something big. The products are top notch, and the people are all very cool and fun. There is no pressure to be something you are not, and individuality is celebrated, not discouraged."
good,"Challenging work. Plenty of opportunities to apply accumulated knowledge and experience."
good,"Very challenging environment being in the Regent st. store as it is the busiest store in EU."
good,"Apple is an awesome company to work for but it can depend on the department. Those following Apple's culture are amazing, those that are more from acquisitions haven't fully embraced the culture. Overall the company is pushing to make a great experience for it's customers and isn't worried about whether or not X feature will sell more iPhones. It's all about making it better for the consumer."
good,Your experience working for Apple retail will directly relate to the store you work at. For example my store is always busy and all of my coworkers work hard which makes it less stressful. Employees at other stores that are less busy are typically lazier and less fun to be around.
good,"If you're interested in Apple products or supporting great customers and colleagues, then you should work at Apple."
good,"I loved working for Apple. I found that they helped drive personal development, good communication within the team, and a bit of healthy competition. It was a really fun environment. You work with customers throughout the day - many of which don't understand the products very well or are pretty frustrated. The most important thing is that you enjoy relating to people, helping them find solutions, making technology relatable for them and assisting their understanding of their issues. The role involves a lot of patience and a great attitude. I loved the team and the behind the scenes culture. I made a lot of great friends working there who I'm still in touch with years after being in the role. The best part about the job is the people and the brand. Apple is an amazing brand and no matter where in the world I travel to I now feel at home at the Apple  retail store."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Great work place, My managers were extremely fun and sometimes allowed me to take hour lunches if necessary. Wasn't a complicated process to ask for overtime, I can just text my manager and ask to come in. Sometimes overtime was mandatory if a new iphone or iphone software was coming out. It's easy to rack up paid time off, especially if you enjoyed doing overtime and is always at work"
good,"I was actually advanced in different hiring processes because of my proven past and effort. I helped with Today at Apple art sessions and also with Summer Camp. Usually, you must wait six months before consideration of advancement. I was interviewed to be a teacher in the creative department to lead more Today at Apple events. I had to leave due to it being part time but loved the job."

good,"Great place to work.  Many perks.  I really enjoyed working for this company.  Depends what department you are working for, some departments could be laid back while few might have to meet certain deadlines.  Overall, this company was fun, relaxing, enjoyable & generous with your pay & benefits."
good,"It's a busy but fun place to be. Everybody is very friendly, willing to educate, very patient with new employees and questions. The customers can be a little ridiculous but for the most part it's fun just to see new technology."

good,"At home position via Kelly Services, sent computer and peripherals directly to my home. Virtual training, difficult to navigate between Kelly & Apple."
good,"Fun, a lot of on the job learning. Many opportunities to learn, help, and grow. Loved getting free software and nice discounts. Most people working here were hired for their love of bringing people together through technology."
good,Apple took great care of their employees. They made sure we were trained and had ample knowledge of the product. The only down side of the job was the management turn over at the time I was there.
good,"Great company, Very fast paced! Things change very quickly so you will have to be on your toes! I would not leave, but just for me, I'm looking for a career change."
good,I spent 4 1/2 years at Apple.  It was the most memorable time of my life.  I made wonderful peers and friends.  I learned what a community was supposed to be.  I learned what loving yourself and your work means.
good,"•	Led team of mechanical engineers to develop assembly of Titanium powerbook. Named on patent."
good,"Very rewarding experience. Opportunities to grow in role, work on special projects, and make a difference. Good team work. High pressure and competetive"
good,"A big misconception is that working here will give you a leg up in getting into a corporate role. This is only possible if you have worked here for over a year, and you are a full time employee. At that point store leader must endorse you for a career experience (internal internship) in which you receive a stipend to work in Cupertino. Most career experience candidates aren't even considered if they are good enough to be endorsed, and those who do have the experience *rarely* get a job there afterwards."
good,"I loved my Job with this company , they love to support your growth"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "

good,"Great team of people to work with, always enthusiastic about helping each other. People are hired based on the way they connect with others and find common ground, therefore, everyone hired is friendly and inviting."
good,"I worked at Apple for a year and a half. Health issues were the only reason I left. I wish I could go back there actually. I worked in the Genius Bar for over a year and it was tough. It really took a toll on me. Mostly from the angry and demanding customers, nothing to do with my peers or the company. I loved selling though. It was really more conversation than selling. Best company in the world."
good,Ive been a contracted employee at Apple for nine months and Id rather not leave when my contract expires. The laid back work environment is awesome. This company is truly an innovator in a aspects from product to customer service and employee relations.
good,You’re gonna love it. I highly recommend the company. They have a unique way of helping you advance in life and in your chosen career regardless of the company’s products.
good,"Friendly employees and managers, had my own hours, had other colleges on the room, free snacks, work was repetitive but fun to do, no timing, no free lunch but free transportation, no benefits."
good,Working at Apple was a lot fun.  It's a great environment with a log of fun people.  The only real negative was being subject to a retail schedule.  But other than that it was great.
good,A great place to work. I only left there to pursue opportunities elsewhere. I felt my work had meaning and I was amply compensated for it. The people were smart and fun and management was inspiring.
good,Working for Apple Inc. is an incredibly rewarding job. You make good contacts with coworkers as well as grow competition. The job is highly fast paced and are required to multitask to a certain degree.

good,"Amazing company to work for, you are always learning as technology changes, Can be stressful at times with the amount of customers that want help and have questions,  Not enough in store support for technical issues, overall awesome experience."
good,"I have been trained and developed to be an engineering supervisor. Thanks to this systematic career development, I have been benefited a lot from the professionalism.  "
good,My primary focus during my tenure at Apple as a creative was the training of customers and employees on new apple products. Providing adaptive training methodologies to enhance the variety of different learning styles. Provided instruction and training on new mobile applications and software. Directed on going workshops and group trainings.
good,"Collaborative and interesting workplace, and comfortable working hours three days a week. I enjoyed working as an authorized Apple re-seller through the Apple agency in Dubai, The IML Group."
good,Always looking out for what is best for the customer. Reasonable rules and gudelines but also flexible enough to address every customer as an individual.
good,"If you like to work in a cubicle on the phones all day, this job is for you. I didnt mind it. Managers dont hover over your shoulder constantly. You can pretty much chill at apple (not slack) and it makes the job a heck of a lot eaasier to do. Just work hard and enjoy yourself."
good,"Highly recommend working for this company. It is a cut above the rest. The culture and environment are friendly and very collaborative. Best job I have worked at. Not without its faults, but they can be overseen."
good,"A great place to work and improve your skills as an employee and as a person as a whole. I love the family culture and environment around Apple. They teach you to deal with ambiguity, ask the right questions, and listen whole-heartedly to those around you. You learn to work with a very diverse team, and help build each other up so that we can all benefit and grow together."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Great place This job, if taken seriously, was the best job I have ever had. The discounts were awesome, my co-workers were equally as awesome. My manager took the time to know what my goals were and gave opportunities for those goals to grow."
good,"Good team work, fun work environment with great culture.  Daily task was to manage project for Apple Documentation Engineering team. Working with marketing manager, designers, writers, and OS for product Help Documentation online and print."
good,"Ive worked at two different stores. Definitely  a different type of retail experiences, products sell themselves so no pressure to meet a quota or be top seller. Customers can be difficult at times but management and your team general has your back. Would always come back but its time for a change."
good,Melhor espirito de equipe com qual ja trabalhei nos últimos anos!!
good,Apple is an amazing company to work for.  Apple hires the best.  The culture is wonderful. Management encourages you to be your best.  A great place to work.
good,"This was a fun place to work at, it was hard if you have children and work from home. Everyone is easy going and you get the chance to move to other departments in your role and be cross trained in all products of Apple."
good,"This job is the creme de la creme for retail jobs. Discounts on nearly everything, the job culture and the people you work with are fantastic. One of the best places I've worked at."
good,"The Job is amazing. No micro-managing, you're given excellent training so you'll be more than prepared to take chats. Of course you also get you're paid time off."
good,"I worked at vmc under volt getting calls for apple support, it was a great environment that was good for those who are social and to those who keep to themselves, there was hardly any problems, due to the hands off approach you get once you've mastered the skills needed for this job."
good,Life work balance is 100% in place at Apple Business. The teams are highly motivated and Management is always open to receive feedback. The Amsterdam Business team is in my opinion one of the strongest teams in EMEA and I'm really proud to led this team of taletend people. I can recommend everybody to work at Apple.
good,"A great company to work for.  It was like working with a second family.  I wish there was more opportunity for advancement within management roles.  I would work there again, had to relocate with no positions available."
good,"Working at Apple Retail had it's benefits. It was a very intense work place, in the sense that there was always something to do, new day-to-day work regimen, always learning something new. Many different demographics as per customers and employees alike. You meet many different types of people, learn a lot about technology, and have resources provided to expand on your knowledge of the brand and products."
good,"Great retail company to work for with great starting pay. Hard to advance in the company. They usually hire outside managers from other companies, instead of promoting within. Work life balance is hard because the schedule is so random, no set hours and required to work weekends. Great company culture."
good,"A great work environment and truly a company that does the right thing. Everyone is working hard and sometimes can be spread thin, yet it allows everyone to perform great work. Change happens often, but it's usually at the best interest of the organization. I learned a lot about brand, customer experience, and overall management ideals, yet often feel I have little opportunity to express them."
good,This company is amazing place to work. There are constant opportunities to improve oneself and it is an incredibly fun place to work. Always a fun day at the office!
good,"Amazing company to work for, you see a diverse group of people everyday with staff and customers. Management is understanding and flexible but the job is demanding and fast paced."
good,great company I love it here. The product is fantastic the people are nice and  the ability to help people is what matters most. Apple really makes things that make peoples lives better
good,"The people you work with are the best part about working at Apple. The retail schedule is what it is but the benefits are amazing. The managers are generally great people who care about your development and want you to succeed, if that's what you want."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Typical day involved receiving shipments of stock, managing inventory, performing basic hardware installations, data transfers, setting up new computers for customers and manning the Point of Sale.  "
good,Apple was great. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Fair hours and compensation. Interview process may prove difficult for some as when i was hired they conducted group interviews. environment is also pretty competitive.
good," thinks bigger aiming to leave the world a better place above and beyond the best products on the planet. Incredibly fast paced environment, learning agility is a requirement."
good,Apple is a great place to work. The culture is amazing and you get to work with some really talented people who will continually push you to improve. The campus is also awesome
good,I work from home as a tech support supervisor. I manage my self and work well with other. I take call and fix the customer and their tech issue with there product. The hardest part of my job is not having a set schedule. Every 3 months my schedule changes and it make it a little difficult to manage my home life. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work from home and helping others solve their problems.
good,"Great benefits"
good,Here  i have to sales all the product of Apple and i gain kind of knowledge which i never ever seen in other brand. I always want to be a part of Apple and i loving it to work with him.
good,Great pay and benefits for a retail job. Working with management to plan your future with the company is vital. Sell the biggest products in the world.
good,"Great place to work, quarterly shift bids got to be a pain when trying to maintain a consistent work life balance but overall great company. Manager's work with you, support is always available."
good,"There are tons of perks for working at Apple, but at the time a large portion of them could only be used by on site employees. That meant that if you decided to work from home, you missed out on a lot of social opportunities for networking. "
good,A great experience to learn and be in the actual center of the high tech world.  A look into the future of technology.  Team becomes family.  Incredible benefits and a trend setter in the Valley for taking care of their employees.
good,"Apple Canada Inc., teaches you more than just the job aspect. It sets you up with life skills through their industry-leading training and surrounding you with the necessary work environment to achieve your goals. "
good,Great company with lots and lots of innovation. You work with some of the brightest minds in the world. Excellent company. You will always be amazed at what happens at Apple.
good,Learned valuable skills! Great workplace environment. Honed my problem solving skills and increased my knowledge in technology and Apple devices. Great benefits for retail employees!
good,"Fantastic if you're working part time. The people are all pretty much wonderful and the company shows that it cares for you. The hours are long but the amount of benefits and chances to progress are great. In order to progress theatre is a little bit of a 'you must suck up to managers' vibe but for me it was just a job so I wasn't concerned. Overall, a great great place to work."
good,"Apple genuinely is an awesome company to work for. It has a great group of people with diverse backgrounds so you're able to learn a lot about different aspects of life, but you're also able to immerse yourself in the customer base as well. Some of the most rewarding conversations I had have been at Apple. Only con is that advancement in the company is typically slow, not necessarily hard, and when you have a lot of goals and financial needs outside of the company, it can be hard to stay no matter how great the company is."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"be ready to help a large amount of customers on a daily basis, and even multiple customers at one time. Long hours but rewarding and gratification of helping others. Management is encouraging and other coworkers are very fun and supportive."
good,"Working at one of the most recognized brand names of the world gave me a sense of pride that shown through my daily processes.  The culture and co workers made it more exciting on a daily basis.  If my hours worked with my schedule I wouldn't of left.  Working for Apple was a blessing, excellent place to work at!"
good,"I loved Apple. I got a lot of great benefits and I learned a lot! But remember, its still RETAIL! At the end of the day don't expect weekends off or even alternating weekends. In the retail world, that does not exist!"
good,"I started five years ago at Apple as a part time sales specialist.  My day to day consists of talking to people and getting to know people.  The culture is great and you feel like the people around you care for you.  I went further into the technical side of Apple by going in to the family room.  I started by talking to people about their issues with their iOS devices.  I switch markets when I moved to Colorado Springs, CO.  The culture changes from different markets primarily due to store volume.  The small the store the closer you feel to the people you work with.  The larger the more overwhelming in can be.  I moved back to Austin, TX and became a genius.  The new store I'm in is different than Colorado because its more volume but we still kept our culture.  It gets hard dealing with multiple personalities of customers and some entitlement but management helps you with your day to day.  My co workers keep me sane and really make my day.  All of the benefits we have, ranging from health to simple discounts really make it worth wild.  The pay is great and you feel good when you receive your check and go out with the people you work with.  Overall I would give Apple a big up because it keeps you interested and opportunities are always there.  I feel like the only draw is the larger the company gets the inevitable happens, it will feel like big box retail.  Get to know your people and you will always enjoy what you do. Because I will say Apple hires a type and thats what keeps the company strong."
good,"The upper management is great, and they were always looking out for your best interest.  Great environment to work in!  Very fast pace, but they give you all the tools you need to succeed.  would highly recommend!"
good,"I loved my time at Apple and remember the people I worked with fondly. The company is filled with smart, energetic professionals that work very hard to provide superior products and customer service. It was truly a pleasure to work at Apple for many years."
good,It's great to work in an retail environment where you feel important. Management takes an active interest in your development and you have direct access to resources in corporate. The culture is very open and accepting especially to diversity. The hardest part is standing for long periods of time and working weekends. The most rewarding aspect is helping people and seeing the excitement on their faces.
good,"Top notch place to work at home or in office. Great benefits, diverse work group/culture, and management really listens and cares.                   ."
good,"Apple has never got a dull day. On a typical day, you have a quick 5-10 minute meeting with management and your day has some form of structure. Colleagues and staff are very encouraging and very supportive and you never feel intimidated to ask questions."
good,"Top Company with hunger to innovate and push boundaries, Fun Filled place to work, Work is simple focused on the Goal and its a company which brings the best in person."
good,"Best Job I ever had. I love the place, people and company, but hated the pay. I would go back if there were better opportunities for growth and work/life balance."
good,The Apple store is fast pace and extremely busy from open to close. Which is an environment I like because the time flies by much quicker. The people I get to meet is also a benefit because I get to learn from everyone.
good,You get to work with a large team of fun and talented people. Be prepared to work hard as the environment is fast paced and very demanding. It's not for the faint of heart.
good,Working for apple is one of the most fun and challenging jobs that you will ever have. It is an experience of a lifetime and you will not regret accepting the position. The only thing that would make it better is working there for longer
good,"This is a great job if you can balance work/relaxation in the same space. I didn't like it because I worked out of my bedroom and it felt like I was at work 24/7. They also weren't very flexible around school, which is the reason I had to leave."
good,"I enjoyed the peers, perks and atmosphere at Apple, 1st class. Just not their temp agency who put me on and took my chance away for something Apple wouldn't of done at all."
good,The best company I have every worked for. they listened to their workers and worked with them. The only reason i had to leave was I wanted partime and at the time they not do it Otherwise I would have worked there until I left Ireland/
good,"I have learned a lot about real customer focus working with Apple.  The benefits are great, pay is reasonable and the teams are all smart as can be."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Everything was absolutely great about the company until it comes to schedule management with school its tough but everything is negotiable. The people are very friendly and happy to help.
good,"I had a good experience with Apple retail as a whole, but due to the lack of ability for advancement and full-time positions, I was unable to stay with the company.  Benefits were good, stock purchase program was helpful, but the required hours of availability for even part-time employees was too much to handle for such a part-time commitment.  Management made goals and criticisms clear, both constructive and non.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with team members and knowing you have resources on the floor to help you with any given situation if you need more information about a product or service offered by Apple.  I would recommend if you are looking for a part-time job, but not as a full-time career as the available positions are few and far between."
good,"My brief time at Apple will be one of my favorite experiences of my professional life. The culture the Apple has is one of hard work and a drive to be the best, but it is also one of inclusion and creativity. A typical day is never boring, as you end up finding something new about the company or its products as you speak with new and returning customers about them, and that education that you recieve is worth more than the compensation that they provide, which is already sufficient even in their entry positions. If anyone gets an opportunity to work for Apple, I highly reccomend that they take it."
good,"I loved my time at Apple. I loved the people I worked with and the culture around it. No matter where you are in the company, you feel like you are part of the company. Something that is unusual for most companies when discussing how each part operates between retail, corporate, etc."
good,"very huge company with many branches, and most importnant thing it cares for is its customer's security, very competitive ."
good,Apple has a very strong culture of ensuring they work with you not only towards your own personal development but also ensuring they give you appropriate time to be with family
good,"La importancia de las personas nunca lo había notado con tanto interés en otra empresa, el foco para el éxito hace la diferencia en Apple. Las personas son el centro para seguir mejorando las gestiones. y obtener resultados realmente positivos con un excelente ambiente y equipo de trabajo."
good,amazing company and even more amazing staff and managers. Very accommodating to both workers and customers alike.Work pace is very busy but there is a method to the chaos that keeps everything running smoothly.
good,"The company treats you like family and not just a number or an employee. You are welcomed with open arms into the Apple Culture and you find yourself speaking and acting the Apple way even though you may not even be present at work. Level of expectations are extremely high and you find yourself doing the same in your personal life. You learn that ""good enough"" doesn't fly but rather that perfection is expected of you & you find everyone else striving on a daily basis to meet that level of expectation. There is job security! Its hard to advance internally but to advance externally is easier."
good,"Work from home, major bonus"
good,"We are working at a retail level and due to limited turnover, it is unlikely that I would be able to advance in the near future."
good,"If you're willing to really dedicate yourself to the company, even as a PT employee, then it's a wonderful company to work for. They expect a lot (particularly as a PT employee) but undeniably take great care of their employees. I loved helping people with technology. I loved the benefits. And my manager was awesome. That said, technology is always changing, though. Constantly educating and familiarizing oneself with the nuances of their products and services is often homework on top of their study modules and meetings unless you have an impeccable memory. Overall, it was a great challenge with great reward. I learned how hard technical support over the phone can really be, but also graduated to a greater level of patience from the outset of my experience."
good,"Perform all daily functions for data center technician for Apple."
good,"A download given by staff, informing team of any changes, community outreach programs, policies and procedures. Call outs fore team successes, and  up beat music starts our day."
good,You will meet some of the greatest people here at Apple. Apple's ideology flows through everything. From the people to it's products. Really a wonderful place to work at.
good,"work with brightest minds. Amazing work culture. "
good,"Loved Apple but working from home was just not for me."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"If you get this job, any position in Apple, hold on to it!!!  Very good compensation with equal amount of work done.  Keep your attendance up and work hard then they will show your value in pay and a variety of gifts."
good,Apple truly lives out its belief that it's people are the most important thing to the company.  They take care of you and really take the time to understand career ambitions.
good,"This company actually cares about its employees and gives ample resources to help you."
good,Working for Kellyconnect and AppleCare was a great experience with great benefits. Never had any major issues them. They were very flexible with schedules and time off.
good,"Working at Apple means that the things you work on get into the hands of hundreds of millions of people."
good,"Company with great products and a sincere commitment to deliver them to the consumer.  "
good,"In the corporate world, everything is great. Great work environments and lunch is fantastic food for a small cost. "
good,Very cool place to work. Everyday you learn a lot of new things. You can manage your time. Colleague are fantastic. Managers help you to do correctly your assignment.
good,Unlike any other place to work. Truly is different experience. Everyone is so supportive. Makes you want to work harder.
good,There are on-going professional development to challenge ourself for improvements. Management provide essential feedbacks for employees (no matter positive or negative)
good,"Apple is a great place to learn and grow as a person and a techie. You learn a lot in how to present to customers, talk to people and enhance customers lives by showing them how to better use their products."
good,"It's never a dull moment at Apple. I've enhanced my customer experience since I've been at Apple. They focus on customer value as well as employee job satisfaction. I work with over 100 people, and everyone is so friendly! We don't have team building exercises, yet everyone gets along. The hardest part of my job is trying to change positions. There isn't much movement within the company. The most enjoyable part is being able to go to work everyday and learn something new."
good,"My time at Apple was great.  The company fosters learning, teamwork, and has excellent internal communications, rare in today's company's.  You are consistently challenged, deadlines are met, and self-inspired learning are the tough parts.  The good parts are the company values talent, is innovative, offers a fair salary and benefits, and has areas to grow your career."
good,"fast paced and demanding it's easy to get a wide range of experiences in a short period of time. Once you get a reputation for delivering quality work, people from all over the company will seek you out."
good,"Apple is by far a dream job for many, however, the work/life balance is not the best fit for everyone. If you can get past that, this place is an amazing experience."
good,Excellent company to work for. Excellent staff and very challenging. I worked remotely for them and I was able to balance work and personal life very well. Company values their employees and their families. I would highly recommend this company.
good,"Trabajé en Apple España durante 2 años en la tienda de Passeig de Gràcia. Buen ambiente y buen trato. Se trabaja muy cómodo. También, tiene posibilidades de crecimiento profesional."
good,Apple has set the bar for how companies should educate their employees. There was always time to develop and learn new skills. Management was always supportive and there for the customer and the employees.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Love the management team and culture at Apple. Co-workers are great too. A large component of how you're rated is teamwork, so the work environment is always friendly. Even as a part-time employee you have health benefits, 401k, and of course discounts. Apple will even pay for some of your education as long at it applies towards any job at Apple. It can be pretty hard though to go full-time or advance up (due to the limited availability of positions). Going full-time is almost like a promotion. If you love working in a fast-paced environment where there's always something to do, this is it."
good,Working at the Apple Store is unlike any other experience. It's fast paced and always changing.  There is a family like atmosphere which is rare in a retail setting.  The days fly by and you get to literally change lives.  Like any retail experience sometimes the customers can get the best of you.  For me though the employer itself was amazing. I love my job.
good,"- Great benefits - great work environment - great salary (especially for retail) - lots of peer support - lots of management support - lots of learning experiences and resources - opportunity for advancement - opportunities for ""career experiences"" in corporate roles, for retail staff (underutilized, apparently. go for it!)"
good,"Fun place to work and learn about Apple computers and software. Its not a company that is based on sales, but its a company that puts its drive behind customer satisfaction. The key thing to succeed in this company is learning how to speak clearly and effectively in a manner, that anyone, even the slowest learner, can understand you. How you feel towards your coworker depends on management. Like every place, if management is in order then the workload is equally balanced throughout all departments. If management is disorganized then surely work will be hard no matter how hard you work."
good,"Colleagues are all very intelligent, driven and focussed; management expect innovation and self-dependence - they are not there to manage you, but the business - you should be intelligent and capable enough to manage yourself.  Don't think you're going to jump from a finance to a marketing to a sales role; the company believe in specialised disciplines..."
good,Everyone that works there knows and truly cares for each other.  It's the closest I've ever felt to any coworkers during any of my jobs.  Truly one of the best experiences I've had working.
good,"Apple leads the world in innovation, working for corporate Apple proves that the company is both successful externally and internally. Apple continues to push you and your career development and strives to make learning as easy as possible. Great benefits and fellow employees."
good,Good work environment and rich in diversity. Working here is a great experience and is full of great people from all backgrounds.
good,"I enjoyed everyday at Apple, besides the launch dates. Those were very long days. They always provided the best foods and expenses didn't matter."
good,"simplemente era muy divertido llegar a trabajar, realmente te gusta, disfrutabas transmitir esa experiencia de tener un producto Apple era fascinante."
good,It's great place to work. Co-workers are supportive. I learned to be work as Managerial responsibilities. Great Exposure to IBM & HP hardware. Building Servers from Scratch. Hardest pat of job is dealing lot of phone calls on 24/7 support every day. Enjoyable part is working with lot of onsite vendors everyday.
good,Apple is a great company to work for. The Apple culture is fun and provides incentive for advancement. I feel like I have job security and opportunity for advancement and most importantly I feel like Apple does care about our customers and we try our best to assist and satisfy them whenever we can. I start my day taking calls and end taking calls with ample breaks and lunch time. the only negative I can think of is not unique to Apple but that is that there are bad seeds in every bunch including teammates and management. The hardest part of the job is when someone else makes an issue worse than it needs to be and make the resolution more complicated than it needs to be. The best part of the job is being part of one of the largest and most successful IT company anywhere.
good,"I believe that being an Apple Genius is a great part time job and even full time job.  Every day is challenging and fast paced.  When you look at a store and see how crowded it is and the appreciation from customers, it definitely gives you a feeling of accomplishment."
good,"Great experience thus far, i have no complaints it's been an awesome opportunity for growth and development, the work environment is suitable and welcoming, co workers are a pleasure to be around, management is always willing to hear feedback from the rest of it's team, i wouldn't say there is a hard part of the job but like any work place it has its disappointments, the most enjoyable part is being able to be apart of the team."
good,"If you are lucky to even land an interview, you will be amazed by the caliber of people you will be talking to."
good,"Key takeaway: Have an open mind, and be ready for change anytime. Company is very dynamic. "
good,A typical work day is centered around customers.  Showing them how to work there new devices as well as letting them know the benefits of them.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"- Really good workplace and work with great people"
good,My organisation has been the second home for me where I can be myself although there are a few limitation but I take it as a healthy one. We work has a team and always strive to take the organisation to new level year on year.
good,very good company got many lot of things to get to know  very good management team for me its a great for to part of (Apple India)
good,"learnt to speak straight"
good,"Manage my team on the right way"
good,"Drive sales through relationships with others to help you meet high targets.  Can be very challenging to maintain high growth rates.  Commission based environment.  Apple culture is amazing to work for.  Great perks, like yearly conferences.  Gotta work every weekend."
good,"Apple prides themselves on customer loyalty, quality products and exceptional customer service (including tech support).  They have fantastic benefits and adequate pay. They mostly hire very tech savvy people who have a vast background in troubleshooting, customer service, and knowledge of products similar to what Apple sells. "
good,A typical day would be just  apple customers get the best customer experience you could provide. The management really prided our store on customer service and listening to what the customers wanted. I would say the Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my customer happy with their purchase.
good,"learned things I will use even after Apple"
good,Being expose on multitask activities from development to process to equipment and whole operation of each suppliers.
good,Apple's culture is a definite positive in this work environment. From the time you enter the building to punch the clock until you leave you come across people that are friendly and passionate about their work day. I would recommend working here to any one of my friends or family.
good,"While the job is essentially retail, my role requires me to wear many hats and has allowed me to gain skills that will help me in not just my current role and job but in any career I seek.  The management has a very open door policy and allows you say want you want in a positive-intent environment.  Co-workers, while young, care about their positions and have fun at the same time."
good,I would not be looking for another job if I was able to stand on my feet all day and work a complete shift without physical problems.
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting accessibility (vision and/or hearing impaired) and non-accessibility callers with their iOS devices. On a daily basis, the team members will help one another out when a problem they are having on a call cannot be fixed on their own; teamwork is strongly encouraged and vital in this position. The team of managers in the iOS division are always pushing their team to reach full potential. The hardest part of the job is the volume of callers, but helps to maintain a rapport with customers, as well as keep focus on the task at hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of accomplishment by resolving issues which customers feel to be impossible."
good,"There was not a ""typical day"" at this job."
good,"Apple Certified  as a Technology Expert Consultant."
good,I would recommend working for Apple Inc. It has been the genesis for most of my success in the last 5 years. Highly creative and intelligent employees and a great corporate culture. You will meet anyone and everyone.
good,"Excellent experience and support/training. "
good,Great place to work. I liked my team and management. I liked working from home but it does get lonely.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple is a fantastic company to work for! They help you to balance your work/life relationships and are true believers on developing your skills. There just is not a lot of room for development unless you are open to moving to California or austin, Texas. The benefits and management is always top notch. I have never worked with a more interesting and supportive team."
good,Always room for growth and moving/looking forward never moving back.
good,"Real fun job. Got to meet new people all the time. Even celebrities sometimes stopped by to have their laptops, computers, and even Ipods fixed. Nice to learn about all the new apple products."
good,Great people to work with everyday and fun work environment.
good,"I would personally say that the Apple culture revolves around community. It is such a positive place to work because Apple truly embraces diversity & therefore they have so many talented people employed who are available to connect with the rich variety of individuals in any given community. "
good,"Fast-paced, but enjoyable work environment.  The whole team is on board with the goals of the organization, which makes for a productive experience for both the employee and the customer."
good,You will come to work everyday and meet some of the smartest people in the tech industry. They are not only helpful but are passionate about the products we make. Leadership is very solid and have great interest in the development of their people.
good,"Apple is like a family, depending on location, and management team"
good,"I was the campus rep for a year at my university. If you do your job well, you get to keep your Apple-supplied computer, and they let you use an iPad throughout the year. It was pretty chill, my boss was great, and it paid a nice $10 an hour for not a lot of work."
good,I enjoyed working with this company; just wished I would have been offered a permanent position; but the experience was great.
good,I was with Apple a little over a year as a part time specialist. The culture and enthusiasm are genuine and refreshing. It is an ever changing and fast paced environment.
good,"Working for Apple was an experience, to say the least. Our customers were a mix of people new to our technology, people passionate about our technology, and people angry because their technology wasn't working the way they wanted it to be, but we had the tools for dealing with all of them. Whether our resources were feeling comfortable being drawn into hour-long conversations about the differences between computers or knowing which of our colleagues to ask for a specific detail or knowing just when to find someone else to help our customer out, they were always available. Our leadership team had some rough patches in my time there, but things were constantly being worked on and our leadership team did show genuine interest in making sure every employee was set up for their own personal successes, even if things took a few months to sort out."
good,"very flexible working hours."
good,"Si lavorava a ritmi molto elevati e rimodulando il proprio piano di lavoro molto in fretta. "
good,"I enjoy developing iOS applications whenever I generate an idea in my head. The tools and documentation that Apple provides is very useful. To me, there's nothing better than being able to imagine something and bring it to life with a few lines of code. But I believe my knack for problem solving lead me into this field. By the way, there would be a lot of things on this Earth we wouldn't have access to if there weren't any innovative programmers left. Besides, I believe my passion for development will take me a long way. It's the only thing keeping me from demanding super high wages. I would have to say the hardest part of the job for me is being a perfectionist. I usually take a little extra time to finish my personal projects simply because they aren't perfect enough for me."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced and non-stop.  I learned great integrity and I was truly able to be an individual as I was empowered every day to do my very best and truly participate in the customer journey.  "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,Great company to work for. Kept me knowedgable on macintosh products. Great people and very service focused.
good,"Delivering an exceptional, game-changing business customer experience within the store."
good,"A typical day involves getting a review of daily news with the team, making sure everyone is on the same page with new product info, and then...talking with people! It's all about communication. With the customers, with your fellow employees - it's about how you interact. Management is there for you, but empowers you to make the right decision on your own. The most difficult part of you day will be running into unfamiliar situations, but that's when you can lean on your resources for assistance. The most enjoyable part of working for Apple is the people! You'll make long-lasting friendships and be a part of one of the greatest companies in the history of the world. If you like people, definitely give Apple a look!"
good,"Understanding the approach of just how to give customers only what they need. From the introduction through the final experience, Apple has what every company should do when making customers or just answering questions."
good,Apple is a great place to work where everyone is high energy and interesting. Great technology training under knowledgable managers. You get the opportunity to meet new people every day and talk about the newest Apple products.
good,Apple truly believes in it's culture and you can see it throughout the company. Big company and lots of room for growth.
good,"Everything is digital, even the registers/cash wrap. Full benefits for ALL workers, paid travel expenses, high-paced environment, and the variety of customer experiences are just some of the great pluses working for a company that did all the intelligent design of retail for you. The products sell themselves; you, just share your love and experiences with the products."
good,Fun place to meet really cool people and learn an incredible wealth of knowledge!
good,Could be very high stress at times but wroth it to help customers with devices.
good,Great environment for one to grow in while learning the quality and technology of each product.
good,Working at apple is fun and exciting. We come out with new products at least every year and we are always changing/evolving. People forget its retail because it is a technology store. Its easy at first but can become exhausting when you deal with customers on a 7 to 8 hour basis. All in all a great work experience for anyone.
good,I was a Sales Representative. I had the privelage of personally intro ducting Apple products to hundreds of people.
good,"A typical day at work involves taking incoming calls and making outbound calls to Apples' customners in regards to their Apple products and problems they may be experiencing with Apple's software. It also includes suggecting Apple's products, selling and replacing damanged products. The hardest part of my job would be pleasing every customer to exceed Apple's expectations. It's hard but I give it my all. The most enjoyable part of my job is pleasing those customer who are irrate."
good,"This Company Is great to work for, they treat their employees very well. They truly want you to succeed and grow as a person not just as there employee."
good,"Excellent work culture, compititive employess, great work culture"
good,"Apple culture and products are solid. They take care of their people, on a developmental and career basis, as well as providing a sense of ownership and responsibility."
good,I loved working for Apple.  As the old saying goes “What you out into it is what you get out of it” Management and staff were extremely supportive.  The diversity at the Fifthavenue store is simply amazing.
good,"The benefits are the best a company can offer.  Health Care, dental, vision; Stock purchase; 401k; vacation/sick time; family leave; internal support;"
good,"The team I worked with was loving and kind. they helped with everything i needed. however, the issue with working here is how intense some customers can get with you. you can end up helping one person out for almost 3 hours. but besides that its a breeze. you have to be a fast learner, there is A LOT to learn when going in. they don't pay well for no reason."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"The company is overall just amazing to work for. The benefits are far greater than you would expect, however they are a multi-billion dollar company, so one would assume they would be taking care of their bread & butter. They take care of their employee's and care about their impact on the earth/enviornment. They care about people, their privacy & rights, which is hands down just a few of the best qualities."
good,The best part about working for Apple are the opportunities to broaden your knowledge. I've learned a lot about customer service and solving technical issues.
good,Working for Apple taught me a lot of skills that I can take with me and use in future positions. Also Apple offered a lot of benefits from a gym to a full cafe.
good,"I had an overall great experience in working here.  I would recommend for someone looking for a stable, fun, non judgmental environment, where you can also gain relevant experience"
good,"This company has given me counseling for immigration consults and has even reimbursed me and my husband money we paid during immigration application time. Not only that of course, that’s just the thing I never would have expected a company could do. I’ve made lifelong friends and they have given me the strength to grow outside of what I feel is comfortable"
good,"It is a must to know your work in great details to be successful in Apple.  Being an engineer, hands-on work is the only way to know the amount of details that is required."
good,"The best thing about working for Apple was the people I worked with. Apple hires some of the smartest and kindest people. The job can be very fun, but can also be very stressful (it is retail after all), but I never felt that this was the fault of management. It is a difficult job and a lot of work, so even if you are part time, prepare for it to take most of your energy."
good,"My experience at apple was bar none! It was the best job I ever had, apart from running my own business which is in a different category. Apple is a fantastic place to work and I would recommend it to anyone."
good,I would recommend Apple for anyone who is looking to sharpen their skillset as they are very much focused on development. Apple understands work life balance and cares about their people.
good,Great job if you can stay for good. Hours were easy to get and the day went by fast. The benefits are good and every 2 years you get a credit to an already discounted Apple store
good,I really appreciate what I learned while I was there the staff was very cooperative with the employees to ensure that no one was left behind while learning new things.
good,"Management was wonderful, and the environment was very friendly and inclusive. My coworkers were so, so diverse. Great pay. Managers and coworkers actively work with you and will gladly share information and constructive  feedback so you can do better. There’s a major focus on health, and much less a focus on making numbers. No focus on upselling makes busier days far easier. Yeah"
good,Worked there on a temporary contract but in that time made friends and honestly best retail job I’ve ever had in 14 years of doing retail. Management lead by example too which is something I wasn’t used to but it was a very good thing to see
good,Apple allowed senior advisors to make decisions to best accommodate it's customers without having to consult with upper management. You felt empowered. The training was very thorough and relevant.  Not working face to face with customers was a challenge.  It was a pleasure to work with a vurtual team from all across the country but never met anybody face to face.
good,Loved every year I worked here! The managers were really supportive in your progression and were invested in making sure you were happy in your role. Would recommend highly to anyone.
good,"It's an interesting place should you get the chance to work there. Lots of smart and talented people with a can-do attitude. Work is valued, but be prepared to work smart, have ideas/answers and ensure your information is right."
good,great company to work for. it was fast paced but its a lot of fun. always learning something new. I love that they are based on giving feedback to one another constantly to better one another and always willing to helpp each other.
good,"I enjoyed working at Apple, my only issue was with my store leader who I did not feel allowed me to be me and succeed as best as possible. The store itself is full of great people and great customers!"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Being at apple makes you feel like you are a part of a work life family, where everyone is so different but yet have so much in common.  There is no place like it."
good,"I loved everything about Apple except my particular job.  If you can land in a spot you enjoy, there's no better company to work for. The benefits were fantastic and the culture was great."
good,"This is a fun place to work, but having to deal with general public for technical issues can be stressful. The managers are friendly and provide you with the tools you need to succeed."
good,"My job as a lead li e cook of a station consisted on making sure to order item every day, making manu, order guide, cooking special and regular item we had every day, training new employee on my station and make sure the guidelines line of cleaning r follow and temperature control etc."
good,"Work from home but work Asia business hours. Perfect for stay home mom."
good,I actually loved working here but it was only temporary through a third party company.  We were there to work through the busy season and the work was very easy. I learned how fix cellphones and once I had that in my head I was moving so fast that I would them and just sit and wait for more
good,Love where I work and helping people everyday with some of the most amazing products ever made. Work life balance is a little hard but definitely manageable.
good,It takes hard work. You will be challenged and you need to be flexible. There is tons of training that you will have to go through. Great work atmosphere. Have a positive attitude and good customer service skills are required to do well.
good,I really enjoyed working at apple. I love their products and the value they have for their customers. I was also given the opportunity to work in many different positions through out the store.
good,You are surrounded by the brightest minds. Going to work each day can be very fulfilling at Apple. You feel like you are a part of something larger than yourself. The collaborative environment is very nice. They spare no expense on amenities. Enjoyed my time with Apple and it accelerated my career by 5+ years easily.
good,the most enjoable part of the job is when i was able to resolve the issue and the customer is satisfied. on a typical day we would work about 8 to 10 hours a day and with extra hours on the holidays. the hardest part of the job was controling conversations with angry customer but doable to control
good,Apple is a great place to work and they take great care of their employees. My situation is that I’m at my cap for how much I’m going to make. I would stay at Apple if I could work for corporate but I can’t live in California.
good,"This a very good place to work if you are looking to settle down and for a forever job, however it is your responsibility your own development, look for mentorship, get a plan for your carrier path and look for opportunities in other departments because manager doesn't tend you let you know your potencial and they only cares about the numbers that impact their own performance, they would develope to give them the numbers they want form you, but not grow with the company.  "
good,One of the absolutely best jobs I've ever had.From the team to the environment the cutlture that is apple allowed for a stress-free workplace.Even as a part-time employee had amazing health care and other benefits.

good,Apple is a wonderful place to work with competitive pay and benefits and a management that is very supportive of their team. Highly recommend to anyone interested in that field.
good,"my review, the job was pretty cool but i got sick of the commute and slow movement. id recommend to anyone looking for a great option with a lot of advancement if you play the game"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Good benefits and pay, a lot of development and personal growth. Small region makes it difficult to get promoted fast, but opportunities to relocate are always available."
good,"Apple is an amazing company to work for. As a technician you will learn everything you need they just want personality and people skills. After a time period you receive Dental, Medical, and Vision for less than $50 a paycheck for it. It’s truly all about the culture and giving back to the community. We believe that we do the best work we can helping to change lives. The only downfall is if you’re in college it can be a bit hard to valence the two. Even as part time you will receive a good amount of hours but other than that amazing !!"
good,"Loved working there, only thing was having to wear stuff that wasn’t metal which mostly everything has some kind of metal on it so it was hard at times."
good,"Good pay, good coworkers, management is kinda iffy but still not terrible. Advancement is hard but possible. Pay raises every year, good benefits for both part time and full time."
good,"It was fun to work here. I was a temporary hire for the LOC conference so I only stayed for four weeks, but I enjoyed helping the people I did. I'd definitely recommend it to others."

good,"Apple has productive and fun workplace. Environment is Quiet, discussion are mostly job oriented. Job security for the contract employees is a concern"
good,"Typical work days started with a staff meeting where daily duties were passed out to individuals. "
good,"It's Apple. Their reputation for having a fun, casual place to work isn't just talk. Open offices, relaxed environments, and fun among coworkers is the norm."
good,"The job is demanding and metrics are closely monitored. Schedules can be rough. The culture is great there though and Apple does have world-class benefits for their employees including on-site health services and gyms as well as a cafe. "
good,"I Really enjoyed my time with Mindlance (At Apple). This job was very repetitive, but also very rewarding. I helped create a better user experience for Apple music/TV/News users. "
good,"Quarterly expectations and targets were huge, but when you exceeded those expectations you were rewarded with great benefits and decent job flexibility"
good,"Working from home does create a disconnect between you and your co-workers. Would only recommend to people who are okay with that kind of communication. Good pay, benefits even for part-time."
good,"It’s an excellent company to work for. The culture is that of taking care of the customer great experience with the product.  The products are focused on consumer and ease of use.  The employees are feed heathy foods and lots of physical activities, which adds up to great health of mind and time out for self care"
good,I had to answer incoming calls regarding customer issues about their accounts.  I enjoyed going above and beyond to help the customers and to also make sure that their issues were resolved.
good,the job was a fun place to work. they showed me alot turing my time there and i felt like i was apart of a real team. im very disappointed when i moved and had to leave the job.
good,Everything was great with one exception. You never know what kind of manager you will get placed with. They are not all equal. First year manager was awesome but he got promoted. 2nd - 5th year Manager could never really grasp my personality and learning style.
good,"I had an amazing experience and met great people who taught me a lot about the work I needed to do, but also about being a better version of myself. I am truly grateful."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Working for Apple felt like working for one of the best companies in the world. When the luster wore off, you realized it was because you were working alongside some of the best people in the world. The people make the culture, and I hope Apple never loses that. I loved working with customers and I loved working with my coworkers. Unfortunately, at the time I worked there, opportunities for advancement were few and far between."
good,This was one of the best places to work. I miss and regret that I left. Relocated to another area that there was no Apple Store. I miss the company but have also made some lasting friendships.
good,"I enjoyed working there and would work there again."
good,"Working for Apple as an AppleCare Technical support representative was face paced and unpredictable, but fun and fulfilling. I got to broaden my knowledge on a product I used everyday as well as assisting, educating and satisfying customers. Awesome position to have."
good,Training is exceptional to learn how to deal with different client emotions and technical backgrounds. Even though I worked from home the feel of having your team with you is always there.
good,I just wished they worked a lot more with there employees I set myself up trying to help them out which in the end hurt my points and caused me to get fired later on
good,"Great place to work and offers great benefits. They offer a great starting salary for my location but a small amount of hours so it doesn't come out to enough to live off. It can be a very busy work environment despite working from home, you will be taking calls non stop for hours on end which is mentally exhausting. Other than that, my experience with management has been great and it is a great company overall."
good,Great company with good compensation  the Austin campus had limited opportunities for advancement and doing different things it seemed. Management and teams were skilled
good,"Fun, exciting and fast pace. Great place to work for the money and benefits. Learn about new technology and stay up to date on apple products. Let's not mention the discounts that's included. Nice!!"

good,"Best place I ever worked. Hard work but worth it. If you have the opportunity to interview take it.,.........................................................."
good,"As an At Home Adviser, my experience was unique in that I interacted with my co-workers and management via chat and video conference. The work/life balance allowed was excellent, and much care was given to how employees felt about the job and the overall experience of working for the company."
good,"Great work and life balance, working from home is a plus, the chance for advancement is great! Only had one supervisor that was not good & dropped the ball out of the three that I had. Great benefits & would love to work for them again."
good,"Nice company to work for. Management were excellent. The calls did get very stressful for me and it didn't take long, probably was a fault on my part as I tend to take calls very personally. The calls can go on for quite some time but you don't take a vast number of calls a day. Also you have the possibility to work from home, it didn't suit me very well.  Overall fabulous company to work for. Highly recommended."
good,"Apple is known for world-class experiences. This  puts an increased challenge on projects, but with a collaborative team, is achievable. That said, Apple is a huge company with many personalities and priorities. It often feels like a never-ending uphill climb of persuading individuals, finding time on peoples’ calendars, and reading minds. But those moments when the stars and teams align feel like none other."
good,Amazing culture and team. Challenge but rewarding leadership experience. Exceptional customer service standards. Work/Life balance is a retail schedule which is not ideal for everyone.
good,Culture at Apple is incredible!  Attention to detail is a must!  Apple devoted a lot of time training us and helping develop our skills to be highly productive.
good,The Apple experiences are like nothing else! From the interview process and the training is top notch! The Apple culture in itself is very empowering.

good,"Pese a ser una tienda con sus inconvenientes el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno y se dan muchas facilidades para mejorar, tanto a nivel laboral como personal"
good,"Great job culture and benefits, these ppl really care about the culture of work and life balance. Ive been working her for about 2 years and there is lots of progress and innovations in the call center area. A typical work day is taking calls supporting people but it can get tedious. You meet so many different people and gain so many skills technical and personal. The workplace is at home but the culture is amazing because everyone and management is in sync"
good,"Fast paced , working with talented individuals and challenging problems  with a balance of work and life. Enjoy working at Apple and would recommend anyone to join BI team"
good,"Loved working for them! The only complaint i have is the work/home balance. They provided excellent training and continued education about products,policy and procedures."
good,"Great culture. Good job. Great food and discounts. It’s a dynamic environment. You learn a lot from day one and everyone is always willing to help. It gets really busy at times which can be quite pressuring. And when it’s quiet, it can get boring waiting for people to come around. Otherwise it’s a great role. Can get tiring standing up all day especially during Christmas. But otherwise it’s great."
good,"I love working for Apple. I'm able to work from home, which makes it easier to do everything that's needed for my kids. I like my schedule, but I recently switched roles, and now I don't get any overtime."

good,"Fast-paced, always changing, and terrific management were typical days. My focus was inventory management and Apple made that job easy with the tools provided. Great co-workers and great managers."
good,"This was a great team environment to work in for the most part, busy, and fulfilling as far as work tasks and responsibilities go. The management team was very supportive, but at times had unequal expectations of team members. Some team members were allowed to get away with doing the minimum amount of work because that was all that was expected of them due to their poor work ethic &  the lack of motivation they showed. On the flip side, other team members were expected to pick up the slack because of their proactive attitude and motivation to do the job asked of them. All and all a great company to work for with great training and benefits."
good,"Apples incredible culture was my favorite part of my career there. The people are its best assets and management knows that.  The values and ethics, not to mention the wickedly incredible products produced - were amazing."
good,c'était une très belle expérience en tant que spécialiste chez apple
good,"Entreprise à l'américaine, accueillante, de nombreuses possibilités d'évolutions où là diversité est mise en avant"
good,"Multi tasking, fast pace on the fly work environment. Working with many personalitys to say the least. Working on prototypes. Performing various builds and installs."
good,"Apple is honestly the best company i ever worked for.  Their credo is universal for any company that has to engage customers, and the skills i learned there I still tap into to this day to exceed customer service expectations."
good,"I worked for Apple for a couple years and every single day I am not working there I regret leaving. The company, the atmosphere, the customers both internal and external were just so amazing and always exceeded my expectations as an employee. When I worked there it felt like everyone I worked with was family. It was really great. Management at my store was overall great, but I really butted heads with one manager and because of her I chose to leave the company. I should've worked harder to make amends and not butt heads with her so much. It would've helped to suck-up to her more but I just couldn't do it at the time."
good,Apple has a great culture and really strives to keep employees happy and healthy. The benefits at Apple are some of the best I have seen in Corporate America. Not to mention you are working for the most profitable company on the planet.
good,Bonne rémunération et bonne culture d'entreprise. Un exemple

good,"Working at Apple was always exciting because there would always be people coming and going.   I enjoyed the interface with meeting new people and helping them solve their problems with their devices."
good,"AppleOne was a primary office job that started me on my tracks to my path of education. It struck a heartstring that made me feel useful which is very necessary to keeping employees, universally available but hard to return to"

good,Awesome job prepare to work weekends and be in a corporately controlled environment. Good management and developmental opportunities. Everything is systematic and controlled by quantitative and qualitative metrics.

good,Apple has a fun and supportive atmosphere. They also provide great benefits and many opportunities for advancement and growth within the company. Great place to work.
good,"I have been working since the age of 15 and have held a handful of jobs. In short, one of the best parts about working at Apple are the people you'll meet and work with.

Metrics driven, customer service satisfaction driven. The rewards both monetary and personal are great and will carry forward into all other job and life experiences. The hardest part of the job was the time management. Your workday was broken down to increments as small as 5 minutes. Don't be late! Keeping up with your attendance and time keeping as per policy could be challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving all the great customer surveys about how you helped out.

good,Apple is a great company to work for. The benefits are insane for part time employees. I wouldn't suggest this job to someone who is struggling with their identity or who has problems when facing adversity.
good,"Really enjoyed the collaborative and supportive work culture provided by Apple. Appreciated their practice of fearless feedback, and personal development. My primary challenge here was the competitive culture, and abundant talent pool which made upward mobility difficult if you have specific career goals that don't align with their structured career track. Other then that what you'll find at Apple is a place that cares for their people as much as their customers and will give you the most support and tools to succeed while you're there. A great place to work, and if you're lucky enough an even greater place to grow your career. Was sorry to leave."

good,"He trabajado en el departamento de Apple Care como Customer Support Advisor, en Febrero 2017 promocionado a Senior Advisor, contrato indefinido y a tiempo completo."
good,Good company to work for if you have a passion in technology and also if you like working with apple products. I love the people that you work with its just when you are trying to advance it is pretty challenging in doing that because you have to make certain impacts with in the store to actually advance. Which means you can be very great at your role but if your not making impacts other ways then when talking about advancing your going to be behind versus other candidates that may have all that they looking for so you have to do a little bit too much work to get to where you want to be.

good,The Genius bar is a tough yet rewarding place to work. You often seen people who aren't in the best of moods and you get to turn their day around by providing complete and comprehensive technical support. Some people can be challenging and others no so much but you learn how that average person thinks and you adapt your service skills to different types of people. You are surrounded by some fairly smart people who are always willing to help you out. You must also be there to help out your peers too. The hardest part of the job is working retail hours. You don't have weekends and you are often working until late at night.
good,"Have very much enjoyed my time with this company - great compensation, benefits, and ability to advance. Only drawback is retail hours and schedule requirements."
good,"A typical day at work includes many customer interactions, having to stay composed during CS issues and even when someone is angry. There's many different kinds of people coming through Apple's doors on a continuous basis. It can be hectic on launch days and holidays but management does try to support most times, however possible. There are going to be people that you meet that you may not like. However, you can let them  know why through feedback. You learn a lot about people and yourself working there. If you're into the Apple culture, you will love the environment. It's not a difficult job if you show up on time and do what you should. The culture is accepting of everyone and just about anyone that aren't bigots as you will meet many people working with you from various cultural groups, orientations and religions. It's nice in that sense. The best part of the job is the camaraderie we have with our coworkers and people who've become friends/roommates. Additionally, the good part is also helping a customer become an Apple user and them being excited and grateful but it can also be the frustrating part when you have a customer who doesn't know any of their Apple ID email or password or recovery methods. Helping people should be your goal because if you don't like customer service, you'll hate this job."
good,"If you want to push yourself, interpersonally and professionally, Apple if for you. If you enjoy working amongst an incredible team of creative, extremely intelligent fun people, Apple is for you. If you're an extrovert, Apple is for you.

good,"A typical day at Apple consist of troubleshooting over 30 appointments a day. Level of difficulty varies within every appointment. The job of a Technical Specialist requires a variety a skills. You need to be able to multitask, troubleshoot, empathize and really want to help customers. Workplace culture is fun and energetic, but not when launches come around. I would say the hardest part of the job is the stories you hear about losing information and loved ones. It's never easy to give bad news, but you have to learn to give it."
good,Productive environment and great teaching skills.  Also had ping pong table and food for sale on breaks. I also liked how the team leads helped with escalating calls.
good,If you want a position with a company that cares about you Apple is perfect. Your schedule you have for 3 months they provide great benefits your equipment. The only thing I would say is it is a work at home position and must be noise free environment but Apple is awesome
good,"I don't see apple as a job but as a place to have fun and enjoy my time. Apple really care for employees and they back it up with listening to our feedback, for example employee stock purchase program and part-time benefits. The hardest part of the job is dealing with fast past appointment and a customer need deeper one on one connection. The most enjoyable part is the people."
good,"My overall experience was pretty descent,  everyday was a learning experience and a great one. When a new software came out they made it possible for the technicians to know the software by putting out interactive trainings. The supervisors and higher administers were very understandable when it came to personal situations. The hardest thing about the job was when a technical situation would happen with a device and we could not fix. It made the situation difficult because then we would have and upset. When i could solve a problem for a customer it would make my day."
good,"At Home Advisor- 1 Year College Programme Contract"

good,"I like working for Apple. They take care of you and the managers are great. Scheduling isn't great because it changes so often, but all and all, it is a fantastic company to work for with amazing benefits."
good,"Best retail experience I've had."
good,"If you are a driven ""mover and shaker"", this specific position may not be for you due to the perceived lack of upward mobility.  As an at home advisor, it is difficult to advance into a different position largely due to the inability to know people in a personal manner as would be possible in a face to face role.  So with this in mind, the issue is more with the type of role, not the company itself.  But other than this, it is a work great environment that I highly recommend for those looking for an entry level experience.  I find that when job hunting, people tend to be impressed with the Apple name and this helps establish professional credibility."
good,"Hey, its a relaxed job helping the worlds best clients and customers. You are apart of a company that leads the world in trendy, but accessible technology.

good,They care about there employees more than any place I've ever worked.  They show it not only through benefits packages but through a genuine desire to make every day better for employees.
good,"Apple was by far the most fun I had ever had at a job. Yes, it is a trail store but the people and leadership team made it so much worth while to work there.

Os colegas de trabalho tem uma boa interação e foi possível aprender muito durante o meu contrato na empresa. A parte mais difícil do trabalho foi criar a dimensão de que era uma multinacional e todas as ações deveriam ser respondidas à sede nos EUA. E a parte mais agradável do trabalho era a relação entre todos e a liberdade nas conversas e vestimentas."

We were responsible for maintaining and creating REST server endpoints/utilities that supported the web app. The front end was primarily vanilla JavaScript web components with underscore templates and Google closure compiler to ensure type safety. Some of the more interesting components included D3 and interactive canvas implementation to visualize battery usage and to allow technicians to draw case and screen defects."

The company was EXTREMELY diverse which were one of the things i most liked while working there. The management were fair. They obviously followed the rules a great deal given the fact we were dealing with actual customer phones. I had a wonderful time working there. I only left because of the complications i was having with my pregnancy at the time.
good,"* Pretty flexible 8-hours a day schedule,great working atmosphere"

good,"Every day is a new challenge, shared with great colleagues and great products. Very clean work environment with plenty of time for yourself. I have learnt both personal and professional skills ranging from computer repairs to customer service. Management is there to push and test you, to make sure you're achieving your best. Trying to repair phones on a short timescale can quickly become overwhelming if not managed correctly, but a kind team that feel like a family make everything worthwhile."
good,"On general a great company, but it depends on which area and function are you working on. "
good,"Highly recommend this job for someone wanting to build experience in a professional work environment while building technical skills.

Their health benefits are fantastic and they also offer commuter benefits.

There are different areas where people can work in, both tech support and sales, but at the end it is all about the customer experience."

I've very pleased."

good,The store is a great place to gain experience with customer service as well as learning a great deal about a technology environment. My schedule as a student was worked with well in the store and I have a very open relationship with my managers and fellow coworkers
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at apple. There is always something new and something changing. I learned how to adapt to the change at Apple. Either the people changed or policies changed and you have to learn how to adapt to both. I learned how to interact with different people from different back ground, how to interact with difficult customers in different situations, and I learned how to probe to find out information to assist customers and how to position the right solution for the customers. Most importantly I learned more about myself in 6 years than I've probably learned my whole life. My co-wokers were always there to assist me in any way possible in or out of work. The hardest part of the job was walking out on the last day. The most enjoyable part was the people. Internal And external"
good,The communication between management and non-management employees is moor than adequate. There is training almost weekly in order to  stay abrupt with the ever changing tech market.
good,"Geweldig bedrijf met goede werkomgeving, goede arbeidsvoorwaarden en ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden"
good,"A typical day at Apple for me was teaching up to 20 people on how to us the various applications on the mac.  I learned a lot about customer service tailored for different people and personalities.  I worked closely with the management staff, developed a solid relationship with them and have earned their trust to put the company's mission statements and vision at the helm of my performance.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the occasionally difficult person or people who chose to be unreasonable.  The most enjoyable part is working with the fellow employees and solving problems for customers.  For example, I remember this lady who's mother had recently died.  She had only her mother's voice on a few last voice messages.  The lady wanted to archive those messages for ever but was afraid that because they were on voice mail they would easily be deleted.  I helped her record those voice mails from her mother to her computer using native audio production application.  I could tell she was eternally grateful.  That made my day and hers, I'm sure.(tears)"
good,"I worked under great Management at Apple retail, people were always moving up to bigger and better positions as the company and the store grew. The people were great and knowledgeable, and eager to promote the company products."
good,"Technical server support for Enterprise customer."
good,"The work environment is fast paced and enjoyable.  Everyday I perform audits to ensure everything from the previous day was processed properly, then check in inventory from the daily shipment, allocate parts for repairs, contact customers.  Throughout everyday I am constantly auditing and providing feedback and learning opportunities for technicians that made any errors in repair processes from the day before or the current day.  One of the best parts of the job was when I was given the opportunity to find innovative ways to make the repair room function better and be more productive."
good,Working in Apple Education division was very rewarding. I liked all the people and Management as well as the customers of Apple Education.
good,"At Apple no day will ever be the same. It is a dynamic, constantly changing and evolving environment with extremely high expectations for the employees and the quality of the support and solutions we provide to our customers. After 8.5 years with Apple I still learn something new every day. We spend a lot of time selecting the best people, and when you have talented and highky skilled employees in a very competitive environment it can be a challenge to keep them motivated when opportunities for advancement within retail are limited. I learned so much at my time with Apple from dealing with difficult customer and employee situations, to Root Cause Analysis and identifying ways to improve the business, to implementing changes that fundamentally change the way we conduct our day to day business. The management team is strong but they are stretched very thin and are not able to spend as much individual time with employees as they would like. The team overall is hardworking and talented and the most difficult part of the job is dealing with unreasonable customer requests. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we all have the ability to impact the lives of customers each and every day, and can help them improve their lives with technology - whether it be communicating with a loved one far away, managing your business with Apple solutions, or using our products to express your creativity."
good,Awesome company.  Great people.  Only reason I left was because I moved across the state and there is no Apple store where I moved.
good,"Fantastic Company, amazing culture, fast paced, innovative, exciting"
good,If you are a top notch A+ personality you will love working here.
good,"A typical day for a boh specialist at Apple consisted of daily counts of inventory, shipping and receiving product, keeping the front of house stocked, bringing out product requests, assist customers to and from vehicles, and assist with sales in the front. I learned how to build lasting relationships with customers that would enter the store."
good,"talk about technology and there you have it. APPLE. "
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"A typical day at Apple was unlike any other day at any other job, but I can't hide the somewhat rough parts of that day as well and they went hand in hand. Working with an Apple user as a customer was absolutely fantastic and converting people to Apple was even more fun; nothing quite like the smile on a face of a proud new owner of any great Apple or Macintosh technology. On the same face that once held a smile will eventually be replaced by one with a frown and due to Apple's great theory on customer service (which sometimes is skewed) the individual may be forced to act a little brash. I always wanted to help, but in some cases, I didn't have the tools or resources at that specific moment and that's when we entered the twilight zone. The training, management, co-workers and the technology itself was the thing that really held this wonderful place together, the glue if you will. Absolutely amazing place to have experience with."
good,"There is no company quite like Apple. From product design to customer service, everything is excellent. The single biggest thing I learned there is to focus on the details and the overall picture will be great. One cannot expect a great outcome if one does not make the necessary preparations. "
good,"If you enjoy the Apple Culture and working in a call center, Apple is a great opportunity. Great company to work for, great benefits, competitive pay packages, good leadership. Great team spirit and managers who are there for your success. A typical 8 hour day of awesome and helping awesome customers."
good,Apple hires great people. I enjoy my co-workers and feel inspired by them daily. Management makes sure you feel appreciated and will help you achieve your goals with the company.
good,"Apple, though in love with itself, treated its employees beautifully. The pay could have been better, but the dining hall was off the scale! They even treated temp workers with respect. My only regret is having developed a medical problem after two weeks. I would work for them again if given the opportunity."
good,If you are fresh out of college Apple is a great company to launch your career. You will be challenged every day and given responsibilities that most people will not receive until their 30's. 
good,Your Karma instantly changes when you walk in. The Store in general is beautiful from inside out. The whole vibe is nice. It's an awesome company to work for. The Benefits are really good!
good,"I did tech support at home over the phone.  Company was great, treated employees well, manager was excellent"
good,I loved the constant motivation to improve and compete against one another to achieve continual bonus opportunities.
good,"I have been here for six months, I have been offered two different promotions already. They really recognize hard work and dedication and benefits are Great whether you are part time or full time."
good,"Apple is one of the greatest companies in the world. They offer stimulating training, and the ability to own your development. With every tool Apple offers I was able to effectively develop myself into the leader and resource I am today."
good,Great company working with inspiring and diverse people. Very challenging role with always lots going on were you need to be playing from a 10 everyday.
good,Exposure to Innovation mind set. Totally focussed on results rather than how you get there.
good,"as a Specialist, you’re highly skilled at uncovering customers’ needs, then following through with enlightening solutions. Not only are you the first person customers meet when they enter the store, but you’re also the person who guides them — advising, selling, and even setting up their new products. You perform other roles within the store too, whether it’s maintaining visual merchandising or assisting team members. Always curious, you stay on top of news about products and initiatives, ready to apply your learning in customer interactions. Your success is measured by team and individual productivity as well as overall store performance. You’re proud to represent Apple, and you get great satisfaction from helping customers develop lifelong relationships with Apple."
good,same. High expectations in this company but it's worthy.
good,"At Apple, they say that their most important resource and their soul is their people, and they stand by that. I learned that by nurturing relationships, a truly transformational experience can occur. B2B sales can be all about numbers, forecasts, quotas, and goals. Those things are important at Apple, but doing things the right way, doing what is in the best interest of the company and the customer is the only way to achieve long term success. Through this thought process, I was able to grow our team and help each member achieve personal and career goals. I was even selected to go to the home office in Cupertino, CA for a four month project on the evolution of the next phase of our Premier Customer Service Package. But, it was the in the advancement of each of my employees while protecting the customer journey was where I had the most of my job enjoyment."
good,"When I was at Apple, my typical day involved chat and email support, for the .Mac suite of services, which is now defunct/known as iCloud. I learned a great deal about how good customer service is expected to be, as Apple is the industry leader in providing customer service to their many users. My co-workers and management were all great, and I really enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of this job is to maintain your enthusiasm when it doesn't seem fun. The reason I left there is the grind of maintaining nearly perfect metrics, and the lack of promotion in the department I was working in at the time contributed to a bit of burnout with my love for the company. I still love and use my Mac products daily, but I could no longer say the same for the job. The best part of working there is the great food in the Apple cafe, they served up some of the tastiest grub everyday."
good,"Every day at Apple is a new experience. It can range anywhere from helping an elderly person purchase their first computer, trouble shooting technical problems with iPhones and Macbooks, to translating for a deaf customer to figure out how we can best assist them. Our goal is not to sell anyone to most expensive product, but to give them the complete solution tailored to their needs. The coworkers are great, having a very diverse set of skills and hobbies and always able to assist if there is a topic that someone is having trouble with. Management is very nice. They help us to progress our learning and assist with anything we need help on. I just love having a customer come in whether they're browsing, or coming with a problem and sending them on their way with all questions answered and a smile on their face."
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Great Place to work, your opinion truly matters and you feel like it does. You never feel like a number or a profile here, there are attachment quotas and things of that nature but since there aren't bonus' there is no competition and you never make the customer feel like they are being pushed to purchase something."
good,Creating and Marketing Measuring Up has been a new and wonderful experience in the fashion and technology space. There is always something new to find out about peoples' shopping habits and how they enjoy or don't enjoy buying clothing. Cute has not always been cute until they found Measuring Up.
good,Forklift driving putting up pallets and pulling down pallets
good,"Most of my days were spent helping customers with their technology needs, whether it be the purchase of a new computer or tech support. I gained new knowledge about Mac products every day, even though I've been using them for 10 years."
good,Great Company with outstanding products- talented people- first class in every way.
good,"A typical day at Apple is more commonly fast-paced with an ocean of blue shirts and customers. Each day I make it a mission to convert every customer who walks through the glass see-through doors an owner, whether they are buying a new product or in need of a repair. The process always begins with the almighty, infamous approach."
good,Great Culture
good,"I would work for them in a heart beat. Since my son works for them I can not, I worked at Apple the same time as King Systems."
good,"Part of a great company with great products, excellent place to work."
good,"The management team was great, the job was very enjoyable, the only thing that is hard is when you are hired as a temp you are at times left out when the company is doing things so sometimes you will be the only one left on the floor"
good,Love this job. Very flexible with schedules and very focused on properly training workers. Benefits are great and pay is pretty good
good,"Who wouldn't want to work for Apple and play with their products all day. Typical days are filled with customer service, alot of questions and answers and learning about new features or products coming out. Management and Co-Workers are great! The hardest part of the job is going home and leaving all those gadgets at the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around some of the coolest things in the tech world."
good,Excellent company striving to change the average consumer's mind about complex products. Strong focus on usability and ensuring customers were taken care of properly. Great growth potential.
good,"I will miss my job as I am moving to Columbia, SC. This is a very nice, friendly, customer first based company."
good,Apple has been the best job that I have ever had. With the part time benefits and the stock purchases plans I feel like I will be with them for a long time.
good,"Apple is a unique experience that encourages employees to bring the best version of themselves to the table. Lots of challenges, lots of growth, and a deep rooted relationship with their direct managers."

good,Loved working there. I only left because I don't like working holidays. Great opportunities for overtime. Great Contest. Working from home set up. Great maternity leave
good,"Seriously as far as retail it's the best. Get paid better than other people in retail plus it's organized and they keep inventing more benefits to give you. Insurance, 402k, discounts...everything you need to be happy. "
good,"Loved working at such an innovative and fun place. I made so many friends at this job, friends that now have been my friends for years and have turned into a family. I learned so much at this job in regards to communication, professionalism, delivering/receiving feedback, and of course, visual merchandising and elements in a retail environment. Not to mention the extensive knowledge that you acquire about Apple's technology. Would recommend this company to anyone."
good,"One of the best companies to work for, ever.  They train you for the job, incentives are great. Employees are motivated to do their best and the benefits are above average"
good,"Working at apple was great, it was energizing and innovative. The workplace was beautiful and my colleague were amazing. I was working part-time and the company was really accommodating when I needed to take time off to go to some classes and to take some exam."
good,Apple was one of the best companies I have ever worked for and highly recommend anyone to work there. They take really good care of their employees  and the experience is like none other.
good,everything about this company is great; the training could be extended to a  week on the floor of call center to help ensure call flow. Love the company for weekly incentives like outside party catering during lunch.
good,"Apple as a whole is a very supportive/family oriented company. They care about their employees needs, wants and aspirations. The management team as well as the other workers are great. They try to support you in every way they can and are always willing to help."
good,loved working with so many different people! It was a challenging retail position in a good way.  I learned new things every day.  The benefits were amazing as well!
good,"People friendly environment where being receptive to new ideas and feedback is a MUST. Highly recommended! Compensation & Benefits are great compared to others, company discount, family oriented staff and environment where you can literally be yourself!"
good,The job is really fun. If you're working in a store it can be very difficult to move up though. Full-time is hardly given out and moving up can be difficult. There's people at my store who have been part-time for over 2 years and are still looking for full-time.
good,"I am challenged to be better every day, not only at work, but outside of work as well. I love my fellow employees and I feel a sense of purpose when connecting with customers."
good,"Great company, great culture, and great people. Working Customer service here isn't the typical soul-draining job that it is most other places. They allow your personality to be part of your interactions with customers, and generally give you the support you need."

good,"I work part-time for Apple from my home office, providing level 1 tech support for MacOS, iOS, and Beats products. From the day I started working there, it was clear to me that the company is dedicated to its workers -- they clearly understand the notion that a happy workforce is a productive one. Taking calls can be extremely trying (as with any public-facing role), and the technical aspects of the job often add to that difficulty. It is no easy thing to deal with an impatient customer and a complex technical problem at the same time. Fortunately, Apple understands this, and has equipped me and my colleagues with excellent training, substantial benefits, unerring support, and constant manager feedback. I cannot imagine a better company to work for in this kind of role."

Management at times weren't always on the same page but great overall. most difficult part was learning new things for the first time but you get the hang of it.

good,in 20+ yrs of tech industry roles Apple will be the company I stay with until the end of my working days.  Its faced paced and exciting with new challenges around the corner every year.  There is a super strong culture that people work really hard to reinforce and retain.  There is a really great set of experienced and high performing people in the company and not everyone who joins is used to en environment where excellence is just expected.

good,"On any given day I had variety in my role.

You would think it would be product training however mostly it was more about building skill sets to better allow me to interact with Apples many partners.

The job allows for pretty good work/life balance. Management is professional. Training is exceptional, even for people who don't necessarily understand technology. Hardest part of the job is, naturally, the customers. It's easy for people to disrespect you when they don't see your face. But the team environment makes it tolerable. Everyone is very aware of the issues and is supportive."

It was chaotic, there was drama every once in a while, but it was fun, I loved the customers, they were almost always happy and exited and it was just a place to come to to forget about your problems in your life.

Management was always attentive and helpful to whatever your needs were. Your co-workers are some of the hardest working people you'll meet. The hardest part of the job was getting the hard-nosed customers who did not want to abide by the process with which we did things. The best part of the job was seeing people excited over their new piece of technology and getting to learn it and have it become part of their lives."

All the employees be it in management or expert or genius or specialist they are all trained very well.

good,A normal work day is building connections with the people you work with and your customers.  You never had to worry about getting the sell because the product generally sells itself.  You are primarily encouraged to figure out people’s needs and what best suits them.  It is a good mix of fast paced and normal depending on if a product is being released or day of the week.  The hardest part of the job is adapting to situations as they arise.  There is always something new or unexpected and most employees are self starters that are highly adaptable. The most enjoyable part of the job is being getting to Mae the connection with so many people.  Even though I no longer work there I have made life long connections that I may have never of had if it weren’t for apple.

good,Pretty good place to work if you don't work under a contract. Contract work sucks. But I guess most of these jobs are repetitive and boring in nature.
good,A decent work culture with lot of opportunities to learn and explore new frameworks on UI. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work in a team where we get to meet members from different culture and work ethics.
good,My team is amazing. Our job is to get to know people and probe enough to ensure the best possible apple experience. Everyday there’s always room for growth and improvement. We notice the little things and execute as a whole.
good,Working for AppleCare Tech support I was able to work from home.  I would take calls from customers calling into Apple for help on their iPhone iPad or iPod at the time.  I loved it because it made me aware of how to help someone solely over the phone with there technical issues.
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,"Apple is a company that is always growing and changing and full of opportunities. There is n negative working for this company, and the opportunities are endless."
good,"Apple gave me an amazing opportunity to work from home that hands down was the best I could have asked for. I've worked from home for other remote service companies as well as a contractor but never had the job security, consistent hours, perks, and benefits that I had with Apple. The only reason I left was to start my own business. Apple paid for my college reimbursement, healthcare, tons of discounts and great swag. I had amazing team members, managers and could speak directly with my organization manager. They were interested in my input, provided lots of creative opportunities and projects. Definitely a great place to work for me who at the time was a single mom with a small toddler. Perfect work from home job."
good,I was not employed here for very long however in my short time it was a fantastic place to work. The management and all of the other employees were so understanding and caring for one another. I would highly recommend applying for a job at apple if you get the chance
good,"It was a pleasure working with unique employees that all bring something different to the table. With a diverse group, we all were able to help different types of customers with their products."
good,"Never dull moment in the apple store. Everyone is super supportive  and friendly. The energy is fun and fast paced. You're always learning new things, and get to showoff all the product everyday. Apple has its own culture that's amazing. If you're a fan of apple in anyway, I recommend it for sure!"
good,Apple is a great place to work. I am very satisfied with pay and benefits. I am just ready to move on and do something new and exciting. Everyone is very supportive within the Apple culture.
good,"it's Amazing..."

good,"As a Specialist, you help create the energy and excitement around Apple products, providing the right solutions and getting products into customers’ hands. You understand that the Apple Store is dedicated to delivering a customer experience that’s unlike any other. It starts with you discovering customers’ needs.

good,"A typical work day consist of answering phone calls, meeting and interacting with customers, and enjoy a bit of fun with co workers during break or free time between calls."
good,"I came from a call center and was able to land an at home tech support position at Apple. I lose my train of thought easily when there is noise around me so being in a private, quiet space was amazing. I have a medical condition that required me to take a medical leave of absence, my manager and Apple were very accommodating. The only reason I was let go was because my Veterans Affairs doctor refused to fill out required paperwork I needed to keep my job. I still am friends with at least one member from my old team. If I didn’t need to take time off for medical issues twice, I would have been promoted to tier 2 within a year of woking. The hardest part of the job, as with most customer service positions, was the customers that were extremely upset. Also as someone that is already a proficient computer technician and had worked previously at a major telecom/ISP company I had a “first call resolution” mentality where I wanted to help fix all the customer’s device problems. Apple’s tech culture was more “point the customer in the right direction and let them figure it out themselves” I didn’t agree with it but I did my job as I was expected to to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my team and making friends with them even though we were spread out though the USA, also working in your pajamas is nice sometimes."
good,This was a great company to work for although I worked for Apple indirectly through  a vendor company. I would always recommend anyone who asks to work here to do so.
good,The only reason why I left was because I was moving. Otherwise I would have stayed. I love that place. Management was amazing and they were there for you. They were there to help you succeed.
good,Apple offers a great culture and sound leadership. Wonderful opportunities to grow and advance. It offers a good balance between work and home living and values its employees.

good,Apple is a great company.  They really care about the employees and management really focuses more on employees self-care and making sure that they are not working over there shift and are getting their breaks.  They know that if they take care of their employees then the employees will take care of their customers.  Just a great environment and upbeat attitudes from everyone.

good,"I arrive at work 6:00 in the morning. Put on my chef coat and grab a cup of coffee. Gather all my ingredients that were prep for me the day before and print out my menu for my station. Apple computer is a corporate kitchen, like a huge gourmet cafeteria. Everyone has there station and crew. There is a lead and a sou chef appointed for every station. The sou chef has multiple stations she over looks. My station caters to about 250 people for lunch time. When i'm done and ready for lunch I present my plate to the chefs as they give me feedback and criticism. The hardest part of my job for me was doing the order guide, trying to figure out the right amount of food to order for my dishes through out the week. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I get to be creative, getting the chance to create my own dishes and the quality of  the food and ingredients i get to order."

good,"Excellent company to work for. It is not your normal retail job. There is no pressure to sell the most expensive things, but you are required to enrich the customers lives with apple product/services."
good,I loved my coworkers just felt because it was a outsourced company that it wasn’t able to treat employees as Apple would treat their employees. I think if teleperformance were to look at employees instead of stats they would see an improvement of the turnover rate at the company.

good,"I worked for Apple through college up until law school. Their teams at the retail level are fantastic, but I never thought it would translate at the corporate level. Once in corporate, I was stunned at how similar the environment was! Employees had all sorts of backgrounds -- some totally irrelevant to their job -- and everyone was focused and passionate. The work environment is very lax and it doesn't feel like there is really a hierarchy. Teams integrated well, and the opportunities to move around as desired were met with enthusiasm and help by ""superiors"" and team members. I loved my time at Apple and that is in no small part due to how it treats its employees."

We kept our clients up to date with the new releases of products, and how to incorporate those products into to their daily lives.

good,A typical day at work was enjoyable and challenging. including receiving inbound calls from customers with a wide range of iOS related issues. The teamwork was exceptional as we at Apple treated eachother fairly between both staff and management. Our management team was always ready and willing to help regardless of the situation. I would say the most difficult part of the job was going from CSAT's to VSAT;s. Anything short was unacceptable to me personally. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customer happy. Executing a resolve was a very rewarding experience therefore was incentive to work that much harder at achieving customer satisfaction.
good,"- Great part time job with benefits"

good,"ZERO ZERO ZERO work/life balance. Execs have been saying for YEARS that they understand and will make it better. But in actuality, it gets worse every year! It is obviously top management LIP SERVICE because if they meant it, they could fix it tomorrow. They have hundreds of BILLIONS in the bank. If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance, they could bring aboard the right number of folks to make that …"
good,Really... It's a great place to work. The management cares about how everyone grows. There4 are great benefits. We are are always learning and the the business is changing every day.
good,This is the stupidest thing I have ever done in my entire life. Reviewing a company that you no longer work for will only breed dishonesty or anger. Why would you force people th lie openly to the world just to continue searching for a job.

During my time at Apple, I enjoyed it for the most part because they provide great training and ample resources to assist you in your daily duties. However, the customers are typically not the most happy people to encounter and their lines are ALWAYS busy.

Planning, designing and implementing different strategic plans has been the main selling point for most of my career.  While working with the most powerful company in the world, technologically speaking, quality assurance was not just QA, nor was CTO just a title for me.  It never was, since managing billion-dollar projects requires an excellent analytical and iterative leadership."
good,A day in the call center is work as soon as you log in. I learned how to have patience and work with people. The management is fair because everyone has a chance to grow to a supervisor.

good,"This place is a great place to work great family involvement there are opportunities for advancement but be aware sometimes there is an amount of politics that plays in. While we may not focus on the numbers all the time they are strongly considered when you are applying for advanced positions, which is something you may not hear. The overall culture corporately is great sometimes it does not get to the local level like it should."

The management is extremely encouraging and truly wants to help you develop into the person that you want to become. Whatever aspirations you may have, there is always training, coaching, and self development that the leadership help you obtain. I've learned to become self reliant when it comes to my development, but also, that it's not a bad thing to ask for help when it is needed. Our leadership helps cultivate Apple's vision into a reality by strengthening the bond we have with our peers but also strengthening ourselves to be better. I would say the most challenging part of the job is giving feedback to others when it comes to correcting a behavior that isn't wanted and doing it in such a way that it lets them save face while also correcting the behavior. I think the most rewarding part of the job is when you get to have a transformation experience with your customer that you're helping and getting to see the elation that overcomes them because they are so happy with their experience."

good,"My typical day at work was started after my morning routine. I worked from home in my own office, and simply talked to customers through a headset.

I learned quite a bit about myself with regards to how I manage my team, how much I enjoy working with my team and customers on a daily basis with their goals and needs, and what I want for myself in the future.  Management is very supportive at all levels, promoting growth and development on a daily basis in a challenging and invigorating atmosphere.  My co-workers were some of the most diverse, gifted and intelligent people I have ever had the opportunity to work with, and I am glad to count them as friends.  The hardest part of the job was not having the operational expertise to be able to do everything myself, as in my previous roles with other companies, the managers, especially Store Managers, were expected to be the experts on everything in the store, and more often then not, were required to juggle many different roles at once.  Not so with Apple.  My most enjoyable part of my role was working with the customers and my team, helping them solve whatever issues they were dealing with at the time in addition to achieving their goals."

Listening to them, hearing their stories, learning about their lives and helping them enrich certain aspects with Apple technology. Management was truly wonderful, the best I've experienced in my working years. I never felt lost or confused because everywhere I turned, I saw a smiling manager ready to help at a moment's notice. My co-workers were energetic, heartfelt and genuinely happy to be at work. We all fed off of each other's energy and the energy of the bustling store to create a truly magnetic work atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was communicating effectively with visitors to the store who spoke not a word of English. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a customer out, no matter how much time it required, and seeing them leave so thankful with a smiling face. There's nothing more satisfying than having customers ask for your business card because they only want to work with you when they return to the store."

good,"Working for the Apple Store is definitely an experience in itself. Interacting with customers and my employees does not seem like work but more like talking to a bunch of friends. The managers at Apple are very easy going but still run a tight ship. The attitudes with all the employees reflect why Apple is doing so well. I am learning so much in every interaction whether it be with a customer or with a co-worker. Each day is a learning experience. The hardest part of my job is when I come across a customer that knows more about the product than I do, but rather than getting discouraged I take that as an opportunity to learn more about the product alongside with them. "

good,"Apple is a phenomenal company. It was a great learning experience, and i was able to grow as a person in the company. It taught me great customer service, and sales skills. They had a very extensive training program to teach proper customer service techniques. I enjoyed face to face interaction with the customers, and the product is the best."
good,No words can express what the training can do for you on a personal level.
good,"Apple is by far the best company I have ever been employed at. They offer their employees many benefits and excellent compensation. My manager made me feel appreciated and personally came to me for the initial interview, which is very rare since one usually has to drive to the company's office. My co-workers were young, excited and driven. They were a joy to work with. I got a MacBook Pro, iPod, speakers... a very generous package to start with. They provided me with free online training the first few weeks of starting. Apple also makes every effort to please their employees by bringing them out to eat every so often. The hardest part of the job was leaving. To continue my studies as a college student, leaving Apple was a must but also made me very sad. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for experience with an amazing company."
good,It is almost not retail at all. It's great to go to work and be able to share you passion for the great life enriching products and services that are offered.
good,"A Apple é uma empresa altamente organizada! Uma oportunidade e experiência única. Após trabalhar em uma empresa como a Apple, me sinto preparada para qualquer desafio."

The benefits including part timers are magnificent. I don't know the last time anyone received benefits and a 30 hr work week.
good,"See previous review about my working experience at Apple. While employed here, I worked in two separate positions. I started as a salesperson and did that for about 8 months before moving to the ""Family Room,"" or the technical support department."
good,"Apple was a great place to work. It was very fast paced and the store was always busy. I learned so much during my time here. From a sales standpoint, this job taught me a great amount about how to successfully interact with customers. Also, I learned how to diagnose hardware and software problems with all types of Apple equipment and how to go about fixing these problems. With roughly 100 other employees at the store, I got to know some great people. My coworkers ranged in age from 18 to around 70, and people had backgrounds in teaching, marketing, finance, photography, etc... The management was great as well. They always went out of the way to ""surprise and delight"" customers even if it was at the cost of the store. The hardest part of the job was staying on time with appointments when the store was at its busiest. The technical support appointments are in 10 minute blocks, so working fast is a must. The most enjoyable part of my time there was the look and excitement customers would feel when they opened their new products. I loved teaching people how to use their phones, iPads and computers. Also, teaching workshops was very enjoyable. These classes would consist of 3 people at the least and as much as 25 or 30. Unlike a private lesson, I was able to work with many people at once and often times, these people would come back into the store looking to work with me again."
good,"8 hours a day, wonderful culture, good benefits. Was the best to be of assistance when I helped people learn about Apple software. fun and great place to work. Wonderful to be part of such a great company!"

good,Best Company I have ever worked for thus far! Due to confidential reason I can not disclose any company personal information.
good,"A typical day was answering questions from customer regarding there product. A lot of how to do this and how to do that. I learned much from this position in regards to how to take feedback from management and use this in the daily routine. The management was far superior to any I have had in previous positions. They always seemed to work for you instead of against you. Co workers were amazing, No matter what question I had in regards to a call, there was always a coworker that could answer this question. The hardest part of this job was nothing. There was no part of this position that I saw as being hard. The atmosphere was the most enjoyable part of this position."
good,apple is a good place for growth. most of the employees are young everyone is nice kid friendly. The food is amazeing.
good,Its a great job place alot of people very fun but serious at the same time
good,"since i was technical support i was on the phones receiving calls to help people with any of their apple products and help resolve the issue whatever it was. what i learned was better empathy and even more knowledge then i already knew about apple, co workers were awesome, hardest part mainly high call volume, other wise it was great"
good,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public.  The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  "
good,A typical day at work would be repairing computers and iphones or answering any inquiries customers have. I learned how to troubleshoot and reslove technical issues with Mac's and iPhones. The hardest part about work was coming across new Mac or iPhone issues that I would quickly resolve. The most enjoyable part about work was learning about new apple products.

good,"I showed up to work each day happy to be there. I would grab breakfest with some co-workers then start my day. I would answer any emails, or respond to any phone calls I had recieved in the morning or the prior day. Then I would touch bases with different memebers of different groups. My day consisted of me running around the campus all day long (I prefer talking to people instead of emailing)."
good,"A typical workday with Apple as an At-Home-Advisor is both rewarding and flexible. Team managers are supportive as they convey a true sense of concern for your personal and professional growth. While providing call center technical support does provide its own unique set of challenges, Apple makes every effort to make sure each At-Home-Advisor is equipped with the skills and support needed to conduct your job effectively and within the established guidelines that help make it among the industry leaders in providing world class support for its customers."
good,"I would assist customers if any and all Apple device needs. This ranged from software trouble shooting, hardware replacement, or providing general knowledge of products. I learned about all there is to know about Apple products and how to fix them. I also learned superior skills with regards to customer service. I can work any every Apple product either software or hardware. The management was very flexible and allowed me to do my job and support customers. My fellow co-workers were amazing, they all had specific talents and high knowledge of Apple products ranging from general information to expert skills. The best art of the job was being able to help people out that were frustrated with products and enabling them to better understand the product."

Management is willing to accomodate students and persons with crazy schedules. Working here you will meet some of the most talented and smart people you have ever met. Although your work starts to become routine and can somedays be tedious. It is still one of the best retail stores to work for, hands down."

good,Work directly with genius bar apple store representatives to relay information used to repair hardware and software issues with macintosh merchandise.
good,"A typical day at work would start with walking in the big glass doors and taking a deep breath as I weave in and out of the rustling crowd of angry, intrigued, inspired, and overly excited, parents and children swarming the store reverently just to make my way back to the back of house. All that in itself takes about 5 minutes. Better be there early. I learned at apple that people really do love the devices; inspired by their beauty and intrigued by their crafty design and easy of workability. Apple devices and the brand this company represents and embodies taught not only myself but other employees and customers around to understand life in a different meaning. Live life to the fullest. When you're using an apple product, you are living life to the fullest. It gets no better. There is no better brand in the wold that holds the desire of the apple brand. Apple employees are hired based on merit, personality and overall friendliness and likability. These co workers are the most passionate about creating a friendly working environment and presenting one of the most unique experience for a customer that they may ever understand. Selling during christmas holiday is by far the hardest but in my opinion most enjoyable part of the experience. It is non stop action. I sometimes got headaches and got dizzy just being in that environment, but I grew to love it as I had the great pleasure of meeting some of the most amazing customers during that time. Customers come into the store rather than best buy because of the brand and the reputation that Steve Jobs imprinted into the company when"

In both scenarios my managers and fellow co-workers were an extremely open-minded, eclectic, and supportive group of individuals. I loved working for Apple, and hope that someday I will return. It is an atmosphere of hard-working, conscientious folks who probably work harder than they play, but truly care about the products and services their company produces. If you are a ""crazy one"" then you will thrive! Remember, Apple's culture is born from everyday imaginative folks, not elititest top-tier grads. (who would have thought right?!)"
