good,"Management treats you well if you perform well and leave you alone for the most part.  Sucks that they force you to try and push garbage products or services like the Hum.  Benefits are amazing, discounts for high price tag purchases are a big plus, pay is on point for a retail position, commission pay is very good if you can perform (average about 2 to 3 grand a month if you do your job well just in commissions and not including hourly).  Advancement kind of sucks because if you become a manager you get paid less and get treated like trash.  You should hear some of the calls these managers have to be on, geez they get put on blast, I witnessed someone crying because of a over bearing district manager.  Experience varies by location,  I have a great general manager that let us have fun."

good,Verizon is a great place to work. We are compensated well and the benefits are excellent. It is a tough decision to leave. The office culture is very relaxed but I know other departments are not .  The management team is very flexible and approachable. I am usually  busy because I accepted extra responsibilities. The most difficult part of the day is meeting deadlines in order to prepare for conference calls with our customers.  I am honored to be chosen to represent the company through providing updates on the conference calls. Verizon is an enjoyable place to work daily. I have a great deal of interaction with various departments throughout the company.I have learned how to expedite projects and motivate other workers within the company. I am grateful to my supervisor for allowing me the opportunity to interact with our biggest competitors and I believe I have gained their respect.

good,Great place to work. It is your typical sales job and you will make as much as you want as long as you work hard. Management varies from store to store.
good,The hours are set but if it is busy then the managers will give you the opportunity to stay. It is a fun atmosphere to work in as long as the right management is in place. I have seen both good and bad management but overall the experience was fantastic. If you are someone who works hard and takes advantage of opportunities than you'll love working for them. I won winners circle my first year working for them and it was a lot of fun to have a paid weekend off to party with the company higher-ups. I would highly recommend working for this company if you enjoy a good working atmosphere.
good,"This was a great place to work and the job was very good. It could be stressful, but it was not bad. The job was pretty good, and you could meet your sales quote each month if  you sold. I am still with this company, just that they became Frontier, and since then it has been pretty bad."

good,I love working at the phone company. Its a fast paced environment. Never a dull moment when working out in the field. I would recommend workinh there.
good,"The only reason I am no longer employed here is due to reduction in the workforce. My supervisor was excellent to work, upper management worked to resolve issues and most importantlynit was job security."
good,I truly enjoyed working at Verizon Wireless Call Center in Murfreesboro. The employee accounts and billing and helping customers with their lines and troubles! I loved to work at the Verizon Store because of the different customers coming in and helping them set up their phones.
good,"lo e working for retail but with a baby its hard now "
good,Verizon is a great place to work if you don't have kids . The offer great benefits but I personally could not stay because they base your shift on a shift bid process. I would have loved to stay and grow with Verizon I personally could not work weekends because of my children.
good,By far the best place I have ever worked for . The people are friendly and some extra incentives are provided sometimes depending on sales  expectations
good,Not enough training always not built into there budget but upper management still want to get the tasks done !! We learned on our own or you get cross trained which is even better and faster!!

good,"I am only an intern so I can't review too much on full time benefits. But as a n intern, it was great and they are very generous with their interns. Very welcoming atmosphere."
good,Really good opportunity and experience. Management isn't all that great but you don't see them since they spent there time in there office rarely coming on the floor. As team members we looked out for each other and aided anyone who need help.
good,Great place to work for. Great day to day because everyday was never the same. I loved working with people in order to try and make them happy as well as it making myself money. I started as a sales person and quickly rose to store manager where i had numbers to hit every month as well as motivate others to stay on top of there game.
good,"My call center closed. I had worked there for 9 years. The people in my center were the most amazing supportive people. We were very structured and strict. We wished to attain the highest of standards. We never settled...but it was ok..because our management was so supportive-accountable-but supportive to help everyone succeed. "
good,"I have been with Verizon for a little over six months and can say that even though the Technical Support job is hard, the training is good and the job itself is rewarding."
good,"Typical day at work is working with customers that come in to store for new equipment,  if not for personal use but for business needs. Employees are faced with challenges day to day. The most rewarding job is seeing the reaction of a satisfied customers face after the transaction. If you have the ability to converse with all people with different personalities and you love a challenge in a fast working and ever changing environment, then this is the job for you."
good,Overall this would be a wonderful place to be employed however I am a temp / consultant and I have been told they are not hiring permanent at this time.

good,"Very challenging, fast paced, large business mentality, communication difficult at times, working withthe customers is the best part of the day by making them happy about the service they commited to."
good,Verizon pays well. They took care of the hourly and management team. When I worked there I was very happy. There are many different roles within the company.
good,For day one your treated like family. Yes you there to work but it's a fun filled atmosphere. The managers and employees areally engaged in there jobs ando enjoy bring there. The time off is great too.

good,"Good working Environment and good management, with a great work experience  on top that we can work from home so this gives flexibility for your life ."
good,Typical day at work would be to manage my sales team. Make sure they were hitting a daily/monthly quota. I learned that people learn best by example. As for upper management is where I found my frustration because I felt we were just number creators to them grinding in and out every single day with a horrible commission structure. My most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to close a tremendous sale while making the customer happy. Also teaching some non tech savvy customers how to use technology.
good,"I worked here for 18 years, started in retail and worked my way through different divisions and positions. "
good,Great place to work. Ever changing environment. They pay for school up front which was important to me. The people are great and the culture is fun while still being productive. Communication of upper level policies/ decisions not clear sometimes so can create an environment of mistrust but overall a great place to work.
good,"I started with a sales job to pay the bills, and it's now 11 years later and I have a career.  VZ is not glamorous, but it's a great company to start a career with because there's an opportunity to grow out of an entry level job into a mid level position...but moving beyond mid level is not typical because after all VZ is still a phone company (we'll see if that's still true in 5 years) and is still a company we're employees remain for 20+ years...makes for little to no opportunities beyond mid level positions."
good,"Being a, ""V Teamer"" is a fantastic and challenging position.  Verizon is driven to make the vision of a digital future possible.  The, ""Credo"" is lived out each day by talented individuals in powerful teams focused on doing what is right for customers."
good,"I enjoyed my 17+ years there.  "
good,"I was a Retail Support Specialist, previously an Experience Specialist. I loved my job. Every day was different. I worked on the floor assisting customers, solutions specialists, and solutions managers. I was also responsible for ""back of house"" duties such as inventory, merchandising, etc. I was very happy with my pay, benefits, time off, and location. I loved my coworkers and managers. I no longer work with Verizon because they eliminated my position. It was very unexpected, and I hated to leave."

Overall a great company with great benefits and long term career opportunities.

good,"Verizon Business was a wonderful place to work. I was laid off due to termination of position I held. Unfortunately, due to medical issues I was unable to actively search internally for another position to what I was encouraged to do so. My management team within the organization was wonderful and supportive no matter what happened or what came up. I would go back anytime I was given the oppurtunity to do so."
good,Working environment is good.
good,"While employed at VZW as a Greeter during the holiday season of 2010- 2011 was a real eye opener. Looking at Verizon from a customers perspective is totally different than what I know Verizon to stand for today. At my location the group of people i had the pleasure of working with were all great and we all complimented each other in the store very well to make are store better and improve in our numbers as a WHOLE! It was really great to say that i played a role in making that dream come possible along side the other representatives in the store. My only wish is that I had not been let go after only 6 short months, and with bringing in only my hard work and determination to help my location achieve it's goals."
good,"The company was an excellent company that I worked for and had to move to tampa, which is the reason that I had to resign from the position."
good,"Verizon Wireless gives their employees many opportunities to progress in their careers. The pay/benefits are great and it is rather easy to move to the next level, as long as you are willing to put in the effort to achieve it."
good,Fantastic Company would go back today if possible. I lost my job due to reduction in force. I was compensated very well while employed and in my severance package. Great Company even though what they done changed my life  for the worse   Not personal just business

good,"It's a great company to work for. The benefits are great, as well as the paid. The products & services that they offer to employees are good as well. If you can get in the door its a great company to work for I think."

good,"A company that is reinventing its culture and focusing more on employees, and also working hard to update legacy applications, architectures and technologies."

good,"I worked cross functionally daily with various groups across the organization on projects that impacted my product. "
good,If you work hard you will have plenty of opportunities and will be compensated well. The bad- some employees are working too hard and do not respond to your emails.
good,"Recommended Work place."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,There was always a sense of purpose in the office and the work was rewarding.  Goals are clearly stated at the beginning of the year and the expectation is that every employee receive regular feedback as well as a mid year and end of year review.

good,"Working at Verizon was a awesome experience. Everyday I learned something new even after working there for a year. Manager was nice and was willing to help out at any given moment. Only complaint is pay was extremely low and the customers were sometimes hard to handle. As a store, even if it wasn't our fault or issue, we would strive to help the customer out in any given situation to the best of our ability."
good,"Great opportunity to build relationships and career advancement. Hourly and commission based, allowing you to live a life you’ve always wanted and hoped for."
good,"My career at Verizon included positions such as, Consumer Sales & Service Representative, Instructor in Workforce Development, Team Leader in Sales & Service, Local Manager in Operations/Customer Service.  My work experience gave me the ability to assist my customers, my direct reports, the intra company employees such as technicians in a professional and proficient way.   My direct goal has always been to focus on providing a positive customer experience and to lead a team with respect.  Verizon provided me with the tools  needed to provide the best service in every position acquired."
good,"I enjoy my working area, also my Managers. They make it a great place to work at, and work for. The flexibility is great, along with my peers as well. I have been with the company now for 5 years,  I also love the fact that this is  somewhere where you can continue to grow."
good,"I was fortunate enough to work at a Verizon location with a very close-knit staff. One might assume working for a corporate location would be cold, but our staff really cared about each other and took pride in making our customers happy and finding solutions. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a sales job with ethics."
good,Easton Verizon Store @ 4138 Seward St Columbus OH 43219 was the best career I ever had! The managers were awesome and had your back! The team as well! The environment was all I wanted in a company! Benefits are A1 which start day 1. Would go back in a heartbeat!
good,Overall great company to work for. However my experience leaving the company was not fair. I lost my job due to a dispute between company and Union after being a diamond club sales person for 4 years out of 8. That is considered a high achievement and is rewarded with a trip and money incentives
good,"I manged an onsite fitness center that provided our Call Center employees a place to workout, before, during or after their shift. Verizon was very big on creating a healthy culture."
good,"I learn s much from selling phones and different product while I was in the store. Then, I transfer over to the call center to learn the difference aspect taking outbound calls. Excellent company to work for alway meeting new face throughout the company."
good,My experience at Verizon was great.  The pay was excellent and the job itself was adventurous. It felt great to provide good service for customers. It was exciting to constantly learn new things on the job that would help you circumvent the things you already know. I had a wonderful time working for Verizon.
good,As as sales Rep we were the front line of the company. Exercising great customers service and providing them with everything they needed. Family atmosphere with room for growth and experience. Hardest part of the job was not being able to meet a customers needs no matter what we were able to do for them. Verizon is a great company to work for with room for growth when presented.
good,I wouldn’t recommend I feel like that didn’t understand situations just make sure you stay busy etc customers will complain but other thank that it’s cool
good,Learned how to advance myself.  I was encouraged to better my education through internal classes and education reimbursement program for collage. Was allowed to work autonomously and I was trusted.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Hands down, it was a great work environment to be in! Management created a competitive and fun atmosphere for everyone to win.  Working at Verizon felt like working amongst family."

good,Work culture is encouraging and challenging roles are given to improve our subject expertise. Bonuses are given fairly for top performers. New technologies and tools are adopted time to time and innovative programs are conducted to motivate developers to showcase their talent and get suitable rewards.
good,At Verizon I learned so much about the Procurement world and moved around to be sure my skills were challenged and improved. I enjoyed the experience.
good,"Verizon is a great company that allows you to grow as much as you would like..  The training that is set aside for you is always accessible and no time limited, which allows you to work on the training at your pace. Ability to work as a team to complete any and all projects.  A plus to work with so many team members to resolve a problem/ outage says a lot for Verizon to clear the trouble and restore service to the network or customer."
good,"Working there was very interesting and learned a lot on what it take to build and run a wireless network. One of the most think need to know, you must have a degree from college."
good,The Benefits surpass the pay and the fact they offer tuition reimbursement is an added bonus. The management staff was great and the fitness center added benefits as well.
good,"My entire adult career was with Verizon (and MCI before the merger in 2006) and I was afforded a number of opportunities to learn, grow and further develop my career."
good,"I loved my 20 years at Verizon. If you're unhappy with one job, there are thousands of others you can hop to. I'd do it all over again! The benefits are some of the best around. Was able to semi-retire at age 43 and go do something else for Chapter 2."
good,"Fast paced and challenging environment. Good culture and professional coworkers and peers. Long hours and demanding, but pay to performance opportunities made the dedication worth while. I was proud to have been on the team and work with the client base, delivering a quality experience."
good,Good pay and very good benefits. Most people are easy to work with and do their job well. The biggest draw back is the top down management that is focus on numbers
good,"I was hired into the Paging department and was there for 10 years. Our Paging supervisor was the best boss I ever had. Sadly our department was outsourced to India. My job required interaction with the Graphic artist, among other departments. We all worked together to get all our directories to the printer on time. They are a great company to work for."
good,"A typical day at VZW was a daily huddle to go over things that needs to take place for that day and any changes. Also, logging into computers and answering call from customer regarding bills, features and technical issues. We had one on ones with are supervisors,"
good,Good place to work. Manager made working in store fun and productive. We were a big family and I missed everyone I worked with. It was a long drive to the store but it didn’t matter because of the work environment I enjoyed working in.
good,Opportunity should be across the board to job shadow other departments . It seems like jumping through hoops. To my understanding Verizon is to help you in your career goals n this is part of the process
good,Working here is like being with family especially co-workers are very supportive. There a little divide sometimes between management and workers. but overall you will enjoy working here.
good,I loved Verizon wireless... great place to start and keep a very long career. With today’s technology it’s not difficult to sell plans and accessories.. the phones sell themselves.. it was tough introducing Androids and Iphones in 2010
good,Benefits and culture were great.  You get work from home one day a week  did not have an on-site manager.  Good vacation for non-union hourly employees.  Union employees were a headache
good,"Verizon is the company where I built an impressive record of achievements through a dedicated 17-year career. I was provided with opportunities to work across different technology initiatives that were key objectives for the company to embark on the digital transformation journey. Overall, a great place to work."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"My input is valued at Verizon. I enjoy my atmosphere, leadership and work life balance. I am able to work from home or a flexible location. They help the community and support great organizations."
good,"During a typical day I would answer inbound phone calls to assist customer with activating or troubleshooting there cell phones, laptop, data cards etc.  I learned how to be patient with each customer and I learn different techniques on how to walk customers through troubleshooting steps. Management was great, they always showed a willingness to help. The hardest part of the job was when I came across a issue that I was not able to resolve on the first call. The most enjoyable part was when a customer call in that's been having issues and I was able to resolve it for them. diversity"
good,There is no typical day at Verizon. Every day is different which keeps each day interesting. We get to work with some of the best people in the industry.
good,team work and great hours. Outside plant was great at the time they were pulling fiber out there. we stayed busy and made plenty of money! plan to work overtime and enjoy
good,"Good pay, great perks, good career advancement opportunity. The only problem is that just like any call center job it gets old and monotone after a while."
good,"Work days were busy and demanding which is what I like. After clocking in I’d open emails to follow up with customers that needed assistance with a purchase, bill related questions or sale related situations. All in all every customer was given top of the line customer service while leading in employee rankings."
good,It is a great place to work they pay well and have great benefits. The paid time off is great also basically you start off with 3 weeks paid time off.They have very large cafeteria and have breakrooms on every floor.
good,This was by far the best employer I have worked for with diversity of shifts ability to change schedules with a co-worker etc.   It made being a single parent a breeze!
good,"Focus on customer experience is always top concern from top management to the field engineers. Meaning, the customer is important to then entire team."
good,"Over 23 years in Legal Compliance team, excellent health, and vision, dental benefits. Lots of perks and sales incentives, loved being part of the team for many years. Certain departments you feel part of the team, to where other departments you can work alone and truly thrive."
good,"Great company, awesome benefits, tuition offers. I seen many changes with this company and really enjoyed the people i worked with. Work life balance wasn't always in your favor but the vacation time definitely comes in handy"
good,"Verizon is a good place to work with benefits starting on day one. Work is high paced when busy requiring you to be a multitasker. The support from coworkers was why I continued with Verizon  for 13 years. I learned how to organize, stay positive, and communicate better, all skills asked for by most employers. It is an environment of change so you need to be ready to adapt."
good,"Great workplace culture, surrounded by employees that are competent and who seek growth. It can be a highly competitive environment but what sales environment is not like that. The only reason why I left the company was because their financial/accounting department is mostly located in Florida which was not part of my plans to move there for the moment."
good,"I worked for verizon for 16 years, and I left the company because they offered me yet another benefit, an amazing separation package. I would encourage anyone to apply."
good,"While the pay structure for commissions is constantly evolving, which may stress some people out, I found that it made it easier for me to adapt on how I wanted to make my money. Verizon really cares about the happiness of their employees and the benefits are incredible!"
good,"Sales can be a bit stressing since there is alot of competition , but along the way you learn alot. Verizon is also very good with rewarding their employees which to me makes you feel like Verizon appreciates you alot."
good,Good place I liked it...meet hundreds of people ..knew it was time to retire still miss my job and the people I met...thanks Verizon..fun fun fun ...made me a great typist and sales person...
good,I worked at this company for 21 years and never had an immediate supervisor that I didn't enjoy working for.  The benefits and focus on work/life balance are exceptional.
good,Great Work life balance- the workplace culture is diverse and allows room for better opportunities.  Verizon has taught me a lot about being on time and always planning ahead.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."

good,Enjoyed my entire time employed at Verizon! Great promotional opportunity. Great way to interact with customers and build customer satisfaction skills.

good,"I scanned phones I love to work for this company,I worked as a temp I pray that some day I can go back there,I loved the manager staff it wasn’t to hot nor to cold in the building,security all over the place"
good,Lots of advancement and flexibility with work schedule. It does require you to work holidays and weekends as well as long and late hours. Other than that I loved working there.
good,I loved not having to fight in traffic or worry about high gas prices but it was hard to find a balance for myself working from home.  In my breaks I would not rest and would prep dinner or do chores without any real down or break times.  For me I needed a break from being at home but loved the entire culture of Verizon.
good,"I wouldn't change a thing about my work experience at "
good,I have nothing bad to say about this company.  The pay is very good if you are willing to work hard and take direction and most of the managers like to create a fun working environment.

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Job that was viewed as a stepping stone and place to learn sales techniques that turned into a career with an opportunity for great compensation and included benefits from first day worked.
good,Worked their almost 30yrs until downsizing became popular.  Loved my job and the employees and others I have met throughout the years.  It was a family to me.  I was so close to my group of employees from day 1 until I had no choice but to downsize.  I still keep in touch with them.  I only hope the new Verizon still has that comradery with all employess; both management and non-management.
good,"It was a nice place to work but our work became automated and the job was not stable.  I was in the same department for 12.5 years.  I promoted my way up quickly from Associate Tech to Tech, Switch Tech, Sr Tech and Supervisor then finally Sr. Manager.  Not a lot of companies offer that kind of opportunity.  Our company began writing scripts and eliminating the need for us to use tools to troubleshoot the network.  We had several RIF's and watched people being walked out of the door.  That said, Verizon offered a buyout package to 40k employees.  I decided to take it."
good,"Great compensation, work-life balance can be tricky.  Some managers will give you a set schedule but others will make the schedule based on retail needs which is a bummer."
good,I don't really have time to write a review.  It was a great place to work.  I enjoyed all the people there.  It was a retail environment so you needed to be available to help all walkins.
good,"Work for Verizon landline phone and Internet and customer service assistance. The job is very demanding at times very stressful but Verizon does have great pay and benefits for the LANLine side of the business. Verizon wireless is a separate entity, and the pay and benefits on that side of the business Is much less."
good,Verizon is a great place for driven hard working individuals. Compensation is very competitive and there are many opportunities to advance within the company. The only challenge is that Verizon adapts and changes quickly which can often require relocation for employees and their families.
good,"Verizon has a great compensation package"
good,If you work hard enough at your metrics you can advance in company or at least have a great bonus at the end of the year. I was on the escalation's team and took supervisor calls. I enjoyed talking to customers and loved my job. had to relocate back to the west coast or else I would still work for the company.
good,"Not much projects to gain technical knowledge  and good place to balance work and life and good pay."
good,The have lots of benefits and my management team was awesome. I enjoyed the work that I did making sure that the networks were up in running in 14 different stores

good,"Good Management "
good,I loved the atmosphere. The people were awestome.Loved working with the customers although sometimes they could be difficult. Pay was good and easy to advance in the company.
good,"As a field engineer, I was given the authority to make educated decisions and manage my time to best serve the need of the Network.  Their culture is diverse and inter-departmental collaboration was always encouraged.  The hardest part of the job is the on-call schedule where safety issues could arise due to the time of day (night) and the location of the task could be performed.  The job kept me engaged due to the variety of task that was called for in the field."
good,great company to work for !! I loved my time at Verizon until a new Director came in and changed the entire structure...  I would still be there if not for her
good,Verizon is a fast-paced work environment.  There is continuous training as products and services change frequently in the wireless industry.  There is a need to keep track of multiple subjects on each call as almost nobody has just one issue when troubleshooting a phone.  Management is very supportive and rarely unavailable when that support is needed.  The culture of the company is that of support.  Employees are valued by Verizon and on-going efforts are made to keep morale high.  The hardest part of the job was getting a lonely or talkative person off of the phone once the purpose of the call had been resolved.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the elation that many people expressed once their reason for calling was resolved.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is at the forefront of technology and always open to change. It's a very competitive and rewarding work environment. The initiatives and projects worked on have a direct impact on daily business and personal needs.
good,"This work environment was very fast paced and kept me busy with doing my job.  As a 411 operator, I would get all kinds of bizarre calls, however, I enjoyed it because it was always fun and every day you never knew what to expect."
good,Not appropriate to review due to a voluntary separation agreement. I will not be writing any additional info to ensure I do not jeopardize the agreement I signed when retiring.

good,"Best Company I ever left! I worked for the Best region, TN NE a lot has changed but there was really nothing like it, not even within the company! We had the Best culture! But Verizon overall has the Best benefits and advancement options!"
good,Working for Verizon was great.  They are a fortune 500 company with great visions.  I was sad when Frontier bought out Verizon in Florida.  I have been happy at Verizon for 10 years and excelled daily at my job in sales.
good,The management that i worked under were very helpful and motivated me to learn more and work smartly. I have learned a lot of new technologies here. The work here was challenging
good,"This job helped me in planning mt career goals,"
good,"Verizon is a good company to work in.  The credo drives the business and the industry is exciting and always changing.  If you enjoy technology and the mobile communications piece of the world, Verizon may be for you!"
good,Days begin at your garage location where you receive your work.  You then head out to each job location to do your repairs. It is required that you keep your customers informed as much as possible.  Your day continues with job after job and at times may require working late.
good,Great culture; Strong brand; Good corporate citizen; Sound strategy based on 5G and technology advancements; Leadership guidance and decision making is prudent
good,"A typical day at work: Working on project plans, holding meetings to   "
good,"Verizon Wireless offers its employees many attractive benefits, like dental, 401 k match contribution, paid vacations, sick days, personal time off, etc. The company provides seminars as well as training for new products and services so no experience necessary to work there. Very conflicting work schedule (three different shifts) every week, and weekends. Slow upward mobility within the company since promotions are primarily given based on sales achievements rather than proper qualifications. Often very stressful sales based commission position since quota changes every month which many times is unrealistic based on store traffic. Many employees conduct dishonest business approaches in order to reach their quotas and keep their jobs."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."

good,"I actually worked for three different company's during my 40 yr. career. GTE, Verizon and Frontier. But during the Verizon yrs. it was quite challenging and rewarding. It was a time when they started to build their wireless networks to compete and provide the best network for all customer's. Most if not all the employee's were from GTE company when Verizon bought them in 2001. So we were all trained, and had the experienced and knowledge to build the networks they were wanting.

Customer focused company to bring in repeat customers and add new customers."

Verizon is a conglomeration of many companies so there are a lot of Silos and there is a lot of oppertunities for improvement...and that is what makes it exciting...there are challanges to solve every day.  The most important thing I would say is that you feel like a valued member of the company and the company take many steps to makesure you are a part of the team."

good,"At Verizon, I was my own business owner. I was entrusted to operate as a team, but independently. I throughly enjoyed working there. It had a great, rewarded culture and management was easy to work with."
good,Great for pushy sales. If you don't mind badgering customers to get your check then it's great. The people are cool but my district manager was awful when I worked there. Great to get some real retail sales skills tho.
good,"The team I work with and management is awesome! No two days are alike, the pace is exciting, and the best thing is teaching someone how to use a phone."
good,Great company to work for. Monthly quotas can be challenging but it is highly rewarded when you hit/exceed them. Pay is great. Down side is you have to work retail hours.

good,It sure is a great place to work and you can advance a lot in this place with the right talent. I was given a suitable work environment and everyone was so helpful and i got to learn a lot.
good,"I would receive a list of job requirements in the morning on my laptop and would be expected to complete the job tasks that day and completing them with quality and no rework. I would sometimes be required to work overtime which did gladly.I learned how to manage my time during a full scheduled work day and how to work well with customers and management as well.the culture was team oriented and i would assist other employees if necessary.The hardest part of the job was sometimes working during the tropical storms as well as during hurricanes, which required you to be extra safe and aware of your surroundings.I really enjoyed the work and gratification of helping customers get there service back to excellent working condition and working as a team with my fellow team members."
good,great place to work pays extremely well but higher up don't know how to manage or adjust to different stores. I would recommend this job for a college student or anyone who has great people skills.
good,"Verizon was a great place to work because you were by yourself most of the time. Sometimes you were able to meet with the customers but there are other times when they were not around because the issue was mainly outside. As a technician, I learned many things about telephony and every new job was different from the previous so I was constantly learning every minute of the day. I learned about splicing, how dial tones were created and sent from the Central Office, operating in and out of F1 and F2 terminals, how to properly diagnose problems by just speaking to the customers, and developing excellent customer service skills."

It depends on the manager. My first manager wasn't that great then they switched managers and the store environment changed completely."
good,"Promotion and growth is expected and will eventually come if your are steering towards being a trainer, supervisor, retail, or AD.  However if you are in the call center an you would want to branch out towards the cell technician, data center technician, or IT in generally it is very difficult to secure those types of jobs from the ""inside out"" i.e. call center rep to cell technician or tech support rep to data center tech."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for and there is a lot of potential if you stick with it. They provide great training to set you up for success.

I enjoyed the training programs created to learn new products and services, and the attention to detail when it came down to providing employees with the tools they needed to succeed. The benefits of working for Verizon were excellent, and allowed me to further my education. Overall the culture was great and allowed people to grow within the company."
good,"When you come into work you felt secure with badge walk in. The environment was multicultural and pleasant people to interact with. The management team was warm and friendly but you understood when it was time to work, very family oriented place to work. The hardest part of the job was the training get overwhelmed with so much information. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you had the material that you needed for the job training."
good,Poor management training on growing personnel.  Far to much concern on production and not maintaining a successful relationship to progress the workers to a new position.
good,"Every workday brought up new challenges and opportunities. Being ""Customer focused"" allows us to see our operations from a customer's point of view.  This is always a learning opportunity. "

good,"Many opportunities and great people to work with, benefits were excellent and the vacation and personal days offered were super.  Room to advance and work with other departments as needed, offered school tuition and online training for many jobs."
good,"Great place to work, I work with fantastic people, we were like a family. I learned a lot working for Verizon. I started in Totowa's office, moved to Madison, Newark, Teaneck and now at Livingston. There was a change everyday but I welcome the change. My only con was my commute to work it was a hard life balance. I'm looking for employment closer to my home."

good,"The position I held was cut throughout the company nationwide. However, I would take my job back today in a heartbeat. Hands down the best company I have ever worked for regarding compensation and benefits. To work here, you must be willing to put the time in to stay up to date on technology, trends, competitors, and troubleshooting. The training they offer is actually pleasant to go to. I learned a lot about the industry, corporations, and myself while working here."

They have top notch trainers coaches and manager. Verizon says they value their employees they have never shown me anyting but that in my time with them. Store managers, district managers even  regional managers will take the time to learn Who You Are what makes you tick and how they can advance your career because once you're ""bought in"" to the VZW culture, you are an investment to the company. I felt valued and respected."

In certain call centers, advancement is low, but you can apply to work in other centers throughout the USA."
good,"We where GTE first and then we where sold to Verizon, then we where sold again to Frontier. The hardest part of the job is trying to do the best you can and help in anyway. You can go any place with this company. The hardest part of the job is the not knowing and what is going to help.  You have management are out there and you have management that know how to treat everybody.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that you have people that you work with everyday that you enjoy and management that can make your day."
good,Verizon was a really great place to work for. Very team oriented and fast paced environment that allowed all sales reps to sell products and plans and profit.

Work place was diverse, I met great fellow employees and made some long lasting friendships. The hardest part of the job was sitting in a cubicle repeating the same phrase for every call ""City and State Please, Thank you I will check"". I would come home and answer the same thing cause I said it repeatedly for 8 hours a day 5 days a week for two years. Most enjoyable part was taking my lunch and conversing with fellow employees."

good,Love the company and the environment career advancement in the gulf is tough due to managers not advancing. Makes it tough for the younger generation.
good,Just be ready to work and to not to have a life besides Verizon. The people you work with is very nice a most of the management people are really good. I will go back if the have office hours and not retail hours

good,Getting involved with customers can be interesting. Dealing with escalations and other things that customer do not understand and we do not have a valid reason can be hard to explain.
good,"Good company, excellent benefits and dedicated to provide the best customer service possible. Not a boring place to work each day comes with new challenges,"

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Managed 25 people"
good,"Verizon is a very friendly and competitive environment with a major opportunity to make heavy income. A typical day at work involves greeting customers and assessing their concerns whether its about getting service, or changing a plan or even getting a new phone. We was managed by a friendly family enthused guy who believed in making sure that each employees are satisfied."
good,"Verizon has given me great opportunities. They support women in the workforce and have encouraged me in every move I want to make. They’re making quotas harder to achieve in sales, but were compensated well nonetheless."
good,Constantly changing technology kept the job interesting. There was a lot of opportunity for advancement and to learn new things. Management staff that I worked with was supportive and helpful.
good,"Until we were laid off Verizon was the best company I've ever worked for.  They promoted education, advancing your career, and took care of their employees financially."
good,Great job!  Company chose to spin off and sell information sales division. The new sales platform was not as widely accepted by potential business clients.
good,Excellent company to work for. I have been with Verizon for over 12 years and it is a wonderful place with lot of opportunities  for career growth and good supportive management.
good,"Its a good place to work. You will work hard and sometimes long days but you are well paid for it. The benefits package is by far one of the best. Plus they value their people.  If you put in the time and work hard, they will return the investment to you."
good,they are worth working for   if your looking for a company that will help you along your career path or just to help you build your resume Verizon is the company to apply for and even if you don't get the first call back keep trying
good,Verizon is exceptional company to work for. The benefits are great! You can easily work up the ladder internally as well as external. You have options of travel within the company to train offshore.
good,"Job was stressful at times.  You never knew if you would have a job from one year to next.  Company sold four times in 24 years I was there.  After one of these sells, I was laid off with 18 years of service.  With another sell, I had to transfer to another part of state to keep job   I finally managed to get rehired and get my retirement."
good,Very Stressful but very fulfilling. Management is always available to discuss any concerns and there is a very strong team mentality and everyone enjoys working together. Verizon is an awesome company to work for if you get the chance. If my position had not been eliminated I would have stayed forever.
good,"Great place to work unfortunately closed office in connecticut. People wwre nice and thwy sis alot for employees to keep us motivated auch as carnivals, games food days"
good,I spent 10 wonderful years with Verizon Wireless. In that time I was able to gain some very valuable skills which enabled me to advance in the company. I had some of the best managers an employee could ask for except one but they are mainly awesome.
good,"Arrive log in and hit the sales floor"
good,"This can be a very challenging job to some. I enjoyed my team members, continual training, benefits, and atmosphere. I am not sure how the environment is now due to industry changes with growth but I am thankful to have worked there and learned the skills that I have learned."
good,"The culture, getting to know new people. You learn new things everday.This job is complex but if you like learning new things this is a great job for you. The managers are great people are also"
good,Had weekly meetings and always supported one another. We always made sure clients were happy. Management took there time to teach and also offered overtime. Just an overall great place to work. They also offered permanent positions to hard working employees.
good,"It's definitely a stressful job, but worth it if you can handle the environment. Verizon pays their employees well and gives them a lot of benefits that make it worth working there. The customers are difficult, probably the hardest part of the job, but co-workers and fun activities throughout the week at work definitely help."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon recognized the high stress level of its positions, and therefore created a phenomenal culture with incentives and activities to promote happiness and a stress-free work place."
good,"Very nice and competitive environment, pays well, very good management, scheduling is very flexible. very good training program. good paid training as well"
good,"Many opportunities for progression.  A typical day in management is filled with meetings with customers, vendors, senior management and team to ensure all requirements of the job are being fulfilled.  My management gives me the freedom to pick up the ball and run with it.  Culture in the the time I've been here is fairly fast paced, friendly and filled with peers and subordinates willing to assist you.  There is no hardest part of my job and the most enjoyable part is being able to be creative in establishing processes for my team and the collaboration that takes place daily in order to be successful."
good,"Take the opportunity for great resume builder, definitely builds character. I had the time of my life and wouldn't be where I am without Verizon career."
good,"Awesome manager make the place good to work ."
good,"I would recommend Verizon. Solid mananagment team with a fair and equitable compensation plan for the sales force.  I worked with Verizon Wireless for four years and would have gladly worked another four.  Our Sacramento Sales Office was closed in 2014, regrettably."
good,"The company is a great one to work for; but you need to do your job. The only way this fast-paced environment is for you, is if you prove yourself worthy, by simply doing your job."
good,"Verizon also had incredibly good people and trainers.  What thrilled me being at Verizon was the high tech built into iOS and Android cellphones. While I was there the speeds advanced in the industry and Verizon was always at the forefront of 3G, 4G, and now 4G LTE data transfer and call reception was extremely good compared to other providers.  "
good,"The digital world promises consumers a better, more connected life, and we’re the ones delivering it. We make it possible for people to stay in touch and businesses to connect with their customers. We’re also bringing technology and hands-on learning opportunities directly to kids who need it most. Our goal is to inspire tomorrow’s creators to use technology to build brighter futures for themselves, their families and the world."
good,"Is a balanced company, hard work, no opportunity for advancement.  Good benefits, a countrywide company.  You can have many opportunities outside of Florida."
good,The benefits were terrific and the stores I worked at were innovative and great. I made many friends all over from Texas to Florida. I was responsible for customer service which allowed me to have many great situations to create great customers.
good,"Reviewing types of work to be done involving service orders, and maintenance tickets. Most of the time busy answering phones from other departments. learned much from first aid to many types of communication systems, and devices, tools, documents and other equipment. In the early years management was involved with facilitating the work to be done. Later a more relaxed setting. The workplace had close involvement from employees. The hardest part of the job would involve the process of getting the correct information from the service order output, in order to keep customers from being out of service. Bonding with other employees, and workshops to implement the correct response from each department."
good,I worked on a team handling inbound calls from upset former customers. who was trying to get Verizon to take away negative reporting on they're credit report.
good,"Excellent work environment, great pay structure, and there was always an opportunity to provide assistance to a customer in need. Overall the experience is one that I recommend to anyone who enjoys working in the sales arena."
good,"I worked at my own pace, prioritizing my tasks to perform efficiently. I learned a lot of Microsoft and other types of software. Management for our group wasn't in the sa,e location as we were. As long as we performed dependably, they let us do our thing. Other groups within the same building were not treated the same. , but they were sales and they got perks we didn't as in endive to keep yheir numbers up. Hardest part of the job Wes my drive to work, 60-75 minutes per day, each way. Most enjoyable part was they I was treated with respect and appreciated for my strengths and abilities."
good,"I would have stayed had I not had to relocate and I wish, I could have been a part of the Virtual Team that started as I was leaving...I will continue, to check and see if they change the Virtual Team work requirements..."
good,Working at this company has provided me with a lot of knowledge in the telecommunications field. Everyday I get the pleasure of speaking to someone new. I enjoy assisting customers setting up their business needs
good,"Reasonable workloads, excellent compensation, great people. Flexible schedule, understanding leadership, team environment. Only negative...upward mobility non-existent under 10 years of employment."
good,"A day at work in this store is like going to work with your brothers and sister, our culture and belief in each other was unlike anything i've ever been apart of in the work place. We have to stay up to date on all technology and know how it applies to each and ever customers individual situation and life. My management team have become mentors in my life not just work, I have learned more from them than all other jobs together. Our culture was something we live daily in and out of work, living life though energy effort and passion. The most difficult part of my job would be the quota, while we get compensated very well for the levels of stress we deal with, the one thing we can not control is the traffic which can be an added pressure when for example this year alone we are down 35% in traffic. The most enjoyable part of my job is coming to work with a team that effectively lives out the culture we have developed in our store, working with energy effort, and passion in every opportunity we have to help a customer."
good,"Verizon is good company to work."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great company if you can take the stress.  Great pay and benefits. Work hard and you will move up quickly. Do not wait on someone to offer an opportunity.
good,"Very friendly colleagues and supportive, learned all the aspects of teleconferencing with audio/video/net. Communicated with various customers in various countries. I worked early shifts and participated in various test calls throughout the night. Loved training other agents on different customer products."
good,"Great company too work for and amazing benefits. Allows for balance between work and life, and also allows for growth within the company. Definitely recommend it"
good,"Large company that provides amazing benefits, and opportunity for personal growth and development.  Learned a lot about myself, leading teams and had excellent mentors along the way through 10 years with Verizon"
good,Verizon was a great company to work for... Very flexible...Great vacation and sick days and personal days off. Benefits start as soon as you start working there. Had many shifts available to work. Rewarding company
good,"Professional services contract with CSX Transportation Railroad. Great work relationships with customers and suppliers. Highly technical with strict SLA's, building high availability for strategic sites."
good,Traditional call center atmosphere. Very fast paced but opportunity for advancement and responsibility. Great company and benefits that match. Not for the faint of heart.
good,"Working at verizon has been really exciting. Coming to work early and on time and and my  boss has to ask me to immediately get to work and I find myeself doing the work with all zeal to ensure that the day's tasks are done well."
good,"A very challenging job taking over 1,000 calls for customers needing phone numbers of residence, business and government requests.  Management kept us on our toes to make sure we gave the very best service which each and every customer deserves no matter how irate they may be.  Parties and rewards were all part of keeping a good moral within the office.   After each six and 12 months during a year we were given a performance review to see how we had improved in all phases of our work including attendance, work performance and contributing to a positive work environment.  In most cases management was fair, tried to treat each employee in a respectful way, encouraged us to further our education and look for advancement within the company.  Overall in the 25 plus years that I worked for Verizon, my assessment was that it was an excellent one and would be very hard to find such a great company again."
good,"No two days are the same.  There are such ups and down on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  "
good,"It is a great place to work. Sometimes it can be overwhelming but if you have thick skin you can handle it. "
good,"The benefits available to Verizon employees are INCREDIBLE by today's standards. When many employers see the bi-weekly paycheck as their employees' incentive to work, Verizon provides above-standard vacation and personal time to allow for the life-work balance. Call centers also allow for Flex Time to allow employees even more options in taking time off when needed or wanted. Contrary to many employers, Verizon allows for up to $8000 per year in tuition benefits, knowing that the certifications and degrees earned can be used by the employee outside of Verizon for other opportunities. Management in the several locations where I have worked or visited have taken a serious interest in the career advancement opportunities for employees, even going so far as arranging visits to locations that are not currently hiring so that I was aware of what that location does in the event that I wanted to transfer there when positions come available. Training, whether formal or informal, allows the employee the opportunity to learn life lessons and not just what is necessary for the job; so much of what is learned can be used in the employees' personal life, as well as in future positions whether with Verizon or not. While some positions, such as those in the call centers, can be challenging, management and the company are sure to take care of the employee and make sure that the employees' needs, both at and outside of work, are met. Any failure of the employee to advance or gain the tools to improve are on the employee, not on the company."
good,"Great company many broken processes due to lack of cohesion to change. "
good,"My career at Verizon, was very positive and ground breaking. I learned a lot about technology and how fast it changes. I enjoyed my time with Verizon."
good,Verizon definitely takes care of their employees. I think the only area of opportunity Verizon has to address is it's choice of leadership for particular districts. Like a good or a bad teacher it determines your overall experience.
good,"Best company to add up in the Job Profile and Experience. Employee will learn a good amount due to proper management and work life balance. Long hierarchy of officials and process will make strong at professional level."
good,This was a lot of fun. I earned a lot of great experience at this workplace and am thankful for the time I had there. Coworkers were all wonderful people. Management was always breathing down our necks to make sure we're always in the game.
good,Not enough opportunity for advancement within the company. Voice was not valued in company town halls in regards to improvement plans for the organization.
good,"Expect to work longer than your 8 hour shift. Most times are spent in one location during an installation, Repair jobs are shorter. "
good,"A wonderful company to work for. Training was amazing, product was superior and upper management had an open door policy. With a company so large sometimes little changes took to long to happen"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I have worked at Verizon in New Jersey and also Georgia. I feel that the company is a very well rounded corporation. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement. They pay for your Higher Education, great benefits and all."
good,Great compensation.  Great opportunity for advancement.  Verizon offers exceptional training opportunity for those who have little to no sales experience.
good,version has a lot of calls coming in day in and day out and that is the fast pace of the company there is no time off. this what I do like abou the company it makes the day go by fast and also it keeps you interesting while the day is going on
good,"Daily huddle, then working to serve our customer base. Management looked to progress you and showed you the tools to make it happen. Benefits are outstanding. Yearly Bonus.  Team building exercises"
good,"I deal job for someone single, or newlywed. Great place to work, but very hard if you have kids with the flex schedules. VZW cares about there employees and pays well."
good,Good pay  many levels of learning and training nice management  informative  good working conditions chance for advancement  working with customers and technicians repairing troubles and dispatching techs to fix problems in central offices  working on computer also building lines and equipment by computer
good,"Verizon was a very good place to work, the pay was great there was always overtime and everybody worked together to get the job done. The hardest part about working with Verizon was when they hired new management from the outside and they knew nothing about the work. Everyday became a challenge to get the work load completed and then we started to have a lot of tickets left over at the end of the day, but management did not seem concerned. I really enjoyed working together with my co worker, technician inside and outside, other departments to get a trouble report on a customers telephone lines repaired."
good,Call center life is taxxing stressfully and has often times a high turnover but if you can get past that the job is a bit fun and the pay is outstanding.
good,Worked with a great team and we were like a family.  I enjoyed going to work every day and would have loved to have stayed there.  Corporate world can be the greatest thing but can also be the worst because someone really high up the ladder that doesn't know you cuts heads at the expense of those around you.  Corporate layoffs are always hard.
good,"An ever changing company that kept up with technology, customer demands, customer AND employee oriented with many opportunities to cross-train and advance.  Flexibility is key to work at Verizon given the quick response to meet customer needs, aggressively retain customer base and implement technology. I was in management and never taken advantage of by upper levels. Union employees were very happy as well."
good,Have loved being and employee in the Telecom World (w/ XO Communications) for the last 19 years. Day to day business is always a pleasure and brings forth may new challenges. Never a dull moment an any give day. I have always enjoyed those I work for and with. Has always been my home away from home.
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits and pay. You will he rewarded for the work you put in and there are many chances for advancement. If you are willing to put in the work, you will be successful."
good,Verizon has been the best company I ever worked for as a company. I was there for 16 years. My team was relocated and I was pregnant with twins. they gave me a great severance package. the benefits were great. I worked from home remotely as needed and the team of engineers were extremely great. the stock options were great. I really was appreciated for all the hard work and years that I served with the company. My peers were also happy with their jobs. This was great work environment. I was always seeking self improvement and Verizon would pay for the training.the bonus that were given were great one a year. I ust say this is a great place to work. Thanks you Verizon.
good,I have to make sure the technicians dispatch on their assigned jobs for customers.  I also have to call customers sometimes if there is no available technician.  I load jobs to technicians as well.
good,"No complaints. Just wish it was permanent and not a contract job. Really enjoyed the freedom and flexibility of the job, Used the best equipment and worked with some very knowledgeable people."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Verizon, fun, fast and always learning. My team was amazing and i was so sad to say goodbye. My Verizon family was the best team i could ask for. The layoffs hurt, not only did i have to leave a job i loved but i had to leave my Verizon family."
good,I felt that I was born to do this job. I am a perfectionist and EXTREMELY organized. I love to solve problems. That was integral to my every day existence in this role.
good,Great benefits and decent pay. Great room for advanced training and promotions. Company has very high standards so co-workers and management are excellent!
good,"By far, the best office environment I've ever worked in. While it is fast-paced and constantly changing, the culture of family and teamwork is prevalent and makes it much easier to adapt to changes and deal with the stress of the job duties."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"very high paced work environment, management was great.  great benefits, plus you get vacation, sick time off, personal time off as well as bonuses and yearly merit increases."
good,"To be a successful software developer at Verizon, you need to be self-directed and motivated. Management and team leads will guide projects but the developer will be responsible for the detailed implementation plan. There is much interaction with other teams and business groups and collaboration is the norm."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for. the culture is very inclusive and positive. Management is geared to help employees achieve their goals. the benefits that I enjoyed are very good,  for example getting college courses paid for upfront. and that is only one of a long list benefits that Verizon provides. Bottom line, Verizon has been one of the best companies I have worked for."
good,"This company truly gives it their all to relieve the stress from a call center career. From various times off the phone, to all the benefits and time off they provide. Job security at Verizon is definitely high! Great place to work."
good,"The good things"
good,"Benefits are great, culture is excellent, most management is terrific, lots of training and development provided, professionalism, outstanding 401k, room for advancement, challenging to an extent, equal opportunity employer, constantly changing and evolving, diverse management styles, school reimbursement, pays well, and much more."
good,"When I was employed with Verizon, the company offered me a great stock option and other benefits.. co-workers were great to work with. management demanded great efforts on the part of employees and rewarded employees when they were successful."
good,Started as Staff Assistant in Sales Operations and over 9 year period was promoted to Coordinator for cover and spine sales for all Verizon directories.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the salesmen that wanted to sell product that wasn't available due to previous customer wanting to keep his ad for another year.  Most of the sales people were reasonable and fun to deal with.  The management was constantly giving awards and bonuses if you did well at your job..
good,Verizon is a world wide brand.  The name speaks for it's self.  Great company to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to other areas of the state and the country.  Advancement was key to me taking the position and that was no problem.
good,Loved getting up in the morning to arrive at this job environment.  My manager allowed opinions and suggestions. I had the knowledge of outside construction work. Best part of the job was the experience to travel to construction sites and watch the inspectors and contractors in their work. Thank you.
good,"Great leadership"
good,"If you enjoy an exciting ever-changing environment, you'll love working for Verizon Communications. As a customer service representative, you will gain superior training, Your coworkers have more than enough to do during their busy day but are very helpful and compassionate."
good,it is a good place to work and a good team .In really I got very good experiences .work in many location and the is company provided us a good equipment
good,"working since 2015  March"
good,"I love working for Verizon Wireless. Working with Verizon has been a great experience. It allowed me to grow as a person. Verizon has also given me from to grow in my career. The culture at Verizon is awesome. I've become very close with my fellow colleagues. Though, Verizon is great I have not yet finished my Bachelor's Degree. Verizon's extensive schedule has kept me from being an a successful student."
good,"The job itself was not great, but the company understands life. You really get a lot of time off and flexible schedules to spend time with family. The only downside is that they can close the center you work in at any moment, which is what I'm currently going through. I wish there was more job security, I would have loved to make this place my career."
good,Great place. After 22yrs my number came due to get laid off. However i loved working for VZ. I would go back in a heart beat. Great people and great company vision.
good,"Typical day is high energy, positively impacting lives of customers, being dynamic and friendly. The co workers are all phenomenal, intelligent individuals who embrace the spirit of diversity and are customer focused."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good place to learn new technologies. Management implements New Strategies and always stay on top of it. Customer relationship management is high priority. Teamwork makes the dreamwork, entire organization deserves it."
good,"I was a call center manager, I loved coming to work everyday.  The most enjoyable part of my day was solving complicated issues for my customers.  By far the best job I've had, it offered everything i'm looking for in a work place today.  Great pay, great people to work with, room for growth, amazing benefits."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. As long as you are a dedicated and hard worker, company is willing to work with you. Treated me very well as an employee. Great pay but long hours and hard work."
good,"If you have no customer service experience, Verizon is the best place to learn. Every day is a different and fun interaction from meeting executives to customers. Everyday is a new experience. At verizon your hard work never goes unnoticed"
good,"I loved having to deal with customers most days."
good,"Good company to start your career with. "
good,This is an amazing company to work for i love working for verizon wireless. they treat the employees really good and look out for the workers
good,"Verizon is a great place to work for, its fast paced, every day new content is learned. Management is with you every step of the way to help with opportunities and growth. The environment is team friendly so everyone helps each other. The hardest part of the job I would classify as figuring out what department to progress too."
good,"With Verizon there is no typical day, every customer is very different. Selling new products from cellular telephones and smart devices that control your household functions. I have had a great supporting cast from co-workers and an all-star managerial staff with guiding my success. I would say the hardest part of my job is pleasing and fulfilling every customers needs on a daily basis. But with responsibility comes with great success and the perks of enjoying working with people pays off in the long run."
good,"I enjoyed working at Verizon and have been taught a lot about sales in my two years of working there. Employees are great to work with, and the hours and pay are not bad"
good,You get what you put in. Very good company to work for has lots of great benefits and pay. Great work culture. Have been there for a few years now there has been lots of changes. Willingness to accept change and adapt is going to a necessity.
good,"I think Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for, great benefits and pay. The only issue with working I n the call centers is that you may never get your weekends off. I don't really feel  like there is a great work/ life balance since you can only use your time if your days are approved. We are allotted a significant amount of vacation and personal time but some days can be wait listed and may never get approve. However, there is other time that can be used in place of it if you have not already used it since your job can be overwhelming at times"
good,I have retired from Verizon.  Unfortunately Victorville  Office was decommissioned.  company excellent to work for. Great benefits.  Enjoyed the flexible shifts offered.
good,"Verizon is very generous employer that truly cares about their employees in their daily pursuit to make good money and maintain a great lifestyle in this difficult economy. The Managment which I worked under were particularly equipped to develop new recruits and excelled at teaching the tools of the trade to a point where they could get on the floor and sometimes do better then the sales representives. From what I saw, the climb through the corporate ladder was accomplished through hard work and determination more than anything which is as it should be in all fields. The company was very developed and will leave in me a lasting expression of professionalism and great work ethic at its finest."
good,The store I worked in for the past  several years is a good store. But when you have a negative Assistant manager always putting down other managers it causes lack of respect for them and doesn't create any motivation that is needed for a good sales environment.
good,Some teams are very cohesive and produce great work. Excellence is only as good as the manager/director encourages. You often think how does this person survive/get promoted when they are so lazy. Company is trying to change its image and be more relevant and appreciative of their people.
good,a working environment where workers feel secure in their jobs and of course where your work environment can be good for the personal and professional development
good,great place to work. company has great benefits and incentives to work for the company. it is a great company to work for.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon offers wonderful benefits, excellent pay and great advancement. I learned a lot about the wireless industry, workforce management and technical support. I really miss working for Verizon Wireless."
good,"Great company to work for, with amazing benefits. The training is extensive, pay is wonderful and the opportunity for overtime is there!"
good,"Awesome job. I meet and worked with a group of guys that were very team oriented.  We were presented with very difficult challenges on a day to day basis but with teamwork we were able to get the done.  Being around my coworkers, was the best part of my day."
good,"I would go pick up the phones from a subcontractor then go sell them, so I worked my own hours and at my own convenience. I would go Business to Business to sell phones."
good,"The HQ building is the best design for working, security and safety in USA. Company culture encourage open, active, healthy and friendly environment."
good,"•	Operate as service point-of-contact for helping to diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve approximately 15 tickets per day. "
good,"Typical day at work in the Verizon Central Office was running fiber to build Fios connections or wiring T1's. We had to trouble shoot a wide variety of Network facilities."
good,"Handle 25-30 inbound calls. Assist with multiple accounts from setting up new service , disconnecting, or handling billing."
good,Verizon is an outstanding company with great pay and benefits.  The mandatory overtime for front line employees can be tough at times but the checks sure are nice.  The chance for advancement is available if one really does put in the time and effort.  The employees and management are all very personable and willing to help and will go out of their way to help others succeed.  The toughest part about the job was communicating between departments.  Nothing was really streamlined and made it difficult to relay accurate information to customers about arrival times etc.
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for.  I'm been employed their for 16 years.  Currently, I am currently looking for temporary employment while there is a work stoppage."
good,"Enjoyed the work, particularly solving customer communications problems. I learned that I needed to be patient with both the customer and management as the tech became a ""go between"" with the two groups. Some new management employees would make a mistake, but never admit they did. Most co-workers were competent, but a few were there only to get a pay-check they felt was owed to them without doing any real work.

good,"As an executive administrative assistant, my days at Verizon were always busy. The days were never the same. There could be a customer needing to reach the executive one day and just meeting scheduling the next. Other administrative assistants are your best friends. Verizon has the best network of admins who understand the daily struggle to find ""availability"" on their bosses' calendars to fit in as many urgent meetings as possible. If the admin understands the company's vision and priority of ""customer first"", they will fit in perfectly. An admin at Verizon is the first line of defense to the boss. We are gatekeepers, bouncers, fire fighters, travel agents, personal assistants and voices of reason. The best part of the job is at the end of the day, you filled a need."

Coaching sessions are given to all employees no matter how good or not good you are performing, coaching at Verizon is meant to help the employees see what their weakness are be a guide to improve those areas.  Most of all to me the short term incentive bonus is worth working with Verizon alone, all employees receive a percentage of gross profits from the year.

We all worked together to meet company goal and requirements . sometimes the customers could be a little difficult but with a major company like Verizon that is to be expected.

good,"Fast-paced work environment consistently driven by sales quotas.  A lot of micromanagement if your sales numbers are struggling, but if you make the sales management stays off your back.  Worked as a team, a family, and as one store.  The different roles within the store help attract and excite consumers to new products and services they never knew existed; that's where the fun of the job begins.  A lot of variety each day of work, new people with new issues and needs each day, and opportunities to grow and open your mind to a new way of thinking.

good,"There used to be a saying that C&P (Verizon's former name) took care of you from the cradle to the grave.When someone had a birth in the family, or when a family member passed, we were there for each other. Friendships lasted for lifetimes, and became extended family. We were proud of the Customer Service we provided.Then the focus switched primarily to Sales, and we lost what primarily set us apart from the other carriers. Then we lost the feeling of being a family and it became an ""every man for himself"" mentality."

In telecommunications it behooves the company and user to change with the time to stay on top of what is needed to be successful.

I am mainly in the back of the store sending and receiving inventory, filing paperwork, keeping counts on devices and accessories. Constant flow of customers in the store, often I am in the front hosting to keep the flow of the store moving in the right direction. Work directly under the store manager and assistant store managers to communicate with the reps on inventory processes and the current  month to date and year over year shrink. Management can be good (or in other words, resourceful) depending on the day and who is managing. Managers are often tied up with customer escalations. The stores main focus throughout the entire day is metrics. Not a lot of talk about the positive outcome of a sale, more focused on the sale on what did not go right or what else could have been offered to the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is the job knowledge. I feel that being a part of a company for such a long period, lets others use myself as the go-to person and at the end of the day, knowing I could help out on a transaction, it makes my job enjoyable. Also, knowing the operations side of the business really helps and makes the job easier to understand."

When the center closed, that was what hit people the hardest, losing family.  My work day typically consisted of high end accounts; managing from taking reservations for them and conducting their conference calls. Received numerous awards for recognition and always met the quotas for error free stats.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to help some people who didnt have the correct information.

Verizon's belief integrity, ethics and customer service is grade A.  A typical day at Verizon is qualifying customers with their needs in some of the services we offer.  We help establish a customer base by closing deals and meeting quotas in all aspects of the company.  Verizon is a technical company making the right decision to efficiently bring revenue not only to your pockets but Verizon itself  Co-workers are phenomenal and with time you build great relationships.  The hardest thing about working at verizon is the time you have to sacrifice because it is retail.  You work your 40 and  even some overtime on occasions and including most weekends.  In retail weekends are great to selling days.  The most enjoyable part of the day is the customer service aspect of the job.  You help customers find solutions with some of the situations that they bring to the store."

good,Only left because of relocation. Had many great years at this company. Learn how to wear MANY different hats.
good,A typical day at worked started at 7:30am and went until about 6pm.  Hopping from one conference call to another and completing work in between.  Great set of dedicated employees who worked well together and for consistent goals.  Hardest part of job was not being able to complete as much work as you wanted to.  Management was supportive and allowed you room for autonomy.
good,"Verizon Wireless values employees and does its best to get rid of bureaucracy in order to grow market share. Compensation, benefits, culture and the continuing development of its employees are paramount to the obvious success VZW is experiencing. I found it very easy to build rapport with all levels of leadership as well as my direct management and peers. Team building activities based around celebrating clear and concise goal achievements were frequent and contagious in inspiring my particular channel participants onward to greatness. Frequently I would hear from counterparts of other companies lament their corporations emphasis on its products and services over their employees.. with VZW it was the exact opposite... we the employees of VZW were elevated over everything as taking precedent to deliver the message, service and products to our consumers."
good,"I would go into work and first thing that i would do is scan all inventory. After that i would typically just sit in my desk and search my database for potential customers with upgrades. Give them a call and set appointments. I would help customers that came in with their phones, could be a customer service issue or a bill pay. Everyone was pretty laid back and it was a fun environment to be in."
good,"A typical day at Verizon could range from hectic back to back calls all day to light intermittent calls every 4 or 5 minutes. While there i learned to deal with calls one at a time, to be innovative when working with customers and how to listen to customers to get to the root of their issues to solve them. Management at Verizon was not uniform thus results were not uniform, top performers were usually consistent for both managers and my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was learning that customers are not angry with me and and to put myself in their shoes. The most enjoyable part of the job was after i learned those lessons, and became a top performer, that upward mobility began to reveal itself to me. I was trusted by my Manager and Associate Director to handle complex issues, to train struggling co-workers, assist in team management. If the Houston call center had not closed, I would still be there."
good,Working at Verizon I have learned multiple job functions. Although I have only really had one title I have performed multiple jobs roles.
good,"Being on the phones meeting new people and being able to help someone with their inquiry, and able to resolve the problem makes me feel good that I was able to give the good customer service I wanted to give. I learned that everyone want to be heard and if you just listen to them, I am able to keep that customer happy. I got along with my co-workers, including management. The hardest part of the job is when the customer is yelling at you, even though I know they are upset at the company for the issues. So I didn't take it personally. What I enjoyed about the job is knowing I'm helping someone. I was proud working for a well-known company for so many years. I believed in the products we offered."
good,"Talking to customers was my job and I enjoyed it. I learned a lot about the telecommunication field. More then I applied for. My co-workers were like family and I enjoyed that. The hardest part of the job was to sell to someone who couldn't afford anything, and we had to do that on every call."
good,"Was not able to relocate, therefore was unable to stay with the company. Though it was a great company to work for."
good,A typical day at work was pretty much fun because every day their was always something new happening. I learned a lot on what Verizon offers to customers and how they gave the best customer service to each person that walked in ours doors and called on our phones. Management was the best that I had because I myself was also apart of the management staff. The co workers were very easy to work with and listened to any problems I may have had at that point and time. The hardest part of my job was to not only help and assist customers but also had to be their all the time for my workers that I had to manage. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I had the chance to say I worked for the company.
good,My actual professional life started from here. Work and fun were co-related. Each and everyone used to enjoy though the shift timings were a bit odd. Team lunch and outings were more and hence giving a chance for everyone to be as close as the other's family members.
good,"Found solutions for establishing relationships with existing clients to insure goal setting growth.      "
good,This is an awesome place to gain experience. A average day is on the field meeting directly with customers and existing clients. Great for networking.

I learned to be patient bc different people need a more patience then other customers such as elderly people. My co-workers were great. We always worked as a together for assistance for questions. I never had a problem with working with anyone on my team. The hardest part of the job was to recover from numbers when you given as many calls to recover from developing. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be rewarded by having time off the phones with call center events."

The worst part was when the rumors started flying about out-sourcing. No one was saying yea or nae. Kept sweeping it under, don't worry about it is on down the road later in years, guess what it happened. Finally a great person decided it was time to come face front and say it was in the works.

With the music in the background all the positive energy and being able to look at the late and greatest cellular technology. Helping different customers everyday and finding the best solution to what they are looking for. The hardest part of the job I would say is the weekends when it really starts to pick up and get busy.

When they needed someone to help in another area I was willing to switch gears and work where I was needed.

This in turn allows each department to realize common denominators in developing short and long-term processes to reducing common complaints."
good,"The workday is enjoyable and you get to help customers with their wireless device needs. There are lots of skills to learn (sales, customer service, technical support, leadership, etc)"
good,This company is a great company with a very positive foundation. But some very greedy CEOs have thru the company over the years and mismanaged the company. Causing layoffs every 3-5 years at contract time . So trying to get 25 years or more to retirement seems to be unlikely. A lot of competition and the technology is changing all of the time . So the company has to work very hard to keep up . But Fios is still the best product as far as the triple play services are concerned.
good,They are a good company and can agree with how they work it was a full time job with full hours and the reason for leaving was nothing to do with the hours
good,Verizon was the a rewarding place to work when I first started with the company. As time went on it begin to be harder to make and money because the constant change in commission and outrageous quotas. The shareholders and Executives kept getting greedy and give themselves bonuses and cutting jobs of the people who actually doing the work of the company. I went from making 80k my first 2 years to making 50K all while doing the same or better numbers year over year
good,Work hours  could be better not a fan on switching  every six months ... They should hire for the hours people want and stick to those hours. Working mothers fall into a problem when working these crazy type shifts
good,"Working for Verizon was a wonderful experience and the people I met were very personable. I enjoyed working there w/ flexible capability being a single mom,"
good,Company was great at taking care of their employees. They promoted within with the right qualifications. Management from time to time woulld have some inconsistency with answering questions but with the tools that Verizon provided and the ability to  get assistance from other departmtents those questions were answered accurately. The only downfall was the event that they terminated the position and the center in Albuquerque.
good,"Great Job, reliable resource for employment. Friendly environment open communication support. Snacks were excellent, I like the freebies given out for good work."
good,"Great place to work, forever changing which makes it exciting and challenging."

good,I  learned something new everyday at Verizon Wireless. Worked for Verizon for 8 years and enjoyed my job almost everyday. We were always busy and I loved meeting new people. The management team was great and  was always encouraging us to do better. They also rewarded us very well. Great benefits and 401k. The reason I left was because I had a baby and wanted to stay home. I still get phone calls from my work family how I should come back :)
good,"I've worked in a lot of different jobs in my career with Verizon. Some I've liked more than others but overall my time with Verizon was very good and I owe a lot to them. They paid for both my undergrad and graduate studies. They've allowed me to afford a nice house in a nice neighborhood and take many nice vacations throughout the years. There was plenty of opportunity to advance, should one choose to do so. Unfortunately for me I did not take that path as I was a bit to risk averse and did not want to be one of the 'new' employees in a group that was then forced to downsize. If I have any negative criticism to make it's around the high number of RIF's that occurred in the 2005-2015 time frame. At times they were occurring quarterly and it was a very nerve-wrenching distraction. There were times when I thought it would be easier to just get RIF'd and get it over with. I was fortunate to make it through all of those RIF's and leave with a voluntary package but it was sad to see so many good people losing their jobs because they happened to be in an area that the company felt was not of the highest value at the moment. It had absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the person being let go."
good,"It is a great place to work. You have to be flexible to change and embracing new things. Pay is great and the benefits are even greater. 401k match, cheap quality health insurance, lots of time off."
good,great culture with unlimited earning potential. Primary role was helping customers with wireless products for internet solutions to cell phones and accessories.
good,A typical day consisted of opening the store and having fun with the clients and co workers. I learned how to address problems and find solutions to everyday productivity loss. Most of the management made the days fun by making it competitive with games and targets/goals. The workplace culture was that of family. The hardest part of the job was staying on top of all the new technology and products that hit the shelves weekly. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work as a team and help each other out.
good,"A wonderful place to start a career full of learning experiences, full of opportunity to grow in sales and retail, a place of employment I would strongly recommend to anyone."
good,"I enjoyed this company too, however the assignment was with a temp agency and it did not last as long as stated when I took the job.  The location has great features."
good,Great Place to work. Very ethical and diverse. Work / Life balance is well. Must be able to maintain sales goals monthly. Great insurance and 401 K benefits.
good,I have nothing bad 2 say I learned alot. There is plenty of opportunity to grow within the company but you have to network and make use of the company.
good,Not a bad place to work. Lot of work but work culture is good. Benefits are good. Overall its a good company to work. Had opportunity to work on various new technologies.
good,I highly enjoyed my time with Verizon.  Sales rep jobs 10 years ago were fun.  My favorite position was as an Indirect Account Manager.  This role you set your schedule based on how you want to manage your territory.  Build the right relationships to influence sales and the job can be easy and fun.
good,I would work there again. I really loved helping the customers and Verizon is a great company to work for. There is not much more I wish to say. I loved working here.

good,Great Benefits package and lots of incentives.  I worked with Verizon for just over 10 years and when they lost DOD contract work I was able to walk away with just over 50K in severance/401k benefits.  My time with the company laid the foundation for what do today.

good,"Verizon was the first corporate job I ever landed and I'm sure glad it was! When I felt the need to leave, I found that many companies were impressed that I worked for them as they are known to be a team of hard workers. I wouldn't pass up an oppprtunity! They also offer phenomenal benefits and there was always room for advancement"
good,"Verizon pays well and has a really good culture.  Sometimes it can get hung up on the bureaucracy, and it can take a long time to get things done, but that can be said of any company this size.  Good benefits and good management (all except my first manager there - she was a nightmare)"

good,i only worked for verizon for only few weeks i got the job at the bank so i transferred over their i had a idea of the job opportunities that verizon had to offer

good,I enjoyed working at Verizon very much. The work is fast paced and the day goes quickly. I learned communication skills along with computer and software skills. Management could be flexible at times but everything depends on the needs of the business. I found that most of the office employees that had some time working there were very helpful to me anytime I needed it.

I had to plan out the day of training for the transition department. I had to coach calls, remote monitor calls, provide side by sides, instruct a class at the end of each day. This was to coach calls with opportunities in front of the class, in order to identify possible trends. I learned how to identify with and manage an array of different personalities.

good,"I would recommend employment at Verizon. The benefita are great and the work environment is fun. I worked for the company for 11 years, great job growth. You have the option to relocate as well."
good,"This company values INTEGRITY. It is at the core of the culture and it makes this technology-focused business thrive. Sales and Customer Service as well as an efficient back office make for a great work place. The culture was fantastic and I valued every day in this building. The training program was 2 weeks long and they paid for hotel, food and travel. Quite obviously, they care about each and every employee and value having highly educated individuals working here. If you have the opportunity, you should work here at least once in your lifetime. You'll develop skills and experience that will serve you for years to come. This company is my gold standard for a workplace environment and I have not found any company to work for that can compete!"
good,The reason I seek other options is that your hours change every 6 months which I couldn't do since I had my son going to school. But other than that great mone! Lots of extras spiffs.
good,"I enjoyed working at Verizon. I worked in a call center where we took est up to 60 incoming calls per day. They always had a lot of fun activities going on to keep the center vibes positive. Lots of food shares, contests, bonuses, and incentives. The hardest part would be  (besides dealing with difficult or rude customers) was to listen and analyze your recorded calls with management once a week. I would still be working there had they not shut our center down in Ca."
good,A typical day at Verizon consists of a lot more hands on work even before the store is opened. I learned a lot of technical aspects of customer service and sales. Management was great throughout the training process and encouraging when out on the sales floor. Hardest part of the job is not being able to fully satisfy a customer for reason outside of the employee's control.
good,A real sense of achievement as verizon was always willing to train employees on new technology.You could grow with the company as you learned the latest tech skills available.
good,if willing to work hard and under pressure great job   field tech is working and communication with the customer   in my career they keep up with training and safety
good,Best place I have worked for sorry that the company decided to phase our division out. Every job and every customer was given the most detailed attention to ensure satisfaction.
good,No way to get promoted. Unless you wait years and years. Good management. This is a high stress job. But the money is worth it. Only if you are good at sales.

good,Compensated well for hard work. Hardest part of job is staffing sales reps. Customers were overall friendly. Fun and laid back style with a competitive undertone.
good,I was on the back end in operations and inventory control. I also did sales and management for the company. I loves=d working for Verizon. As most companies they did away with jobs and outsourced. So I was unable to go back to them. Most of their stores went into authorized agents.
good,"A typical day consisted of answering many customer questions.  Speaking daily with door to door sales and promoting as many products free at first and then the customer would keep them."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great work environment. I enjoyed the team atmosphere. I was able to advance at a rapid rate and was well compensated. The leadership team is requires a lot of training.

good,Great place to work! Very rewarding! Management was well aligned with its representatives. There were many special opportunities to make extra money!!!
good,"Great office environment and very enjoyable to go to work each day."
good,"Verizon Wireless has great benefits and room for advancement. However, it is a very cut-throat competitive environment and there is little to no support from management."
good,"I think my summary pretty much says it all.  Overall, Verizon is a great place to work.  I learned a lot, worked with some of the best in the business, and have a stellar resume to show for it.  The only issue is, Verizon knows this and leverages this to get away with compensating lower than market averages for the same jobs.  As is the case with many other jobs with large companies, you are better off leaving the company and coming back to make more money than getting promoted internally."
good,"-  Manage the sales opportunities that require finance by discussing with the sales team and exploring ways to put them in the best position to win and expand the sale."
good,"Unfortunately they closed or i would of retired from Verizon."

good,"I found this to be a rewarding and challenging place to work.  Overall very happy to have been there, upcoming Department closure was my only reason to have left.  Personally I was very happy with my own management.  The hardest part of job was dealing with upset customers, while the most enjoyable part is when other customers appreciate the efforts you have made to help them.  Over my Time there I have greatly expanded my knowledge on my job field, which is Telecommunications."

If you work retail, you'll get the stresses of retail: hitting quota, difficult customers, working weekends and holidays, but the pay and benefits are amazing for what you do. You're not outside digging a ditch, you're selling a quality product to people who are looking for this product."

This culture requires the employee to be fluent in a wide array of skills such communication, teamwork, and the seemless use of many different systems."
good,"Not a good fit for my career goals, but the benefits are excellent. Management has been supportive 9 times out of 10. Incentive programs exist and are achievable."
good,Enjoyed working with my team and other teams on a daily basis. Worked at Verizon 17 years with the same co-workers so we were like family. There were ups and downs like all families but I still enjoyed coming to work.

good,Verizon had a fantastic work environment and culture. I really enjoyed my position as a technical account coordinator and was very disappointed when my department closed in October 2008. I was part of a small division of Verizon which focused on Data Maintenance contracts. Main duty was to dispatch technicians from all over the country through various Verizon branch locations.

good,"At Verizon I engaged daily with Vendors, CO Supv, CO Techs, Production Control and Planners for NJ/DE/PA markets. Daily conference calls regarding DSL/HSI backbone capacity for my markets. The most difficult thing I experienced at Verizon was to get everyone on board to promote jobs that have to go thru different testing groups and/or getting on the schedule for for testing acceptance and card add modifications. Management at Verizon was good and I like that there was no micro management.  I was able to complete jobs and disseminate tasks out job to other people on my team.  The most enjoyable experience at Verizon would be the people are very helpful and respectful."
good,"Advancement is specific to job. Jobs are starting to try to be based in certain localities. They are losing good people that have excellent job skills because of limiting placement to these localities. Which is very odd as they are still a widespread company and, above all else, a TELECOMMUNICATIONS company. Shouldn't they be pushing the technology piece of the business?"
good,"From all the places I worked before, the VERIZON is the BEST!"
good,"Verizon is a excellent place to work if you are looking for a career job with ample opportunity to advance. Verizon will pay for continuing education and will provide a diverse work environment to advance.

The hours are long however you work with a great group of people so time is no issue. Benefits and compensation is available day one of employment.

good,A typical day included checking my numbers from the previous day. I learned everything about the sales process from start to finish-in depth. Uptight but casual culture.

good,"I've seen many changes over the 30 years that I worked there. Beginning with C&P to Bell Atlantic to Verizon it has ALWAYS been a great place to work with great benefits. I went from typing service orders into a database to making travel arrangements for the Director and so much more in between. Management made sure we got the necessary training and tools to successfully do our job. We had quarterly ""Town Hall"" meetings to ensure that EVERYONE was kept abreast of the ""state of the business"" and outstanding employees were recognized for their hard work. We also had quarterly teambuilding sessions which helped with office morale. "

good,"A typical day at Verizon was happy and helpful. I learned patience, training skills and alternatives to solve issues with many different personalities. Verizon was like a family. The hardest part about the job was getting snowed in/ forced overtime which sometimes was the most enjoyable along with providing outstanding customer service. Providing a winning experience with a live operator."

good,"Verizon is a great company to work for. A typical  day a work for me starts at 8AM, and I usually start the day you take calls, and then after about 20 minutes we would take a huddle with our supervisor, and what the objectives were for the day, and the goals for the month. I learned a lot from Verizon about customer interaction, and the responsibility that we had to the customers. The management was fantastic, they would help in anything that we need, and also any questions. The workplace was great I was in the bilingual department and it was a great place and the people that I worked with were very fun, and always willing to help with anything that I needed. I think that the hardest part of the job was when the customer came on the phone mad, and we would have to deescalate the situation, and make the customer try and have trust in you, and make sure that the issue was going to get resolved."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,"I worked with a great team while in Sales Mgt at Verizon. Hard to believe those 3 years went by so fast. It was enjoyable learning the skills of a Sales Professional, given that I had done Manual labor most of my life. I made life-long friends while working there, and I made memories that will last for the rest of my life."
good,I worked in the call center. You have to go through six weeks of training that is all paid. Loved working there but after training my shifts were changed dramatically and could not commit to them because I was a single mom back then with no help at all.

My job was to patrol on foot with a flashlight, behind storage units, looking for cuts in the fences. You never knew what to expect. Could be a person with a gun standing there.It wasn't the best of neighborhoods. Fortunately, nothing major ever happened there."

Yes, but anything worth having usually isn't easy.  The pay is competitive and clients can be a challenge, but the rewards far exceed the difficulties."
good,There is nothing you couldn't do when working at this place. My mentor helped me in training and understood the weak points that employees undergo during the training process. It's really the most valuable part of the job where you get to learn and enjoy the work and the work culture.
good,"Great place to work part-time the pay is awesome alone with the bonus.  we also had employee appreciation day.  where your play games, take pictures meet other employees, eat and it was fun sometimes you can bring your family.

good,"good work life balance. "
good,"When I started working with Verizon Wireless, they worked with me every way that they could due to car issues or emergencies. The management excelled in pushing you to your limits to entice your own growth  and to make you a career employee. The hardest part of the job was the inventory management, as there was only myself. The team was terrific with encouragement and helped every way that they could to assist. I learned that this is a company that goes above and beyond to help their employees and create excellent team members!"

good,"Verizon pays the most for the industry, they have a union CWA in place to insure benefits and pay are maintained, the work is not extremely difficult, but getting hired on may take a while.."

good,"typical day , consist of handling different call types technical , billing , and escalations.  45 to 50 calls per day.  calls are always being monitored as long as you do your job then you don't have to worry."
good,Verizon expects a lot of their sales teams and that is the culture the strive for. This is why as a company they are very successful. Training is great they know what they are doing and how to do it. They hire and train for a week outside of the store. This is the best way to train employees when you want them to be able to do right things with customers.
good,"Overall Verizon Wireless was an awesome place to work. They have a great culture and their values are something everyone should live by. The issue is that everyone there does not live the values. The way to get ahead is determined by who you know, which is sad. If you are in the ""in crowd"" you are able to do more. Somewhat like a big high school. But overall it was a great place to work with great pay."

good,"My last job was very challenging and demanding. The fun part was to make customers happy by resolving their issues by troubleshooting, but hardest part was to handle upset customers. Over all, I had fun working with Verizon Wireless. We had several training sessions throughout the year to learn about new products due to frequent job and industry change."
good,"The Verizon Wireless call center in Lincoln was a great place to work, but none of that matters, because it's closed now. I'm sure the similar facilities in other cities around the nation are similar, and provide an excellent environment with ample opportunity for advancement. Also, the closure of the center was handled as tactfully as possible by management, with great options for severance and relocation."
good,"I've been with the company for 18 years.  I've seen multiple promotional opportunities and enjoy the workplace culture.  The days can get a little long.  Which does impact work life balance, but it's worth it in the end. The salary and benefits are fantastic."

good,"As a Customer Service Representative for a major telecommunications company, some of my responsibilities included the ability to handle incoming and outbound calls on a very high call volume basis, troubleshooting those calls to the correct department, or assisting the customer directly. This involved listening skills to determine exactly what the problem was in order to correctly direct them. I was responsible for placing orders via computer for new phone service, disconnect or move existing telephone service, and/or make changes to existing phone service to better serve the customers needs."
good,"During my time in Verizon i learned a great deal of knowledge , I sharpened my sellings skills as well as my superior customer service. I would recommend Verizon as a great place to work"
good,Fantastic staff and management team. Wonderful benefits but as most jobs in a sales environment it is hard to balance work/family lifestyle due to working most nights and weekends.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,"I enjoy my time at Verizon. Management makes great business driven decisions and can back those choices up with good results. "
good,Great People to work with and great management to work for. But CEO taking company and spreading it to thin in it's business dealings.But for the savy salesperson great opportunity to learn fantastic selling skills.
good,"Recently let go after 14+ years. The last couple of years have seen reductions in personnel and increase in workload. As a cell tech more duties were added to that workload without any scaling back of others. This caused time for things to get completed to compress and therefore adding to stress."
good,"During my time with Verizon Wireless the management staff was very supportive towards advancement of career and very goal oriented.  I was able to advance quickly and attain the knowledge necessary to advance into the technical field.  This company has a very good history of providing excellent benefits and caring for their employees.  The most difficult part of this job is that the schedules are very strict and you are on the phones all day with an incoming call queue.  The company atmosphere was very team based and a lot of fun to be a part of.  They also have a fully stocked cafeteria with very friendly staff, free food on holidays, and the on site gym was a plus as well."
good,Great place to work with great benefits. Great pay and easy work. Customers are bad. Hardest part of the job would be standing all day. Workplace culture is fun.
good,"The company is a strong developer of staff, having a high-expectation to meet company deliverables.  Training is outstanding, and there are plenty of upward mobility opportunities."
good,"Great Company with great benefits I'm a tech head, and loved this job. This job was a great summer job, and I had fun here one of the best jobs I've had so far."

good,I was an System Analyst.  The company was focused on making the best individual I can be for the job and the individuals I worked with. The work was a challenge.

For me the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the lasting relationships I developed.

Verizon instills a competitive sense in the employees, and employees take pride in their hard work when they achieve their personal monthly sales goals. It improves employee's critical thinking and analysis skills as they fully examine every customer's account to see how they could help to benefit the customer. There are often opportunities for career advancement in this industry."
good,This place was basically my family. We all got to enjoy each others company while still providing a wonderful experience for the customer
good,"This is a call center where the driver behind making money is based on called volume and efficiency in turning calls into sales. the more transactions you produce, the higher your pay will be. The company has not been effective in hiring people that can do the job with ease. it requires people with unbeaten personality to solve problems and  constantly figuring out ways to make things better. We have had employees who want result without putting the work."
good,"Mooi bedrijf dat goed voor haar personeel zorgt."
good,Working with Verizon is great. The staff become like family and you are paid based on how much effort you are willing to put in. Excellent company to work for.

good,"I've worked as a sales associate, and also as inventory manager and floor merchandise. "
good,Great job if you like Sales. Management and culture are really the best in the industry. Pay is fantastic. Only downfall is dealing with sometimes frustrating customers and having to work weekends and holidays.
good,It's a dress down environment. Which makes every one a little more relaxed at the work place and easy to work with and talk too.
good,Verizon really knows how to take care of their employees when it comes to Health and Wellness. They understand that balance is important and are fair in giving out personal and vacation days. You are able to work overtime when it's available and you are rewarded for it.
good,"Great company to work for. People and culture are exceptional. A great working and learning experience. I have many true friends, the company has great benefits and truly cares for its people."

good,working for Verizon has been a great experience from a professional and personal perspective. Everything from the culture to the everyday activities is handled with a sense of integrity
good,"Verizon was definitely structured through an authoritarian style of management. Associates even here in Florida were still members of a union, and many associates and management did not get along. Most upper management had a very large ego problem, even executive's secretaries would blatantly try to over-exert her authority."
good,"it was a great place to work  in a typical day I would start with identifying the cause of overage on bills, "
good,Very nice and intelligent people to work with! The work setting has a beautiful pond off the break room balcony. The hardest part of the job is actually leaving. The most enjoyable part of the day is assisting customers and helping your coworkers.
good,I love working here . Great benefits and great compensation . The only downside is it is time consuming . This job will take over your life and won't give you much time to be with family or friends .
good,"Working for verizon is an awesome experience. I found myself taking what I have learned while my time there and applying it to other jobs I have pursued. The benefits are valued in this economy, I will never find benefits like that."

good,Verizon was an excellent company to work for. The salary was great and there was plenty of room for advancement. would still be there after 2vyears if they didn't down size and eliminate my department. We received bonus's and raises every year. I loved everything about working for Verizon.
good,"Bell Telephone was in my opinion a great place to start and end a career. The process of job growth was to ""groom "" the employees to best good at what ever position they happen to be doing at the time."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,been to many job title in the company started from the bottum up.  started from janitor to labor from lineman to constuction repair. working in outside forces with other people is fascinating and you work with them 24hr a day.
good,I would process reports. RUn numbers and take them to the engineers. Everyone was very nice though much older than I. Everyone was encouraging and fun to work with. THe days would just fly by.
good,First call resolution is key to this wireless carrier. Excellent program to work with. I very much enjoyed my management and position. I would still be there today if possible.

good,"Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. They have awesome benefits and are provide you with the tools to succeed. It is a performance based company. If you are an okay sales person, you should hit your targeted commission. However, if you are a GREAT sales person, you can make a lot more than the targeted commission. The company has great medical, dental, 401k, and tuition reimbursement."
good,I spent many years with Verizon starting in the engineering department when I first entered the company. It was exciting to have worked in ten different locations during my career.  I learned so much at Verizon and the experience alone is invaluable.
good,Dealing will 30 plus customers a day it is key to keep an open mind and think on my feet. I have great management and coworkers who keep the day going by quickly. My manager I have an eminence amount of respect for by holding everyone accountable of their actions. The best part of my job is talking to all different kinds of people and making money while doing it.
good,"Verizon is great company to work for. They provide exceptional benefits and try hard to make changes based on feedback from employees. The pay, rewards and incentives are great, but there is a reason for this. The customer service roll is tough. You must have thick skin and be able to leave your feelings out of it. All in all, I love the company, management and the culture here."
good,"Working in a Verizon Wireless call center is a wonderful, mostly positive experience, which is increasingly rare in the call center industry.  The vast majority of call centers, regardless of which industry they support, spend the majority of their time focusing on the numbers and the quarter goals and/or client (if third-party), and reserve little, if any, attention for their customers (and none whatsoever for their own employees, who suffer as a result and become increasingly disgruntled.)  Verizon Wireless, however, spends far more time focusing on their own employees to the point of making their employees a priority, knowing full well that if the employees are happy, they will in turn make their customers happy (well, as much as is possible anyway.  Some customers refuse to allow happiness into their lives.)  "
good,"loved working here, great company, you get what you put in, "
good,"Excellent place to work. Great people, good salary and benefits. Fast paced environment. Fully support diversity, flexibility in scheduling normally honored."

good,I was hired as Communications Manager to introduce a new billing system internally that was being taken nationwide.  This was a very fun project until they decided the roll-out was going to be too intensive and ended up not producing the billing system.  I was then put in charge to coordinate with HR and external movers an internal move  consolidating all Atlanta and metro areas to the SE headquarters north of Atlanta.  Future projects were to coordinate IT's software/hardware with all departments for Y2K rollout.  Along with newly developed software we were also introducing new hardware with a very specific deadline.  This was very intense and I realized just how organized I really was. I have used my organization skills many times over since.  This was a good company to work for and I enjoyed the co-workers and management.
good,One of the best corporation to work for and be apart of. This company knows how to treat employees and advancement is there for the hard worker and skilled.
good,Great company to work. Continuous online training that comes with the job. Great deal of benefits such as tuition assistance.
good,If your looking to make a competitive salary and have amazing benefits then apply at Verizon. It is very competitive but so worth it at the end. The only reason I could not say there it was hard to balance with sch
good,"work place ha a great culture.  strong union.  Great benefits and great opportunities. lots of overtime,  the hardest part of the job are the schedules changing.  on the phones for the entire day,  co-workers are good and helpful.   the most enjoyable part is payday every Friday."

good,"Great job only complaint would be life/work balance, but its retail so understand the odd hours. Would highly recommend working for Verizon!!!"
good,"Excellent training and benefits. "
good,A typical day involves various types of customer service issues which need to be repaired / resolved before they become service effecting. What I realized is that every customer deserves individual attention and your best effort and that no problem is beyond being resolved. Probably the hardest part of the job was realizing that you are the customers interface to the company and your effort reflects directly upon the company and also the customers opinion of the company.
good,"The daily audit consists of gathering customer data, examining trends, providing analysis, research into billing inquiries and engagement with other teams for issue resolution. "
good,All of my retail experience came from. Company motivates one to meet and exceed job expectation. This allows one to work hard and to see what the hard work will result in. Company promoted within the company to motivated individuals.

good,"I've spent the last 16 years with Verizon Wireless and was hoping to retire with the company. Unfortunately it went through a restructure. The Finance Team I worked for was amazing. We worked hard, supported each other in every task and by the end of the day, I can say I've accomplished so much and found the job very rewarding. The team members were like my extended family. The hardest part was being laid off and not getting to see their smiling faces and the day-to-day interaction."
good,"Great place to work. Fun environment. Great CEO and managing partners. Good pay, great co workers, good hours. Learned a lot"
good,I was with the company for 15 years and started as a customer service rep and ended in management. I reached where i wanted to go with the company an am thankful for the years i worked there.

Your co-workers are nice and friendly, and your superiors are strong, and nice, but also have that intimidation factor. "
good,The Job as Sr. Analyst consisted of constant teamwork everyday.  The most important things I learned in this job are that the customer is your number one concern and that as a team you can always provide the customer with quality service and satisfaction.  Management should know each team player and have some insight and understanding on the assignments being handled by their team.  Without management involvement in the assignment there will always be a missing link.  The hardest part of the job is getting everyone on the team to have the same vision about what is most important.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to successfully complete an assignment and have the customer acknowledge that they are satisfied.

good,"I enjoy this job, I'm looking to continue in recruiting or HR"
good,"My typical day at work is to start with stretching and breathing, sort of a mini yoga, then dive right in and start assisting customers with any inquires they may have.  What I've learned at my current position is that the customer is what pays my income so in allowing them to vent and not interrupt is very crucial in allowing me to assist them.  With the help from supervisor, I've managed to go from developing to performing on the road to leading in a very short road.  I've maintained consistency in very minimal call work and, have received many high survey scores.  I always say, behind every successful employees is their supervisor assisting them and always leading them to excel. Never hesitating to help them in a truthful matter and giving them all their best.  My co-workers are awesome, we are allowed to assist each other and never disrespect each other as peers. Our supervisor allows us to have down time so we can communicate with each other and get to know each other.  Successful team players start off by becoming friends.  Let's see, the hardest part of my job is when I find myself in a situation where I'm not allowed to change policy to accommodate the customer. Policy is created so that consistency is fair for all customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get that call where the customer is at their wits end and I've not only resolved their inquiry but create a customer for life.  My supervisor really enjoys receiving a call from the customer stating that the representative (me) have helped them and that no one else could.  My Customers always want to"

I looked forward to going to work each day as each day presented a new challenge that allowed for both business and personal growth.  Although each day brought new challenges, each day was similar in that I used yesterdays knowledge to obtain new knowledge.  I learned several, if not all, Verizon billing platforms and worked closely with management with sharing of  our combined information to support our large customer base.  With this being said, the most difficult part of my job is when there was a lack of communication between organizations within the Verizon alliances.  The best part of my day on the job was simply working for Verizon and knowing that I was part of a winning company; I will always value Verizon for allowing me to the best that I  can be.  "

good,"I love the sales environment and pay and benefits and new technology, and... Verizon is an awesome company to work for. Like any other company in the work right now, you always have to stay open to change. My favorite part of working is the pay - I directly control how much I get paid. If quota is 40 new lines, I set my personal quota at 60. The more you sell over quota, the more money you make! I have been with the company for 7 years and love it, only downside is retail hours. I don't get home sometimes until 10 or later, which makes it hard on the family."

Management in general is there for support when needed and for keeping employees abreast of their performance on a consistent basis.

good,"Very busy! Answering phone calls, providing ALL customer needs, resolving billing issues, issuing all types of service orders ex: New Fios service orders, moving orders, disconnects, change service orders, and handling customer complaints. I learned how to work as a team, get the job done in a timely manner, always being professional and turning irate customers into satisfied committed customers. I worked amongst the best management team and co-workers! I researched large billing claims sometimes $50,000 or more for Large Business customers. If the customer’s claim was denied after researching and investigating all the facts, it sometimes was very challenging to get the customer to accept the denial. The customer would become very irate. As always, I remained professional, confident, and kept a copy of the investigation on file for future reference. Researching billing claims was the best part of my job. I really liked doing that and I enjoyed it! I like to satisfy my customers and keep them happy and committed to Verizon. The manager, team-leaders, and co-workers worked really well together and we got the job done. We were like one big family."

I always had wonderful, educated managers that were willing to help when there was an issue that I could not resolve on my own.  The culture itself was surpass.  They celebrated everything! Seriously. Individual accomplishments, team accomplishments, quarterly, annually, all were celebrated by certificates, balloons everywhere, catered lunches, special off-site events.

Verizon has a lot of tools and resources in place to make sure that you're not only able to succeed in your job, but also at home.

good,Verizon provides opportunities for everyone  The company provides growth and expansion of your career into different areas.  The culture is solid and supports work/life balance.

good,"Processing transactions as well as managed multiple projects"

good,"•	Human Resources Representative for all hourly and salaried employees within region including explanation of benefits and payroll management."
good,"the management was really good compare to my previous jobs. typical days are hectic but exciting, there is always something going on. I learned many things about clients and how fast the industry changes"
good,Loved working here.  I would still be working here if the center didn't close. It had a great environment and the people were always so awesome to be around
good,They expect you to take at least 40 calls per day which is sometimes non-applicable due to troubleshooting and having to understand the customers needs when they do not come up front and tell you what their concern is. The environment is amazing though. The pay is spectacular and they give you a lot of time off to recuperate from the stress of a call center environment.
good,"I really loved working for this company. I met so many amazing people and gained skills that I can use for life!"
good,"Great it was an awesome experience, I enjoyed my time working there and the entire staff and workplace environment was amazing! During my work at Verizon j learned souch social awareness and learned how to effectively communicate with people."
good,Work closely with the coaches to assess the health and wellness needs of the employees. Very relaxed and calm environment. The coaches were extremely helpful.
good,They are very difficult to deal with when it comes to requesting or submitting time. There is no clear guideline regarding rules that should apply to every employee.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"One of the best Fortune 500 companies to work for, Diversity, Salary and Benefits far above average, Culture of the Company , they are very interested in Employee development, and excellent Work Life Balance; Verizon is very pro-active about promoting from within, and are a very diverse company; Verizon is still one of the few Union companies around, so the excellent benefits and salary can be attributed to CWA bargaining efforts. The Verizon brand and products are the best in the business, and this makes any Employee feel proud to work for the Company"
good,fun enviroment to work at i like the job.  i really dont know what else to say its been a while since ive worked here. thank yoiu. ok gotta go imm just typing making mistakes
good,I was baffled by the union rep when he sided with the supervisor and that made me unsure of the persons that I worked with.
good,"Lots of benefits, great culture, and a manager that is better than any I've ever had. My team is caring and is more like a family. I learn a lot and never have a problem approaching another teammate or manager for help. The company is changing a lot and sometimes I worry about the security of my job; I also do not want to be a sales rep forever. The company had graciously paid for my master's degree and I would like to put it to use. I also have to mention their drive to empower women in the technology field, it's top notch and makes me proud to work there."
good,"Great opportunity to grow, and learn ."
good,"The job and customers can be stressful, but the management and benefits are great! Health insurance, PTO, sick leave,  STD, FMLA, vision, dental, etc."
good,"Encouraged higher learning, very family oriented, kept you in the loop on the company.  Offered training and mentoring.  Leadership very accessible with an open door policy."
good,Verizon is the best company I have ever worked for in respect to its willingness to invest in their employees. The job is very challenging and energy draining by nature. No matter how many resources Verizon invests into developing  great workplace culture they can not change the fact that listening to people complain for eight hours is tough.
good,"Help customers that came in for assistance , and help renew plans or upgrade services . Management was good . it was fun place everyone got along with each other.."
good,depending on what position you are working at it can be very stressful and take up a lot of your time if you are on call. The elimination of jobs thru the years has put a lot more work load on individuals and leaves you with very little home life.
good,"On the phone with customers for 8 hours assisting then with their cell phone issues.  Did not know a lot about cell phones at the time but I learned a lot had an excellent manager was promoted very quickly to lead and always exceeded their expectations..The hardest part of the job was the commute and working Sundays.."
good,"Unable to provide detailed information without giving company information, but it was a very good place to work.  Company no longer has call center in Virginia, where my family resides, otherwise I most likely would not have left the company."
good,"This is a call center for business customers  calling in about there phones and accounts. When new phones come out you have to be on point because calls come back to back "
good,"Typical work day includes promoting and closing sales, assisting guests with their devices and bill payments as well as assessing customer accounts and offering solutions."
good,"Great stability ,  your co-workers were like a team, my supervisor was like a team member also,  Verizon has excellent benefits, the hardest part of the job was getting there."
good,"Company is a great place to work. Verizon is in a transition period or trying to figure out what type of company it wants to be. It wants to get out of the land line business, layoffs in the wireless business and now they are acquiring obsolete companies like Yahoo and AOL. So Verizon isn't sure if its a Media company or Telecom Company, and they'll be 100 Billions in debt before they realize they are heading in wrong direction."
good,The Verizon family was amazing to work for. They cared about their employees and wanted us to succeed. Great atmosphere to work in and gave all employees discounts on services.
good,"A typical workday at Verizon Wireless always encountered working with customers and getting to know them on a personal level by asking the ""right"" questions. For example, ""What do you do for a living, what do you do on your own time"", so we could recommend different products we offered. Verizon wants their customers to know they aren't just a phone company anymore. While working there I learned about setting goals and how or what I had to do to reach those goals, weather it be a daily or monthly goal. The management team was awesome, they tried to keep the flow of the store and environment upbeat and move smoothly. The hardest part of the job was having your customers believe that you weren't just a sales person trying to sell them something they wouldn't need or use, which in turn is why Verizon as a whole company focused so strongly about getting to know your customer well enough to recommend something beneficial to fit their personal lifestyle. Overall it was a great company to work for and I would highly recommend this job to anyone, unfortunately the job became unfit for me and I did not want to start to perform badly so left and planned on returning to school."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon Wireless is a place where you can build a career.  They develop employees and hire from within.  Do a good job, and you'll be able to advance."
good,"Verizon would offer prizes, we had goofy day. It was the best. It was the Verizon workers from corporate who made things more lively there. They made no one feel left out no matter their background."
good,"Working in the call center can be stressful. You're on the phone all day for 8 hours straight and sometimes you will have to deal with difficult customers, but in the end it's all worth it. All the managers I had for the five years I was there were great. They feed us when we do overtime during busy peaks of the year like Black Friday or IPhone launch days. The people was the best part. I enjoyed all my coworkers."
good,Loved working  for this company. Although it was a little stressful there were ways to manage the stress and be able to live around it. I was able to complete my studies thanks to there tuition assistance program.
good,An excellent place to work. Verizon provides lots of incentives including bonuses and prizes. Quick paced and a changing environment. Health benefits are good.
good,Verizon was an awesome job that has great benefits. Offers many opportunities for advancement. Company really strives to help educational advancement.
good,"Day started out saying hello to my manager and team members and co-workers. Everyday a new policy or sales product or repair option  kept you on your toes and constantly learning on the job. Loved my managers, all of them. We all worked together and very hard to accomplish great customer service to remain #1 several years running in the wireless industry."
good,I made a lot of money working for Verizon. I would not recommend it for someone with trouble closing sales as you will not last long if you can't keep up. I was successful there and I loved working for the company.
good,great company to work for and lots of room for professional and personal growth and development. There is an open door policy with all supervisors and training is very effective
good,"Great training process about 2-3 months worth of training with a gym, and Cafeteria available. If you need help you can easily receive training and help"
good,It was a productive environment for software development and quality assurance. Team work was awesome for solving problems. Working remotely reduces stress.
good,"The training programs are amazing.  Verizon offers a lot of support, they have great benefits.  You get out of the job exactly what you put in to the job."
good,"At the time Verizon offered 100% tuition reimbursement for all employees. Now they offer partial, but it is still an encouragement for developing future personal goals. The manager of my location was extremely supportive and I keep in contact with him to this day."
good,"The typical day of work is inside selling of  several products and services in a fun work enviroment.  The is a face- pace and quota requirement environment.  Plenty of overtime is offered.  Management assist in cross-training employees to ensure valued employees.  "
good,"Verizon Wireless was an excellent company to work for. They were focused on making sure we provided excellent customer service. They invested alot of time and effort in training. They made sure you were trained on every system, product, policy and procedure. They pushed their employees to succeed. The environment was very welcoming and we knew that we were appreciated. Management was always readily available to provide any assistance we needed. Great pay, bonuses and benefits."
good,Verizon Wireless each of their employees as internal customers. As such I received thorough training on a monthly basis in both technical and customer service areas. I would recommend working Verizon to anyone.
good,"I was with Verizon for almost fifteen years, and really enjoyed my job, my management team and coworkers."
good,"Great Place other than they laid us off in 2014.  Rewarding, great culture. Everyone respectful of each other. Not political.  Awesome training. Continual advancement."
good,"Pay was great, end of year bonus (STI) was always great! Had a great manager.  right before layoffs in 15' I was working a promotion, the director probably already knew we were getting rift. A waste of time.  Some parts were challenging but for the most part it was what I liked.  working with numbers and learning the products of Networking for Datacenters."
good,"I was a fiber support analyst and had to assist customers remotely with all of their Internet/TV and Phone Issues on the FiOS Network.  I already knew how to do the Job before I gained employment, there was not much to learn on how to do the job.  Management is very good as well as the culture.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling that I received from the customers when I fixed their technical problems, on top of receiving commendations from Management. The hardest part was the repetitiveness of it."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is an awesome company to work for. the job can be challenging and somewhat stressful at times. benefits are great. i have a special needs child and everything we needed was covered by the benefits
good,"Good management, good place to work. A tipical day at work is relaxed. The hardest part of the job is to have to talk to customers. I improved my customer service skills."
good,"It was fun, coworkers become family.  Management was the best.  My position was closed nationwide thats the only reason I had to leave.  Would work for the company again.  Great benefits and great company to work for."
good,"Lot of Learning scope. Will talk about new technologies every time."
good,Good company with great products.  Excellent benefits with a 6% match on your 401k.  They will allow you to relocate if desired.  Management opportunities are available.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is troubleshooting issues and being able to help our customer to resolve there issues. Also being able to work with smart people around you is very fun.
good,I like Verizon vey much. My wife works for Come by currently & I also had the opportunity to work for this company.  The only reason I am not still with them is because Verizon sold our government contract I was part of.
good,"It was a great place to work there over 400 people and pretty much everybody knew each other we were like family great place to work. There was always something to do. However our main gold was our customer making sure there issue, problems were resolve in timely fashion manner. And then there was a lot of activities also to keep us fresh and ready to go on in the rest of the month, week, day. I would love to still working for Verizon. However with the moving of the call center I had the option to relocate but I didn't take it but its a great place to work for."
good,This was a very good job.  It was very satisfying to provide our customers with reliable service.  It was a small office and a very friendly environment.  Everyone pitched in to help each other out so we had excellent teamwork.  We had number ranges for our orders and the work was divided evenly.  Overall everything was enjoyable at the job except the commute to work.
good,"As a retired employee , i can state that my time was a valuable experience. The skills learned  and training received continues to be a valuable tool in my continuing work-life."
good,I learned a lot about customer service at Verizon. I liked how they took the time to coach you through your issues or questions regarding customers.  Overall great place to work.
good,Verizon is a great place to grow and develop skills that will open doors for you in the future. Your shifts are about 9 hours long with a hour lunch. The most enjoyable part of working their were the team builders so everyone got along.
good,"The job is a very high paying job with plenty of opportunities. The job is very competitive to other large corporations, but very stressful. Some of the stress could have been avoided and some could not. The regulations of the FCC plaid a role in the stressful transformations of the job. Aside from the stress, it is the highest paying job I have ever had."
good,"I would recommend Verizon for future employment. I worked with company for 11 years to the day, the company made the choice to close the store corporate wise. Hence I was laid off, if not I would still be within the company."
good,"Management is so cool and good work culture.It offers cellular phone service through contract plans and unlimited prepaid plans for smartphones and basic phones. Features: Verizon’s prepaid plans come with many free features, including caller ID, call waiting, call forward, data alerts and three-way calling"
good,"you'll have lots of opportunity for internal growth, paid training and immediate benefits for health care.  There is a gym in the call center.  The culture here is very diverse and no one ever feels out of place with a big focus on the employee work /life balance."
good,Verizon was a great place to work and I would like to work at Verizon again. Love that they paid for your education. Great management and great coworkers.
good,Over the past 16+ years I've had the opportunity to grow with Verizon and it has been excellent for me and my family. I've been able to take advantage of the education benefits over the years and it's been phenomenal.  My project has ended in this area and now I'm looking to see what other companies have to offer since I'd like to remain here.
good,"This is an excellent place to work, however my particular job was very fast pace and stressful. The management was great & the overall working and training conditions were very good. I left because my particular location was closing & relocating to another city and  other states. So I was not willing to relocate, they offered an excellent severance package which I excepted. Great company to work for!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great job, great pay, great benefits, and the discounts offered were wonderful  "
good,Experience with the client is good. But I joined as a contractor so I am tired of switching companies and places as well from time to time so i am thought i can try to look for a Full Time position so that i can stick for one company and be part of that company for long time.
good,Best Call center culture to work in and grow. Competitive but very fun environment with generous rewards for doing well. plenty of career paths to chose for advancement.
good,Please review job descriptions available online at verizon.com. They are very accurate. They clearly define requirements and benefits as well as job description.
good,Great place to work with excellent opportunities. Very happy with my career at Verizon. I was able to grow and learn throughout my 23+ years. I am grateful for everyone I had an opportunity to work with and for over the years. Benefits were very generous and growth opportunities were available to all.
good,"A great company to work for. Treated my family very well by compensating me nicely for the jobs I have done with Verizon. Has let me be able to be an independent single mother supporting my family on my salary alone. I have nothing but good things to say about Verizon as you can see of the length of time I stayed with this company. 30 Years retiring in August 2017 at the age of 50. My commute however is 1.5 hours one way. I retired with full pension and benefits. Looking to find a shorter commute in my remaining years of working."
good,The Job culture and the management were the two most important aspect of working for Verizon Wireless. The bonus paid out for your performance only made the employee reach their potential.
good,"There was never a typical day of work as projects changed constantly and multitasking was a key to your success.  The Verizon management is great and they become your family.  I dealt with management and union employees and enjoyed the feeling we were all one team with respect for all. The hardest part of this job was ensuring communication was consistent among the regions/call centers and departments.  The most enjoyable part of my job was constantly learning, identifying areas of opportunity, reducing churn and increasing revenue through the projects I lead."
good,I worked for Verizon and several predecessors for 26 years and retired with a pension and lifetime medical benefits. The company also paid for full tuition for both undergraduate and graduate degrees.
good,"Wonderful place to work...management always made it fun to come into work and they appreciate their employees.  When Alabama was hit with the April 27, 2011 tornadoes, Verizon took care of their employees as well as the families by feeding them, providing gas, showers, electricity to charge phones, etc.  I can't say enough about them as a company."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, they are very caring for their employees and make sure employees come first.  Lots of benifits, very competitive pay, and plenty of vacation time. "
good,"Great benefits, discounts, pay increases."
good,"A typical day at work was answering phone and troubleshooting with customer and or service technician. I learned to remotely repair DSL troubles, change cable/pair and effectively interact with irate customers. The most rewarding part of the job was fixing the customer's trouble."
good,"Reported to VP of Verizon and was given multiple duties and 5 secretaries reported directly to the position.  Very well organized, good management, training was great."
good,It is a very busy and fast paced environment.  Overall ALL employees are welcoming and I love that they care for employee advancement. The flexibility of working from home when needed is accommodating because at times kids get sick and you're able to stay at home with them while you are working.
good,Loved working at Verizon! I was on contract with them for 2 years. They compensation is competitive. They also pay quarterly bonuses in addition to daily/weekly/monthly incentives.
good,Loved working for Verizon Wireless.  I was there 15 years.  Went to work with my former director at T-mobile.  I would go back to work for this company if offered the right job.
good,"Working for Verizon was really fun! They made it enjoyable everyday. You do experience changes on the spot or the day before a new feature or plan is coming out, but they make sure that you have all the knowledge and reading material on the subjects that changed."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Company is overall a great place to work. The people are great and well paid, makes the culture great and the worst part can be a bad customer. Only thing to worry about is the on going lay offs."
good,"opportunity for advancement. great place to work, great benefits. Will work with your schedule. Great place if you are trying to go back to school while working."
good,High stress but Verizon does their best to make life good for employees.  There is an awesome on site gym and cafeteria and the benefits are great.  Raises seemed fair.
good,If you are wanting a high energy career this is a great place to start.  You have a lot of training and support.  Other than that I will not make additional comments.
good,"The first thing i do is i complete if there is any pending work from yesterday which i wasn't able to do, due to lac of time. Then i do the phone order list for the stores, after the approval of the owner i place the order. i then reconcile commission and documents from the store. Then i add in inventory. Label and pack the accessory for stores. Make reports for what the owner asked for. Help my co-workers if needed. if there is some time left i do the Profit and loss excel."
good,Enjoyed my stayed there and everyone was very easy to talk with during my applying and resignation. Cozy pantry and resting area during break times. Lastly transportation is not difficult.
good,Coming from other carriers and working at Verizon was probably one of the best decisions I ever made. Sadly I took a different career path which led me to Exit the store I was working at but almost immediately I wanted to go back. If you want to be pushed to do better everyday and to earn a decent income this is a great place to be.
good,I loved working here. All the expectations were clear. The people and the environment from both of the Verizon places I worked for were pretty clean and professional. I learned more about their awesome products and new technology. Very fun place!
good,"Verizon had really good on the job training.  They seemed to have that down to a science,  They had great benefits including discounts on cell phone service.    I was on an 800 line so as soon as you hung up on one call you had to be ready for another call.   I learned about the current cell phones on the market  and the pricing plan choices, collections, researching lockbox payments etc.  They didn't do much in the team building department....but probably because of the nature of the job.    There were many different shifts and there were a lot of people in the Customer Service Department.  The people I worked with were always supportive including management.   The hardest thing I would say was when they moved a lot of their jobs to N Carolina.  The company merged a few times and understandably there was always a risk of job security."
good,Work life balance  was awesome and able to go to school and have time for family. The benefits were great with the awesome job security. Didn't get any opportunities for career progression in the way I would like to advanced.
good,This has been one of the best companies I've worked for. The management has been one of the easiest groups of people to deal with and they are always concerned with the needs and advancement of my coworkers and I.
good,a typical day at work is coming in at least 10 minutes ahead of time with a great attitude. greeting everyone in the morning and making sure every customer is satisfied with meeting all needs. the most part i enjoy about my day is making sure I'am meeting all of the needs of the company and also making sure every customer would recommend me to all of there friends and family
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company. They take excellent care of their employees with salary and benefits. Verizon is also good about providing employee training and workshops that will help to advance you within the company but also provide you general skills that you can take with you if you decide to go in a different direction. I would have loved to stay with this company but I was looking for opportunities outside of the US and unfortunately Verizon Wireless did not have a path that led in this direction.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for and the company offers an excellent work-life-balance! As a contractor for the company, I was always treated, as if I were a full-time permanent employee."
good,It is definitely challenging but it doesn't feel like a burden to do the work. If you like tech this is a great job for anyone to be in plus great benefits.
good,I have enjoyed bettering myself and sharpening my skills at Verizon. I have made great money for retail sales but there have been some major cutbacks in commissions as to why I am leaving the company.
good,"Very busy and high-paced."
good,"Working for Verizon is a lot of fun, and gives me challenges on a day bases. I lead a team of 7 sales reps and I help devlope them to make them better everyday."
good,"I loved working for Verizon , they really know how to compensate a hard working sales rep. they understand if you work hard to pay well. I love all the monthly contest to keep you on your feet. and if you were not sure of something their was plenty of resources at your fingertip to get the information you seek. vacation accrual is excellent as well."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A lot of opportunity to move up in this company. Management continuously encouraged employees to apply for the next level in their career  path, and provided them with the resources to get there."
good,Managing people through stressful situations. typical day at work is to be up-to-date on all tasks for the up coming week in providing support to other teams in IT.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to see my team excel in their everyday work.
good,"Learned a lot of leadership, account management, data analysis, and government contract procurement  skills. Sharpened my customer service skills in areas of negotiations & closing, being proactive in leading/providing clients with opportunities and cost savings that will grow their businesses."
good,"Verizon is great company to work for it. I will recomand  anyone. Their benefit is outstanding, great vacation , cell phone discounts, health insurance great too."
good,"As someone that has been employed on the network and outside plant side of telecom working for Verizon was an absolute pleasure and I worked with an outstanding Supervisor and team."
good,My company Managers and Supervisors were first rate people. The workload at times was very high but considering the vastness of the networks that is understandable. My departments had great team minded people and we all worked well as a team.
good,Great place to work.  Training and benefits are great.  Need to move for advancement.  Flexible time off and work from home is nice.  Take advantage of going to back to school.
good,"While tending to customers can be a challenging and enduring task; the reward of the job is in the fulfilling and successful interaction with the customer, not the result of their purchase. The job pays more when there are happy smiling faces on their way home feeling fulfilled with their purchase regardless of what or how much they spent it on. "
good,The greatest company I've ever worked for. The amazing advancements made by the company within the multiple industries combined with being a leader in cellular services made for amazing day to day interactions.
good,Guaranteed hours never will go under 40 hours per week. Commission will definitely be your cash cow especially if one is knowledgeable. You can learn a lot with the company on a technical aspect as well as sales. Management always finds ways to improve individuals. Always looks to hire within the company.
good,"Leadership is very supportive from what I've noticed. Actual job can weigh on you mentally at times, but there are lots of supportive people you can talk about it with."
good,"At Cellular Sales I was put in charge of the entire office, 36 retail store locations, the sales staff and support staff. I worked in every area of the company and managed several teams. I handled anything from HR to payroll, to commissions, to training, to hiring, to sales support to customer service. Cellular Sales was a very employee focused company that rewarded its employees hard work often. The management style was very macro managing... and i was trusted with setting my own schedules and prioritizing my responsibilities. The job was very enjoyable with a strong sense of team and a collaborative effort."
good,"Pay and Benefits are Great. Call Center supports Growth, Ethics, and the Best Training I've had in the Call Center industry. The Culture of the center was awesome and Sups, Ads and management on up are very possible and approachable. Very proud to work for this Center and all that they stand for, very Customer oriented and allowed Reps to always be what the customer needs as well as the company."
good,"The company provides really good benefits overall., Also is a good place to work, every zone creates a nice relations between coworkers of other stores."
good,This is a great job. The people are nice and helpful. The hours are great. They work around your school schedule. Management looks out for you. If you're someone who likes to talk on the phone you'll love this job.

I felt the employees had a voice in some of the training available to them.  As telecommunications evolved, it was great watching the many changes as they happened.  Most people looked forward to the company's bonus received each year.  Most people were rewarded based on their production.  The hardest part of the job for me was when the decision was made to transition all of Corporate Accounting to another state; not enjoyable at all.  "

Certain jobs required to be done first or during special hours during the night. I enjoyed driving my own vehicle, listening to my own music & being responsible for my own jobs.

good,"I miss this company! Compensation was great! You are able to balance work and life. They understand that you have priorities. The work environment is what you make of it. It is a rather large call center so you are able to make friends outside of work. Yet, the company is so professional that no matter what you will know your boundaries. Training is thorough and paid. Benefits from day one. The trainers are great. Many people strive to become a trainer one day. There are many perks of being a Verizon employee. Discounts on your phone bill and discounts with other businesses nationwide.

The professionalism at the Verizon Wireless call centers is spot on and you have the freedom to work with your teams and make it an enjoyable place to work. During my 7 years at Verizon, I helped over 30 employees career progress, so there is alot of advancement at this great company. The only thing is pay increases are given only once a year(based on performance) and when you career progress. Management is great, folks at the Area level are great to work with, and I enjoyed leading a call center to reaching a record high metric achievement.

The hardest part of that job was, getting on the phone for on behalf of a customer to correct something done by another Repersentative, customer service rep, or even by the customer themselves. However big the task, I would face it for the customer to keep them coming back to the company first and ""Derek"" second. the best part of that position was honestly haveing all of mine as well as my peers customers being happy with my service, enough to come back to me again wheather if it was just to resolve a billing issue, a tech question, or if its just to stop by and speak to me."

They follow a very ahead of the game type Credo when it comes to customer service they have just as much fun as work. You haven't limited advancement opportunities and you can basically write your own paycheck as long as you take your job seriously. I unfortunately had to move out of the area otherwise I would in a heartbeat go back to working for this company.
good,"Very fast paced, will train new hires so no experience needed. Can make decent money but is commissioned based and need to hit goals to get paid. Must have flexible schedule, not guaranteed schedule, never get out of work on time."
good,Verizon is a great place to work.  They afford you a lot of opportunities for internal advancement.  The workplace culture is an extremely collaborative environment.  Verizon has worked very had to become and stay relevant.
good,I spent 14 years as a Verizon Wireless employee. Only left because the center relocated out of state. Verizon wireless is a great employer. I would highly recommend anyone to apply.
good,"It was a great job to have, you were always paid very well hourly on top of your commissions once a month. Always room for improvement in the business as a whole as well as they are always looking to hire within even if that requires moving to a different location."
good,Everything is urgent and a very fast-paced environment.  I would recommend for anyone to work there as they pay well.  If you have good leadership they will push you to succeed
good,"great work place"
good,I worked here out of high school and learned a lot about sales and leadership. It was an awesome job with even better people. i would recommend this to anyone.
good,"I would work for Verizon again if I had genuine interest in the industry. I have other passions that took me away however, I have referred many family and friends for a place of employment."
good,CEO at this company is not good. Forced me to travel to his other locations if I don’t he says I can’t work st Easton because he doesn’t have room for me I can only work at pottstown because he needs people and wants me to teach them.
good,I love this company it is a great place to work if you want to be challenged. There are many benefits that superceeds many companies and they live their people.
good,awesome job - worked there 22 years am was giving lots of opportunities and then they asked all the management to leave  - I was a supervisor the entire time
good,"I thought I would retire at Verizon. I was placed in a ""lights out"" department of Billing working with Legacy systems. My salary was great, but I found myself stuck with no room for advancement in a critical legacy system. Then, I got promoted to a project management position, but it just was not challenging enough for me. Verizon decided to do a lot of outsourcing and I got so bored with the work, so I decided to take a special voluntary layoff package."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,One of the best jobs anyone can have had. Very good company and takes care of there employees. Very good benefits and vacation packages. Works with their employees
good,"A typical day at work is taking up to 70 or more incoming calls from customers to assist them. My takeaway from working at Verizon is to always make sure the customer is assisted and satisfied before that first contact call ends. If there's a situation where more intense research has to be done on Verizon's part, I must follow up with the customer at the time promised by me to the customer with a resolution. Employees and managers alike are always ready to assist each other if there's any difficult issues an agent may need assistance with, in resolving a customer's concern. The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of my shift I feel truly satisfied that I've resolved customers issues and they're satisfied with my courteous service and professionalism."
good,as a field engineer I am given leeway to manage my work as I see fit with full support of management. there is a great sense of teamwork and most of the time you know what part you play in the company's future.
good,Verizon will give you all of the tools you need to be the best in what you do. I have learned a lot at this company and I intend to use this in my path forward
good,"A typical day at work would be to brief each other on what goals/sales we need to be focusing on independently and co-dependently. Verizon - Cellular PLUS taught me how to remain professional and calm in  a wide range of social situations/interactions with customers on all ends of the 'good mood' spectrum. Management was very motivating and positive and provided appropriate instruction and direction at all times. Working on a small(er) team of about 5 people at a time was very rewarding, to me. On a daily basis we could rely on one another to keep the store, ourselves, and our customers moving as smoothly as possible. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, was pitching certain products and/or services simply for personal/corporate gain. For me, there were many enjoyable aspects of my position at Verizon; yet, the most relevant and memorable would be the fact that I was able to create and sustain unique relationships with both customers and colleauges."
good,working at verizon was a great experience. i had the opportunity to make money and support my family. it was a great start to adulthood and i wouldnt trade it.

good,Verizon is a place where I truly enjoyed what I was doing as an Order Writer processing telecommunication orders and working with techs to ensure telecommunication services were established.
good,"Rapidly moved up in the company from a customer service rep, to escalated calls, Supervisor of Customer Service, Technical Support Government Accounts and Trainer.  good co-workers nice environment enjoyable part of job is flexible hours and learning how to deal with irate customers using empathy and  showing sympathy tool"
good,"Verizon had all the bells and whistles a company can offer an employee. A typical day at Verizon was stress free most of the days.  We may have team meetings first thing in the morning to discuss any issues we may have experienced the previous day or any new assignments.  We knew what we had to do to get the job done.

I was able to work and learn from a very diverse group of people from many different cultures which I enjoyed and if not for my opportunity working there would not have happened in my lifetime. The hardest part of the job may have been being understaffed some days and if there were a lot of vendors calling in during upgrades you could get distracted from your primary responsibility of monitoring network and multiple alarms. The most enjoyable part of the day was completing my shift with no incidents and knowing I had handed off my group in good condition to co-worker taking over for the next shift.

The shifts usually range from 845 to 630 or 11 to 830. You get a 1 hour lunch break and no other breaks. Very long work days and nowhere to sit on the sales floor. Customers get tired and ill as well as it really tolls on the bodies and mental state of employees who stand stationary for up to 10 hours a day in the same spot while being screamed at by rude customers. Verizon is a great company, takes care of you, and really tries to make the employees happy. The customers and sometimes working conditions are a little ruthless"
good,"We would start with morning meetings and then go do our various duties; I did most of my telemarketing from home, but also sometimes at the office, creating meetings.  I tried to make at least two or three meetings per day which would ensure a good close ratio.  After the meetings concluded for the day I would return to office to create artwork for the ads and clean up any inquiries about the work I turned in.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and learning about their businesses and their dreams.  The hardest part was having the ads not attract calls and therefore customers for the clients which did happen in some of our less popular directories."

good,"I enjoyed working for Alltel Wireless and it's management. Verizon bought the company but Alltel was perfect. Alltel was concerned with their customers, which made it a customer oriented company."
good,"Everyday was a learning experience. A typical day would be being on the phones reaching out to Verizon Wireless Customers, going over their account to ensure that they are getting the best services, and share information on promotions available to them. Part of my job was learning about products and services and how they can be beneficial to the customers and how to recommend them for a new device/plan. The management was helpful when it came to answering questions that I had. There was little interaction with my coworkers, unless it came to asking them questions regarding a customer, most of the work was handled by one agent. The hardest part of the job was being able to get a connection with the customer, most customers answer the phones angry that we are calling them or don't even answer at all. But the most enjoyable part was actually getting the connection with the customer and understanding how they use their devices, and being able to recommend them to something new or ensure them that they have what's best for them."

Once I discover what the customer may need I try my best to offer the best solution to resolve their visit. As far as management goes, we are not micro managed so us as employees manage ourselves. We do have managers which is our team leaders. They are there if we have any questions or issues that we cannot solve. The biggest benefit working with the management I am with right now is every month based on our sales numbers: New activations, upgrades, Hotspots, Tablets, Accessories, and insurances sold. we have every a sales meeting with the eight stores and we get to pick which shifts we want to work for the month."
