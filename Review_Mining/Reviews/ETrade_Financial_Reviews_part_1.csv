rating,review
bad,"Pay is the Lowest you will receive from any broker or customer service firm. This company has an extreme high turn over rate. Your job will consist of sitting at a cubicle and answering back to back calls with no breaks in between. If you take longer than 20 sec between calls you could be subject to performance reviews. During high volume they will work you like a slave. No one is on the same page about howetrics work. This will be the case no matter if you get promoted. A promotion at this job is literally moving to another desk 2 rows next to you with a 1 dollar pay raise. Now I will say you can work several overtime hours but the job is a bit stressful so after about a week of working overtime, you'll regret it"
bad,Company is a terrible place to work; technology and platforms are from the 80's. They have no clear sense of direction or what they want to accomplish since they will be bought out soon and are lame ducks until then. Management is racist and discriminates based on people's disabilities. My recommendation go to a better broker.
bad,"It just depends on where you work at the company, my overall experience was not good.  They did not have flexible work hours, no remote work options. Overall experience was ok"
bad,Underpaid and mismanaged.  they tried to go online but didn't want to provide customer service.  I guess it was a model that was changing the whole dynamic of the stock brokerage business.
bad,"Not a good place to work. Go to another firm.  ETRADE is trying to find a buyer, so this job will likely be gone with any future merger.  Cheating among peers is rampant."
bad,"The facility looks nice, some of the people are great. I worked through a temporary agency and I think the experience could have been better. best of luck."
bad,"Please be weary of TSR and E*TRADE; you will not be transition into a full time E*TRADE Employee. It's all lies, They want you just to work during their busy tax season. You are just needed for the interregnum"
bad,E*TRADE is a disaster as a business.  They have very little financial acumen despite selling investments.  When I was working there the entire management team was fired.  I'm amazed they're still in business and I doubt it will be for long.
bad,"Terrible work places especially customer service. Managers dont look out for employees and customers very rude and uneducated. Managers openly favor certain employees; hard work is not appreciated. Highly stressful environment,Only plus is good training and great employees."
bad,Laid off from company twice after being there for a long time. Lack of  advancement opportunities. A lot of the work if perform by Manila.
bad,Employees can post negative comments online about other employees and receive no disciplinary actions.  Management is very poor.
bad,"this company was just awful.  Management would make you write up a report for taking lunch or a brake more than 3 minutes after your scheduled start time... thats right- not taking too long a lunch, but for going to lunch at 12:04, when you were scheduled to take lunch at 12:00.... because you were helping a customer."
bad,"According to recent announcement, E*trade continue to seek the buyer for its mortgage portfolio. Be careful to consider any position that related to its loan portfolio because it may be gone in any time soon. Just saw in Bloomberg news, due to the recent improvement in mortgage market, the buyers are finally starting to consider acquire E*Trade mortgage. During these years, I also saw my site is dying because of job cuts and re-organization. Saw 3 re-orgs in 2 years. The management was definitely unwilling to contribute to it's loan portfolio instead of selling what they can sell. Budget gets more and more tight. Almost no training is provided. Works were mainly done by contractors or Temps. Management does not care about workers. Both permanent employee and contractors were let go without any reason and surprisingly this is legal in lots of state including VA. People's career was thrown in the air. E*Trade really does not care about your career or your life."
bad,I'm not going to say much about the company. My views and outlook didn't align with the company's so I decided to leave. The leadership's focus was on their wallets and not taking care of their employees.
bad,"The culture of this company can be summed up as ""I am the boss and I do whatever I want"". HR is useless - they don't listen to worker bees only to managers and up. No confidentiality guaranteed either. Some people work 12+ hours a day and some spend days browsing. If you want to feel unequal employment get in."
bad,E*trade is a great company unfortunately local management is totally unprofessional and they have no ability to train or support representatives at the local branch.
bad,they use you as clinex. you have no value for them. they use you then throw you away. they are not honest. stay away from them. you got nothing but stress disrespect and long hours
bad,I would say the average age of the typical manager is 25. That sums up the mentality and culture. The location I worked at was basically a revolving door. It was not uncommon to see local police on site to evaluate bomb threats that were called in.
bad,"Bad experience, no room for advancement, bad management, knew of no one who enjoyed their job there."
bad,Etrade is very behind with technology. The local branch has a terrible location and difficult parking. They sell cookie cutter one size fits all portfolios. Branch manager plays favorites and has poor lead distribution and focuses on pushing inappropriate portfolios to unsuspecting clients. My advice is to stay away as an investor and potential employee.
bad,"Why do a good job?  It will get you nothing but a higher paycheck.  Due to a constant revolving door, you may be worked to death.  Yes they will buy you lunch but you need to work thru it and chew in a customers ear."
bad,Company is not solid. Layoffs are treated as a natural way to clean house.  Upper management is very volatile.  Plans are usually not well thought out.  Technology is antiquated.
bad,everything in this company was super micromanaged.  from lunch to rest room breaks.  more that 3 minutes late to take a brake because you were on a call and you needed to fill out a form...
bad,There are so many departments in different states that it was difficult to execute simple tasks. The management was not great at all and they were not transparent when it came to changes.
bad,Perhaps the worst company I've ever worked for. not sure how they got all the good reviews on here but do your homework
bad,Works company I have ever worked for   I would not even recommend a college student to start out there  The company has no direction and have been wishing to be aquired   The clients are only looking for cash deals but now there are zero commissions it is hard
bad,The Series 7 and Series 63 training was very beneficial but once you get out on the floor you are expected to learn everything though trial & error. The Team leads were worthless and would try to make you look stupid for asking questions. Worse place I have ever worked going all the way back to high school. I wouldn't refer my friends even though we got $1500 if they make it 90 days.
bad,The work life benefit was extremely poor.  The training was the worst I ever had and no help was forth-coming. The Management in the office was the worst I've ever seen.
bad,I was hired as a full time contract worker. training was a month long  in a classroom setting. Things began to go wrong from the start. The agency TSR told us which hours and days we would be working well ETrade told us something else. The hours were 12 hour shifts either from 1pm -12am or 2pm to 1am. The culture stiff and you are micromanage every second of the day. Being a temp made me realize that I would not be happy working for this organization I was glad when my contract was over after 6 months.
bad,"The management at the Alpharetta location fostered an incredibly hostile workplace. They will micro manage your every move and blow little things out of proportion. Don't get sick or they will punish you for it. I can't get into the specifics, over personally identifiable information, but let's just say that my parents wanted to sue them after I quit. Just couldn't handle the bs anymore. I would say it is a good place to get your 7 and 63 licenses and then bounce, as I did."
bad,"Best house on the worst block. Company does some things well such as website and branding. Personnel is ""uninspiring."" Bottom-up driven org where lower levels come up with strategy. Think office-space environment for culture. Pedigree is mostly absent across board. "
bad,"The main issue I had in working for ETRADE was that they forced you to up-sell to clients all the time.  Customer service was never a priority.  Someone could be calling for a password reset, or for a question about their portfolio, but helping the caller address their needs is not a concern for management.  The only thing they care about is to be able to get a caller to move his or her money to ETRADE, by hook or by crook.  If you have good ethics, this is not going to be a place you'll enjoy working at."
bad,This company basically relied on contractors to get the work done. It was a low cost operator and couldn't afford many full time staff. It did give great perks to top heavy employees.
bad,The company micromanages employees. There is too much stress and demand for the pay.  Very political. Pushes employees to sell without compensation for sales.
bad,"There is a huge disconnect between the customer service side and the corporate services side. The customer service side (Financial Services Representative) is the worst. It's pretty much a highly micromanaged, sales, call-center job. Your breaks are scheduled, your lunches are scheduled and you pushed to get what they call ""leads"" or you'll be frowned upon in the company. "
bad,"People get stuck in the quagmire of ETRADE and never emerge. As a minimum performing employee can maintain their position, some folks stay and lose their desire to be challenged and grow."
bad,"Things were rarely ever slow at E*Trade (preferable for me). "
bad,"For the last few years the corporate culture has been to exceed your workload by 10% annually and to look over your shoulder to determine whether you will be the next one to go. We have lost many good, experienced people for cheaper, inexperienced labor."
bad,"You answer phones all day in a call center environment.  Very micromanaged.  Every minute is accounted for."
bad,The work here is interesting but my experience is that the culture is a bit dull.  In Menlo Park it's quite and very 9-5pm or later.
bad,The site I worked at was telling people that they could take a month off and keep your job. Several months later they shut the site down.
bad,"The company is removing most of the talent and experience in favor of inexperienced recent college grads making much less money. In the last 2 to 3 years or so, many licensed, knowledgeable people have been forced out."
bad,"The company atmosphere and benefits are amazing. As far as the team atmosphere, you are constantly under a microscope. There were very few days I went home and didn’t feel as though I hadn’t had my hands slapped with a ruler. "
bad,"This place has recently undergone a paradigm shift, whereas it used to be a fun place to work. In fact, I remember thinking that I was lucky to be one of the few people who love my job. Then along comes a ""promotion"" to a new team, manager change and executive management change. Shortly thereafter,  the overall atmosphere went down the . But like I said, depending on where you land, the hardest part of your job can be tolerating your manager; as they can range from decent human beings to passive (or plain ole aggressive) micromanaging maniacs. They promote emotional eating to cope with the duress that system failures and their clients put your through, as there is always free food in lieu of a bigger cash bonus. The pay is ok but the time spent in traffic wouldn't be worth it if there was a long commute."
bad,"Depending on the department ETRADE can eithe be a great place to work or not so great place to work."
bad,"After a week in this temp to perm position I asked my agent to end my assignment as soon as the initial project was complete.  This was about 3 more weeks.  The next person in this position lasted 2 weeks.  The workers try hard but the inexperienced and unqualified management and poor equipment make the work impossible.   "
bad,"The company has high turnover. It has a lot of initiatives but not enough resources and poor priorities. However, it is a good place to learn and provide plenty of opportunities for someone who just graduates from college and/or someone who would like to move up fast, similar to a big 4 firm environment."
bad,"Job happiness is almost exclusively dependent on your manager.  In more than 15 years, I've worked for good, bad and mediocre bosses.  When I reported to good managers, I was happy.  Currently, I report to a dolt and my job is miserable."
bad,"No work-life balance"
bad,the management has no clue or vision of the company and they keep going in circles making it frustrating for people to work
bad,"an enjoyable work place with caring co-workers. supervisor was pain to get along with, but it was my co-workers that got me through the day"
bad,"While I was there the work was interesting and challenging. But (isn't there always a but?) Upper management was too concerned about cutting costs, so I got whacked in a budget cutting mode."
bad,Financial Consultants are hired to serve as a glorified customer service representative and to move money into their managed portfolios. It's as simple as that.
bad,Its a good company with good benefits however the current
bad,Great place to learn about financial market. The trainers are great. you will have to love working in a call center . Time and adherence is ultra important. You could potentially lose your job for being 3 minutes late.
bad,"This is the scary part of corporate America. Two 15 minute breaks, and one 30 minute lunch. The value provided to clients far exceeds the return from this company. Would rather earn necessary credentials for upper management instead."
bad,"Mission-driven organization making a positive impact on a massive scale"
bad,"I was one of the last to get hired on as a consultant and was able to review and open more accounts that all the other consultants. When I was not hire on at the end, I asked the manager for a meeting to see what I didn't I could have done better and all he did was play with his phone. He would not give me an answer to my questions.So I decided to drop the subject and  thank him for the opportunity"
good,"This position is better suited for recent graduates. The culture is not the most positive, but there is a lot of overtime opportunity which is a good thing. The pay is also okay. Scheduling is a hassle because you don't get  a say."
good,Management was an issue not providing whats needed to be at that position. All managerial responsibilities were passed to team leads as managers take breaks and lunches.
good,"Working for an inbound call center is the definition of being micro managed. Rated on call performance, quality assurance, told when to take breaks and lunch, and pressured to take more and more calls at high call volume times. E*TRADE sponsored me for my Series 7 and got my foot in the door. 3 years later I had barely any advancement and was laid off due to company cut backs for the Jersey City Call center."
good,A lot of good people here but management is driving people out in droves.
good,great foot in the door to help learn about the industry. People help you study for series 7 and 63 licenses and they are very helpful. Work can be boring but it pays the bills. co workers are friendly and hardest part of job is sovling issues when clients in your headphones waiting.
good,E*trade by its name was supposed to be a fast-paced cutting-edge online trading firm. But I was part of a group that made had nothing to with online trading and the company failed to utilize the potential of that unit.
good,"Leadership has great ideas, but lacks the focus to follow through.  The company can benefit by promoting diversity in leadership. Employee experience and growth opportunity vary based on department, no clear standards."
good,I was a contractor. Cannot say much about the benefits. My team and manager were great. The pay rate was average and so was the work as per typical contractual work.
good,"The typical day is answering call after call dealing with customers who are having trading problems. "
good,"Overall the company itself is okay. I like their concept (the whole trading on-line thing made easy for those whom never traded before). However when it comes to the culture well that's a whole different story. I resent condescending people especially when it's someone you have to report too. A very sarcastic, know it all in their eyes that assume you're inferior to them. I guess I didn't get the memo when I was told they own the company because you would think they do by the way they behave. Management suppose to be people that are easy going and easy to work with. I do not feel they represent that notion, again I am only speaking of the management I interface with. So, if you like to be talked down to as if you are an adolescent, be my guess join the group."
good,"Not a great place to advance, don't waste your time, you'll be laid off soon."
good,"Maybe it was just my department at the time, but days are long, everyone is ALWAYS online (2 am emails? The norm), working weekends is second nature, health benefits aren’t competitive. It’s just a company trying to break even with the street. Some drink the koolaid with this place, but I was never one of them. I don’t recommend."
good,"A company that has had a multitude of CEO's along with identity issues as they struggle to show growth to their shareholders and analysts.  Management is often chosen from a pool of old boy network, inclusive of loyalty and lacking in true leadership qualities and traits."
good,"A lot of turnover! Poor management in some areas due to the amount of turnover. Very friendly and kind people who work there, but also some very depressing people."
good,"You are given great training to pass the tests, after that, you basically learn as you go. Its a great start to the industry so that you can learn the basics, but once you get inside there's no real room for advancement. There's certainly not many women in the company and you do hear a lot of that. The environment is very laid back. The biggest piece of your job is sales. You can have some managers that seem to threaten your job every day for not meeting sales goals. You have to be sales oriented to be truly successful and is the only way to be recognized in the company."
good,"This team is a motley crew of members who have been there for more than several years, along with newcomers that have just joined the team over the last few months. As a result, there is a rift between the two lines of thought, which impacts the audit and departmental efficiencies/approach. While some Managers are fantastic to work with, the Department does have a tendency to promote people who have continued to dig into the Department for more than a few years - as opposed to recognizing talent when it arises."
good,"Lots of changes, a little unstable right now. No workplace flexibility unless you ask. Hard to get information sometimes from leaders, and when you get it...it's not transparent,"
good,"It works for a short time but working in a call center should not be a career move. Its fast paced and just like most companies, are sales driven. Very little room for advancement"
good,Management is out of touch and comp structure is not favorable to new hires. Ever changing working landscape making it harder to make commissions anymore.
good,Loved the team and people.  Management keeps changing and and organization was in the mitz of a reorg.  Unclear where it's going to end up.  Work life balance was unclear.
good,Review 70-100 transactions ranging from applications to wire transfers. Checked for fraud attempts and anything that could also be detrimental to the company's image when conducting business. Management kept pushing productivity despite not providing enough training. Co-workers were a pain to deal with. Some were ok but not alot to make it worthwhile to stay. Hardest part of the job was getting the initiative to come in to work. The only reason one would stay was the promise of an upgrade in pay after working for 1 year.
good,"My tenure at this company consisted of many ups and downs. I however learned a great deal about financial markets, investment products, regulation, and tax implications. The knowledge I gained is invaluable and has prepared me for the next steps of my career. "
good,"It's valuable because they will pay for your training to get your series 7 and 63 licenses but beyond that there's not much reason to stay long term.  If you're just getting started in finance then maybe start here, otherwise look somewhere else if you really want to be happy in your job."
good,"The company starts you out in Customer Service and expects you to feed leads to Financial Consultants. Management focuses mainly on the sales portion while completely ignoring the customer service you are providing. If you do well in sales, you can move to other departments. If you do not provide enough sales leads, they look for ways to make you miserable. Highly micromanaged company. They pay you enough to keep staying at the job, but your advancement is dependent on office politics."
good,The employees are a great group of people.  Upper management is a revolving door and with the changes in leadership comes constant change in goals and how we get paid.  It is impossible to build out a long term strategy.
good,"E*Trade is great if you you really need a job, they'll hire almost anyone in customer service. If you want a job in customer service or sales and can't get hired at fidelity or another financial company, etrade will give you a chance. If you work in operations, unless they see you as a rising star you can pretty much plan on being in your position indefinitely. Generally favor outside hires over internals. If you are in ops and do not get promoted in the first two years of being there, start looking elsewhere."
good,It's a hard place to be ambitious at.  I was actively discouraged from getting my CFA. That said if you're looking for a place to coast for several years it works.
good,"E*TRADE provides the opportunity to obtain broker licenses and rewards hard work with promotions/advancements."
good,"Very mature company. Not much growth. The company has a fixed operating margin,so if the business environment ever deteriorates, they will cut staff. You won't get to learn much at ETRADE."
good,Good place to start but if you want to move up i suggest changing companies. 2 years max get the experience and move on. Management needs work. Culture in the office is non existent.
good,"Technical teams at E*TRADE are small. Very small. Teams, or perhaps I should say ""teams"", that support critical systems are usually one or two person operations. Couple this with a change/break fix culture that requires changes to begin no earlier than 8PM. The upshot to all this is that if you are part of a ""team"" that supports something that needs frequent updates, you will find that you are working the entire work day and then spending half your night implementing changes."
good,Great place to work and fun colleagues.  Management likes to make changes so it is very dynamic.  The learning curve is steep and often difficult to keep up with changes in the industry.  Expect long hours and not a lot of movement.  Occasionally new groups are created so you can make lateral movements to the new groups. Career path is what you make of it so you are on your own.  There is little or no training of management so they are not very adept at managing employees.  The benefits are great but although they tout that Human Capital is their greatest asset they do little to invest in it.  Overall a good place to work with nice environment.
good,The company has always been dynamic since at least it's .com days and the culture persists. If you enjoy change then look no further.
good,"Beautiful workplace. Metro accessible. Lots of windows so as to see the outside world, esp. while working super late."
good,It's ok.  Good people to work with and good location.asdcsdcasdcsdcsdcsdegferwthbfrBHTRewr tewtbyryjubr6jyubev6tjyu7be6t7yju b
good,"Your job will mostly be in service catering to all sorts of people from all over the world. You will be on the phone for 8 hours a day and your work schedule will be regimented. You will learn everything you wanted to learn about the financial markets if you apply yourself. You will meet good people along the way, but ultimately you will notice that E*Trade is nothing more but a revolving door. Your pay will be below market value and you will feel underpaid in no time."
good,office was inviting and friendly place to work. after hour social events for team building were awesome.
good,Enjoy the work I do and the individuals that I work with.  I have had the opportunity to interact with every part of the organization and at every level.
good,"The new technology work comes in fast. Every day presents new opportunities and issues. They add to your backlog and you continually reassess and reprioritize.  You have to stay focused to stay on top of it all. You get things done, but it doesn't always look like progress was made."
good,"This was a temporary job. Although it was temp, it was nice. I met some really good people, but I wanted more. I knew my job and I did it well, but the opportunity for becoming full-time was not going to happen."
good,I never got comfortable with the expectations for the job because the initial and ongoing training were inadequate to the important nature of the work.
good,"A typical day consisted of answering 150 calls in bound and up selling there savings account to there clients base."
good,It's a decent place to work; as with any company there will be people you do and do not get along with. Most everyone is professional and willing to help you along your career path.
good,"in 2014 new management came in a ruined the positive work atmosphere. Managers picked on little issues like making attending town hall meetings mandatory, if not, you were looked upon negatively."
good,Good number of smart people who are passionate about their jobs. Relatively flat structure where you can get things done/make a difference if you are willing to put in the effort. Few egos. Limited opportunities for growth.
good,"Those on the ground do a wonderful job but get frustrated due to lack of upper management insight, playing favoritism and using jobs and promotions as power struggle tools. The company as a whole offers great pay and benefits to its employees compared to others within the same industry. work life balance depends on the team and management you work for."
good,This company was alright to work for. Management does not have a clear view of the future. Employee's are treating well.
good,"Most ppl starts from entry level, which is great for college grad. But it is very difficult to get advancement. Your job performance bases mainly on how well you can 'sell' a financial consultant to customer. They give you training to make sure you can be put on the phone, then hardly get anything to help you improve."
good,Was a great starting point in my career within the financial industry. Not much room for growth. They expected alot and provided little. Compensation was ok.
good,Good place to work. Lot of things to learn. Environment is good and so are the ppl.
good,Great place to gain experience and learn the industry as a yound professional.
good,Decisions made change constantly.  Hard to define priorities and gain stability in your performance.  Many of the employees here are very talented but upper management makes decisions without consulting to see what the down chain effects will be.
good,"I had a long tenure at ETRADE and was very successful. Like any company it had its good days and bad.  Surviving re-orgs and new management seems to be a common theme for medium to large size firms, and ETRADE is no different.  Over-all, it is a decent company to work if you like fast pace and latest in technology."
good,I appreciate the ability to obtain a series 7 license with this company. The educational opportunities available were amazing. The position changed from a service position to a sales position which made the position more difficult as we weren't brought in or taught certain ways to bring in more business initially and the compensation wasn't justified.
good,Most of the employees are borderline competent (or just very lazy)and it felt as though nobody had any dreams or reason to try harder than the bare minimum.
good,"Temp to higher position. Within the first few months, company announced plans to move to another state CA to GA. Unable to commit to the move due to family objections."
good,"E*Trade's biggest appeal is their willingness to train almost anyone about investments enough to pass FINRA licenses.  The downside to working here is that most of your time is spent on the phone, dealing with people who often know more about investing than you do.  Overall, a great place to get a start."
good,At times it feels like management will hold you back because you are more of an asset working for them versus promoted those who do well.  Those who struggle seem to get advantages when it comes to promotion because they are easily replaced
good,Etrade is very competitive with their salary but has a bad culture. Most Senior Management is set in their ways and wont allow teleworking. They are also not good about promoting internally. Some departments are cut throats and people will do anything they can to throw other people under the bus to make management overlook their shortcomings.
good,"Many employees are working for ETRADE for more than 10+ years."
good,"shift bids are awful; favoritism is alive and well; age discrimination is a problem; managers live in their egos and are not ""all that""; training for series 7 and 63 exams is the best part; you get paid to study and benefits are satisfactory/ pretty much immediate; various depts. were not accessible per phone while in the call center if needing help; had to figure it out on your own, which makes NO sense.  very stressful environment"
good,"Large recent turn over in the compliance departments which has made for uncertain future.  No career advancement for last five years.  "
good,The Company is conducting cutting edge work which will stretch the intellect of all those involved. Lots of though provoking work with tight deadlines and demanding clients
good,Very disappointed in how the relationship of being hired as a contract employee and no opportunity to be hired permanent was followed through.  Many promises made by company were not honored and not handled in an ethical manner.
good,Decent place to work. Great technology. Management needs to make some improvement on employee compensation. Compensation has not been at par with industry
good,"8 CEOs in 10 years...I think that says it all.  The company just doesn't have a direction, and changes on an almost daily basis.  For your entry level positions, that doesn't matter much, you just handle the problems that are right in front of you...but for the people who move up into specialized roles, it's a constant battle just to get simple changes.  "
good,"Though there is a modest salary, the threat of take merger and layoffs in the New York area offices has always loomed over the office."
good,"OK place to work depending on your location. The fact that the company is spread out really prevents growth."
good,Great people. Challenging work. Continual changing environment that is under constant transformation losing track of all the people always leaving the company.
good,"An interesting place to work with at first, leading to a dull and unrewarding work life. Great pay and benefits but much lacked in terms of excitement. A nice commute all in all."
good,"Good,It was a nice expericnce working in Etrade,good learning curve."
good,Technology Company more than a Brokerage.  Programmers have more power than Business Users.  Good people in Operations.
good,"Life at eTrade is much like any call center -- stats driven, production oriented.  Employees are broken into teams and shifts, which are allocated based on one's call stats -- the better you are at handle times, the more you are able to provide ""Client Engagement"" leads to the firms asset managers, the better your stats, and thus your shift.  Stats are measured weekly, and failure to make ""goal"" can result in discipline."
good,Paid training program is phenomenal. Management seems to be extremely stagnant. Call center
good,Cross training with others and learning new skills which promotes career advancement.
good,Had opportunities to learn about markets and banking.  We thought the company would go insolvent during my employment.  Seems managment is top heavy with youth vs. experienced workers.  Salary appears common for the position.  Not enough opportunity for other positions.
good,"Customer service is a high volumn non stop call center"
good,"Most jobs are call center focused, which places a premium on job efficiency. Break times, lunch times, everything is measured down to the minute."
good,"Typical days were often busy, fielding external customer, internal employee and team member inquiries/escalations. Education at E*TRADE was strongly encouraged with resources and opportunities provided to those willing to take advantage or required due to job responsibilities. The overall business environment with regards to interactions with management and co-workers was strictly professional as team members and managers were often shuffled. The hardest part of the job was aligning company goals which were usually vague and unclear with personal and professional goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was the access of information and insight into the financial markets."
good,"This is a good company to get your foot in the door in the financial industry, but not a place to build a career long term. Micro management as well as limited positions for advancement."
good,"This review references my experience back in early 2000 before the dotcom bubble. With their high profile Super Bowl ads, the company definitely had a confidence and swagger about it and it started with the very talented marketing team. The work was challenging, the hours were long, but I learned a lot from those around me. I've heard that the culture may have changed quite a bit since, but that's for someone else to comment on..."
good,Although E*TRADE was an enjoyable place to work the company lacks growth opportunities at this time as it struggles to fully recover from the financial crisis of 2008.
good,I have learned many thing from here because this company workers are very cooperative so they make company environment very disciplined and one can easily enjoy their work.This is a good company to start career in SEO.
good,High tempo and you'll have a lot of responsibility. The ability to drive things. But there are a lot of power plays and selfish senior managers. Direction of firm is always unclear.
good,"I worked in the Charlotte branch and would have hit most of my quarterly goals had it not been for the payment structure.  There were some things that were totally out of my control.  Even though I hit all of my goals, my quarterly bonus could be totally wiped out for the WHOLE quarter on the very last day!  Total Bummer!"
good,Leuk bedrijf waarbij je je lid voelt van een familie.
good,"E*TRADE cares about their clients, very customer focused.  My area provide a good work/life balance, I was lucky to have great leadership. My team allowed for ability to work remote when needed."
good,"A typical days consists of 50 outbound sales calls to clients and prospects."
good,There was no room for advancement.  Job was easy and picked up during peak seasons at years end and tax season. The commute is easy to Jersey City using the train.  Great location but culture not good in certain departments.
good,E*TRADE was a challenging work experience. I learned a lot in my 8+ year tenure.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the people at E*TRADE.
good,"It was Ok, while they were in Charlotte. They did well in caring about their employees while they were here but I think they grew to fast. Good company"
good,ETRADE is a company evolving in its strategic business.  It is establishing its core business and emphasizing productive work experiences between its employees and customers.  Employees suit up each day with a positive consumer experience in mind.  ETRADE's employee development is still a work in progress.
good,Not much work from home policy or direction on upward movement. The systems you use are outdated and slow making simple processes take longer and frustrating.
good,"The people are very professional. Company provides good benefits to its employees (HMO, Retirement plan, Insurance, annual performance bonus and appraisal, etc.)"

good,Got lot of challenges and learnt many things which made me explore which resulted in getting the knowledge and co-workers who helped me to be who i am.
good,"the job was fun and paid well, but the company has the habit of hiring temporary employees with the promise of full time work, only to let them go a few days before they would be made permanent. other than that the atmosphere was pleasant if tense and the customers were generally nice."
good,"Fraud Policy Development and Implementation"
good,"A great place to work when it comes to culture and work-life balance. Not much room for advancement, and no clear career path. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers. They keep things fun and interesting."
good,E*TRADE provided a delightful environment with many of the tools to be a success.  I left on good terms and would potentially consider returning in the future.
good,Great place for initial experience but limited room for vertical movement. Never ending executive turn over leading to lack of corporate direction. Very reliant on the brand recognition as there is very little innovation happening.
good,I learned my new skills within my field.  Some of the managers needs to improve on their communication skills and learn how to get the most from their teams.
good,"Everyone is very friendly. 	"
good,*Diverse teams.  Depending on what team you land may be completely different experience.  Overall alright place to work.

good,inbound call center with high call volume. answered 100 - 200 calls a day.
good,"A typical day envoles making calls to clients working to obtain new business through account transfers, probing for advice opportunities, and providing advice. I feel the bigest lagard at ETRADE is management support. The hardest part of the job is managements attitude even when you are successful in your position. The most enjoyable part of the day is the atmosphere created by colleagues."
good,"Good place to start, can be fun environment. some advancement but not above manager. yes man environment expected."
good,"This organization relentlessly strives to innovate. In spite of its size, the firm is impressively agile in detecting emerging trends in the market and adopting changes. Tons of intelligents people is a big plus. I can feel I constantly learn many valuable skill sets through interacting with them."
good,"You learn a lot at Etrade though it can be a grind. If you are working in the call center it is strict time with no opportunity. The culture is trying to shift to retain talent however you are at the mercy of your manager.  No flexibility is the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable is the coworkers."
good,Typical day at work is very like typical day at work for any business analyst. Management is very nice and understanding. The office has a great view.
good,"Decent Place to work - Okay technology, good vision, good management - needs to step up their game to match other competitors however.  Okay pay plan for the FC."

good,I am in an entry level position where they pay you to study and a trainer helps you pass the exam as part of your training. After all of the training you are in a call center environment and take cuatomer service calls.
good,"Environment is good. Highly competitive friendly environment."
good,ETRADE is a very fast paced organization.  There is plenty of opportunity to learn and grow.  The hardest part of the job is maintaining work life balance.  The most enjoyable aspect are the people.

good,"Involved in test plan preparation"
good,"Provided customer service regarding website, stock market, technical support, account maintenance, troubleshooting, and ways to be more self-sufficient with trading and account control."
good,"Its a great place to learn about retirement accounts, markets and everyday happenings in the finance world."
good,"Over the last 6 years, E-Trade has been a great place to gain industry experience, work with top of the line talent, and grow as a professional. I have fond memories of projects, interactions, and day-to-day accomplishments. While E-Trade is a great place for a young professional to gain quality experience, it is very limited as far as career advancement goes. Many of my colleagues have been in the same position for over a decade, with little hope of breaking out."
good,the day begins with getting all check and ACH runs ready. Once approval has been received I would run the checks and send the ACH. Then send the checks for extra signatures. At that point I start getting visit from co-worker and we sit and talk about all the usual stuff. Our management was great she thought me something new everyday. Once I was comfortable with with what I learned she passed the duty over to me.
good,great jumping off point but lacked growth. entry level role to learn the markets
good,"I had a great experience working as a contract/hourly employee. I was hired by an agency to work at the Ballston location. Great staff and office environment. I was included in the virtual staff/ marketing meetings. I reported to a great Director and Senior Manager there. I wish that I could have stayed on longer, but I needed a full time job with benefits. I left after 8 months to start working at a nonprofit. I miss my former colleagues at ETRADE."
good,"E*TRADE Financial is a great company to work for. E*TRADE provides employees with the benefits required to perform the job tasks effectively and efficiently, while providing the motivational support to boost employee moral."

good,"A typical day consisted of contacting my clients within my book of business and making new prospective client calls."
good,"This is a inbound call center position with 2 15 minute breaks and a 45 minute lunch break. Pay is hourly and is set among your peers with annual pay increases. Annual bonus and opportunities to win challenges for awards. Occasionally can sign up for over time which pays 1.5x. Management seems lazy and not willing to make changes to better the firm. Granted i have learnt more working for etrade in 15 months than i ever have in college its a ""foot in the finance door"" firm where most move elsewhere after 2 years."
good,"The firm went through a rough patch from 2007-2010, several management changes and current team seem to have us on the right path.  Management is excited and positivity has returned."
good,Busy Call Center environment. Great co-workers and management. Internal CRM software is a bit dated and needs to be updated.
good,"- Gained knowledge in all sectors of the Financial Services Industry (Retirement Planning, Active Trading, Banking, Home Loans)"
good,"When I first started at E*trade as a new hire, I was enthusiastic about the oppportunity that was presented to me. I looked forward to each day as a learning experience and an opportunity to grow. Unfortunately, my manager did not see that. He did not appreciate that I was not extremely fast paced and disregarded my effort on the job. At times he would question my expertise indirectly to insult me. For about 2 months, I dreaded going to work with this manager. I often felt unappreciated, undervalued, and criticized with every question I asked. However, after my team switched me to other managers, I began to realize that it was just that manager that was like that. I began to appreciate the job I work and the environment I had. For the time being, I have enjoyed working at this company. All I would change is one of the training managers here that seems as if he doesn't enjoy what he is doing. He was my first impression of the company and it wasn't a good one either. Thankfully, I got to stick around and experience the job with other managers and team leads. Hopefully this is the case with other new hires and interns. However, a first impression can rarely be changed."
good,"It was your basic call center experience. You do get to learn a lot about investments, and are facing new questions everyday for a while. You mostly end up navigating clients through the website though."
good,Good company to work for. Job and work life balance was balanced. The compensation and benefits were exceptional. Job security and advancement was average. The management staff was average and the job culture was the same.
good,"Ping pong tables, tvs with ESPN and a great coffee selection.  ETRADE was a great place to work, my management was great, the environment was fun and the work was face paced but not too much to handle.  I would recommend working here to a friend."
good,"It is a fin tech company. in addition, it is a fast paced brokerage business. Hence, you must be always on the top of your game. Management always encourages bringing new ideas to the table."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I was here for almost 4 years and was attending college the entire time. I left just before  graduated to find a role in information security, which is what my degree was in."

good,"Call center location, 8 to 10 hours on the phone with customer who have questions about the markets, banking transactions, tax questions, cost basis questions."
good,"My schedule is flexible and the time off available is excellent. The people I work with are the best in the business and the tech is too. From the online trading tools for customers to the cutting edge Stock Plan management tools in Equity Edge and EEO, no other company is even close to E*TRADE. They could do more to offer advancement opportunities in the Sandy office as it is very limited."
good,My workplace is a call center and it remains the same each day unless something causes the market to fluctuate. My shift is Monday through Friday from 8am to 5pm ET but my workday begins at 7:50am. I have a mental checklist I run through each time
good,"A very customer service oriented workplace. Management is very helpful when employees need a hand,"
good,"E*Trade was definitely a fun place to work and learn (and earn) until I was laid off. I'd like to keep the pleasant memories and not focus on what happened in the end. Overall, I was very happy there and I now have a sense of the type of environment to look for."
good,I do not like writing reviews. I have nothing to say negative about the company. I would recommend working there to someone looking for a job. That is my review.
good,"*Stressful, time management."
good,"Typical work day consists of 50 in-bound calls and 15 secure message correspondences. Heavy focus on service to sale. Series 7 and 63 licenses are required for this career.  In essence you are a licensed Stock Broker. ETRADE provides the training material and pays for the exam."
good,E^TRADE was a great company to start for me. The issues that caused me to leave were the lack of career advancement. Their culture is to keep an individual in the same position for a long time if you have the expertise.
good,E*TRADE is good company to work for with plenty of opportunities to learn and deliver. The firm is growing through acquisitions and new product introductions.
good,"Working on new product enhancements (public website/internal site)."
good,"Most of the day was spent assisting clients over the phone. Managerial and educational meetings would take place a few times per week. Supervisors and Managers are very well trained, and I highly approve of the CEO. The hardest part of the job was the knowledge base and having to answer a wide variety of questions immediately in a phone conversation."
good,great platform to learn about the finance industry however limited advancements past a certain point.  Poor perception within industry
good,They want people to move up the ladder. Good management that are looking to help there workers. If you can pass the FINRA tests you can do vary well there.

good,"Although I have only been there for 6 months I have found the managers and coworkers to be top notch professionals. Managers set clear expectations and goals. While typical bureaucracy exists (and really where doesn't it exist), the professionals and direct line managers get the work done."
good,Answering client calls on a daily basis. Financial Services Industry. Managing client financial assets can be tough.
good,"E*Trade provides opportunity to gain relevant transferable experience.  The environment and culture is fast-paced and can be challenging; however, hard work is rewarded and the compensation is fair.  I've spent 12.5 years with E*Trade and have developed lifelong relationships with my several of my colleagues."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits, learned a lot! Some great managers. If you get into a good department with a good manager there is lots of room for growth and career advancement."

good,Its a great  place to work and the mangers and supervisors are their to assist you in any way possible. I am a contingent worker there and it was a great experience.

good,"- In a typical work day I would answer calls from our clients and assist them with account related issues and their tax questions they may have.

good,"ETRADE is probably one of my favorite place to work at. I'd really enjoy having a fun and supportive team to work with. There are always so much going on but everyone is there to assist when you need them. Though, there are a lot of projects to work on simultaneously, it keeps you on the edge and allows you to learn something new everyday. I think the most challenging part is learning to work well with other teams but have them follow certain software development life cycle guidelines. But if you're able to develop a good relationships with other teams it makes every project more smooth and productive."
