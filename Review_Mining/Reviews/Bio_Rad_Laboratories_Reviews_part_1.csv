rating,review
bad,"bad company, if your not part of the company click, your treated in a substandard way, my manager is a bully, loves to tell all he is in charge."
bad,"Very busy at work"
bad,"management is prehistoric in how they deal with employees - if you are ""in"" you are ""safe"""
bad,"More focused on strategy meetings than actually implementing and doing. I learned that a huge corporation can stagnate due to inability to make decisions. If you were politically ""in"" you will become a protected manager. Hardest part was not being allowed to make business saving decisions when required. I enjoyed absolutely nothing about working for this company."
bad,"i was treated as a contractor - just did my job, they where happy"
bad,"the management has no compassion for their workers, there's no future"
bad,"Empresa sem cultura definida, falta de gestão da direção, processos ineficazes."
bad,"Les journées chez Biorad se ressemblent toute il ny ajamlais de surprise,"
bad,"If you're looking to advance in this company without kissing a few rear ends then this is not for you. Not a great working space very micro managed along with the feeling of alienation if you're not Filipino/Laotian/Cambodian or any kind of southeast Asian for that matter . You'd be better of somewhere else the pay is not worth the disrespect, barely over minimum maybe $15.50."
bad,"This is possibly the worst place I have ever worked. The EMEA Commercial Leadership Team are the worst leaders, a blame culture, distinct lack of accountability and lip service to customer centricity. There is no real desire to do things better, to be compliant, to do things right. Its all about 'looking good' vs actually doing good."
bad,This company requires a cult like following from its employees.  Long Term employees are rewarded while newer employees carry the load.  Management is top down run as a sole proprietorship even though they have a goal of 5 billion in sales. The job description was misrepresented to me. I fell ill during a 72 hour weekend call shift and was forced to take a warehouse position I was totally unqualified or prepared for.  Computer systems and work materials were very much out of date.  Company spent little on employee development.
bad,"free parking, multiple toilets, exit signs, break room, chairs, desks, walls, phones, carpet, windows, air conditioning, heat, running water, hot and cold,"
bad,Incompetent old school confused company. Nothing works properly out dated software. Everyone works in silos with a boring un engaging work environment. Worst company i ever worked for!
bad,"Empresa del sector de la Biotecnología, más enfocada hacia los resultados: gross margin y cumplimiento a rajatabla del uso del CRO Sales Force."
bad,Terrible experience working for this company.  Management promote a culture of blame and no one wants to take accountability for anything.  Very difficult workplace with high turnover of staff in most departments.
bad,"The co. has been on SAP for about a year. There is no one in the accounting department that can train you. So your on  your own."
bad,The co workers is what made me happy coming into work everyday. The supervisiors and and the upper management did not know what they were doing.
bad,"Bio-Rad is in an Transitioning period currently. So lot's off positions are unclear at the moment. In different departments. Still growing, but adjustments will follow."
bad,Not a place for forward thinking individuals. Long hours (at least in my group) and unfortunately really entrenched and uninspired leadership. Great Bay views though!
bad,"The work itself was not difficult.  However, I received contradictory information about what was expected."
bad,"The Irvine operation is in the middle of a culture change, the manager are changing and the ones left are very stressed. Expect long hours and changing project targets."
bad,"If you want to work for a team of management individuals that have very little interest in you, your health, or your family life; by all means go to work for Bio-Rad. Did I mention they were sued (and lost) for not paying their FSRs overtime.They set you up to do the impossible, then when you fail, your reprimanded."
bad,Bio-Rad is not the place for the 20 something crowd. The majority of the people in IT are over 40+ years old. Many of the managers have been there for years and are set in their ways. Not the most friendly place to work.
bad,"This was my second job in the industry. The colleague and the manager I worked were very strange. Did not tell their expectations up front. No appreciation for good work or successful experiments which were 95% of the time. However, they keep track of 5% failed reactions. The colleagues talking behind your back. "
bad,"Empresa Multinacional de grande porte de atuação no mercado de pesquisa cientifica, qualidade alimentícia e farmacêutico."
bad,i was just a temp and didn't have much time to observe the work culture
bad,Equipment Leasing implementation was a new learning in the Pharma industry. We used the standard SAP methodology and it was a sucess
bad,"Severely underpaid, I did not realize it until I went elsewhere. It is very hard to be managed by someone who is incompetent and doesnt understand the job they are managing! People are promoted based on politics and seniority rather than skill. High turnover."
bad,"Nessun supporto da parte dell'azienda, formazione quasi inesistente"
bad,"work was stressful, everything was a different scenario for processing orders. They wanted to much work to be completed on a daily basis as well as follow up on orders/work from previous days that haven't shipped for whatever reason. The expected you to get and understand everything first time. you got help, but unless it was an coworker you wouldn't. Management would fix problems but wont explain what the to fix it and just tell you that you did it wrong. when there were teams meets or one on one meets.  The supervisors or managers wouldn't really listen to your question or suggestion, if at all. HR wouldnt even take on your behalf about the managers/supervisors listening to you in meetings. . Most times they would just cut me off mid-question or answer. instead of showing you what was wrong they just gave you a list of errors and asked you yourself to reviews if they are your error or not."
bad,"Bio-Rad is an excellent employer if one is employed in a spotlighted position such as a scientist, engineer, business  professional,  or other professional.  However, there is a clear class system.  Advancement is very difficult to accomplish.  Management takes very little interest in support positions and has difficulty in simple assignment instructions.  Essentially, they focus on the Big Picture and have trouble with the Small Details.  Furthermore, most Bio-Rad employees have 10 or more experience / seniority which can very difficult for new employees."
bad,"Good benefits and healthcare"
bad,"if you work at Irvine QSD you are either good friends upper management or employees that have been there for a longer time will make you suffer. In other words, You have to be part of the club in order to do well. This hurts morale and drives good people away. Ask about turnover rates before you sign the offer letter."
bad,"Once owner passed after my 6th year being employed there the company then CHANGED. "
bad,"Bio-rad is located in Hercules Ca which is an excellent location, away from San Jose and San Francisco."
bad,Great place to work if you are okay with status quo.   Culture requires a lot of selling to make any change.   Drives behavior of trying to please everyone which in turn makes no one happy.
bad,"Stable company, but some depts. lack good management. Some managers do not lead their team, and are only concerned about their own advancement. Changes are afoot so hopefully things will improve. Also lack of transparency and a ""blame"" culture has been prevalent."
bad,good place to work if you like uncertain work hours.long days and expected to work into AM hoursxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
bad,"They draw you into this company with a great salary - however it is honestly not worth it. Worst working environment I have ever had."
bad,Too many people with high credentials and low people skills. Company is highly disorganized in terms of paperwork matching materials needed.  Too much emphasis on R&D and not as much in manufacturing
good,Sté où le bien être du salarié n'est pas pris en compte.
good,"My experience was great in the beginning of my employment with my hiring mgr. But after working with many different manager's through my 10 years of employment, never had stability or a just acknowledgement of my hard work. My responsibilities kept building up and more difficult to handle my position, while my co-worker , Sr. Admin. Assistant had less Responsibilites, got approved OT for regular duties and was taking vacation during busy department events and was paid more than I. Very unfair...and my concerns about all this was all overlooked. Nothing was ever done, I had to make a decision to leave, after realizing they were taking advantage of me."
good,"Training, in the field and class room was to short. "
good,"Great people to work with, longevity throughout."
good,"In the 2 and a half years I was there, it was pretty bad. It's very fast paced which i dont mind. But once a mistake was committed it came down to he said she said and the management always took the word of the person with more seniority. Management pins blame on the most vulnerable person."
good,"Never received formal training. Elders in company have own ""language"" and don't bother to explain to newbies. Bosses tell you what to do but not ""why"""
good,The company needs to make it's compensation and benefits package comparable to other Bay area employers especially if it wants to recruit/maintain younger talent.
good,"Bio-Rad is a global company that has all the benefits of job security that one would expect. "
good,Good company! Very hard to advance within the company. They sometimes promise things that may or may not happen. As a whole the work environment was not bad.
good,"I have spent 17 years of my career in Bio Rad, Its a very good place to learn things. Co workers are good."
good,"Bio-Rad labs is generally a good place to work. There is a strong culture of getting along and solving issues as hand without blaming one another for the problems. "
good,"Good learning experience with this multi national company. "
good,"Streamline warehouse - Basic warehouse to help you kick start your understanding in the warehousing and distribution."
good,"Management changes in the last few years that make things difficult, no fun at work. But organization changes happen ."
good,"Long commute for me (70 miles) but the People are great and depending on Management, the job can also be. They are trying to modernize by upgrading to a new ERP system (SAP) and deploying it globally has been painful."
good,"Bio-Rad is a great beginning but not much more than that. Advancement is rare and compensation is low (salary and bonuses).  Be sure to negotiate your desired salary upon accepting the job as the likelihood of a significant raise is low. Management consistently pile on responsibilities to make up for the many who already jumped ship. D O NOT expect recognition for all your hard work as it is rarely given. Lastly, the company culture is that of an operating room: sterile."
good,"OK company"
good,"high turnover in some departments"
good,"Grande parte da minha profissional foi na  Bio-rad  um empresa  muito  boa de se trabalhar."
good,"MA operations were moved to CA - no opportunity for continued employment for accounting team.  Because most of the company management was located in CA, there was plenty of opportunity for to make decisions.  The local staff and management were supportive of each other and worked together well in the transition of operations.  My direct manager was supportive and I learned much from him."
good,"This is in regard mainly to the Life Science division of the company. Overall, a decent place to work if you're looking for a relatively stable job in the science field. However, it is not the most exciting place to work and the company leans toward being too conservative and attitudes a bit outdated. Work hours are scrutinized, they frown upon working from home, they have zero tolerance for alcohol consumption (except for holiday party), and do not grant stock options-- just to name a few. Salaries are mediocre and raises are paltry. You get the sense that there is a great deal of complacency. "
good,"A Bio-Rad é uma boa empresa, possui produtos de excelente qualidade o que facilita a realização das tarefas."
good,très bonne organisation sur les planifications de contrôles et fabrication.
good,"Company does an excellent job with sales of their reagents.  Internal databases and software programs are way behind the competition.  Bio-Rad is light years behind Siemens in terms of making things flow with technology.  "
good,"Solid products that contribute for human race (diabetes). "
good,"Silo mentality, made it difficult to gather consensus. Group finger pointing, defensiveness etc. Too many internal hires, not getting enough multi company experiences from external hires."
good,"It was hard to understand the company's purpose. You couldn't even tell if they wanted to grow or stay the same size.  It was hard to work there because of that. I found other employees to be worried about the future all the time.  While I was there, a sudden meeting said that the company had decided to cut back its work force and that was that."
good,"My experience is one of react mode.  Unfortunately, senior management doesn't seem to know what they want, so there are a lot of fire drills. The communication is muddy and sometimes there is no communication.  We aren't sure what the company goal is in order to work toward that goal.  Depending on your manager, you can either position yourself for a great position or you are micro managed."
good,It's a good place to learn about the industry.  The department I was in allowed me to explore and learn many different molecular biology techniques that I learned in college courses.
good,"I think the company realizes this and has been starting to drum up communication about vision and leadership.  But important initiatives continue to be 'spoken' about and never acted on.  "
good,"If you want to stay with Bio-Rad for the rest of your career without worrying about updating your skills, then you are at the right place. Slow in adapting to latest technologies. No appreciation for work. Internal politics. No career advancements"
good,High stress in support and service.  Culture is focused on sales and profits. The people in service and support were great to work with and made it worthwhile.
good,Company is maturing as a global entity. Departments and divisions are fighting for their survival. Many smart people to work with and definitely a place where you can learn quickly
good,Dependent on the work environment the job can be manageable. Ultimately the people is what make the job fun and of course the salary compensation is key. Benefits are OK with outer pocket for medical quite high.
good,"My current company is very stable. I have learned and grown so much being at this company.  It will be hard to leave such a great company if given another opportunity. I would seriously have to consider and soul search before I decided to leave. Ultimately, I have to do what I know is best for myself if I were to be given the opportunity."
good,Great company but management is whats wrong with there distribution center. Many employees taking advantage and not participating as team when there is work to do.
good,"Great work environment."
good,"it was a wonderful place to work. great co-workers, great atmosphere. I had a lot of fun working there. There was a sense a family togetherness that exist at that company."
good,"very fast paste environmentt , several departments had to get to know the lead department supervisors for special circumstances"
good,"Bio-Rad has great products! The job I had was very interesting. "
good,"Good Place to work. Work and personal life balance. Overall, Nice place to work. Company located in East Bay. Not a desire location to leave."
good,You are always busy and on your feet. Quest processes a lot of patient samples therefore work has to be performed in a fast an efficient manner. Everybody was very friendly and helpful.
good,"My working in Bio-Rad is great/bad experience. Since I focus on continuous improvement projects, risk management and building up quality system, I experienced obstacles. Too much politics and people are too used to their current environment. NO body wants to make any change."
good,"I worked in the call center in Hercules, CA, answering incoming calls from Universities and Hospitals for product orders."
good,"taking orders by phone email for pharmaceutical products.  Checking stock, ensuring delivery was made, follow up with customers.  "
good,"La gestion de projets est une expérience significative en termes de gestion des Toll-gates (6 au total) et documentations, ce qui m'a permis de mieux appréhender un projet. : Cela fait partie d'une continuité qui a commencée à apparaitre lors de la réorganisation de nos services informatiques au niveau international."
good,"Pay and benefits above average. Often stressful due to repeated chaos as a result of poor communication, incompetence and apathy at every level. Feels like being setup to fail."
good,"Bio-Rad is a highly matrixed entity - comprised several  ""Global"" organizations. In that mix, there is a lot of opportunity for advancement and professional growth if you are willing to work hard and play nice."
good,"Working with the team provides good experience with many different types of hardware and provides an interesting experience working with laboratory equipment.  Sometimes though, issues can occur with management zoning out and not caring until it is too late to make a difference.  In general, development is unconcerned with following the SCRUM process correctly, only doing parts that are convenient and ignoring everything else.  It makes it harder for the team to also stay focused since it seems to me the product owners and management never step in to indicate what is priority, causing a bit of chaos when it comes to deciding what to do per iteration."
good,"At the management level, it may be difficult to influence change. It is in general a culture of consensus with some exceptions. At a lower management position, it is a less stressful environment. People seem to like working at Bio-Rad, specially in manufacturing where there is more teamwork and collaboration environment."
good,J'ai apprécié travailler dans un environnement différent à savoir un grand domaine de plus de 100 hectares
good,"Not the worse but not the best,  its all in the middle."
good,"A typical day begins and ends on the phone, any intervals are filled writing emails, reports, or logs. The QC dept is the face of the company's clinical laboratory controls sector and a high level of customer service and professionalism is required. I've learned how to navigate a cooperate environment, how and when to approach management. The hardest part of my job, besides being restricted to an antiquated in house software, is the lack of reward for performance. I enjoy helping people, and when you can troubleshoot a problem with a customer, solve their issue and make them confident about the clinical care they provide, it almost makes sitting behind a computer screen all day worth it."
good,"Nice people but a lot of favoritism.  If you're the one favored it was an okay place to work. If not, then you were stressed out.  I was favored but . "
good,"Bio-Rad facilities are nice and well appointed. The work culture is pretty much to oneself. Not enough teamwork as a group."
good,I worked daily seeing 4 to 13 customers per day. All of our sales were direct so it was easy to track on the daily basis. Management was ok . It was a great work place culture and was a good place to work. Upper management changes changed our culture from family to a military style environment. My colleagues were like brothers and sister. Getting help from tech support and customer services was outstanding.
good,"Salary for job title is highly competitive."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the US and international travel, wrting the service manual, and the training. I got to visit Japan, China, Singapore Australia, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany."
good,Was the lead LMS administrator for a project which deployed training globally. Once the project started to roll-off the administration I provided no longer had the volume of support requirements. My position was eliminated and replaced by a lower level administrator.
good,"If you do not have any common sense do not work for this company. You will be thrown into the deep end if that is not the biggest problem the staff turn over is very high, hence why they probably don't train the staff much."
good,"On my former post, I contributed to the amelioration of equipment, using various tools of lean 6 sigma (Pareto chart, ishikawa diagram, OEE, ..)"
good,This is a great place to work. The people and culture are very easy going an friendly. Promotions and raises aren't easy to come by but the benefits and stock options are a plus.
good,"L'environnement de travail est très agréable."
good,"Very busy, multi tasking daily, honoring all customers concerns.  Great group of co-workers, worked great as a team.  Some days wishing the clock would stop for an hour or two.  Very busy but feeling really great and confident about getting the job done and meeting the needs of our customers."
good,Was helper to fulltime facilities maintenance crew. Was mainly changing bulbs and ballasts the month I was there. Lots of carrying around big ladders to clean gutters helper temp contract type work.
good,The company has a good training system in place to prepare you for most equipment issues you encounter in the field and experts with a good knowledge base to contact if anything out of the ordinary arises.
good,Job responsiblities on documnation process has anadvanced electronic technology.
good,"For a small sub-department of the company, we held a lot of work on our shoulders. Environment itself was not heavily pressured."
good,"Excellent company to start a career but limited opportunities for advancement. The salary is well below industry standard. High expectations for job role, many demands outside of specified job functions. However, there is still good work life balance, most people can work a standard 9-5."
good,"I must say the best part of my job is the customers.  The hardest part is being told to focus on everything but customer service.  With hard economic times companies are cutting costs and taking care of customers costs money.  Great coworkers and the job itself is fun setting your our schedule and traveling.  But with a new CRM application managing from spreadsheets with inconstant data is never a good way to answer all aspects of your organization.  All in all I gained a wealth of knowledge in 8 years and started a good career.  With management making a hostile work environment employees have gone to covering there movements more than getting work done.  Since the passing of the companies founder they have lost there family run business edge but, happy I was able to work there when I did for those first 8 years."
good,Un environnement de travail très agréable avec des collègues à l'écoute et dans l'entraide.
good,"Culture Américain, Cadre de vie agréable, dans un parc arboré,"
good,"Stress pur, aber positiver. Gutes Team. In den wenigen freien Minuten herrscht eine humorvolle Atmosphäre. Leider ist man leicht ersetzbar, oder wird je nach Bedarf oder auch nicht entbehrlich. Großes Minus: Der Betrieb wir von den USA aus gesteuert und die sehen keine Menschen, sondern Zahlen Zahlen..."
good,Très bonne entreprise familiale en forte croissance et optimisation de son organisation
good,"Bio-Rad is a company with a high degree of integrity and work ethic. The products are innovative and of excellent quality. Our overseas offices are very supportive of our endeavors in the market. "
good,Bio-Rad is local and the people are great but there is not much room for advancement and the pay is NOT compatible. Its a good place when you first start out but if you want more money you need to go elsewhere
good,It's a good company to work for. The Project I worked for was executed as per the plan. It is interesting to work across various work stream teams both in US and Europe.
good,"Tres bonne equipe , et Environnement de travail."
good,"There's opportunity to move around to different areas of the company.  "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the celebrations and recognition the company rewards its hard workers with from time to time.
good,"Productive and encouraging place for beginner level jobs. Got to work with Various clients including Business - HR, Compensation, Payroll, Benefits, Stock, Security, Badge, On-boarding, Local and Intl HR. on other hand worked with internal and outside IT clients on various interfaces and implementations. Open and encouraging environment with independence to work solutions as IT lead."
good,Had the opportunity to learn a great deal about R&D through great management.
good,Le recueil des éléments variables de paie à transmettre à notre prestataire s'arrête au 5 du mois pour la paie en cours. Nous transmettons tous ces éléments à notre prestataire de paie.
good,great company to work and great co-workers and management was very helpful
good,Work with cross functional teams to bring projects to completion.  Ability to work without supervision. Ability to lead projects and represent Manufacturing Engineering in cross functional teams.  Ability to present and implement new ideas.
good,The best part of working at Bio-Rad is the people.  Most everyone is enjoyable to work with and eager to solve problems.  The obstacles tend to be lack of or old technology.
good,Improved my skills on how to communicate effectively with people from different departments and work together to find solutions and/or improvements to varyings materials and SOPs
good,"Employees are very helpful.  People are very helpful, however; if you are not management you are almost invisible and non existent."
good,"Go in and do your work kinda of atmosphere. Easy to make friends."
good,Bio-Rad is a great place to work. I have enjoyed my time here and have no real complaints. I was able to identify some of my real passions to advance my career engaging with others across many departments.
good,"Many structural changes and high turnover rate lately, poor management and poor insights in new product development and acquisition. Very limited career advancement opportunities for field-based staff."
good,Environnement hors du commun (ancien site de pasteur)
good,"L'entreprise est organisée en division et en pôle d'excellence par métier au sein de chaque division. Une telle organisation permet à la division d'être autonome dans la gestion de ces projets cependant elle favorise naturellement le travail en ""silo"" parfois néfaste pour l'avancée d'un projet. Un travail en transverse est donc indispensable pour maintenir la communication et la motivation des équipes."
good,"Lots of great tech poured into a great product, but too late for product launch to be profitable.  Closed facility.  Work was fast paced, culture was great, but management was slow to react."
good,Empresa dinâmica e com excelentes quadros e portfólio de produtos.
good,"Very heavy workload with while expecting almost 100% accuracy with daily deadline finish times. Working in -20 to -35 freezer conditions. Manager and supervisor kept monthly statistics on orders picked and packed to make employees compete against each other instead of working as a team to accomplish getting all orders (average of 1,000-2,000 daily) out by 5:00 pm. Manager had no idea about how things go inside freezer/refrigerators while picking orders, while always claiming to know everything that goes on inside or outside packing orders. Much more out of touch with employees than they believe they are. Unfortunately ""kissing the bosses behind"" does actually work for those willing to sacrifice dignity and self respect. Personally, I never have and never will."
good,"This is a good company. But lots of contractors, not may full time company hires."
good,"Werkdag begint om 8.15 uur. Gezellige ochtend praatje met collega´s van andere afdelingen. Half 11 standaard koffie pauze van 15 min, waar alle collega´s even tezamen kwamen om leuke prive als zakelijke dingen te bespreken, waarbij ook veel gelachen werd. Veel ervaring opgedaan als debiteurenbeheerder in de afgelopen 12 jaar.  Over de hele dag regelmatig contact met collega´s van de afdeling verkoop. Het leuke van mijn baan was, dat ik veel verschillende werkzaamheden had. Naast de debiteuren, verwerkte ik ook de bankafschriften, controleerde de credit facturen, zorgde voor de aan- en afwezigheid registratie en ziekteregistratie. Gaf ik ondersteuning bij de verwerking van de salarissen. Kortom een leuke afwisselende baan."
good,"You will face new challenge everyday, won't get bored. Bio-Rad is a little conservative, but stable in new tech development."
good,"Working with great people and excellent management. In continuing the mission of Advancing Science and Improving Lives, you have the opportunity to make contributions to products that improve life on the planet Earth in meaningful ways. I love the get the job done environment in Plano and being part of a team that delivers"
good,This company definitely provided me a good amount of growth but the compensation could definitely be better. Overall a good working environment with great employees.
good,"Great place to work, nice people, great culture, fast pace, great products and the pay And health benefits are extremely awesome. Wish the company was not relocating"
good,"Good work life balance, but lack of advancement. "
good,Helaas is Bio-Rad in 2014 verhuist naar België anders had ik er nog met veel plezier gewerkt.
good,Firma o dużym potencjale. Duże możliwości samorozwoju oraz autokreacji.
good,"Tres bonne société"
good,People are very nice and culture is great. I think they need to do a digital transformation if they want to remain competitive. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,"Place is stuck in stone age and needs to have innovative leaders to encourage the company to stay with the times when it comes to retaining their people, technology, and efficiency. I guess age and work culture differs between departments. Some people were very uptight and took their job too seriously."
good,Très bonne entreprise il s'agit de travail à la chaine donc un peu répétitif même en changeant de poste ceci dit le salaire est très correct et les avantage sociaux aussi.
good,"Great management. Flexible work schedule, had a great time as a product manager. They had nice training programs for  new employees. Only cons was my work commute."
good,"Bio-Rad is a world leader in providing quality control and a broad range of products for the laboratories, life science research and diagnostics market. It's guiding principles are humanity, growth, innovation, stability, independence, and opportunity. Bio-Rad core values are independent, innovative, Integrity and involved. It is a pleasant place to work with job stability and competitive benefits."
good,"I worked here many years ago.  When I was there, it was a fine place to work.  Environment was nice and other employees were friendly.  Cannot speak to what it would be like today."
good,A payroll set up on ADP Freedom - up to 6 monthly payrolls for different sites. Main tasks payroll start to finish and Month End reporting. Culture is called the bio rad way - but if you do a job well you are rewarded. Hardest part is switching off and having a break as the job is to make sure employees are paid and managers are given reports when needed. Enjoyable part is knowing you have paid employees on time and getting appreciated for efforts.
good,"Its a good place to work  . I would definitely recommend it to someone. "
good,The atmosphere is laid back. No micromanaging. Most everyone works as a team between departments. A lot of room to advance.
good,A good and nice work environment.Nice place to learn and implement.Good work culture.Work and life balance is good.Very descriptive training is provided for all the product.Good technical support from team members.
good,"- Os dias são sempre muito corridos e com muitos imprevistos, afinal de contos, trabalhávamos com o reparo de equipamentos."
good,Bio-Rad is blessed with employees who are very dedicated to their jobs.
good,"This is a great place to learn the ropes of a biotech company.  Lots of great people who offer mentoring and inspiration.  However, middle managers can end up getting frustrated by the culture's fear to change and thus innovate.  Many good managers leave as a result, but many stay as well because they are patient, or Hercules is just a convenient location for them."
good,Every job has its own set of challenges. but that what make it worth every second of my time.
good,"Typical day would start at 6 am... Some days the phones would start at six and would not stop until it was time to clock out for the day. "
good,"Le personnel de Bio-Rad et accueillant. Je travaillais avec deux autres secrétaires, mais nous avions chacune la responsabilité de services différents. "
good,On peut évoluer à l'intérieur de l'entreprise. Les bureaux sont relativement modernes
good,Knowledgable management providing solid direction during projects provides a great learning experience to those within the project team.
good,"Each day was different, I interacted with lots of different and friendly people on many projects and marketing campaigns. Management was approachable and willing to listen. Strong focused work ethic."
good,"journées longues horaires toujours les memes pour l'interimaire "
good,"The lack of vision of the use for the newly acquired technology made it difficult to work there, but the company overall is a good company. Once they figure out what they want to do the group will be much more effective."
good,"Bio-Rad is a great place to work, but I would like to utilize my experience and knowledge in manufacturing elsewhere and continue  working manufacturing"
good,"Pretty good place to work but some problems related to separate divisions trying to become a global company, and not as profitable as they used to be, leading to yearly rounds of layoffs and contractions. Management can be highly variable, some have been there too long."
good,"They value their core values integrity."
good,"Overall Its A good place to have a job, but at this point in life i'm looking for A career. The work environment is great the employees are amazing. i would recommend it to someone looking for A steady job."
good,"productive and fun at work, management are cool/not fair i learn a lot nice enviroment. production fast pace.hardest part dealing with power tripping."
good,"Medium sized company, top heavy. If you are in a group with good people and management, it is worth staying, long term. "
good,"Ce fut une très bonne expérience, surtout pour la découverte du logiciel de BANN et  surtout le travail en équipe."
good,Good organization to work with. Friendly environment. Management and coworkers are very friendly. Very good place to learn and earn good experience
good,sehr kollegiales Arbeitsumfeld in einem strukturierten Umfeld.

My main job is to key invoices for payment, but I also do weekly check runs, Monthly journal entries on month ends, get pulled for archiving documentation, help out when co-workers are out, and serveral other tasks that pop up from time to time. One thing about Management here is that they don't want you to learn just one thing. They try to change things for you so you learn other avenue of accounting which I see a good thing. So if we were to go out on our own we would take this knowlege with us. The tough thing for us right now since the started a sharde servives department for accounting at the Corporate office. We been told our department will be shut down in the beging of July with the start of thier new system they are using. So we will be let go shorly after wards.

If anything I think its a bit competitive. People looking for projects to call their own. The DBC is new, well equipped, the Staff are a group of Brilliant PhD's. every one is approachable and ""Human"" I feel privileged to work with such a wonderful group of people. I KNOW the science we are doing here will benefit society one day. We continue to solve problems and answer questions everyday. The ONLY problem I have is because I work with a room full of PhD's, advancement is very limited without an Advanced degree and LOTS of experience, but I made my life and I love what I'm doing."
good,Working in a lab is pretty cool. Interacting with the chemists and watching them perform their experiments was awesome. Cleaning up after them was not so awesome. It's hard work and mopping throughout the day was pretty tedious. The manager in charge of me was clueless as to what she was doing and assigned me to pointless tasks just to keep me busy all day.
