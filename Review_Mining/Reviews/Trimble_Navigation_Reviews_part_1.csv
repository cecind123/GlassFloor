bad,These guys will leave your application hanging after the in-person interview. They even asked you to bother your job references and by completing the survey. It's a good decision that I did not asked my current boss to complete the survey. Don't waste your time on this unresponsive employer.
bad,"You will be forced so far outside your job description you won't even remember what they originally hired you for. Refusal will be categorized as ""bad attitude"" and if you go along with it, they'll wring every drop of value they can out of you and give you petty excuses as to why you aren't advancing or moving up. The comp is decent for an entry level position, but not for what you'll be put through. Be prepared to give up every inch of your dignity and self respect while trying to do anything here."
bad,"not good not good not good not good nothing good about them no loyalty they steal , to the victor goes the spoils . never reckmened anythinh they have as it will change like the wind and sometimes you dont need it to stay the course."
bad,"This place had gone back to startup mode with no moral values. The management in Operations didn't know the products or their functions. So, they never understood the people who worked for them."
bad,"Those that aren't corporate drones should steer clear, it is a culture that will grind everything out of you that they are able to. Look elsewhere to be happy!"
bad,"Lack of Drive and Motivation as a company."
bad,"They will work you to death for a whole year, and will not hire you! Management doesn’t speak or acknowledge you. Its a lot of high school drama in the Pack Out Department"
bad,"Trimble is a very very low tech company with terrible leadership that are cheap with every aspect of the business except for executive pay. Trimble is a joke with zero growth potential, low pay below market, and zero support from management. The worst company I’ve ever worked for with a toxic culture"
bad,"In my experience, the company hosts a lot of ineffective people who have worked there a long time and who continue to hire even less effective people reporting to them. The company also lacks a cohesive organizational or branding strategy to absorb its numerous ongoing acquisitions. In comparison with Trimble's competitors, there also is a complete lack of investment in or belief in the power of marketing. As a result, it's competitors' sales growth, brand visibility, and stock prices are much stronger."
bad,Excellent place to work.  Very supportive managment that allows for individual contributions but availalbe when needed.
bad,"This is the place if you want to be walked on, left in the dark and completely have a terrible workplace experience. The company touts a modern product all the while the work spaces and equipment is old and run down.  Their engineers are complacent. Their managers are out of touch with todays reality. The products they sell are spec'd by competitors and do not meet the specifications they claim. This should be a law suit but most do not check the specs of their products they only trust the name and in this case what a falsehood."
bad,Trimble Navigation does not have a good management team. Employees at the distribution center are treated different than all the other buildings in the area and they are very hard working. Trimble does not value their employees that are dedicated to their job and have been a good asset to the company. The local management team does not follow company policies.
bad,"I was lied to at the start of my employment, yesterday's technology at tomorrow's prices.."
bad,"Management tended to be people that had been there the longest and didn't have management training. Poor organization."
bad,"Werk valt goed mee, is aangenaam."
bad,"This company was strange, the training was minimal and you need to look everything up on how to do your job from training docs.  The hands on training terrible (because it's minimal), the people skills in my dept. terrible.  Being yelled at and bad attitude if you ask questions on how to do the job or have questions.  Prayed to get out of this place and quick!  Temp employees never staying, people are always being let go.  I felt like I was being bullied by grown ups, never have I been treated like I was at this place.  I have worked in Government, Aerospace industries and never have I been trained or treated like they treated me here. "
bad,"you were expected to learn new software with no training and on your own time with no help for anyone. and then if you didnt have the software up and running to be use on a job, you were written up by the company"
bad,"Management lacks accountability and products are buggy and poorly designed. Hardware company trying hard to be a software company and failing miserably. Horrible training protocol for employees, terrible support and unprofessional management make this company (I thought would be my career), someone to pass by. Too bad..."
bad,"Trimble Inc. very rarely converts people to full-time easily. As intern, they make you work as much as 50 hours a week. You get very less chance to learn and grow. Nepotism prevails."
bad,Management does not loop in employees on possible changes to come until the change is right in front of them. To make a collaborative environment employees should have there opinions registered before decisions are made. This helps with a cohesive work environment. This does not happen at Trimble. Trimble tends to function in silos that hurts the overall company and the morale of the employees.
bad,Very poor management at this company. Workers are expected to process at a very high volume rate and co workers are allowed to come in late and not process at the rate of others and are not spoken to about the behavior.  The HR department is very unprofessional and certainly not on the employee's side. The only good thing I can say is they do offer very good benefits.  Recently over 500 people worldwide have been laid off.  Some employees working there in excess of 30 years.  They are moving so much of the work out of our country which has caused a huge impact on the quality of their product.
bad,"Depending on the leadership team you're assigned to, you can have a very different experience. Unfortunately, poor leadership is tolerated and can become very toxic. Work-life balance and flexibility are provided to some, but isn't a consistent benefit offering throughout the company."
bad,This position offered a stable paycheck for a couple of months but routinely lays people off. It is difficult watching people continuously be fired or laid off.
bad,"Worklife balance is needed to neutralize the heavy office politics."
bad,Trimble purchases companies and then fails to maximize the resources. The management is totally committed to the end of quarter and fails to invest in the products and people resulting in a smaller and smaller customer base.
bad,Job duties often included baby sitting the owner's young child.
bad,"They have great technology and smart people, but they don't know how to sell the products they have. Managers are promoted just because they've been with the company for a long time or because they have a college degree, not because they have the knowledge and experience to fulfill the position."
bad,"Doesn't Recommend"
bad,"There is good work life balance.  No one here is going you to challenge you to get out of your comfort zone and learn new things, you will have to develop your own continuing education plan and implement it on your own.  There are silos, politics, and turf wars, poor communication between people, teams, and divisions.  There is a lot of offshoring.  Not much in terms of individual, team or management accountability.  Limited career growth potential, unless you want to go from hands on software engineer to a paper pushing manager.  They will tell you that you can cross transfer to other departments, but most of the time, other departments hire from outside of the company because of the shell games and bureaucracy involved with getting an open req.  Once you get out of your team's bullpen, its a big corporate hedge fund.  If your division doesn't do well for the street, there will be layoffs - like other large Delaware corporations."
bad,The company used to be a great place to work with decent pay and lots of stability for workers.  Since the new CFO started it has gotten much worse.  The extra perks have been drained from the benefits package and everyone's job has become more dependent on stock market performance than their own performance.
bad,the company is really good. But the only problem is the management does not know how to manage the resources. The technology used in the company is old and outdated.
bad,"Not so good to handle products and customers."
good,"Changement de stratégie non justifié "
good,"I spend a lot of the time in meetings, with more focus on that than actual hands on work.  "
good,"I gave them 13 years of my life only to be demoted and treated like I knew nothing.  The management is biased and they play favorites and I was not one.  The health benefits are great, 401K, stock purchases.  Yearly pay raises, but not more than 25 cents a year!  Morale sucks, they don't listen to the associates when there is a valid point to be made.  Promotion is non existent . . there is no ladder to climb.  Overall, it depends who you work for that you enjoy working there or not."
good,I enjoyed my time there in general. I believe management could have been better as well as the pay. The duties I had to perform were fairly easy and repetitive.
good,"Trimble is a great place to get your corporate career started.  State of the art facilities and up to date technology are all positives.  Im sure at executive levels, this is a great place, but many find it hard to advance within the company.  There are no clear paths to promotion.  They do no encourage career development."
good,"Trimble was a great company and first of many industry-leading product innovations.  With the latest wave of home grown leadership 4 years ago, it’s moved from creating market changing products and customer focused to a culture of short term results and subpar thinking and leadership.  Instead of focusing on strategies and investment to grow the top line, senior leadership allows financial results to be achieved through cost trductions, starting with an endless amount of layoffs.  Layoffs seem to be the first response to achieve numbers.  Sad....it used to be such a great company."
good,you will not get the pay you deserve expect unpredictable work schedule and management to be constantly walking around watching you basically over worked underpaid
good,This company really trated me poorly initially and I was passed over for a deserved advancement four years in a row.  It was only until I made up themind that I was going to leave that I received another offer in a different department that I truly thrived and enjoyed.
good,I was a contractor trying to become a full time employee. Did not work out. Enjoyed working for my manager and liked my co-workers on my team. Wish things turned out differently.
good,"Trimble is an okay place to work; however, it could be improved. The company is getting large by acquisitions and I'm starting to feel more like a number than an employee."
good,I have learned a vast amount with this company. Dealing with end users in a hostile environment and how to apply my knowledge.
good,"Good company to work. "
good,"I had great co-workers but upper management was not in tune with the practical processes and time that it takes to deliver a ""good"" product."
good,A typical work day consisted of many many calls trying to collect a debt. I learned that many people are in a financial hardship at this time. My management team was fair and there when they were needed. I enjoyed the work environment a great deal. The hardest part of the job was trying to get people to pay their debts. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i collected a debt.
good,Day to day over shadowed by other peoples cultural attitudes and demeaning outlooks. On the job trianing was on going and per job requirements. Managers and subordinants were verried from passable to inexperienced.
good,"Trimble believes in a one size fits all mentality. In my case, if you are not from Tennessee, you will not fit in well here. It is very casual and very southern."
good,"First and foremost I’ve worked here for a while. Once you understand how the culture operates it makes a difference in how you do your job. Benefits are really top notch but the pay leaves quite a bit to be desired. Micromanagement from the CEO is not helpful. CEO must approve EVERY open requisition in the company. Merit increases are handed down in a bucket to each area and must be divvied up, CEO must approve any increase over 10% (including promotions). If you’re coming into the company new you have a much higher chance of receiving fair pay. If you’re being promoted from within you will never catch up to where you should be. The technology is very interesting and the people are pretty awesome to work with."
good,When picking orders handle  with Care and make sure u follow all forklift rules. Look at the serial numbers to make sure picking the right order and be respectful
good,Typical work day is long.  Business model is very dynamic with constant changes due to large number of acquisitions.  Management team was conservative and demanding.  Hardest part of the job was the long hours required to manage the work load.  Enjoyable part of the job was the learning opportunities that was part of adapting to ever changing work environment due to rapid growth.
good,Good people for the most part with changes resulting in managers being put in charge of groups they don't know anything about. Big con is the surprise layoffs. They can randomly pick you if you're 2 weeks from retirement.
good,Great coworkers and fun technology to work with and develop.  Good work/life balance for most.  Management is all about who you know and if you are not in the club do not plan on advancement.
good,"Job culture is good. People are helpful, and usually willing to help.  But as with any large company, you get lost in the shuffle.  It's who you know if you want to move up.  Salaries are low to average. Raises are rarely more than 2%.  Management in my area seem to be after their own success, not yours. Good luck moving up!"
good,"The work at Trimble was mind numbing, but satisfying.  There really weren't any benefits and everyone was initially brought in as a temporary hire until they passed the initial period."
good,Exciting technology. Good work-life balance BUT excessive office politics and very low racial diversity in leadership positions. Good benefits and reasonable compensation.
good,"California Based. Good company to work for."
good,Fast paced culture with hierarchy management style.  Opportunity for growth and advancement within the organization.  Great if your looking for Tech work.
good,"Trimble is a well-established Silicon Valley company.  Any employee will be OK if they show up for work and do a decent job.  There is some room for career advancement."
good,It is a good company to work. Management are not capable to provide resources to get job done. There is no good direction on how things should be done. Basically you have to figure out from the day one.
good,"This is a good company to work for, there isn't much negative feedback for them.  I would return if had the opportunity.  They are strong in agriculture."
good,"The co-workers and management were nice. Seem like a nice workplace environment. Benefits were good. Pay is generous. In my field, I sat for a long period of time. I am used to getting up moving around, so that is a con. The work load is unbearable. Very very high volume workload and difficult to manage. Must have excellent time management skills to do this job. In addition, I never cleared my desk due to always work to be done. I believe they could use a few more people to bring down such a high volume of work to be completed.  However, I do not believe that will EVER occur."
good,"While I was at Trimble I led my own initiatives, so it was pretty nice to be independent as an intern."
good,"Contacting prospects and business partners to set sales meetings and company presentations. Review trade materials for trends and opportunities. Research funded projects and place into pipeline."
good,"Not like a start up company, work is balance and no overtime. But not much opportunity to move up to develop career, people been working over 10 years on the same position."
good,"Co-workers were great, management was not very helpful with basic systems training - so people were constantly looking/talking to others who might be able to help get the data they needed. This was a waste of everyone's time."
good,Great co-workers and good boss. Opportunity to attend training and advance career path. It can be stressful due to business performance and interface with customers.
good,Productive & an enjoyable place to work. It was very fast paced & adjustments to new management. The co-workers were supportive with a change of positions or added duties.
good,"My typical day at work:"
good,I really enjoyed working for @Road/Trimble the first two years. lots of changes my 3rd year that made it more diffiecult to make money. great managers.
good,"Management offers a nice life/work balance versus other companies I've worked out. You work hard while at work, but they are also accommodating to family schedules. Pay was a little below standard for the position. Work environment in friendly."
good,"Trimble was nice place, on my electrical department  the people I worked with were nice and helpful we had a good relationship as a coworker. I learned a lot with them"
good,Very fast paced environment where everybody needs to be on their feet and hard working. The job starts with tasks in the morning that can be completes quickly or take multiple days. The hardest part of the jobs is always being on your feet with multiple demands to handle.
good,"Company is very limited in management tools and philosophy is narrow minded and dated relative to progression and evolution. Their management philosophy is very task orientated and non expansive to new ideas, methods and approaches."
good,Enjoyed working at Trimble I processed the paperwork that came in the morning In the afternoon I packed the product and shipped it out via UPS by EOB.
good,Management is often pressured into inconvenient decisions causing inappropriate results and adding to personnel stress. Great technical products and applications.
good,"Great place to work, excellent solutions and great professionals. It was a great place to learn new technologies (GPS, SaaS, IoT, LoRAWAN), present in front of customers and acquired a lot of skills"
good,Stable company to work for.  I would recommend.  Opportunities are plentiful and can provide a long term career.  Education requirements are needed to succeed.
good,"I enjoyed working here and with all the other people there. Even though I was low man on the totem pole, I felt included in everything that went on in the office."
good,"- Lots of Learning at this place"
good,This company is well established in its industry with a diversified business.
good,Prospected new business opportunities in public safety.  Worked with technology that makes police and federal officer safer.  Covered the east coast and security trade shows.
good,I traveled about 75% of the time from coast to coast and I just couldn't do it. They had a lot of new management with unrealistic views. It would have been an awesome place to work if they had better leadership.
good,"The company was established in the 1970s and is still expanding to this day. Given that it was created over 40 years ago, management and personnel is rather ""old school"" with existing application and systems being consistently in need of upgrading. Management was also a bit archaic in their management style. Trimble is not a great company to start and settle into your career."
good,"i had a great time when working at Trimble and learned a lot. Due to the location I was in, there were very limited opportunities to learn and grwo."
good,Fun easy-going atmosphere with great people to work with. There have been a lot of changes in the past year both good and bad. Not a lot of room for growth. I am a lot better at growing than I ever was before. I have learned a lot about myself at this job. The hardest part is watching good employees leave for better jobs or Trimble not hiring them as a full-time employee. Management does not relay information to the employees in a timely manner.
good,"Trimble is a great company to work for. They have built themselves via acquisitions, which has its good and bad points. "
good,Growing and continual growing company. Rapid growth requires focus and dedication to tasks especially at quarter and year end. Ample opportunity to input and discuss annual planning and autonomy in management of group. Overall a good and progressive experience. Management team open to ideas and opportunities.
good,"It was a good place to work, decent people and management it was a place that took care of people who worked hard and the were very understandable in helping people"
good,The management does a good job managing a large group of employees. A typical day at work starts with a morning meeting with all employees in dept to let everyone know how much work would be expected that day and if we work more than eight hours. Then we stay busy with various task till time to go home.
good,"A typical workday for me is to come in and help our customers (other employee's at Trimble) with any issues they are having with our systems or change orders. I have learned to use so many different tools like Cognos, Oracle, Smartsheet, Agile Product Governance & Compliance Module 9.3.3 – Administrator/Compliance/Conflict Minerals Manager. I can get along with anyone and I enjoy working with my coworkers, except for one because she tries to get me in trouble with my boss by making things up. The hardest part of my job is when we are at quarter end, because we get an influx of tickets and some of them are new ones that I have not handled before. But I love the hard tickets because I learn something new. The most enjoyable part is helping people with any issues, I am a people person and love speaking with them day to day."
good,"Fast paced organization that balanced product development for Enterprise Customers with market goals."
good,Trimble was a good company to work for. High turn over of personnel made it challenging to maintain a smooth working environment as a IT professional.
good,"I start with checking the printer for sales orders that have printed overnight. Check my email for anything important and then continuing with pulling the product, process the orders, box it up and ship it the destination."
good,"Overall, good place to work. Excellent work/life balance and opportunities to move around into different areas. Benefits and compensations are okay, but not great."
good,It was a good company to work for I hope the next place could be just as laidback and offer good benefits ad they did. They also help pay if you would like to take classes.
good,Great company that is aggressively acquiring companies to offer a more complete product portfilio to service customer's needs and transform the way work gets done!
good,Great company to work for. Good people. Great management. A lot of misunderstandings between HR and employees which I hope has changed over the years but the IT department is fantastic and so are the people in the company.
good,Fast paced organization divided into many subdivisions or business areas. Some team environments can typically be stressful at times but overall managed to overcome hurdles. There is freedom to learn new things and techniques. With being such a large company there is a lot of exposure to different products and industries which kept the job interesting.
good,"A culture of good old fashioned work ethic.  If you work hard and have a good attitude, there will be opportunity and a whole lot of loyalty.  Turn over is very low.  Average tenure very long.  Work/life balance is a challenge.  Some level of travel required for almost all roles from moderate to excessive.  Management style a bit paternal.  People are great!  A culture of accountability and success!"
good,"Although not very well known to most people, Trimble is a wonderful place to work, and offers a great culture for people who don't like wearing ""suits"" all day."
good,Good Company. Good work environment. Enjoyed working there.
good,This is a good company. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I learned a great deal.
good,Ótima Empresa para se trabalhar. Ambiente favorável ao desenvolvimento de talentos. Ambiente Jovem e descontraído!
good,"I love Trimble, everything about the company is fantastic.  It does not pay as well as other companies, but they made accommodations for a daycare situation and that makes up for it, in my opinion."
good,"Smart engineers and developers to work with. People work out during the lunch break, and have high energy in the afternoon."
good,"Great place to work - innovative and a true global competitor.  Fun environment, multi-campus work opportunities.  Clear vision from leadership team working towards one end."
good,Component engineering is a critical position in electrical field of any manufacturing and design company to insure that a proper component is selected and maintained for every product.

good,"Monthly advertising"
good,"pros - Flexible schedule, regular working hours, good benefits, company has recovered from financial downturns in the past"
good,"The work was mostly the same everyday, which I like because I always knew what I would be doing the following day. Coworkers were friendly and usually easy to work with. Management was good, but not great."
good,Worked well with internal and external departments. Handled escalations and provided excellent customer service.
good,A lot of folks have been there 20+ years but they have new managers who don't care about the employees. They are better fit to be correction officers rather than leaders.
good,The environment is fast paced and the overtime was never ending however i enjoyed the people that i worked for or the people that i worked with.  I would recommend this company.
good,"very good company."
good,"This was my first career in accounting, I had learned a lot in there and had great experience, had great mangers that give me the opportunity to grow in my career whic helped me to move to a senior accountant position at iPass."
good,"Trimble continues to grow and advance in their technology. Many people I still am in contact with are there for life because they love the company that much,"
good,"The company moved my position after 10 years, but they did take care of me in the end. The people were wonderful and I was able to do my job independently."
good,Trimble Navigation is great place to work if you're interested in technology and innovation.  The company is also very good about providing employee growth.
good,like my job. not the best salary but it works. good location. good benefits. nice vacation time. if you are young expect to stand out. everyone will remind you are 20 years younger than them
good,"They had the best compensation for employees in Chennai."
good,"In the morning I go thought all my emails, working any that come through needing my attention. Then I update my logs and between those two areas, my day takes off. My goal daily is to gain RoHS compliance documentation, Working in this area, the job always takes me into other areas of work...one thing leads to another, in other words. Everyday I learn something new."
good,Absolutely the best group of people I've ever worked with. Really a great company to be a part of. Definitely recommend them for Project Managers/Client management types of jobs.
good,Small Colorado business that helps treat most major pests that can negatively effect a home. No contracts and a personal yet professional relationship with the customer ensured for solid work being completed
good,"Global high technology company."
good,"•	Planned complex, business changing high level projects by assessing possible project risks and managed scope changes to deliver projects within agreed time constraints and cost."
good,"Overall I continue to be overwhelmingly impressed with the vision, product and service mix and roadmap of this global leader.  Great, bright people are abundant at Trimble I would gladly work here again."

good,"A typical day of work"
good,You could be overwhelmed if your in a job function that is tied to revenue.  After leaving Supply Chain and moving in Environmental Program Management the stress level was reduced.  The job descriptions are made such that you can really be your own entrepreneur and work your job while meeting company goals and values.  This is what is great about Trimble.
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Progressive management team is demanding, but fair.  Training is available and encouraged.  Trimble encourages learning for advancement possibility."
