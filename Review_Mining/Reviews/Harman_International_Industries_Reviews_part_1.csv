bad,"They treat people like trash. Disposable. Work you hard, burn you out, kick you to the curb. And produce a lousy product.  Take advantage of the h1 system to import slave like labor and treat them as such."
bad,"Management rewards employees not based on your work ethic or quality of your work but who they socialize with.  Employees that hang out with management get opportunities that should go to others.  Management doesn't address any issues whether it be with employees being late, not in the phone queue, or bullying done by others.  The atmosphere is toxic and never addressed by management.  Management has unfair hiring practices and unfair promotion practices.  Those who due the minimum or show up to work late get promoted.  Management lies to employees when plants close down"
bad,"Every thing is unordered in Harman."
bad,no management skills. work 7 days a week. they the do not care about the employees. this is so bad that even the lower management changed almost weekly
bad,Not organized and no leadership. Management are only worried about making their bonus. Management does not want to fix or hear about any issues and will not address it
bad,En la empresa no te dan oportunidad de crecimiento
bad,Harman is becoming a shell of itself by outsourcing its strategic competence and hiring low cost engineers and managers who are happy just to pick up a visa.  The worst of what the H1B program means for the USA.
bad,"There is no work/life balance when you work here. If you have a family that you love and want to spend time with do not apply to work for them."
bad,top heavy organization - too many directors with inflated egos who only think about self and not project or company ! Every one on top is a glorified ticket manager with no sense of project management !
bad,"NA management is bad. Very partial to their locals. "
bad,"They didn't care about family at all. Their main concern was the bottom dollar. I worked from 7a to 7p sometimes and other times I worked from 7a to 3:30p, 7 days a week with 1 day off every 3 weeks. I was a single mom, so I had to work but I never got to spend time with my son but once a month. The money doesn't compensate for the time missed with family."
bad,"Environment:"
bad,"A very engaging but sparsely productive set-up, that is constantly into transition modes."
bad,"Company prefers to hire H1b Visa employees over american workers.  They force these workers to work 80-90 hours a week and then try  to measure US workers to the h1b Visa  workers productivity.  "
bad,"3 műszakra kapnak az ott dolgozók 130000ftot.. Más részlegen lehet, hogy több a fizetés  ,sőt biztos.. Nevetséges. Azt se tudja a főnökség, hogy kinek hol kellene lennie.. Akit Pécsről küldenek fehérvárra, azokat Pécsen keresik.. A jelenlétit nem vezetik normálisan. A bérszámfejtők rendszeresen tévesen számolnak.. Nem korrekt a cég. Senkinek nem ajánlom.. A szállást állják kaja is van.. Talán ez a 2 a pozitívum. Nem értem ezt a sok jó véleményt"
bad,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo - es demasiado tenso, la administracion cambio y desafortunadamente los dias estan llenos de reportes que constantemente cambian. haciendo imposible la planeacion adelantada de el trabajo y una rutina saludable. "
bad,There are many people with nil technical knowledge and none leadership qualities at leadership roles. They are not able to build good teams and maintain quality of products. Sometimes they think money can buy anything. The HRs are toothless or inactive. Everything depends on the reporting managers.
bad,"No work life balanace, worst working condition. work culture pathetic, no matter how much effort you give , the only thins in the end is blasting, the management always appears to be in Alice in wonderland."
bad,"Do not work @ HARMAN!  No work/life balance, management is a bunch of overpaid little boys who need their a**es wiped by the secretaries, who run after them like little puppy dogs."
bad,Inability to push new technology and management was part of the good ole boys club. No perks such as stock options and constant threats of losing your job.
bad,"Pros :"
bad,Harman has closed down and will no longer be there. Management only cared about themselves and no one else in the building. Everyone was looked down on. They were right you were wrong even if they were wrong they were still right. They really did think they were better than everyone
bad,"Unfortunately the company has been through a lot, lost market share and a lot of the culture that made it great. There has been an exodus of executives and ""rank and file"" employees over the last 18 months or so."
bad,"- Very Good colleagues, Clean Place, Good Benefits"
bad,"Pay is not good."
bad,If you really want to join... keep another offer ready with you for atleast 3 months after joining harman... within a month you will understand what works within harman. If you have offer available you can easily jump.. but i would suggest anybody joining harman to consider harman as the last resort..
bad,"In a year, few months will be 16 hours a day and few months will be  less than 4 hours a day, lack of planning"
bad,"very irritating management. You will find managers everywhere - this is with respect to office in bangalore, India. Its becomming a worse comapny. Work pressure all the time. Every manager will ask you for the same reports."
bad,They don't pay great but the factory has air. tHEY have great pride in their Customer Service.
bad,"travail trop rapide malaise a repetition,infirmerie trop souvent demander tant de pieces avec ci peu experience .un malentendu avec le chef."
bad,"difficile dans les actions "
bad,"Trickle down lack of accountibility and competence. "
bad,Great people to work with at the lower levels but upper management(CEO) make a lot of bad choices and blames it on the bottom/working people. I really enjoyed what I did.
bad,good pay for the work.  lots of overtime and now company is going out of business soon. the work life balance is a negative since they have a tendency to wait until the last minute to let you know if you have to work because it is all based off their current demand
bad,Fue el mejor trabajo que tuve..pero debido a cambios en mis actividades no me fue posible continuar en el turno...pero lo que me desánimo mucho es que aplique para algunas vacantes durante mucho tiempo y no me llamaban...al final califique para entrenamiento y para área manager..pero nunca me dijeron nada...solo me mandaron un correo dicie dome que había Sido seleccionado como área manager y ya después de ahí no me volvieron a decir nada así dure medio año...esperando...

bad,"La empresa cuenta con buenas prestaciones laborales, los horarios son flexibles y muy amigables. "
good,The job was not wat was advertised in the beginning. The training was all on the job training picking up from others. The work schedule was 7 days a week without time off for several weeks at a time. No promise of being hired on full time from the temp service I was through.
good,"Hay muy poco desarrollo ,no se toman el tiempo de apreciar tu trabajo"
good,"Buenas instalaciones"
good,"I have been working at HARMAN full-time (Less than a year)"
good,"Esta empresa fue adquirida por Samsung ,"
good,"This company sought me out and offered me a very good salary and promised benefits."
good,It wasn't the best place to work and the manager was a extremely selfish and rude to his employees.
good,"Currently safe with my position. Just found out yesterday that effective June 30th, that any temporary employee hired 1 yr or"
good,"On a typical workday you will see most employees walking around talking or sleeping on testers.  Management values and quality values change from shift to shift.  Some managers say that quality is not important, its all about the numbers.  They have been working 7 days a week for 4 years and tell employees they are not dedicated enough when they take points so they get days off.  Employees are treated as if they are stupid and are made to feel replaceable. "
good,"A lot of overtime, usually working 21 days with 1 day off is the typical schedule.  Have been a temp for over 9 months and there is no end in sight when they might hire full time again."
good,"A typical day at work starts at 12 pm and ends at 9 pm."
good,KFC is a nice place to work at until we got our new manager she’d talk to us like we were her kids and she’ try to disrespect us we barely got brakes and when we asked they’d get mad
good,"Poor IT support  impacts people ability to do their job.  Managers are getting training, but overall are not great when comes to developing their people"
good,"A good place to work in."
good,"most of my co-workers were high qualified and open to help everytime"
good,"Brand services was a great, hard working team of marketing professionals. Deadline driven department with an eye for accuracy and creativity."
good,No es lo que esperaba ya que económicamente hablando quedo corto para completar los gastos.
good,"Eleinte nagyon büszke voltam arra, hogy ennél a cégnél dolgozhatok. De idővel rájöttem, hogy ez is csak egy azok a multi közül akiknek az egyszerű operátorok nem jelentenek semmit. Számukra fogyó eszközök vagyunk akik közül bárki pótolható."
good,Harman was once a great fun place to work.  Management changed and everything went downhill from there. I spent many years working seven days a week. The company is closing down in Sept 2019.
good,No customer focus at all. Financial focus only with no relation to customer needs or expectations.  People working to get things done are alienated as being too risky.  Doing nothing guarantees a solid career.
good,"Es una buena empresa pero desamerita tus opiniones y no muestra tanto apoyo como dice hacerlo , aprendi mucho con respecto al sistema que manejan gracias a mis compañeros de trabajo , pero por parte de la empresa no se ve el interese de capacitar ni evaluar a su personal muy frecuentemente."
good,Harman is a great company with great people.  Harman Connected Services is turning into a body shop and led by people not from an automotive background.
good,"Very flexi work culture. "
good,"Una empresa con una cultura a enfoque a resultados, con una visión de excelencia en manufactura a través de la implementación de cultura LEAN, posee herramientas muy poderosas de solución de problemas y diseño de procesos."
good,Moving all manufacturing to low cost countries Without consideration of customer impact and long term strategy.  Plenty of opportunity to grow in Connected Car division.
good,"empresa con buen ambiente laboral, lo critico es que hay poco personal en almacen y no facilmente nos brindan soporte con personal y es demaciado el esfuerzo fisico y las largas jornadas laborales."
good,"It is Interesting to work with Real time Vehicle Infotainment devices. I have learned to interact with Clients, Smart working and Hard working, the most Enjoyable part is to deliver the product with out any issue to the customer."
good,Atmosphere was clean and well structured. Hours were more than I could perform. 7 Days a week constantly.
good,"Viele Umstrukturierungen und teilweise chaotisches Umfeld machen eine Zukunftsplanung für den Arbeitnehmer schwierig. Auf den einzelnen wird wenig eingegangen und somit fehlt häufig die Möglichkeit, sich weiter zu entwickeln."
good,"Check how was production."
good,A little Hard to grow if you do not have much contacts. No matter how much you perform it will still be difficult for you to get some Onsite opportunities.
good,Harman is a company of brands and it has a hard time defining the message to the customers on what it is trying to deliver and how to unify it on the back end with sales and support and next steps. It's relationships with customers is driven through the integrator and there should be more focus on the end users relationships to drive the suite of products across the entire company and not just one off needs
good,"Very interesting work.Technology was high class at one time."
good,"Reasonable work environment,  opportunity to grow, onsite assignments, management support is good. Growing opportunities are ok. Pay structure could be much better"
good,"People really like their jobs and are passionate about what they do. Management is out of touch with the average person, however."
good,"El trabajo que se lleva a cabo en dicha empresa en muy sencillo, cómodo y de fácil aprendizaje, la cafetería y transporte son buenos, el ambiente laboral es pésimo puesto que los administrativos en la mayoría de la veces abusa de su autoridad, se realizan cambios de turno drásticos, sin previo aviso."
good,No training provided. Very difficult upper management team who provided no assistance. Great team of SFAs. Lost of stress and anxiety.
good,"Usually work in Harman has money benefit, "
good,Harman had a lot going for it. We were very busy. Then one day the CEO appeared at our plant- to tell us that they were shutting it down. We were given a year and a half notice  and decent severance package.
good,"The office is big and open, but very noisy and a difficult place to concentrate.  Management is very focused on their activities, and people are expected to address their own activities with a high degree of autonomy.  This is fine when things are going well, but provides even greater challenges when faced with problems and there is very little support to address them."
good,"Over worked and under paid. However the company did pay for the manager to go on a 7 day vacation to HI once a year, and the co-manager every other year."
good,"Pros:"
good,"A typical day at work for me is very long yet eventful."
good,Work in a fast pace environment. Quick to learn got to work with a team to get product out in a timely manner. Seven days week. Good benefits. Not managed the best could use help in that area.
good,"At this time, Harman is closing a 3 US production facilities in the US. At one time, Harman was a good company to work for, not this year."
good,"El trabajo se enfoca en sistemas y procesos, se aprende a estructurar las áreas."
good,"es una empresa buena para trabajar pero tiene sus defectos, como cuando te postulas para un asenso es muy difícil que te lo den y por esa razón muchos salen de esa empresa ."
good,"Hace falta mas oportunidad de crecer, confianza en la gente."
good,"Worked with the onsite engineering and sales team as presales owner for Europe. Focus was on Cloud, UX and Mobile."
good,Once I joined the automation team my experience became much more beneficial. We were writing automated test systems for smart radios. My co-workers were amazing which is the reason I enjoyed my position so thoroughly. The hardest part of the job for me was being introduced to corporate bureaucracy. I hadn't worked in a position of this nature yet so I hadn't been acclimated to that lifestyle.
good,"Most Co-workers were okay to work with, fun environment most of the time."
good,Great place to work for career advancement and want to get experience in other countries
good,the most enjoyable part is spending time with coworkers. the overall job is fairly easy. It is a very clean place to work. We only get one fifteen min break and a 25 min lunch in an 8 hr shift and we have to work 7 days a week only 1 Sunday off in a 3 week period.
good,"Interesting and fun products. Management looking for their bonuses, not building sustainable processes. Strange management structure where lower engineers all reported to a chief engineer, yet group leaders had to get the results (without having direct reports)."
good,el horario es muy bueno para poder estudiar saliendo del trabajo
good,A goog company which provides good work life balance due to flexible working hours. Learnt lot of things about SDLC & STLC and experienced working in different domains.
good,"Nem volt rossz náluk dolgozni, de Székesfehérvárra kellett utazni minden héten és ott lenni 5 napot."
good,"I work at Harman Connected Services from last three years.Work environment is OK.  Hike every year is very less. From last one year, there is reduction in all employee benefits."
good,Lost job due to buy out  by Samsung.  Operations were moved to Mexico and Southern California.  Overall not a bad place but management was mostly mediocre.
good,"Less competitive and lacks the good managements/leaders. People like architects, despite being at high positions are incompetent and useless. Merit is less respected. Otherwise good place to work/learn and with right balance between work and life."
good,"There are 8-10 conference calls per week, tons of active learning! What I've learned at HARMAN is no day is average and the same. The last several years I have managed CEG globally and have met so many wonderful people, such wonderful experiences with my customers. I love the people!"
good,Working at Harman was great.  There was a good culture and engaging management team.  Only complaint was the processes in how things were done- things could have been done quicker and more efficiently.
good,you only got 1 day off a month and and no time to spend with family and always was talking about a plant reduction need new management team  met some great people
good,"Has gone from a small local, family-owned company to large, global,"
good,"KFC was Real Stressful for me but it also made me be at my Very best , I always wanted to make sure that I didn’t mess up and hope to have our customers leaving satisfied. Being in the food industry helped me pay attention to detail and team work. My Coworkers were Very helpful and Understanding. I am glad i had the opportunity to work with great people and most of the time great customers."
good,"Everything depends on who you have as your manager. Very difficult to move to other groups in the company; easier to quit and rehire.  Connected Car division is very strong, visionary.  Tough to get support for  cybersecurity and testing initiatives."
good,"Good place to work with great learning"
good,"Overall good comapny for work, but need to have more focus on work life balance of employees."
good,Good technology but  bad work life balance. Need to stretch always. Get a lot to learn though. But being a part of Harman connected services is really bad
good,"flexibility, work life balance, ok place, lot of projects ranging from small to big to major ones  in entire spectrum of technologies ranging from legacy to cutting edge."
good,It is somewhat difficult to review Harman because shortly after being acquired it was felt that the intention was to close our local facility and move production to another location outside of the country. Prior to the acquisition AMX formally Xn Technologies was as excellent place of employment. I would not have spent 18 years there if it was not enjoyable and I was able to learn many valuable skills.
good,"es una empresa que te ofrece, Segura, oportunidad de crecimiento, es innovadora y Visionaria, tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo, su prioridad es el recurso humano."
good,I work as part of HARMAN connected services. It's a OK place to work. Senior management lacks vision and company is still not settled with series of acquisition.
good,"Friendly environment."
good,"Complexity based on constant engineering changes driven by software updates, many management and direction changes due to is a very new plant, very good support is received due to profitability of the product and the plant"
good,I worked there almost 20 years ago.  Since then the management has changed and their products are expanded.  It is not appropriate for me to review.
good,"Good Company and fun to work given "
good,"seeing as i still work at harman, I would really really rather not say anything here at this time. it has it's pros and cons like any other job. that its all."
good,"Overall a key place to learn & explore some skills that are essential"
good,I've been with the company 14 years it's a good place to work. Love the 12 hour shift schedule rotating 3 day weekend every other weekend!
good,"The company culture is great and provides employee's with a supportive environment. The only concern is they are growing and managers are trying to transition it into a corporate environment,. Over all it's a good company!"
good,Overall Had good Experience at Harman. I enjoyed my time @ Harman.
good,The company offered many forms of training. We developed many friendships. The immediate management provided the necessary supervision for high performance. The hardest part of this job was the lay off that occurred due to relocation of the company to Mexico.
good,SAP Training Excellent and great people to work with.  Positive feed back on a daily bases and a great all around team.
good,Harman is a decent place to work. They have a variety of jobs within the facility. Very fair throughout the plant.

good,"Industry leading technology in all categories.  All products in automotive, lifestyle, and professional areas are best in class."
good,"401K match, education reimbursement, health, dental, vision and supplemented beverages. Potential for internal advancement."
good,working in R&D department to design & development of  Automotive Infotainment  & speaker systems
good,"I would have rated most areas higher, but the fact that the factory was shutting down brought most of them down as there was no oppertunity to be hired permanent or be promoted."
good,"Harman is a good place to work providing good work /life balance. however there are areas of improvement in benefits, selecting or hiring middle and senior management who care for people."
good,"Ambiente Laboral interesante con oportunidades de mejora, en áreas como procesos e ingenieria, alta rotación de personal."
good,"Poor Managers with lack of tools Knowledge "
good,"La organizacion estaba convirtiendose en una excelente planta con miras a logrr todos sus objetivos, un cambio en la Direccion elimino todo el capital humano por lo que se fugo una gran aprte del talento y finalmente de la gerencia."
good,Falta de oportunidades para personas preparadas. El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno ya que es una empresa donde todo se conocen y hay un trato grato hacia el personal
good,"Harman is one of the best company to work on Audio Domain. I assure you, one can gain lot of knowledge on audio architect who has passion on music"
good,"Where you can believe in rapid growth , which might help you to reach the next level. Yes mostly focusing on coding not on documentation"
good,"Its a good company. I am working as a Admin Executive. My role & responsibilities are Fire & Safety, Soft services. Transport, Material movement."
good,Gutes Arbeiten in einem entrepreneuner Umfeld. Nettes nice to have ist der Mitarbeitereinkauf zu sehr guten Konditionen!
good,"El area en la que me desempeñe da mucha oportunidad de aprender muchas cosas y de desembolverse bastante dentro de la empresa, asi como mucha comunicacion con bastantes empleados, como gerentes, ingenieros, supervisores, operadores, etc. Area: Nuevos modelos."
good,"Daily work is fast-paced, busy all day.  Lots of politics among management / staff as a whole.  Employees not very confident about the future of their jobs ever since the company was bought up by Samsung."
good,"Harman bought the company I worked for, AMX.  They kept the company for 2 years and layed us off and moved our jobs to Mexico.  Many people have been devastated."
good,"Co-workers were great and the management was pretty decent in our department.  Company made some changes to how they did sales which actually caused sales to drop.  This caused concern with shareholders which caused many jobs to be moved out of the country (including mine).  Other then that, I found it to be a nice place to work at."
good,"Good benefits, good place to work, vacation, health insurance is comparable.Hours of operations is good, Great location to work at, Employees are friendly."
good,"Great place to work, and many exciting products are being developed. However, upper management is making extreme shortcuts to make a profit and as a result people are loosing their jobs in some areas of the U.S."
good,Working as client location MSC Software. but no work standard. work culture is good. No hurry. just chill. if you tired with small company and  you need rest please join harman and MSC.
good,"long shifts but a fantastic crew i loved my job and wouldn't mind a more social job, i really enjoy talking to customers, even if its resolving a problem the company has caused, i.e. messed up food orders, disrespectful employees."
good,Harman House is one of the leading retailers of high quality home entertainment system in the region. It has a fantastic management and fun co workers making my job a pleasure.
good,"Travail dans de bonnes conditions physique "
good,What I learned is that there a companies that operate on seven days a week not leaving much personal time for family. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the people I worked with were very friendly and they became my true second family.
good,We build radio's and make sure they was made right. We work as a team and help each other out if we needed it. We had clean up after we was done with our shift.
good,"Harmans is a great company and treat the managers well.  However, like in any other business if your short staffed it falls on the manager.  They were a little stingy in the pay to the assistants.  If you were a gm you did get alot of benefits-trips, health insurance, stock option in the company, etc. Restaurant is hard work and long hours."
good,Issues with product availability which leads to extra work. With the purchase of Harman by Samsung there are many changes to come. The department is all new and working through the kinks.
good,"Harman has grown too fast.  By combining several companies along with very rapid sales growth Harman has been unable to keep up with the required skilled people resources, procedures and processes.  This makes the days long, frustrating and stressful.  Very few people are experienced and knowledgeable to solve issues when they arise.  Thus putting more stress on the entire company."
good,manly manual  with `one nc mill. heavy duty surface grinders. manual mills and lathes. work uniforms provided. interface with mechanical engineers to finish projects.
good,"Productive and fun place to work.  Colleagues and management are nice, work is steady and fun.  A great place to work.  Highly recommended."
good,I loved it there until my position was moved to another country. I loved the work I did on a daily basis and all of the wonderful people I worked with.
good,What i thought was a great place to work turned out to be horrible. The company was sold and they treated the workers unfairly. There severance pay was unimaginable.
good,There are long hours we pull every week and then we don't have a guarantee that we will have days off. This makes it hard to enjoy the benefits of the job.
good,"was a fast paced job, but when it was getting ready to close the doors for good it got pretty slow paced. the easiest job I ever had. most of the people where easy to get along with."
good,"I am grateful for my 10 year work experience at HARMAN, Inc.  "
good,"Good pay and great hours, the management team needed people skills but overall good job. I would recommend this job to someone in need..."
good,Enjoyed working there. I have learned many things about the products. I enjoyed working in other departments and cross training on different lines. I liked working in the team environment
good,"Es una trabajo muy fácil pero muy cansado y el horario esta muy bien ya que es de 2:00 pm a 10 pm por lo las personas no salen muy tarde, además la tarjeta de bonos tiene una buena cantidad."
good,Very unstable and lacking clear direction due to buying smaller companies and being bought by larger company. Management may be located off shore and not fully aware of tasks and accomplishments.
good,All in all Harman was an excellent place to work. They did however shut down the plant and left a lot of people without a job.
good,"KFC is a great place to work for entry level experience. It offers a variety of skills to advance in including but not limited to, sales, cash handling, multitasking, managing inventory...etc. I worked here off and on for about 5 years, it was a place I had job security at, and my whole family worked here some point. My biggest drawback is the pay and advancement opportunities were very limited."
good,"No tenías un buen horario de comida, las capacitaciones tardaban"
good,Harman International is an above average large company. The people are great .I learned a lot about the electronic industry. The product is designed well.
good,"Safe job but the timing always changed amd they transfer sharjah to dubai every three month once ."
good,"The other employees were very niece and i learned well. I felt confidently in their hands. The job was very easy. I was to answer calls, forward calls, and leave messages."
good,I loved working at Harman. They tend to reward those who can play the game and play politics more than those who actually get work done and produce results. There is a disturbing trend of out-shoring jobs to Indian and China that have hurt the innovation and future of the brand under the Harman umbrella.
good,"Harman is a great company to work for. My days are very busy between emails and on going projects and standard weekly conference calls with our broker and vendors. Harman manufactures audio and infotainment systems (Harman Kardon, JBL, Infinity, AKG, Lexicon). They have great products and I'm very proud to tell other I work for Harman."
good,No dan oportunidades prefieren contratar personas nuevas
good,"fastpaced environment, leadership seems to be struggling for direction, large disconnect between leadership and working level, highly silo-ed as an organization that causes roadblocks in execution, lots of politics at play at a higher level"
good,Flexible work hours and respectable management.  Good benefits.  Large company so it may feel like you are just a number at times.  Many driven and fun to work with individuals.
good,I enjoyed my time at Harman.  The company had a good culture that it embraced.  The plant was ramping up when I arrived due to the consolidation of our sister plant.  Another opportunity came up after we began contemplating moving production to Mexico was the only reason I left.
good,Lo que más me gustó de esta empresa fue la oportunidad que se me dió para aprender en diferentes ámbitos
good,working in a fast paced environment and working late nights and weekends are challenging - but may be good for short period of time to learn the fast paced environment work culture.
good,"Company is strong on driving out costs to maintain profitability in a highly competitive automotive environment."
good,"1. Good Company having good projects."
good,Poste correspondant en partie à mes attentes mais l'entreprise a délocalisé mon poste puis a fermé.

good,"Clean, fair and understanding workplace."
good,"Best organisation to work and develop yourself by working on new things with multi speciality personalities."
good,"Able to work with new technologies"
good,"Exciting, changing, great synergy with Samsung."
good,"Cool people, friendly environment, and interesting work. Was only temporary statues for a year and if there were no full time positions open you would have to re apply for another year and hope there was an opening."
good,"Flexible Timing"
good,"I was a full-time employee at Harman that was contractor Nokia/Microsoft. So I spent more time at the client's offices than Harman's. I had more of a long distance relationship with my boss since I rarely got to see them in person. Mostly online/phone calls. My manager was very good, she tried all she could to make sure I was happy with my position and even when I was starting the seperation from the company she was looking for new positions/contracts that I could apply for within the company so I could stay longer."
good,antes de los cambios en la gerencia el ambiente era mas bonito que ahora.
good,"Nice people perhaps I didn't give the job the opportunity I should have, they have grown since I left and still do a good business."
good,"todavia tiene muchos problemas, no es estable de ninguna manera, es mejor conseguir otras opciones antes de trabajar alli"
good,"Harman......une entreprtise très agréable, une entente entre collègues très agréable, une ambiance de travail que je n'avais jamais trouvée ailleurs......"
good,"Work with team members in planning, execution & improvement of their tasks."

good,"Learned how to solder and rework and trouble shoot circuit boards"
good,"Perl, Perforce, Cruise control and JAM."
good,"• a typical day at work"
good,"Working on a small Consumer Insights team allowed me to learn a great deal in the area of market research. My direct supervisor trusted me to work independently on several projects shortly after my start, which enabled me to learn at a fast pace and use creative freedom on presentations. The environment was professional yet casual enough to encourage interaction with co-workers within, as well as across departments."
good,I work on manufacturing assembly lines and cells to produce a variety of speakers and or related components. Ensure daily production targets are met ensuring compliance to all processes and controls. I love working as a team and on my own.
good,"Actividades normales en confianza de mas"
good,it was a very good work place and the people because family to each other. The work was kind of easy then most work place. learn all the part number when they change then in a week. when you get there you start to work and know what your job is. I learn how to built speaker and radio.
good,my typical work day was around many hours. I enjoyed working in my own store with my own crew of 12. My hardest part of my job was the constant negativity from the area consultant
good,"Harman Management was a great company to work for, they compensate you well but upper management needs to treat their employees with respect.  Over the years upper management had changed for the worst, they treat their employees and managers like numbers, not as a person."
good,"Work wise use really good. Pay is also good but people inside need to change their attitude.  Apart from that every thing around are awesome, heaven like environment."
good,"Had a great time working with the Shutterfly offshore team. Kind, helpful, and the friendliest team. Hardworking and also supportive in getting more ideas."
good,Have been working here for almost 2 years. Work and work life balance is good. Growth aspects are limited though. Perks are not up to the mark. Career aspirations if not pursued tactically can get tossed.
good,I managed a group of analysis technicians on three shifts. A typical day for me was on average 12-15 hours long. I enjoyed helping out my co-workers with their production teams.
good,"Good and healthy environment to work in. "
good,work culture was good in harman and process was good excellent supportive from   Germany team. they were full competitive and communication was good when working day to day with counter part team.
good,"fun working environment especially with the marketing department. Harman product sold at great discounts for employees. Relaxed culture, though very political. Some VPs were horrible to work with as they were both micromanaging yet incompetent in their role."
good,most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with.  We have a blast. Get along well and laugh everyday.  We are a huge support system to each other both in and out of work
good,"With such troubling times looming over the automotive industry , Harman in not exempt in the question of job security. In the past few years the design teams and project management have really let the Harman name down. Customers are leaving for other suppliers, Harman doesn't market to enough platforms and the market is very difficult to survive only being what is thought to be ""high end"" audio components. Supplier issues along with engineering stumbles time and time again are taking it's toll on the company. So much , the talk of best cost country is an hourly talk among management. And the US is not leading the way according to new management. It's a troubling time, but with hard work and hopefully some management changes and realignments throughout the company, Harman will be what it was once known for."
good,"Like worked here."
good,The delivery of  materials has stagnated in terms of sales and process.  The process has remained in place and there is  frustration within the culture about the direction of  the different departments. Many  innovations that are standard in different companies are absent. Business modules in the databases and wms systems are scaled back or do not exist causing frustration among the employees.
good,"The workday is from 8-8 1/2 hours. Very busy with entering 600+ warranty claims per month. Answering phone calls about service, warranty, and repair."
good,"A műszakváltás rosszul lett leszervezve így nehezen állt össze a nap eleje munka szempontjából mert az 5 perc műszakátadás kevés volt az információ váltásra."
good,"Great brand, well balanced work culture"
good,Harman was a great place to work. I started when the place first opened. It did go downhill when Sydney Harman passed away and it was bought out. I actually lost my job due to position relocation to Mexico.
good,"Sometimes seems like management is disconnected to workers."
good,Overall Harman is a good place to work. It is clean and climate controlled. Work is light physically and can range from very simple to complex work mentally. As a whole Harman cares about their employees health and goes out of their way to make us feel appreciated.
good,excelente ambiente de trabajo sin necesidad de ocupar equipos de seguridad estorbosos y facilidad de promocion
good,"i liked working there and meeting all sorts of people. i like how there was always something to do, i was never just standing around. The management and the company care about whats going on in there employees lives and did what they could to help"

good,"-Brindar soporte a las lineas de produccion, manejo de presion, trabajo en equipo, rastreo y analisis de fallas."
good,"Never a typical day, always new challenges and issues. Learned basics of electronic board manufacturing and used alls skills learned over a lifetime working on and installing machinery. Almost all managers and production personnel were excellent to work with, knowledgeable in their jobs and aware of all processes and challenges associated with the manufacturing of the infotainment systems."
good,If it were not that the factory moved to Mexico I really like working there. Being busy during our shift was common. For me working with the product and making sure the quality meant company standards was one of the things I liked about the job. Even though I worked there as a temporary employee the people I worked with and for were the greatest.
good,"Mi experiencia en Harman fue buena principalmente en todo lo que aprendí, me desarrollo muy bien tanto personal como profesionalmente, y la mayoría de las personas son muy amables al explicarte los procesos, eso te facilita adaptarte de una manera mas rápida."
good,"Management was good.. working atmosphere is very nice."
good,Most of the days are spent working out problems with internal or external customers.  Work load is heavy and the days are long.  Required to work off hours to support other time zones.
good,"1. I have learned lot of new thing/new domain:"
good,"Like all companies, some days are rewarding, some are boring. But when you work at HARMAN, you work for a company on the cutting edges of consumer technology. It's a lot of fun to be associated with some of the most brilliant minds in audio, and constantly be developing new products for the audio consumer."
good,Nice place to work and every hard work is noticed. Best set of customers it had. Good set of managers who handle the worst cases properly. Hardest part of the job is to secure it when there is no new projects coming up.
good,"Good Company, Good place to learn and work. "
good,"In the 20 years I have been with AMX (now Harman) it has gone through many changes, with the acquisition by Harman and then Samsung being the latest.  It has always been a fun working environment with great colleagues."
good,"Good benefits, discounts, pay, facilities and working conditions but disrespectful treatment by the manager and supervisor. A great group of co workers that support me, help me and teach me a lot.In general everything was great but nothing is perfect and if it weren't for the manager and the supervisor would have been perfect also I know nothing is for ever but that is the other reason I didn't gave them five stars, ""Job security"" they moved the facilities to different countries (Mexico & India)."
good,"One of the best company to work for."

Se desarrollan actividades como instalación de facilities eléctricos, neumáticos, red y señales para conexión de maquinaria, movimientos e instalación de maquinaria. Se atienden fallas de equipos y se realizan actividades de mantenimiento asignadas por el software de mantenimiento. En lo personal he aumentado mis conocimientos sobre instalaciones, mantenimiento a edificios y desarrollo de proyectos y el sistema de producción de la empresa. La empresa cuenta con directivos del mas alto nivel, el trabajo con mis compañeros de trabajo es agradable mantenemos buen ambiente de trabajo y nos apoyamos para realizar las tareas asignadas. La parte mas difícil del trabajo en ocasiones es la instalación de facilities por el espacio en la planta aunque siempre terminamos el trabajo. Lo que mas me gusta del trabajo es el ambiente del mismo, la limpieza de las áreas y el orden en general."

good,"very nice place to work in."
good,"Harman has been a great place to work for me.  A typical day is longer than 8 hours.  There is very little oversight on daily activities, which brings a lot of freedom, but also puts ownership on each employee to determine their career path. Productive employees are overloaded and all departments (that I interact with) are understaffed in my opinion."
good,"I worked at HARMAN International as an full time employee for less than a year."
good,"A typical day of work would involve delivering product to different lines so they could run that material for that certain day. The hardest part of the job would have to be lifting heavy material day in and day out, whereas the easiest part of the job would have been the job itself. All of my co-workers were very laid back and easy to get along with. "
good,"en el curso de inducción aprendimos que somos la principal fuente de vulnerabilidad y la primer vía de acceso, existe compañerismo y un buen ambiente de trabajo la parte mas difícil es cuando estamos a cargo de la planta los fines de semana y a que tomar decisiones lo que mas me gusta del trabajo es todo por que voy al trabajo siempre con ganas de aprender mas.

good,"Good place to work with good benefits.  I was not planning to leave Harman but department was moved to Mexico and preferred not to transfer.  This would be the one downside to Harman, Decisions are being made to move as much outside of US as possible."
good,"Harman can be a great place to work. They are plenty of opportunities for career advancement, learning, development and support for job related training and certifications."
good,The work was not real hard. It could be chalanging at times though. It was a real learning experience on how to deal with people. I learned how to work on machines and how to do lots of paperwork.
good,"The company pays well and has several perks besides normal compensation.  Demanding at times, can be a bit ""clique"" oriented.  Manufacturing is being sent out of the country for the most part."
good,"Past paced competitive workplace with a good learning curve."
good,Harman's Shanghai office was fairly similar to their office in the US but certainly not the same and my experience is mainly from Shanghai. Harman is very focused on their objectives and the vibe of the office is 100% work centric.

good,Operations team is like no other that I have worked with.  All managers and directors truly looked after your best interest and took the time to mentor me.
good,"Wonderful place to work and would love to stay.. However, since production has moved to Mexico, I am not sure how stable my location is before that is also potentially relocated."
good,A good place to work with good opportunity for career progression and self development. Management always listens to concerns or queries and is very accommodating.
good,"It is a fun, caring company to work for with great pay in the long run. In the down side the hours and turnover with the younger generation is not fun"
