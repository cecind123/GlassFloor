bad,"If you want to throw your life away, go for it.  This has got to be the worst place to work in the entire Las Vegas Valley.  You want to have a steady job, feel like a family rather than feel like a number or look forward to advancement?  Well, it's not here, unless you can stick your entire nose way the 'fudge up' all of their ugly a holes.  You're better off cleaning up from underneath toilets for donations then work here.  move on... carry on"
bad,"Be ready to get surrounded by toxic people and the ugliness of casino culture.  Over in time it gets harder.  The wealthier the customers, the more valuable they are over the own company's employee staff.  Not an easy career."
bad,When you go to HR to explain that bullying is going on in the company and nothing is done about it you tend to look elsewhere for employment due to an uncomfortable work environment.
bad,"Everything and anything is about the bottom dollar... making the company money. You literally have to bend over for players and management for pennies. I will never work in a casino again, takes the life out of you."
bad,This place was the worst. Once management switched the job was more of a burden walking on eggs shells. The policy in place is not designed for a working person with a family.
bad,"Not a positive work environment. Dealers are minimum wage. Never see family for holidays and weekends  No true support from upper management. "
bad,"They’re dishonest and does a lot of dirty business. If you work there you ll never be happy and they rob your tourney tokes you will never realize it at all. "
bad,"Nearly every promise or “perk” of the job that I was told in the interview was a flat lie. They do NOT train new hires for back of house. The person tasked with training me couldn’t be bothered because she needed the face time that certain events or non-department specific events were opportunities for her to be seen. So rather than train me, she would say “put a calendar reminder” so we can pick this up later, which would never happen."
bad,Poor pay scale hard to move up and there is zero job security currently at all casinos due to buy out hr department is not available or very limited all departments are short staffed and not hiring.
bad,Hated working here. Horrible management. The hours were terrible and after 6 months they promised me I could switch shifts but they never followed through with that.
bad,"Backstabbing coworkers, zero job security or opportunity for advancement, millennial managers who play with Legos in their offices, frat boy atmosphere and mentality, one of the most toxic environments imaginable, huge disappointment"
bad,"Never work for Caesars!  And never work for their Strategic Marketing Department.  You will be overworked, underpaid and disrespected every step of the way.  You'll never move up, no matter how qualified or ready you are, and they will always make excuses to keep you down."
bad,"not sure how anyone could rate this company as a 4 or 5-star company to work for. Even if you have high seniority you still have to wait in line, OR IN YOUR CAR to get any specific day off. the union that represents the employees stands for this which is despicable and the company allows it to happen. I wouldn't wish this workplace on anyone. terrible shifts, no evening premiums, pay is subpar (guess it's ""good"" for windsor). Management does not care about their employees at all and they have a me against them mentality."
bad,Bad management.  People get promoted who are clueless.  Systems do not work and have to lie to customers.  Benefits of PTO is great.  Health insurance horrible.
bad,"Understaffed and over worked. Safety of guest and emplyees not a concern of the casino. They just don't care. The only time they show any appreciation for the employees is during eos surveys, so they get good scores. Everything is blacked out so you can't spend time enjoying our city or our families during the holidays. It is a horrid place to work. Very negative atmosphere."
bad,Supervisors was not knowledgeable about companies policy's. Anytime you ask about something they say they will get back to you with the answers and never do.
bad,"Poor management . All are snakes, if u work here, u gonna be a slave..."
bad,"Harrahs in valley center just wants employees that are just happy to have a job. They employ tons of foreign exchange students at a very low wage. Management is poor, I would say none of them really care about the work they do. Sanitation is horrid in kitchens and constantly overlooked. Food quality is extremely poor. Employees are piggen holed. HR is just ridiculous, and I don’t believe they understand HR is ment to support employees. Tons of fratnation with chefs and exchange students. All around just a sad excuse for a company. No holiday pay at all yet required to work all of them. There is really nothing good about this place. Unless you just want a low paying job."
bad,Retaliation and targeting is rampant. No career advancement opportunities for those who don't succumb to the negative culture. VPs/HR turn a blind eye.
bad,"If you happens to put your two weeks notice, because u try to be nice to people, dont expect they will let you work that two weeks, they simply too sensetive that you are leaving them."
bad,"Horseshoe Casino was very understaffed and not very well organized ."
bad,"This job was too long ago to rate.  I remember being a security guard and then I eventually moved into surveillance and it was a better job, was fast to move into supervisory role"
bad,"This is one of the worst professional experiences i have had.  People are terrible not just at Caesars but the over all culture of Las Vegas!  people here are dead and heartless inside!  Money is good be that just isn't enough for to cover the cold cut throat culture!  If you like the idea of playing games, being fake, and trying your hardest to ruin people careers and lives, this is the place for you."
bad,"Harrah's casino advertises themselves as a fun place to work, but it it quiet the contrary.  It is a very cutthroat environment, where management intimidates you."
bad,"The ""union"" that was ""representing"" the employees turned out to be BS. A lot of the bar porters at the time could not make it to the union meetings, so there was no representation for them."
bad,i would not tell my worst enemy to work for this awful company to be honest its the worst of any casino company around.... what others say is true if you can work for anyone else do so!
bad,never again they attitude was to bad. But dont get to wrong it's was okay for a first job into you find something better. But housekeeping just wasn't for me.
bad,"Looking for a great Casino in Baltimore City. This is a Great casino, with two floors of gambling, and a variety of slot machines. The Staff was very pleasant and helpful. There is free parking."
bad,"Worst place I ever worked.  The money is good but you need to give up your life for Caesars.  Not easy to advance as a new hire due to the union seniority.  Part time is available to new hires and you will probably stay part time for at least 3 years before you can achieve full time status.  When part time, you will work every shift in a week and every holiday.  It's very hard and very stressful on your body."
bad,"Horrible edr  food/ nasty people don't wear gloves"
bad,"the management sucked, coworkers and managers were unprofessional and rude constantly, The supervisors wouldn't follow proper protocol for sanitation and biohazards. Made employees that weren't their favorite feel inferior"
bad,Friday and Saturday was a goo day to work because of all the top players made the day special on the weekend. and they kept the day going as well as brought food from the special event the held for them.
bad,I think they have a meetings to discuss when to host meetings. No time to get your work done during normal business hours.  Talk the talk but do not walk the walk.  Properties are great and good working environment.
bad,Worse experience.. worked here for 5 years... some people are great... others were meh... management was just really not there for people and they overlooked a lot of things
bad,work was work and I showed up to be paid. some days was hard and some days was long but pay days were the best and the lunch was ok .management sucks .
bad,This job has no caring culture they I have never worked at a casino like this before. they need to get rid of the whole upper management team and start again. Worst place to work no one should ever work there I moral in that place is so bad that no one wants to come to work. They need to close the whole casino and start all over again!!!!
bad,Constant chaos. lack of accountability. put in several hostile situations. short training. never fully staffed. no support system for several departments.
bad,"The management has no clue on how to run a casino.  I would not tell anyone to work there, it would be a waste of your time.  Well if you do not know anything about the casino game, then yes it would be perfect for you, because you would know just as much as management, all the way to the top at this property."
bad,Working for this company was stressful because it was far a hour away then I was working 2 jobs at the time. I worked there for short period of time. I soon resigned and stayed employed only at isle of Capri.
bad,"I worked very hard but nobody didn't pay attention, I didn't get any vacation time wile working there I was always on time for work , never missed a day"
bad,The job is supposed to be a corporate job but we are treated as fast food workers. There is no room for growth and you do not get paid for major holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving.
bad,"No Benefits, The hours are not great.  I have to work every weekend, I will get of Saturday/Sun at 4am and have to be back to work on sunday at 4pm.  Management not good"
bad,"dont work there, they dont care for the employees or for the guest they only care for the money, there is no advancement their, and they break the gaming laws all the time"
bad,The union runs the place.  It's a cut throat environment. They own you.  Place is filthy and infested with bed bus and rodents.  Staff is underpaid.  Horrible
bad,"The environment was poor. The employees in the surveillance department wasn't knowledgeable after being employed for 10 to 20 plus years (Old & set in their ways) which doesn't work well with a forever fast changing environment. The other department had no respect for the surveillance department. Lastly, The entire company wasn't organized."
bad,"Harrahs has undergone many changes since I worked there, there really isn't anything new to say."
bad,"When hired I was told I could bid for shifts. However, it is by seniority so it was very hard to get off graveyard shift. Twice I won a bid for a shift then they took the shift away before it started. I ended up quitting before I could receive benefits."
bad,We were told at orientation that if we applied at the grand Casino whcih was opening soon thereafter that we would be fired.  They found out and walked several of us out!
bad,This company does nothing for its employees thats.why it has been bought out . We were promised a raise every year and still I have never received one and I have been an employee for almost 3 years.
bad,"Scheduling was unreasonable. Drivers could not meet the scheduling requirements in a safe driving manor. If we were unable to pick up our guest on time because of the unrealistic scheduling, we were harassed by the dispatchers and management."
bad,"I have never worked somewhere that was more unprofessional. The training was terrible, that's if you actually get someone who even wants to train you. The managers, supervisors etc. are rude and don't care if you understand your job or not. They are just waiting for you to mess up so they can send you home. You are not paid enough to put up with the attitude of the staff or the drunken guest."
bad,I worked for Harrahs New Orleans for two years i hated it almost everyday if you are not a dealer you don't matter to this company your only the 800 number they give you DONT WASTE YOUR TIME
bad,I liked my position itself however there is a lot of backstabbing that goes on in a casino setting and you need to have a backbone. If you don't find a different job. Also they are open 24/7/365 so take that into consideration as well everything is by seniority or favoritism.
bad,I had the worse experience their they were not prepared to open this up and they didn't not know how to handle the employees and i can still go up there and find the same problems. The best things where the free stuff great but not worth while
bad,"working for Harrah's is noting like they say they are. They don't care about the employee. The laughlin property is out of date and the management team they have in place there is running it into the ground, it gets worse everyday."
bad,I am opposed to gambling. However I regret that I did not have a better grip on my personal life which interfered with my productivity and longevity with the company.
bad,"It sucks working there they dont care about all they care about is making money.they wouldnt listen to there poeple, there all about the money"
bad,Working for Horseshoe was like working on a slave ship.  Every month it was an additional project added to the work load with no follow through from upper management.  As middle management I was left to figure it out and have my team look to me for guidance and when things did not go right.  There was a performance documentation on how poor performance for the project went or our team scores are to low.  If you have the ability to run your head into a brick wall and enjoy it please Apply.  The General Manager and Assistant General Manager are clueless to how the department is ran and can careless when things are brought to them.
bad,Would not recommend anyone working at this casino.  Management has proven unable to properly staff the facility.  This leads to overworking the employees.  Management is unappreciative of the efforts of the employees and consistently harps on what has not gone well.
bad,"Very low employee morale after harrah's bought the biloxi grand, I was lied on suspended and terminated over a situation I had absolutely nothing to do with."
bad,"due to a current issue with this company I cant write a good or bad review when it comes to this company. I would say in the beginning it was a very nice place, but towards then end of my employment thing went not according plan."
bad,"This place has gone down since Jack Binion, guests are finding out the real shoe! its hard to get comps, give always goes to the high rollers. employee get treated like step kids..."
bad,I Have not been treated fairly from day one to much nepitizim.
bad,"a typical day at work for me included answer phones, enter data into the computer system, filing paperwork, transferring calls, answering any questions that the guest may have, and work together with the wait staff in order to ensure that the guest receive the best possible service.the worst part about my job was not getting enough hours"
bad,"great co workers,worked there for over 8 years co workers became like family"
bad,Typical casino job....all work and no time to have a life.  Management expects more and pays less.  No frills place to work.
bad,"Highest grossing and lowest paying casino in the area.  Don't mention the 'U' word (union, don't even mention it) or they will fabricate things to fire you with.  I WAS an Engine Utility.  They have room for advancement and raises......pssh they don't know what those are.  If you want to work in an Engineering side on a boat, go on the lake or go to another Casino with a Marine crew."
bad,20% or more turnover rate. other casinos pay better. management all say things are corporate's fault. i think this casino is behind the times
bad,Do not work for them. Being homeless is a better option then working for this place. Don't get me wrong it used to be a great place back in the day but now senior management has one agenda and that is how do we come up with ways to sc**w our employees!!!!!!!
bad,"Harrah's claims to be a great place but it is the complete opposite. In my four months of working there I was part time working full time hours with no benefits and they even wanted to have me work overtime on occasion. My travel there via SEPTA took an hour to and an hour back from Philadelphia which meant my work day lasted roughly 10 hours. Though I was taught how to deal blackjack for free and made a decent amount of money (the only benefits) the job itself was mentally and physically draining. Constantly dealing with addicts for eight straight hours (with only 15 minute breaks every hour and some odd minutes) was draining and depressing. Not all floor managers were awful but there were a select few that did not tolerate any mistakes and would belittle me if I made a minor error. There were many times when I felt like crying on a game. Also the uniforms were absolutely dreadful. When I tried to request off more than six months in advance my request off was denied even though I was a part time employee and was disposable. The most ignorant company. I became very ill and was not offered the leave of absence option because I was considered part time so I ended up getting fired due to so many call-outs. When I tried to collect unemployment they tried to deny me. I won the first time. They tried again to deny me a few months later and won because I did not want to go through with fighting them again and was better by then to start working elsewhere. Ultimately, they are money hungry and do not care about their employees at all."
bad,"Dont care about their employees"
bad,they hate all of their employees ESPECIALLY the security team!
bad,"Unqualified people get promoted, hard work gets you no where, and luck has more to do with advancing than anything else. They are always getting rid of people and cost cutting is all they care about. I would never recommend working for this company."
bad,Upper managment was not friendly. Employees there considered a dime a dozen. Make your voice heard and they make sure to let it be known that is not tolerated. To worried about continuing to hire as opposed to teaching existing employees more training. Guest allowed to say and act how they want with no concern for employees. Besides most coworkers and some guests not a fun place to work.
bad,i was treated bad and was told something and it was wrong so the fired me miscommunication is a bg thing there
bad,This company tosses employees out like yesterdays trash. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency. No growth!
bad,Dealt most table games very well.Horseshoe was very good to emploees and the guest.Most employees worked very well together..It was a easy job.The best thing was PAYDAY.
bad,"one they don't know the pay rate saying it might be 950, no one knows how to answer basic questions like when does the pay period end and which weeks are on it, and the other person is right because they want you to mingle with the customers and smile and kiss butt but the race track people are not paying attention to you.....they promise you alot but no one knows what they are doing...we don't even have a handbook yet, not even a old version."
bad,"The terrible wage, horrible management and very bitter staff made this a terrible place to work. The only positive of this restaurant became the amount of money received in tips as a hostess and waitress. It was as well in a very convenient location for me while I was finishing high school and in the long run became a great learning experience."
bad,The job I had at Harrahs has been outsourched to the Phillipines and Mexico. In 2006 we were working overtime. At one time we had about 180 employees. To date all employees who did the job are are no longer employed
bad,You do not want to work at this place... Executive management does not have a clue how the casino or hotel opporates... Managers don't do anything but blame supervisors. Supervisors are over worked and under paid....
bad,To work for this company as an hourly employee would be a benefit. Don't recommend a salary or especially supervisor role. Upper Management is cutting hourly employees and working the salaried employees excessively to meet their goal of quarterly bonuses on cost saving initiatives.
bad,"I worked as a slot technician for these people. The whole experience was horrible. Elderly people dropped at the door in wheel chairs, some with life support attached. People dragging oxygen bottles. Clients wiping bodily fluids on the machine. Harrah's is understaffed to save money and run there employees to death. Training is almost non exsistant before they throw you out on the floor and then get angry when you can't solve a problem."
bad,"Dont waste your time, management couldn't careless about you. You are just a number to them. Try and stand up for what's right and you will be sent packing."
bad,I would not suggest to work for that company. You been treated like a number. There is too many managers and directors in the position that have no clue what they are doing. Favoritism is how most of the people get their position. If you have any issues nobody will address it. If you too experience you are a threat and not valuable employee. STAY AWAY!!!!
bad,Underappreciated all the time. Very hostile environment with employees.  Would not ever work there ever again. Due to the experience that I had I would not approve anyone else that I know to work there.
bad,"Through my many years in this industry, I have been exposed to good and bad. From this job, I have learned..."
bad,This company was the worst I have ever worked for. Very poor management. Extremely unorganized and corrupt. Upper management will do anything they have to to get what they need done without any consideration for their employees. Nobody takes responsibility for their actions leaving others to get blamed.
bad,"The buildings are in poor repair, upper management does not care about the well being of their employees, pay is low, upper management is incompetent and takes people from roles unrelated to what they are being promoted to. The upper management allows for dangerous situations and will even place employees in dangerous situations. Do not work here!"
bad,"Unbelievably unorganized and intentionally stressful, it could be an amazing place to work if not for poor management decisions. The job expectations are impossible, especially considering the lack of training or tools provided. I can't imagine that corporate has any idea what goes on in this location. If you should ask for help or additional training you're labeled incompetent or a complainer, and your employment should be reevaluated. People are forced to work beyond their limits, if they are physically or mentally unable to continue they will receive a formal reprimand and incur point violations.  The buzz phrases like ""culture of caring"" is actually demonstrated by the exact opposite meaning. When discussing work conditions with those who aren't employed by this location, it appears over dramatic and exaggerated. I assure you it is not. The pay scale is very luring, until you realize what you are required to do to earn it. The benefits are horrible HUGE deductable. You may accrue PTO but you won't be able to use it. The union is mandatory but doesn't protect you against blatant violations. I may seem like a disgruntled ex-employee, but that's not the case. I like most of the employees are holding out hope that corporate execs discover what's really happening for themselves. Make no announcements of planned arrivals. Maybe send in a mole, apply for a job maybe a few to see exactly how and what things are happening in Atlantic City."
bad,"I could spam this little box with everything wrong with this place. Instead, I am going to simply tell you wholeheartedly to keep looking. Do NOT settle to work here, you can do waaaaay better. Promise."
bad,They don't know how to care for their associates they are insensitive and I'm passionate. I very much ended up seeing the place decline and management suffering to maintain staff. It's horrible! I wanted to quite and care less about being marked as non rehireable.
bad,"food and beverage cashier pays is the worst."
bad,Working there is boring and didn't learn a thing The managers aren't fair towards the employees they only fair to employees who been there to for a long time
bad,Typically going to deal with rude and disrespectful guest. The supervisors and dual rates are also rude and don't care about you at all. Dual rates will throw you under the bus if you don't do what they say and they play a lot of favoritism up there. everyone is out for self when it's a group effort on the tables each and everyday. the most enjoyable part of the job is clocking and having your two days off so you don't have to deal with Horseshoe bull.
bad,Purchasing department is the worst in the business.  Unless you are hired in a corporate position you get treated like a slave and are not appreciated and will never get a promotion no matter how hard you work or what you do.  If you want advancement you will never get it.  Go work for MGM they treat employees better as far as advancement in procurement.
bad,Changing the CEO in any business will drive that stock down the people lose confidence in their working environment and are afraid of losing their job the CEO presently is worse than the last CEO no comment
bad,Working for horseshoe has been an exciting job to have . I have had the pleasure to meet different people and learn to grow in the company. They tend to treat men better than woman in security and even pay them more for doing the same job.
bad,"great way to make a quick buck, but with a closed door policy, lack of communication causes endless issues.company is bankrupt and so is management..."
bad,"Management rules this place by fear. Each day there are ""new"" performance standards. This job is supposedly booking hotel, dining, show and ""gift"" reservations for members of the total rewards program. In reality, if you don't get enough callers to sign up for a Visa credit card, or be transferred to Wyndham for a time share presentation, you will be labeled as a poor performer no matter how many hotel room reservations you book, or how much positive guest feedback is received. Zero job security, long time employees are not valued.  Call center with a ""point system"" for attendance. Returning from a break 1 minute late, no matter the reason, is 1/2 point.  A one day sick call out is 1 point. There are no ""excuses"" not even a doctors note.  Agents constantly come to work very ill, fearful of losing their job and pass their diseases along to the others. With no assigned seating, germs are passed everywhere. You are only allowed 12 points in a 12 month period, so it's easy to see how quickly agents can lose their job. Computer and phone systems crash on a daily basis. The employee is also penalized for this, as you are required to go into a computer problems status that also counts against you and lowers your adherence below acceptable levels, through no fault of your own. Management constantly promises new computer equipment which never arrives. There are workstations with out of service dates from 2013 still hanging on them! Employees are constantly threatened with losing their 10 min per shift bathroom privilege if more time is used. Don't have an upset stomach or a day when"
bad,"Company is nearing bankruptcy, so everyone is worried about job security. It's turned into a nasty environment of favoritism, competition, and uneducated overwhelmed senior leadership trying to save their own jobs."
bad,good place to work but ran incompetently! The job itself is not bad. If you a people person it could possibly be a nice fit. But the way the managers treat their employees is unacceptable. I worked in the cage for a little over 3 years...and did well there...but in my time there my manager hired and FIRED 26 people. Highest turnover rate i have ever heard of. And good people too.
bad,"You'll find more integrity in Congress, than you will at Harrahs"
bad,"If you don't want a life and enjoy dealing with unprofessional, biased, and unqualified management ... Harrahs is the place for you."
bad,"just plain poor management, nothin could be done right, the people were fun to work with tho"
bad,Employees are just a number.  And the last few years they have been doing all they can to chase off older workers. When you walk around their properties look around. See many over 50? Bet not. They chase off the older ones they have and REFUSE to hire older workers. Serious harassment and hiring discrimination practices going on in this company. New owners need to fix it!
bad,The worst management I have been through. Nobody in management communicate with eachother and they all contradict one another. The best part about my job was my customers I came across.
bad,Favoritism and advancement based on seniority was all here. 95% of management didn’t earn their roles but rather got their roles from being the longest ones there. All levels of management were not qualified to be custodians let alone managers of their departments
bad,"Transferring between departments is difficult, and there’s not many opportunities for growth. The corporate jobs are mostly given to friends of management."
bad,The entire company is corrupt.  Management is often unqualified.  There is absolutely no work/life balance concern from management and favoritism runs rampant. The ONLY plus is relatively decent pay.
bad,The culture is uptight and most of the people are rigid and unusually unfriendly. Difficult to collaborate with prima donna consultants  and know-it-all employees.
bad,"Do yourself a favor DO NOT apply for safety Ambassador at Rio!"
bad,New hires are not welcomed. The culture is territorial. Management is not professional and create a hostile work environment. Human resources is unprofessional and biased. Harassment is allowed and encouraged.
bad,"Management constantly changes their minds about who is responsible for what, there is an overall lack of communication leading to system failures. Management is not looking to move in a posive way forward rather mismanaging the company into further decline. Managers are notorious for treating staff badly, harassing them and set the tone for a negative work environment."
bad,"If you are looking for job don't look here.  Management Is unethical and lie.  They say what a moral company they are then act dishonest when it suits them.  Trust me, there are better places to work."
bad,"· Safeguards casino assets; responsible for the protection and control of the game."
bad,"Worked in Convention Sales just shy of a year. I left due to Management & Compensation. You cannot have a voice and Paid minimal for a Billion Dollar Corporation. Stated as ""Corporate"" but NO Paid Holidays & was denied a bonus because I left even though I did the work in 2017.  Employees make the company but you're treated as dispensable."
bad,"The geust was the best thing about the job , other than that it’s a terrible place to work , managemt doesn’t appreciate good workers. They will fire you quick fast & in a hurry"
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there. The pay is horrible everyone gets paid differently we all done the same labor of work. Management sucks lack of communication. Favoritism it’s really not worth it it’s sickening and stressful .
bad,"Just not good. Very boring. When you work there they own you.They had the right to change their policies at anytime..therefore if they didn't like you they would find a way to get rid of you.Things that one person did wrong and got written up for other did and got away with. They always had way too many people scheduled. Therefore servers weren't making as much money and there was alot of just standing around. That makes for a very long day. "
bad,"Harrah's has some wonderful people working for them.  Unfortunately, the culture is to work you to death.  The senior leadership is very poor.  However, with any job there are lessons to learn; mine is to find something that is more understanding of the work/life balance.  Harrah's offers none of that.  A typical day is minimum of 10-12 hours...not uncommon to work 7-10 days in a row or more."
bad,I worked the day shift where i would have to interact with my direct management team and also mid-day management. My direct management were great. Mid-day management was hardly ever around. They were constantly in the office on their phones or outside smoking. When they did actually come around they tried to cause a lot of drama with staff
bad,"As a ""Security Officer"" at the Harrah's in Laughlin, and I assume most all Caesar's properties, you will spend your time speaking with guests about what products to buy. There was no semblance of a Secure work environment and no form of training or clear policy. Everything is word of mouth and Security is the last to be consulted."
bad,"Made promises they didn't keep, treated employees horrible  if you weren't one who kissed up to them. They overlooked employees for management positions took people from other departments."
bad,"this job sucks gives no promotion . treat humans bad no respect."
bad,left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Poor training and lack of employee support. The rules are conveniently altered to fit their needs at the time. Lack of structure and poor morale
bad,"Use to be the best place to work, my how things change. If you are good at kissing up and doing nothing, then this IS the place for you as the company seems to want that rather than people who can make a difference by being the best at their job. If you work hard and prove yourself, you DO NOT have a chance here. So if you get hired, the requirements are  to make sure you do nothing, play on the internet all day and kiss up to everyone, you'll go very far!"
bad,Evs management is awful as most evs employees will tell you. Very uneducated and uncaring . Does not show good leadership at all. Hard work goes unnoticed. Spends more time playing on his phone than on the floor . Firing people based on his likes rather than their performance.
bad,"I meet my husband here and even let management know we were dating and they had no clue. We kept our professional life separate from home life. Well they must have starting caring because my hours got cut to 8 a month and he got full time. I decided I would leave so he could stay."
bad,Just not a good experience all the way around. I was wrongfully terminated and rehired 3 days later when they discovered they were wrong and had to offfer me my job back.
bad,"Update different projects cost report every day, pay invoices to the contractors, check gl accounts periodically for not usual charges, file,"
bad,"Terribly managed, under-paid compared to other casinos in the area (plus other casinos give FREE food and paid holidays, Harrah's does not), typical ""corporate bull."" Very hard to get time off, people aren't willing to help when you're busy, management is very two-faced. Things that should be kept confidential aren't. A lot of harrassment problems amongst employees. Employees are afraid to speak up about complaints because retaliation has happened many times. I would not recommend this place... there isn't really anything enjoyable about this job."
bad,"(This is only my experience)My little department was ok. There were actually some enjoyable moments, but no true progress and no initiative for improvements.  I would not recommend this place of employment as a career.  Lots of backstabbers, favouritism and definitely mismanagement, but if you stay long enough you can move up, but only if they like you."
bad,"After spending  11 plus years and watching the Senior management turn over like a revolving door, it was time to move on . The sense of nepotism was apparent in some departments. Favoritism was widely apparent especially if you didn't fit into the click in management. "
bad,Never again!  A manager shouldn’t call employees derogatory names because they can’t handle the job! Employee relations is a joke. Nothing is done for the employees!
bad,Not a good place to work unless you're native. They use you until they can't anymore. They do not value you as an employee unless you are a native American
bad,"upper management is horrible, especially in food and beverage and security. the head of security is extremely racist, sexist, and misogynistic. the overall environment from management to the guests themselves is absolutely toxic. every employee there pretty much hates their life. the only exceptions are probably table games, HR, and employees on the administrative side, everyone else is only staying long enough to find another job. there is NO MONEY in the casino therefore if you are working for tips don't hold your breath, guests aren't winning so they aren't tipping and the ones who would tip are being pushed out by the security department due to the color of their skin and the type of music they like. its honestly sad."
bad,Job was difficult with a lot of space to cover and no support from upper management.  Nothing was ever good enough but no clear direction ever given just that things were done wrong.
bad,Working here is depressing. Management does not care and will do anything to make themselves look good even if it's at the expense of others. Would not recommend.
bad,"This casino is not the place to work unless you are under 35 years old. They have a no excuse point system for attendance. You can be taken by ambulance from work to the hospital and you will still get pointed for it. My department had poor management that has favorite employees. Those of us that are over 35 years old do not fit that criteria, get passed over for promotions and disregarded. There is an unusually high amount of backstabbing and high school gossip mentality there as well. Harrahs doesn't care about their employees or their guests. It's just about making money."
bad,You are only a number in the casino's eyes and easily replaced. Its not a fun environment when your management uses the workers as scapegoats constantly and changes rules whenever it suites them. Terrible place to work would never recommend it to anyone.
bad,"bad place to work. It's nearly impossible to get full time hours. No shift premium.....odd shift times....no job security...they make you park 8 minutes away from the casino Friday and Saturday. No paid lunches, plus much much more is wrong. Do not apply here if your looking for a career. Everybody is easily replaced here. And the union does nothing for you."
bad,Working as a table game dealer may seem like the easiest job but it's actually one of the hardest job you have to deal with. You have to deal with many different personality and make sure you follow all procedures because your dealing with money. It's a fun environment to work at but it also emotionally drains you out.
bad,"Not a great culture if you are an ambitious person aiming for the stars. Stay clear of this company."
bad,"If I never set foot in a Harrah's property or their affiliates again, I'll be happy.   The management uses no sense in determining values except protecting the higher echelon's high salaries and benefits.  I put in nearly 13 years. of dedicated service participating in extracurricular activities.  I protected the company as an EMT/Security Guard saving them thousands in fines by catching minors trying to sneak in, treating as an Iowa Stated certified EMT both guests and employees.  I made 6 saves never having a guest die on property. I participated in asinine promotions like Everyone Greets Everyone which was more irritating than helpful.  We were told to have fun but constantly reminded we were under the watchful eye of Surveillance.  There was no privacy.   For all the value I was alleged to have I was terminated by a slip of the tongue.  After commuting 2 hours a day through all kinds of weather I was let go for a supposedly minor infraction to their precious set of policies which Supervisors broke all the time.  I know through our Security Supervisor and Security Lead Officer in discussing the poor rate of pay advancement ( I once went 3 years without a raise) that our Security Manager stated it would be unlikely due the fact our General Manager and Assistant General Manager thought it more cost efficient to get rid of people like me who had gained a few extra dollars and full benefits in favor of constantly establishing a turn over rate of new employees paying them less with benefits not taking effect until 90 days.  When I started the turnover rate was a whopping 150%"
bad,A typical day of work consisted of walking around in circles around tables taking drink orders. I learned that people are willing to do anything to get what they want and throw people under the bus. The management was horrible. They talked down to us like we were children. My co-workers kept to themselves. The hardest part about my job was I was being degraded by men daily and I wasn't allowed to say anything to them and  when I told the supervisor(s) they did nothing. The most enjoyable part of my job was the pay.
bad,"Horseshoe was a very horrible place, management was very poor, as in hotel, was a college student at the time of employment couldn't move up or get a raise due to me pursing a degree in unrelated field."
bad,"I applied on line and was given a ""Panel Interview"" there was a bunch of us together in a big room and we were asked stupid questions which had noting to do with the job at all. i was applying for a security officer position not a marshmallow and roses position.Then we played pictionary as part of the interview REALLY. We then were split into groups and asked to tell one thing about ourselves while the ""Panel"" wrote down our answers. When it was done myself and one other person were pulled out in the hallway and told that this was the end of the road for us. I have over 20 years experience in Law Enforcement and Security but because I didnt smile enough and my body language wasnt what they wanted REALLY. Give me a break. Lets see them smile when the drunk they are trying to escort out of the casino is fighting with them try to keep an upbeat attitude and ask them to come back after you toss them out GET REAL."
bad,"You know when you're doing great work here, because other people will try and take credit for it. My co-worker got me uninvited from creative meetings and was taking my designs and presenting them at these meetings. This person also deleted code in our content management system after she left, but still had access. Complaints about these things were actually ignored by Senior Management, which basically just sums this place up."
bad,"A company that has to do more with less. Casino drives business, all other areas given subordinate position which results in less compensation and brutal work schedules."
bad,i must say u make decent money but the management sucks. the company seems as if they do not care about their employees. the work is not hard. the drama and mess are extremly high.
bad,Worst place i ever been
bad,I’ve never work for a company where race plays a factor and not experience. I work for this company for over 5 years and have over 15years experiences. But as I look around every race gets a promotion except for the race I am and it’s only in the department I was in. But I always ended up being the go to person to make them look good and get promoted. So unfair that racism still plays a factor within this company.
bad,"Get in and Get out.."
bad,"if you want to be given a write-up for stupid stuff, then this is the place for you. management is abusive of power and half of the time they are not even qualified, half of the time they are in the smoke shack doing nothing, or just standing on the casino floor doing nothing. they will proceed to treat you like a expendable robot.why do you think they are always hiring? One example is that during a tornado warning they didn't do a head count to see if all of the EVS crew was safe why do you think they are always hiring? only join as a last resort."
bad,"Worst corporation."
bad,"My trainer told me coming in that Security Management at Harrah's Casino in Las Vegas would do ""anything to get rid of an employee"". And it's true! They will set you up and even harass you. None of the security guards like the Managers. Worst job ever!"
bad,"Apathy rules the day at all their properties. Just walk around and look. Everything is dirty and broken stuff is everywhere. One area literally had black mold growing up the walls! No one cares from the top on down. Its no wonder the company is so deep in debt. "
bad,Caesars was a complete political nightmare.  The upper management in the food and beverage department played the politics game and if you did not play that game they found a way to get you out.
bad,"I preface this by saying that I personally can't enjoy the table game culture as I did when I first started dealing.  But if you need a place to break into dealing; I'm sure this is a great place for that. The only problem is that of other casinos I worked at. Third shift, difficult regulars, and yahoos who forget how to act in public because they think it's Vegas( just off the top of my head ).  There were a handful of skilled dealers and supervisors there to learn from, as well as sloppy ones, but I would say the ratio leans more to the former."
bad,"Horrible  Company to work for. employees spying on employees, inexperienced  management. poor communication. no advances in house. very poor training ,"
bad,"when the customers where treated right everything was good. Now they aren't given the respect of before.  The management needs "
bad,No chance for advancement only if you play games.  Unable to spend holidays with family because you are always scheduled to work.  There is definitely no job security because if a high player casino complains you could be fired.
bad,"Management is horrible...your not treated with respect, your talked down to, and nothing is confidential between managers. Spa manager is the worst about letting employee's personal issues, the next days gossip amongst other employees. She can't be trusted and somehow remains in management. Spa supervisor lied on her application and doesn't even have a high school diploma or GED, But yet she was promoted to a supervisor position, because of lack of applicants, merely by the manager so she herself does not have any extra work. Horrible pay for amount of hours required to work. Company and management allow guests to get in employees faces and yell at them and just pretend they don't see. Manager allows employees to come in high on marajuana and no drug tests are enforced."
bad,i dont know what to say.......the place speaks for itself i guess....not sure if they truly care about their employees ....ethics investigations should be done there and they have other reviews you can google and read about
bad,"As a table Games Supervisor, Horseshoe Hammond is a horrible place to work. If you're not in the Management team clique, advancement opportunities are scarse. They also have an annual bonus program in which the same people get every year simply because they are a part of a management clique. It's pretty much equalivant to the Illuminati. They bend the rules for who they want to bend the rules for."
bad,"Management is impossible to work with or for. The room is full of little clicks and the favoritism hits you in the face from the moment you start. The director of Table Games (Susan) is NEVER AROUND but that doesn't stop her from forming an opinion about anyone. In 16 years of casino employment, I've never witnessed a worse director. The is 0 job security as everyone is nothing more than a number. Someone simply saying that you said or did something will result in an IMMEDIATE termination with NO INVESTIGATION. After only 8 days of employment; I had seen enough and I quit!!"
bad,"Management is a joke. A majority of employees are completely miserable, avoid this place."
bad,The management has NO care in the world about its workers. They make all the upper management run three properties at a time and they are so stressed out that goes down the chain to the line employees. They do things that are not conducive to supporting customer service. DO NOT work here.
bad,"I love my job! However, the management team is much to be desired."
bad,"I was a 38 year, day one employee and have sadly watched the building deteriorate to the state it is now.  Co-workers are great but management is clueless.  What used to take one supervisor now takes three and it is worse.  Lack of supplies and filth everywhere you look makes it a toxic place to work."
bad,"If you need a job that bad, go ahead and apply. But expect to be treated poorly, never get ahold of Human Resources, to not be trained properly, work in an under staffed department, never able to take a day off or your EARNED vacation time, and be penalized for tragic uncontrollable events. Management is incompetent, they will mess up your pay so keep track of your hours, and don’t be too good of an employee, they don’t care or deserve it. Bally’s in Atlantic City, NJ."
bad,Management is too powerful unchecked no one fights for non management and the union power is limited. If you challenge a write up it's going to be upheld regardless because management stands up for management they cannot be wrong at this company even if they are.
bad,"The management is high turnover and not set up to support the company and its objectives."
bad,Company was going through a division and possible bankruptcy. They were laying off several people and terminating a lot of positions in the company. I don't think that the company takes care of there employees the way they should. A lot of places are unsanitary which resulted in employee's becoming ill.
bad,"Would give this place a Zero if I could, I am not a disgruntled employee since I worked there six years it is just they are strong top to bottom management and everyone above you will think they are better employees and smarter than you because they are higher on the corporate ladder than you. Also saw and reported to no avail age and gender discrimination, as well as preferential treatment because of race. Also during the economic downturn in 2008, they laid off 1400 people in Tunica, froze salaries, but at the end of the year, the CEO took a $96,000,000.00. Yes, that reads ninety six million dollars!! If you enjoy working for a company that only cares about the bottom line and how much the executives can pay themselves while throwing people out of work, this is the company for you."
bad,"Harrah's casino is a good place to work if you're looking for job security but that's about where it ends it was good when I first started until you get exposed to the drama and gossip and even though they make you sign papers not to get caught up a it helps nothing management employees they're all involved in gossip Management is very unprofessional not Casino side hotel sites it got to the point where I got so tired of the drama and the il Gossip I split and it's a shame because other than that it's a pretty good company"
bad,"This is a great place to work if you are a supervisor or above. You can learn a lot at the managment level for this company with absolutely no prior gaming experience. It is definitely the worse place to work as an regular employee because the priority is always the customers. Management does not deal with customers the same as the front line staff. They just tell you to keep smiling and make the customers happy at all costs. This company thrives on selling their soul to the devil or the customers. Management thrive by throwing you under the bus. There are no job security here too. They do anything to save a dime in this company which means no food in cafeteria, trouble getting supplies, and not bonuses for lower level employees."
bad,"My job was good pay was good but the management was very poor, bias showing favoritism, many advancement promises, but no results."
bad,"FT dealers don't get 40hrs, they force you out(-2hr) Fri and Sat. PT they get the early starts and they get to pick the shift too. At the end you go to work 10 days and might end up with 8 days pay period. Now they won't even consider seniority. Every month 30 new PT dealers come out of class and get shoved under the FT."
bad,"Very fun place to work however if you not in a good graces of the higher powers the most definitely you will not have any advancement. A lot of clicks are formed in if you not part of any of those clicks in guess what  You're on the outside looking in even if you doing your work."
bad,"The management in housekeeping is the worst I've ever experienced in a work environment. The work is basically slave labor. They pay well but it's not worth it in my opinion. They could careless if you get a break, you just better get those 15 rooms done or you'll get written up and belittled. The management will make mistakes and when called out on it the b look and is on you. The rooms sometimes are so filthy, and it's impossible to do 15 rooms in 8 hours with multiple beds to make, trash everywhere and fully cleaning the bathrooms,  windows, vents, light fixtures. Every piece of everything in the rooms basically in 15 to 20 mins per room. The make up rooms also have to be cleaned fully like the check out rooms. No one talked to me because I didn't speak Spanish, it was like being the new kid at school everyday. The company itself is okay I may have liked it better if I was doing something other than housekeeping. Or at a different hotel other than Caesars Palace. They also make you wait 6 months before you could switch jobs. I refuse to be miserable for 6 months for any type of money. The whole  housekeeping department at Caesars entertainment needs to be reevaluated but especially Caesars palace."
bad,"As a Gaming Host, I had the great pleasure of greeting and meeting with people from all walks of life, of course, 18 years and older.  The guests developed a  pleasant and professional rapport with me."
bad,Caesars Palace was  great the first several years I worked there. Once the bankruptcy started it became very stressful. They kept adding responsibities for us to follow and adding more and more games to learn without training properly.
bad,"Does not give raises or recognition. "
bad,"I was a day one employee at the Horseshoe. The management is terrible. Nobody ever communicates effectively and they have no concern for the well-being of their employees. Fights would break out on the floor weekly among the guests, and security never implemented any safeguards to prevent these occurrences. A dress code would have effectively kept most of the trouble at bay. At times, a guest was removed for assaulting employees, only to be allowed back in the following week. Their primary concern was revenue, and it was obvious to everyone."
bad,Awful place to work for. Management was changed over 8 different times all telling me what an over pour was. Then i was let go for overpouring when i measured out exactly what the manager had said to give.
bad,"I enjoyed the daily work at Harrahs, creating menus and executing them for high volume buffet.  The hardest part of the job was reaching some of the kitchen staff to change their ways.  Most of the employees followed my example but several did not care.  The most enjoyable part was seeing the quality of the food improve day by day."
bad,"Hired by a corporate director, managed positive results on P& L but due to complaints within department in regards to union contract I was terminated. No written warnings no progressive discipline nothing. HR seems to be in bed with union, corporate at the time stated by my director they were being investigated for these practices."
bad,"Management likes to play around too much. There is alot of stress in the job keeping the kids off the casino floor. Dogs are  brought on the casino floor and employees can't say anything about it."
bad,"The job itself and the customers are probably the best part. The being forced to breathe smoke indoors aside, the management was very unstable, vindictive, and favorited people. Infidelity is rampant, and HR is ineffective."
bad,"Harrah's is one of the older casinos in the area, but it's also much farther out than most of the ones in Bossier City. Because of this, the overall player base is much older yet also more loyal. There's not much to do, and it's just overall more slow and boring."
bad,They make a whole lot of promises but the management does not care about you at all.  There are too many employees so the chain of command is basically a big circle and nothing ever gets done. The pay is hard to beat but they treat you like garbage. Also the benefits are great if you’re full time but you get nothing if you’re part time.
bad,I love cleaning make me like an home... Easy as pie.  Clean room make bed .clean behind bed clothes wipe down everything wipe floor mop floor that need to be wiped moor is
bad,"Management at the Linq (Flamingo Starbucks) sucks. Too many young kids that are there to make money and not really work. Tons of favoritism. Loved the customers but that's it. It's foot in the door if you're new to Vegas or the corporation. Otherwise, stay away"
bad,"Terrible management... They fire for no reason.."
bad,Harrah's discriminates against you if you are not a minority or LGBTQ. Minorities and LGBTQ have opportunity for advancement but others don't. Love to promote people just for the claim of diversity regardless of ability. Declared bankruptcy on local small businesses after purposely running up bills
bad,"Horseshoes Casino always training all employee very good.Mananment are very friendly."
bad,"Management Lacks respect on Acknowledgment of doing good things, yet they point out the bad a lot.  Our workplace environment is dirty.  The hardest part of this job is feeling like a robot and not being able to be myself. "
bad,"No structure. Leadership only hires their friends and don't promote from within. Multiple colleagues reporting managers for harassment while HR just rolled their eyes and let it happen. Extreme turnover,  misconduct and borderline illegal activity."
bad,the president of harrah's has no backbone his underclass people run the casino.the culture has a lot to be desired hardest part of the job was to watch out for the management they are very sneaky
bad,"Harrah's overall is a wonderful place to work. A certain shift manager is not a compassionate shift. That person does not care about what anyone is (was going through). I also think the HR department should allow people to appeal their termination if people point out, because they do not know the circumstances as to what was going on in that person's life and did not try to find out. That is the one thing I would change"
bad,The HR department doesn't side with management. Only sides with the union which makes managing extremely hard. The salaries are not enough for what you have to deal with.
bad,Nothing to say. I couldn't say anything that would be positive about the environment. It satisfied my monetary needs but was not a healthy working environment.
bad,"Horse Shoe of Batimore is not a good compamy to work for due lack of structure in its management team, poor hiring practice, and the pay is terrible and the list goes on."
bad,I loved my job at Horseshoe Casino. I went to work motivated and prepared everyday. I love the relationships with the guest and employees over 9 years working there. There wasn't a hard part at my job.
bad,"Not equipped to accommodate all the customers that walk through the door, stressful work environment when nothing goes right. Rules are often not followed through and changed depending on the person. Hours are decent, not exceptional."
bad,"Write and proof read employee citywide communications for emails and printed advertisements. Design email and poster templates. Assist the Marketing Department with launching new guest programs and offers to employees with communications and employee events. Support HERO and Code Green community outreach initiatives. Revamp back of house areas by having new branded wall wraps installed along with requesting repainting areas when necessary.

bad,"My interview consisted of me being told , come now you will start as a dual rate supervisor as that is the only position open, within 3 months you will be a RGM ( relief games manager ) 12 months you will be running a shift, "
bad,my typical day at work there was very good and what i learn that they are very nice to work around and i enjoy working with them and management was very very good and co workers was very friendly easy to get alone the hardest part was i love to help out with other room attendant but i couldn't do it at times because sometimes everyone needed help  the most enjoyable part is i would like to work for harrah's again
bad,I walk in and its stressful. Management don't listen or try to meet you half way.
bad,"I hated working for this casino, it was the worst thing that i had to do. Hated the manager she didn't even have the right qualifications to be in her position, i knew of Supervisors with more experience than her. It was so unfair to the employees who worked for the Gift shop or any shop here. People would yell at you scream at you and even though you where right the manager would take their side just for the money. hated this casino and would never ever work for it again. Even though they try to say that its a fair place to work it isn't."
bad,"A typical day at work is a smoke filled atmosphere. I learned that there is no room for advancement. Management doesn't train or give feedback. Co-workers are noisy, unprofessional and rude. The hardest part of the job is not being able to take off when your ill & dealing with rude customers. The pay is horrible and the benefits are OK"
bad,"Ran front of the house operations. Trained staff on customer service, handled cashier financials, worked with a great diverse group of people."
bad,"IT was a good place for training and got a lot of expernces in customer service. also I handled money day lee ."
bad,I was a great working and came to work on time.  I never called in sick and early all the time.  I did my job assignment to the best of my ability.  I have respect for my supvisor.
bad,"Fun place to work, much room for growth. Co-workers are friendly everyone are team players. I provide excellent customer service daily. Offer them the ultimate experience at Horseshoe."
bad,Management seemed to go out of their way to emphasize the negativity of an individual. No praises or reassurances. Never anything positive expressed to most employees.
bad,"They I mean survelliance, would the camera the ball type on you and judk it up and down to harass you. The manager we had rode and watched you all the time I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders when they let me go."
bad,Management aint the best its very mboring 90% of the time ur chilling or just doing laps in a post  pretty simple ur a baby sitter for adults just a low payed one
bad,"All nights and weekends plus holidays.  "
bad,"Since the company joined/merged with Harrah's everything has hit rock bottom.  The food, the morale, the team orientation, the hours, the benefits, the place is sickly now.  I was proud to work on the strip but the management and staff is burnt out and ""living in the past"" before the market crashed, literally.  Beautiful property that is not being taken care of since Harrah's bought the rights. No growth opportunities for entry level managers or front-line employees. I was 25 years too late working there because it truly was ""crem dela crem"" at one point in time:/"
bad,Online hotel and show bookings. No longer operating. Fast paced
bad,"Management has their favorites, so don't think hard work will pay off.  Want a schedule and technically you should get it?  They'll find a way to bump you out of the running."
bad,"Many staff members are hired part time and worked full time hours and never given benefits.physical building unhealthy with mold issues and  poor cleaning habits. Staff Chronicly over worked, under paid , poor training."
bad,Not a bad place to work if you don’t have a life or kids you work every holiday and aren’t able to take vacation days on the actual dates you want management isn’t willing to cover shifts for the supervisors when they request days off Good luck you get the job!!!!
bad,"Be careful if you decide to work there. It’s not the best company to work for. If management do not like you, they will find ways to get rid of you. Mark my words."
bad,"If you want a life, avoid this place at all costs.  Doesn't allow you to have a work and family life balance. "
bad,no one should work here the mangers get drunk and on shift and charge there bill to vip customers..nothing is confidential...you will be expected to work 12/16 hours per day sometimes you can start at 6pm an not finish till 6pm but asks to be back on shift by 10am...top managers have 0 work ethics and will scream at staff members new and old in front of everyone....even if he staff member starts to cry then will then use that against you to try and make out that your not a good fit...I have worked on an off here for years and. it just gets worse and worse...
bad,"Supervisors and managers are very unprofessional. Very disorganized and not interested in taking care of their employees. Constantly under staffed. Extremely filthy, fails health code inspections."
bad,The company is difficult at best to work for and employees are not treated well.  They lead you to believe at the beginning that you will be making $25 dollars an hour except that you don't work 40 hours a week.  Doing the math and dividing by 40 it comes out to less than 13 an hour.  The hours are unforgiving and you cannot lead a normal life.
bad,"As a cage cashier I loved interacting with guest and SOME coworkers. For lunch breaks you are required to clock out for one half hour, come all the way back to clock in and go finish your hour break.WHAT A HEADACHE! If there was a line and it was time for you to pull your drawer you get written up for overtime. If your work week said 40 hours even, they made you leave early even if they were short handed, leaving others to do double the work. Complaining to your supervisor or manager was pointless. The only time things got done is if you went to the head of the Department. Also tips came in plenty as a cashier, but you have to split them with the ENTIRE department, including those who had no customer interaction. Working there for the small time I did made me quickly realize why they have a 100% turnover rate."
bad,"Work with a lot of great people who are taken advantage of by management because of the economy. This company's mission vision, and value statement is totally opposite of the way they act. They micromanage every aspect of the business and have several incompetent people in places of authority making bad business decisions that affect all the employees."
bad,A typical day as a Table Games Supervisor  consists of constant guest interaction as well as watching for procedure violations and any questionable gaming. Management needs work at this property after it came under the new corporate owners. The hardest part of the job are the hours and the lack of time for family.
bad,The employees who start new make $$$ more than the good employees who have been there.  Little or no advancement opportunities.  You earn time off but are denied days off when requesting time off.  You won’t get paid extra to work high volume days but if you call out you get pointed as a high volume call out.  It’s who you know not what you know to advance.
bad,"Maybe if you want to start in the hotel and casino business this might be a good company to do so. After 2 months I knew it would lead to nothing. Employee dining room was disgusting, non happy co workers, Benifits are terrible. No one seemed to care when you brought up better ideas that are more cost effective but would enhance customer experience.  Co workers are not engage and are unhappy.  Managers just go through the motion. No leadership. Lots of theft going out the back door. I only looked forward to my last day after 6 months, thankfully found a much better company"
bad,Very stressful place I had write and complain about not get weekend off then they start give  me weekend they want to be off through the week and work weekends and they dont give Sat and Sun off they give fri and Sat off are Sun and Mon not enough people they want work you extra day sad not enough money they have the point system and if take of a point if go home point ...weekend double point I work there 2 time
bad,"Very unorganized place to be. Very stressful, as a supervisor, upper management doesn't listen to your input regarding your own team. Management in general is horrible. Sexist"
bad,"They DO NOT know how to treat employees fairly."
bad,"The security department at Harrahs Reno is so  Dysfunctional.  Three different shifts all being trained Different ways and going in 3 different directions the department has no manager and no direction. Worst so called Corp. Security department I have ever seen."
bad,"Harrahs Resort Southern California is not for everyone. As a seasoned professional, I rely heavily on being provided adequate training and knowledge to better understand both my position and expectations. They failed on delivering training which promotes success. Pathway to understanding bonus structure is unclear and no one is on the same page when it come to understanding the culture."
bad,"To each is own, but this is by far the worst job I ever had. Management is terrible. Management abuse her power. Management changes rules to cater to her. Apply at your own risk."
bad,"In bankruptcy, no advertising, staffing at a bare minimum. Accountability for actions not consistent. Earned vacation can't be accrued or carried over. Difficult to keep entry level positions filled, high turnover in the gaming/ beverage side. Don't utilize the floor space effectively to maximize revenue."
bad,"Horseshoe Casino and Hotel, was my first job.  Really enjoyed working there, I had to put up with a lot.  Tried to do the best I could and make the best out of that situation."
bad,"This company isn't interested in the welfare of their employees. In this casino you have no value and should not express any opinion. You must behave as a zombie without a brain. Nice pay, but I've made more at other places. You can tell by the lack of dental care afforded to the employees how poor their benefits are."
bad,"nice place ., was unaware it was for sale . I was brought on"
bad,"Challanging work enviroment dealing face to face with the general public.  From professionals, to retirees, to every walk of life the combination of gambling, drinking, high volume and little to no management support make it a tough working environment.  Company policy is to keep the different levels of employees away from each other so no supportive team environment exists.  Should be an action filled fun social job that pays well but sadly poorly run and with little to no career advancement opportunities this job is more for a robot than a customer service professional."
bad,new company with ever changing rules and conflicts of interest between departments
bad,"Very stressful place to work as a Supervisor.  You are always second guessed on your decision making skills.  Other Supervisors are afraid to do their jobs in risk to be termed.  If you work there as a Supervisor, you better know your place.  It's is about the front-line employees and management above you.  And also, kiss you life and friends goodbye because you are going to lose touch with both.  The property says they have integrity, but check out the new about them giving out VIP membership to political figures. "
bad,"It may really depend on what part of Caesars you work for. Non-gaming auditing ? Stinks. If you don't mind working long hours (10-12 hour days) on a low salary (no ot pay), then this place is the for you."
bad,"I had a great boss, but there is no opportunity for growth. As always, it's not the most qualified or hardest working that get promoted, but the person that's been there the longest."
bad,The company has many law sue cases and it was poorly managed  wouldn’t recommend anyone to work for this company. Not treating the employees fairly and even cheated their employees by using them full time but not providing full time benefit etc.
bad,They don't care about their employees...they treat them like garbage. Most supervisors are untrained...biased and incompetent to do their job...none of them have your back and always take the side of the guest.
bad,"Point system they follow is more of a hinderenc then a good system for attendance.  They point you for everything from going home early for a family emergencies...children sick and more.   They point you for every time you call off due to a family emergency or being sick.  If it's a holiday they double point you.   The Caesars here in Maricopa have 16 holidays while you only get paid for 6 of them.   And these are considered blackout dates.  Where you are not allowed to call off.  "
bad,"Don't care enough to review. "
bad,"It was very stressful for me at the time of employment there times when my children and I took sick and I was informed to bring in my doctors note or hospital release papers so my time off would be accounted for and when I brought my papers in I still got pointed for them, and while I was on maternity leave with my last child I was terminated for what was said to be job abandonment."
bad,"So in my area, the local Casino/Resort is the only place to work that even comes close to providing enough income for the cost of living, and yet it's a double edged sword, because the job becomes your life. Very physically and mentally draining place to work. Great benefits, you'll utilize them consistently."
bad,"You are over worked and understaffed ever single shift. The company blames sick calls but it is poor scheduling and bad management. You are treated like a number not a person. They don't care about you, your family or anything other than you coming to work and doing the work of 3 people. They will never tell you your doing a good job only talk to you when writing you up. You will never get full time but they will make you work 5 days a week without the benefits. Without a union everyone in there would be part time working 4 or 6 hour shifts."
bad,"Hope for experienced supervisors each dept is operated different.  Bottom line is you can and will be replaced, must be on time, getting days off is a hassle."
bad,"The overall corporate workplace of Caesars is very old school. The people who have made it to management, made it there by time in position over experience managing people. They know the industry, but leading people towards growth is treated as a threat. Treating their peers with respect is difficult for most. There are still some good apples here, but for the most part, the culture among management is CYA and let all others out to hang."
bad,this is a place I would never go after working here. It’s unprofessional the people are rude the service is ok until it’s a request for something extra then u get attitudes.
bad,Advancement opportunities are more about who you know and their clout within the organization and less about what you know. Compensation is based on geographical location and not what skills you actually possess. The overall mentally is that you should be content to have a job and less concerned about how much you actually are paid.
bad,"Have to work there to know what it really is all about,  Honestly if you want a personal life the casino business is not for you. If you want fast paced and stressful that give it a go."
bad,"The casino treats you bad and does not care about your health. You work a lot of hours, get yelled at a lot. The supervisors set you up to get fired and then laugh about it."
bad,"I work for a vendor. Not directly for Horseshoe, although we had to obey many Horseshoe policies. It is very stressful working in Horseshoe. It is not like other casino's and a lot of unpredictable things happen there."
bad,"Apparently the manager didn't like me, so they made up a story I know for a fact was false, and had me fired. Never again would I even consider working there again."
bad,"This place will suck the soul out of you. You think your doing a good job but no they have to constantly be beating you down, management changes every few months so you never know who'll be in charge and what you'll have to reverse next"
bad,Management is out of touch. Expectations for positions are beyond what is possible for the amount of employees being supervised. Employees are not treated equally. Favoritism is shown and allowed by management.
bad,The HR group works hard to make this a fun workplace.  The rest of the management group is not so engaged.  Workload and expectations for salaried employees is extremely out of balance to the bad.  Many extra hours and no appreciation or compensation. The union makes this a miserable place to work.  Beware.
bad,"A typical day at Total Rewards is greeting and signing up guests, selling all casino gaming, promotions, and issuing out comps.  I learned how to print cards and be a information hub for guests.  Management onna scale from 1 to 10 is a 3!  Poorly managed and no leadership in Total Rewards.  The co-workers are not supervised nor managed effectively.  In addition,  I was constantly verbally harassed and ganged up on by several associates in front of guests and staff!  Hardest part of the job was the poor compensation and commute.  The best part was the guests that played there; the guests are fun people."
bad,"The work environment was great!  I met a lot of lovely people who are still my friends today.  A lot of the things that we were promised at the employee rallies (i.e. promotions, working conditions, set hours, unions,etc) never came to fruition.  The hours were long and arduous. The point system was brutal to deal with."
bad,"The management doesn't show as much appreciation for their employees. Advancement is more about who you know, instead of what you know. They refuse to be flexible to lifestyle changes such as school, having a baby, and etc. The employee dining room food is terrible."
bad,Ensured beverage/bottle set-up and clear tables in cooperation with the Lounge/VIP Bottle Server. Communicated with the Lounge/VIP Bottle Server.  I was Responsible for communication between the pool and bartenders. I set up cabanas for Guest Event Orders to specifications along with maintaining food areas and serving food. Performed all other job related duties as assigned.
bad,"No managerial processes.  Projects are prioritized by whoever is making the most noise, with no regard for highest business impact.  I was sold a bill of goods.  Hired for one job then completely changed when I started, without consulting me or offering an option.  Leaders in the group are entrenched and limit any chance for growth.  Not too much positive I can say about my time there."
bad,"Do not pay much and managers like ""Macro"" management style. Employees are easily fired for no reasons, so they do not feel safe for working for this company."
bad,"When I first started working for Harrah's, who was Grand Casino at the time, everything was great. We had paid holidays, quarterly bonuses for providing great customer service, and even a turkey on Thanksgiving. As time progressed everything stopped."
bad,I learned that you can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink
bad,Management has their favorites and they are the people that advance in the company.
bad,"The benefits are good. Health care is affordable. Meals are provided."
bad,I was forced to leave due to an incident on the job where I seen it ambulance had to come take me to the nearest by hospital where I had to undergo recovery
bad,"Lets just say, my manager at the time.  What's a spoiled brat didn't like it when she was wrong. Couldn't take criticism. And she made sure to make you feel small and belittled you in FRONT of EVERYONE!! And that is why I left. Upper management never did anything to help. I don't think she is there anymore. I will say this they treat you nice when you go into your orientation but when you start working there you are a piece of property to them. They do not care about you. I was a housekeeper doing 20 sometimes 35 rooms. And it was never enough for them. I made a lot of friends with the other housekeepers. But the management suck. And worst of all people would lower them self and brown-nose the management so they could get their way. And they did."
bad,"The rules and policies  at this place is similar to Guantanamo Bay prison. Nothing good to mention ,very low work culture and most of the stuff are exhausted seniors with  20-25 years seniority .No good will staff and especially management .If you want hate casinos for life try working there."
bad,Housekeeping Managers dumped  THEIR duties onto us. We have more responsibilities for lower pay... I can understand if we're getting a decent salary. $12 an hour isnt worth the extra work or getting screamed at by 70% of guests we talk
bad,"I had a opportunity to be employed by Caesars Entertainment. The culture that they are instilling is great, but there people that still there decide to take advantage of kindness as a weakness."
bad,"Overstaffed most days of the week and too slow a workday. Hypocritical management when dealing with employees. The workplace culture is too drama based when dealing with other employees. The hardest part of the job is standing one to two hours at a time between work. The only saving grace of the job is the tips, and even then its still unbearable."
bad,"I worked 4 and a half years at Caesars and all I did was babysit. The job was not competitive in pay. Working the hours we worked, we probably only got paid $18.00 an hour for all we had to endure. If your regular scheduled day fell on a holiday, they would take your day, so basically I worked every holiday for 4 and a half years. There are no incentives for sous chefs. I had 4 different times to go to work in a work week, so no work, life balance for me."
bad,Things have changed and the management are all fighting to impress the GM who is out of touch on what his guest wants and needs and what his employees also want and need. The pressure that management are under is a trickle down to supervisors then to employees. The overall moral of employees was down. The compensation has declined in the departments that are tipped wages because most of the guest that were coming here have stopped due to the companies drastic changes. Its casino life so with any casino you don't have much of a life as it takes years if at all to have weekends off on the schedule or holidays. Those days are going to be spent at work so home and family life is hard to juggle working here.
bad,"There is so much required of you it is ridiculous. There are certain people that are shown a great deal of favoritism. The harder you work, the more you get to do."
bad,"Working with employees and guests. Resolving problems. Helping employees achieve their goals, perform to the best of their ability. Enjoyed meeting people from different walks of life."
bad,"If at total rewards it is usually always busy, always assisting a guest w question / concerns.. the department itself is slightly laid back. The management could use a lot of work. Everything is way too sales driven for working in a casino... where people just come to enjoy themselves"
bad,"When I started, it was fun and exciting. I met a lot of fun people and everyone had a good time but when the economy tanked, management started taking all the benefits away. Then they started micromanaging the place. They started adding ridiculous rules and made if very difficult to build relationships and have fun with the customers which was encouraged when I started. They took all the fun out of the job."
bad,"Poor management ,poor house keeping.If you had an issue with anything the management give you a number to empolyee services they were no help for in house issues"
bad,"I worked as a cage cashier in Cherokee, NC. This was by far one of the worst jobs I've ever had. A lot of management was really rude, acted like they were better than you. The hours were terrible, I didn't get home til 1 or 2 in the morning most nights. The pay for the amount of stress you have to deal with isn't worth it."
bad,Fun work environment. Employees assigned the jobs of 2-3 positions due to short staff. Stagnant management causes slow advancement.
bad,"The beverage Department is ran by a group of unprofessional people with very little to no experience. The Company doesn't seem to be doing well since the smoking ban, GM is nowhere to be found most of the time. However, the money it pretty good."
bad,This place is an ok place to work. The possibility of career advancement is slim to none. As far as the work environment you deal with drunk a** holes every day who are very rude.
bad,In the beginning it was a nice place to work but then they became like a military camp. You had to act a fool to get the job but once your in their its the total opposite.
bad,"Being monitored during your daily routine of interacting with guest and building relationships. The co-workers were great! We all knew we had jobs to do and we made it happen. "
bad,could be a bit more organized when i work  there i didn't get much training some of the other employees were kinda rude but all and all it was okay
bad,"Currently this company is experiencing a bankruptcy.  Unfortunately it reflects in the management and day to day operations of the business. I enjoy working with my co-workers, but stress and the overall climate take their toll on moral."
bad,"It was fun meeting new people, and working with coworkers."
bad,They basically either made us do managements jobs or put us in defferent banks without being trained properly.
bad,"DO NOT WORK FOR THESE PEOPLE!!!! Awful top management, junk pay, open 365 days a year, never a holiday off."
bad,decent pay for atlantic city
bad,Outsourcing and or eliminating jobs. When the casinos came to CB they were to create jobs and buy Iowa products and services. With outsourcing they are taking jobs away and leaving employees out to dry.
bad,"I worked there for 3 years. I never missed work, stayed late, came in early, & worked days off. I made good money because I had guests requesting me and tipped me well. The upper management did not care about loyalty or hard work. They would cut very good employees to save money. Your work and dedication was never appreciated."
bad,If you just need a job go there. The people there is full of drama. My experience there wasn't a good one. Most of the time I wasnt taking my lunch break or anything.
bad,"Overall this is a Casino, expect corruption and being on the MS Gulf Coast also the 'Good Ole Boy/Gal' system is ""in full effect.""  The terms of my employment with them ended upon a stark disagreement, and when I started their HR representative gave a 'plug' for their Board of Review process.  However, even though I was well prepared for the BoR, it was more of a ""going through the motions,"" and they just appeared to have one for the sake of having it.  I think they ""bank"" on a lot of Folks not fighting their system or showing up for this Review Board.  I did, in full suit, and had my valid arguments, but all they did was back the Security Manager in his ""second guessing"" of how I handled a case that came to Dispatch.  They did not furnish my hand-written Witness Statement, and were very sloppy on the so-called ""investigation.""  If you ever get S.P.I. (Suspended Pending Investigation) - expect that to be the end.  I was lied to by the 2nd-in-charge of Security guy to believe that I might 'outlive' the BoR, but that was just to get my hopes up.  Ultimately, all they did was for show, and my impeccable near six months of employment with them abruptly ended.  Also, the ""Guest with a Gun"" which I monitored that floor in Dispatch for hours, they cared less about my suggestion to Ban him from ever staying there again, but they used that ""incident"" to find a way to end my time there.  They also were very shady about not paying out my earned P.T.O. (Paid Time Off)."
bad,"The management at Caesars Pizza Palace were paying under the table, didn't conduct real interviews and hired people with no background in the food business."
bad,"I worked multiple roles with this company and one thing was consistent, they expected your life to revolve around the company.  Even in a supervisor role, where there were other supervisors on my same level, I frequently received phone calls at all ours of the day.  You have very limited opportunity to take time off, especially if you are management.  One year I lost the majority of my time off for the year due to staffing.  This company is especially bad for work/life balance, which I would know well after working for the company for 15 years."
bad,"They work you to death, only get paid minimum wage and the management team is terrible. Barley get any benefits and the department is always low on staff"
bad,i used to love this place now they’re not giving out raises. they don’t care like they used to. Been trying to transfer and the process from in house employee will take forever. especially if your manager doesn’t want you to leave the department to advance in the company
bad,it was an okay job wasn't a job for me anymore I wanted more for myself  I was working hard was part-time working full-time hours  plus I didn't receive any benefits when I was there over a year
bad,Helping guest and providing great service for all promotions and gifts guest qualify for throughout the year  was fun but management was poor. Great work environment and vibe depending on shift manger
bad,"There is no diversity in hiring.  They hire people who dont know how to do their jobs.  You are treated like a number, not an employee.  No respect shown for those who do do their job. They do not pay very good salaries, especially to those that have been there."
bad,"I prefer not to review a company I currently work for. there are many pros and cons as with any company and any position. if hospitality, service, and entertainment is what you want to do this company may be good for you."
bad,"There are too many individuals in management with a quid pro quo type attitude, and favoritism runs rampant. Many departments are ran by inexperienced individuals."
bad,"Worked in security for 4 years. Never missed a day, nevver late, no write ups. The scale for your yearly review is role model, strong performer, and needs improvement. First two years, I got role model. 3rd year got strong performer. No reason given. 4th year, again never missed a day and never late, no write ups, strong performer again. I worked with people who called out multiple times and they got role model and a higher raise.( 4% as RM and 2% for SP). Management plays favorites. They don’t pay for performance. You have to kiss the managers butt to get noticed. I can’t speak for other Caesars properties, but at Philadelphia, that’s how it works and you can either deal with it or leave. I left and took my work ethic with me."
bad,"It's an ok place for a college student. Not much money or a balance in job and regular life. Great people and a fun environment, but no room for advancement."
bad,"I did mostly production design work, but really wanted to do more creative jobs. It was hard to move up in the department. The department engagement activities were fun."
bad,The pay is too low for the amount of responsibilities that are given to you. Very unorganized and no structure. Work life balance is unheard of in this position.
bad,this place does not give a flying penguin about you. they will over work and screw you over. they are on your butt about every little thing and cannot handle a confident employee.
bad,"after working with the company for 6 years, never had a raise, always worked ever single holiday without extra/double pay. constantly harassed and no management to stand up for you"
bad,Management is not honest.They have a bad attitude  They expect you to give excellent customer service but take away all tools to do so.Lack of communication between upper management and employees.Favoritism!!!!!!!
bad,i was there in the beginning they were unorganized you had to stand up all day. you couldn't go to the bathroom . when it was time for your break you had to speed walk to the break area bc they only gave you 30 mins but the break area was a 15 min walk.
bad,I feel that there could be a better work/life balance and attempts for all to restructure when jobs are eliminated and not just for a select few. The hardest part about my job is requested others to do more than what is expected all the time versus only when it is needed to help business.
bad,The managers could be better understanding that people have things to do outside of work. The pay could be better for all that you do and the scheduling could be better.
bad,"For an organization that has over 50 locations, you would think it was the first time they were opening a casino. They would set policy and within a day or two change them. After a while, no one knew which policy they were enforcing that day. Some of the supervisors would be harder on some employees than others. The hours were family friendly and then six months into the job they changed them so no one had family friendly hours."
bad,"Like most casinos overpriced, but the benefit of Harrahs is that each room comes with 2 bathrooms! His and Hers! Also their buffet is on the second to top floor so the view is great there too!"
bad,If  working for this company you need to enjoy long hours on your feet and a very fast paced industry. There are no holidays off and all weekend are mostly worked
bad,a typical day was stressful! as an employee your constantly being watched and Criticized. I have learned that its really important to have a college degree that why i started school this year. management was a bit unorganized. the hardest part was when it goy really busy and we were short staff. the most enjoyable part was getting paid every week.
bad,the job was very easy and fun but its a dog eat dog type of job there was other ppl who hated to see you rise up and did all they could do to get you out also they took there position as sup to a whole another level than needed to
bad,"The casino was poorly ran and maintained by corporate, it was ran as cheaply as possible to squeeze ever drop of profit before selling the property."
bad,The job has a diverse set of responsibilities. Overall a nice environment to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is using all the technology we have.
bad,You had to appear at work on time regardless of weather conditions family emergencies etc. Otherwise you got demerit points.
bad,The Horseshoe Casino on the weekends is crazy there isnt enough security for all the customers that are there
bad,"Handle cash register, help customers, hand out food. Some co-workers would help out if you needed it but others wouldn't. The managers treated the us unfair. But some customers could make your day because they would be so nice."
bad,"I was caught up in the Union problems, when business turned slow as the season changed I was low man so I was laid off and had to move back to Reno"
bad,Easy going no room for advancedment .Dead ead job.no need for 1 hr lunches ..work envoirment friendly but it seemed there were no people on floor to help new hies
bad,You don’t really have a life if you in the management. Hours are crazy. One day you closing the next day you opening the place. Not worth the money. You learn a lot about mass production and different kind of foods all in one place.
bad,Harrahs can be a good job. On most jobs if you do your  job and care about your work you'll be fine. This is not a given at Harrahs.In the 3.5 years I was there I've seen some good guys fired for silly reasons. I never had job security with people fired so easily.You live under constant surveillance and about 1/2 of the supervisors are cutthroat. Watch your back. Employees are great though.
bad,"Let's just say the VP of Sales didn't survive the Me Too Movement"
bad,management abuses power and they pick and choose who they do things for. Basically if you have been there for over 5 years you can get away with anything while others have to follow rules. smh. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!!!!
bad,Working weekends and holidays. Not getting requested time off. Management has a hands off mentality. The work area is smokey and loud. I did like meeting all kinds of people.
bad,It was tough. Very high paced and high stress. The management for that department was all over thd place and the employees suffered everyday because of it.
bad,"You will interact directly with customers to understand their underlying business issues and design an analytical solution to address the needs."
bad,Hours are not consistent so trying to balance work and life is not happening. No weekends off. No job security. I come home stink of cigarette smoke. Not the place for me.
bad,Ok jobHigh turnover rating. Free dry cleaning. Needs a union. Short breaks. A lot of smiling for no reason. Cool uniforms. It has a employee cafeteria
bad,Management is unsupportive.  The pay is low compared to other casinos serving positions.  Although the job is easy and the other employees are friendly.
bad,"I was working in a brand new Starbucks that opened in the Harrah's casino. It started off okay and got rocky really quickly. The pay was nice but the management was not. Things were all over the place. I gave them the benefit of the doubt due to the fact that it was a brand new opening. But after a few months, they still weren't up to par. Some days, we were unsupervised and didn't know who to call if we needed something. Scheduling was chaotic. There were days when multiple people would call off and others had to stay hours after to cover those shifts. Sometimes that wasn't a problem for me because more money. But they would let you know until an hour before your shift ended. That is so inconvenient. Tons of drama occurred too, which is not pleasant to work around. Some employees seemed to run over the managers and there was a lot of favoritism."
bad,They would ask you to work late one day and send you home early another day so you dont get overtime. Some managers abuse their position and is very confrontational. Supervisors in the poker room are very racist. The cage cashiers are. Unless you are a poker dealer your tips get taxed and put on your paycheck.
bad,"Company is constantly in a state of change. People come and go. Good experience, but long term no stability. But since its such a big company if you can find the right Department with the right people it make work out for you. Otherwise I would pass unless you are really desperate"
bad,"The coworkers are nice but the supervisors are very cliquey, and their own mood can affect how they treat you during the day just because they can. Some are helpful but many don't like it when you bother them for help and plays favorites. A couple are even rude to the customers. The company stress that they care about how the employees feel and we can file complaints again the supervisors but that's just all talk."
bad,Management doesn't care about the Front Desk. They talk a big game but do not deliver. Caring Culture? Not here. So sad. Co-workers were great though.
bad,My supervisors were great but the opportunities were limited. Never any incentives and bad hourly opportunities
bad,"horseshoe is a very busy environment people meeting new people having a good time and drinking, I learn about working there you have to be quick and friendly, the management was not so good and I didn't go to make friends but I was an excellent team player the hours were always either cut short or changing that I didn't like and their 10 point system is terrible. I meet good people and enjoyed my time down there"
bad,upper management seems to be running the company into the ground. normal eight hour day would easily go twelve hours. director requesting too much for personal gain and shows no respect.
bad,Extroverts and fun people may enjoy this workplace but the pay for managers (in Ohio) is low. The benefits package is pretty good. There is very high turnover in many departments because of an extremely high reliance on very specific rules and procedures due to the fact that is a state-regulated gambling establishment. Workers there are on camera 90% of the time. It can be fun but it takes a special kind of person to make a career out of it.
bad,"Transported employees from employee entrance to parking area. About a five minute run each way. "
bad,prepared large variety of different foods from many cultures
bad,"The position of Cage Cashier is challenging -which normally I thrive on. But upper management within the finance dept. could not have been worse. Prior to opening day the cashiers had not had any hands on computer training because there WERE no functioning training computers. We were thrown out behind the cage windows while our coaches and leaders were no where to be found. There were irate customers, many embarrassing moments when we could not find supervisors to advise us, and panicked tears among cashiers. By the time I left a year ago 120 of 160 original cashiers had been fired or left....the worst part about it was the indifference management had towards us. We needed continued training....we wanted to succeed and had been chosen to work for the casino because we had something in our personalities that expressed our love for working with the public.  It was a huge disappointment to realize our supervisors did not care about us as much as we cared about the casino customers. Our concerns were never heard. It was evident that coaches and leaders were constrained  because an unqualified person at a higher level of mgmnt was attempting to maintain complete control despite not having much of a clue of the day to day activities within the cashier cages. Very very sad and frustrating for many....especially because we had gone through in-depth background checks, hair follicle tests (drug), etc. in order to become state licensed (which we paid around $560 for!!)"
bad,"Sinking ship and each management decision smells of desperation. Good talent has been driven away, poached or simply underutilized. Lack of optimism about future prospects makes this a place you won't want to stay long, if you even end up there at all."
bad,"a typical day was a 9-5, I learned how to support multiple systems, the management was fair along with my co-workers, the hardest part of the job was working overnight, the most enjoyable part of the job was the casino environment"
bad,huge corporation that could care less about you and the time and effort you put into your job. Bend over backwards for them and after your back is broken they'll kick you when your on the ground
bad,I once thought being a table games dealer would be fun: You get to gamble with the casino's money and get paid to do it. What they don't tell you about is how easily you can get fired if you make the smallest mistake. Or how you have to deal with belligerent drunks who insist on losing money and still blame you. Or the smoke-filled room that makes your eyes and nose water all the time. Or the noise.
bad,"If u need the money, go to work here. If you value sanity? Go somewhere else. Management only cares about the numbers, nevermind if they kill you in the process.  If you are not a favorite? You can guarantee a hard shift everyday"
bad,I'm scared to give  my real opinion they may read this get me out the door. They are not fair a lot of things going on there need a full investigation.
bad,"I worked for Caesars Entertainment for many years. Staff is overworked and underpaid. Most do not start off at more than $12.00 per hour. There is a double standard starting with the Director of Security all the way down the management chain.  Females are spoken down to and disrespected both verbally and mentally. Integrity which is a core value that Caesars pushes is nowhere in sight. Expect to hear sexual talk and racial comments by management and no discipline to them. Complaints are made and turned into your fault not what the whole situation was. Backstabbing,gossip,sexual orientation discrimination is all part of the job."
bad,"High turn over. Poor management, they play favorites and don’t take care of their people. Direct manager was great but senior management is out dated and unprepared for the current economy of Reno."
bad,"My personal opinion of this company is that they are union based at my location 1st off, but paint bad pictures about the union representing you from the start, so that you won't defend yourself when mess hits the fan. So I will say the PTO and benefits are great, but this company goes through a lot of management, and there is a lack of communication along with a lot of blame placed on the wrong people."
bad,"The company culture, on its face, seems appealing.  However, upper management clearly does not care about the welfare of its corporate employees, despite repeated calls for change from its employees."
bad,"They set you on a pedestal for a little while until you become a threat to management because of your unstoppable drive.  They agree to many of your terms upon hiring then slap you with changes ""to better serve the demands of the business.""  Be prepared to be promoted and never completely trained to fulfill that opportunity.  They stress to you that you must follow the employee handbook, but it's only by discretion and at the hands of your Supervisor or Manager/Director.  You will be at fault for following the handbook.  You will have all sorts against you!  "
bad,Top down management. When they want your opinion they give it to you. They are 100% focused on financial performance. Short term thinking. Was once an exceptional company.
bad,"I loved this job for the people I worked with however, the management failed its employees due to their lack of leadership skills and inability to make good decisions. While there were several good assistant managers, it appeared that they were never able to grow above the ""good old boy"" that outranked them. Employees were bullied into doing work off the clock and salaried employees were underpaid for the work they had to perform."
bad,"I've loved my time working at the casino, but working nights, weekends and holidays takes its toll. The company has a lot of work to do in regards to how they treat their customers and employees."
bad,"I would recommend when in your probation period, do not get too friendly with anyone. Do your job and keep your mouth shut. The company says they want your suggestions, but berate you when you try to give any. My manager had a bad day, took it out on me and when I was upset told me to just go. Called my supervisor over the next 3 days and never a return call. When I showed up for my next scheduled shift I was informed that I had been terminated! One week later, after a call to HR I was informed that my check was there and to bring my uniforms in. The reason for termination was that I caused a scene in front of guests and abandoned my position. Further explanation was that I was shouting profanity and security escorted me out. In any case, being on probation they can say what they want and you have no right to tell your side. I loved this job and wanted to continue with this company, now I have no chance."
bad,When i started there its was good but a few years in they kept changing management for security and kept getting new general managers. I had 1-2 good sec managers in my 5 yrs there but most didnt care or have your back or follow the law.
bad,"The current page scale is poor for the customer industry ."
bad,The poker room not being around anymore shows how poor it was run. They put the spa manager in charge of the poker room after firing an actual poker manager and it was downhill from there.
bad,I worked at the Race and Sports Book at Paris and Bally's! Training was not the best! Didn't care for the way management allowed Employees to behave in an Unprofessional Manner!
bad,Great people to work with. Unfortunatly all about the numbers. Great Shift Manager and Director of Table Games to learn from. Fast paced enviroment.
bad,"Caesars does not have ""security"" officers...they have customer service reps. Don't be fooled, this is in no way a security job. It is a ""meet and greet"" service job. The hours are horrible (ex. 1am-9am)"
bad,"The upper management does not care about their employees.Pay is not good unless you're a ""big shot in the corporate office making the big bucks"" The upper management should treat employees better.After all its the lower men on the totem pole that's making them rich."
bad,"This company was horrible for trying to advance, and in fact the only benefit that I got from the company was time working in a resort environment. All I ever heard was that we didn't have the budget, and then hear about big Corporate bonuses."
bad,"I think that working at Horseshoe Casino, really brought the employees down. There was such a small window for advancement and the raises were very poor. Some of the supervisors that were employed were great and knew what they were doing, while others did not have a clue. I did not like the way we were treated at times, when so many were let go, and the few of us left had to cover the duties in a timely manner, and not make one mistake. Some days were easy, but then other days were stressful, and the supervisors would ask, what is taking so long, adding more stress instead of jumping in to help. It appeared that most of the supervisors were more interested in meeting quota for THEIR bonus and don't do anything to jeopardize that bonus."
bad,"In my time with Caesars, I do not believe there was a fair advantage in promotion practices. The culture is that someone will already be in mind for a position and the company will not post, therefore, never allowing for other qualified candidates to apply. Medical insurance is horrific and expensive."
bad,Schedules dont allow you to have a life.  Work is not hard just stressful.. High turnover rate. Good benefits. You get to meet alot people from different cultures
bad,"Ok place to work, but no job security and a lot of uncertainty. The management is good to work under. Not many perks, more contractors than full-time employees."
bad,Disappointed on how the leadership was. Very discriminating. if you worked more than 18hr you still had to be in on time with no sleep. Unrealistic  expectations.
bad,"This is a great place to work but “supervisors” have a tendency to abuse power, bully and block advancements. Must work and keep head down as to not stand (excel) out at all which is opposite of what they encourage. Do the job and do not do any favors or will be taken advantage of and then disciplined for not continuously being available."
bad,"I love working here. The people and culture is the best i've ever had, although the benefits for non-salary in house workers is awful. The PTO i get is no where near enough for the Holidays ive had to work, with no bonus pay for working them either. I got more PTO at a different company and that wasnt even including the holidays i got off. The medical and dental benefits are a joke, sure they are cheap but it shows why when you get the bill from your doctor/ dentist in the mail. I honestly wish i could be happy with this company, but its a joke"
bad,"I did not love working here, the casino work life is hard especially when you are on graveyard with not many options to move off of that shift.  The costumer service part of the job is fine if you enjoy talking with people and fast paced work shifts."
bad,"Working at Harrah's is not a hard job, but it is also not for everybody.  It is a very fast paced job, and a job that is high on giving customer service, as it is the key for bringing our guest back.  Depending on the department you work in, you will need to be good with counting/handling money and/or chips.  Our everybody greets everybody motto with a ""Hello,"" helps us interact with our guest and each other daily.  The company is very diversified, and most of the co-workers get along with each other.  The problem is management. This company is managed poorly, and management doesn't really take the opinions or advice from the people who work with the guest on a regular basis; to make the company better. Most new hires notice the poor management during their probation, and don't make it past it.  We have a very high turnover rate because of that.  Those who have survived there multiple years, have gotten use to management, but new hires tend to not have that patience, especially if they are young adults.  This company is a 24/7 business, and you most likely won't start with weekends off, or the shift you want, as this is a seniority base job. There are no paid holidays, and barely a 401(k).  This company will work you a lot, but the compensation(pay) is not enough for the job."
bad,banquet houseman setting up for functions.i learned that they did not care as much as we thought they did.poor management cause the manager when I was there did not know what he was doing.the culture was actually ok.the hardest part of the job was moving furniture.i enjoyed the people I worked with we kept each other sane enough to be able to there as long as we all did
bad,"love hate relationship with this job. Mostly love the staff, but everyone is using it as a stepping stone to further themselves, all for one and one for all."
bad,Its a place for growth an advancement. To better yourself an to achieve your best .You learn how to please the guest an to handle any kind of issue that may accrue.
bad,"We used beverage carts that contained liquor, beer, and serving supplies. Terribly ineffective. The management consisted of people demoted from the Horseshoe. Nobody seemed to care about the guests needs. The compensation could be substantial some nights. Others, not so much. I learned that there are people who complain about free drinks. Made for an overall hostile work environment."
bad,"My coworkers were so nice. Great opportunities, easy to move up and able to excel within the company but management sucks. they really don't care about the customers demands. They're all so fake."
bad,"In my few years with Harrahs I learned the many aspects of customer service, reservations, training, quality control, human resources, and operations."
bad,"unreliable management team, that does not stand by their word or employees, I learned not to believe everything you hear in training."
bad,"Guests are rude and impatient. Day staff tend to be clicky, 2nd shift are much more open and happy to be at work."
bad,"A good place to work for if you like working in the food and beverage industry. Of all the high-end casino/hotels in the Strip, Caesars is probably the worst, with all the bankruptcy and cut-backs they are going through. All-in-all, Caesars provided me with stable employment for 18 yrs."
bad,I didn't like housekeeping too much. There were too many rooms to do in too short of a time period. In order to thoroughly clean the rooms it took up more time than the company expects you to do it in.
bad,Too much favoritism. Not a fair place to work for. Will always be stressed and worried about losing job. The Job itself is fun and the people who work at Harrah's are mostly good people.
bad,"Great Call Center, learned exceptional typing skills, management was great to work with. Co-workers were awesome i met some great friends. The hardest part of the job was was the phones get pretty busy but all in all the day goes by pretty fast. The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a company that provides great benefits."
bad,No matter what the situation the management is only out for themselves. They don't care about their employees at all.
bad,It's a very fast-paced and fun it can be overwhelming  at times. you enjoy getting to meet your co-workers some celebrities. the most fun I had there was getting to work with my customers and getting to work with my co-workers and other co-workers in different departments and having fun and getting to talk to them
bad,Caesars didn’t push to promote workers. I feel like I was hard worker and I wasn’t appreciated on my work. Management lacked communication with the employees
bad,nice job good people union isn't so hot but its there I wish I could have stayed there longer but the recession in 08 caused a big lay off in the gaming field
bad,"Low pay, hard to advance but great hardworking staff and excellent management. Due to personal beliefs I didn't feel comfortable working for a company that promotes drinking and gambling but I needed to pay my bills."
bad,The job was OK they just needed better management. I wish more people from Vegas or Atlantic city would come to assist with management things would run smoother.
bad,"Starting this job was way too long of a process but once everything fell through it was great. Dealt with many types of guests , everyone from extremely entitled people to very nice people from out of town.Being a receptionist helped me be a great multitasker and problem solver.A typical day started out opening ,meaning,answering voicemails,getting retail products ready, printing out schedules for aestheticians and massage therapists, and dealing with our customers that are creating appointments or being checked in for one."
bad,"Harrah's is a great place to work. My experience there was excellent, my- coworkers were great, my manager was a great person very kindness. And management was excellent.i will recomande Harrah's to people, friends  and family. The hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving the guests and having fun with co- workers"
bad,The management team really needs improvement with their communication skills and how they interact with their team. You do not talk to adults as if we are less than human. No professionalism at all.
bad,I work in a very small department with no room for advancement.  If you try to move to another department you probably won't make it if you don't first 'know' the supervisors/managers of said department.  There is no money to be made here and they fight any union inquiries tooth and nail.
bad,were just a number. people were friendly. management viewed you as just a number
bad,"•	Bringing greater value to the clients by continuing innovation and by embracing new technologies and techniques"
bad,"Economy started going downhill so labor got cut back so all the chefs had to ""support"" our employees work areas to cover gaps in coverage even though the union employees complained about less hours even though they didn't realise we were covering their union jobs. (idiots)  The employees in the buffet stab each other in the back each day so they have something to talk about rather than focus on the guests. If you get caught breathing the wrong way you will get documented so watch out for this area. The paperman cometh, and that right so!"
bad,"Overall atmosphere and workplace was great. Co-workers and guests were great on the most part. Harrahs is an enjoyable company to work for except for management and human resources. Management at times were very unorganized and needed to make work cuts, which they did. Little did the workers know though, that when these cuts were being enforced, that they would trick you into not coming into your shift, saying you have the day off, just to invite you in the next day to fire you. When taking it up with HR, they said there was no proof of this being done and there was nothing they can do. Overall you need to be a tremendous suck up in order to advance in this company."
bad,"Besides bad management the job was fine. There are different teams and some are team players but the ones who don't want to work managed to keep their jobs. Like I said, Bad Management"
bad,"It an entertainment industry so have to out going, approachable, guest service very important.  It encourages adults to have fun and highly forbidden for under age to be around the casino. Management no comment!"
bad,It might be one of the worst place I have ever worked at. harassment is left and right and people always get away with it. the more you work the more they take advantage of you.
bad,"Responsible for supervising all Stewarding and EVS staff and the overall daily management of a designated shift. Supports, administers and manages operational goals and monitors achievements of performance and profit objectives"
bad,"I would clock in then start on making sure everything is stocked up in the housekeeping items and then checked if they are any rooms that need to be clean and marked available for customers. With another employee we would then get all the hotel laundry ready to be transferred. as the day went on I would tend to the customers needs and  make sure everything was cleaned in the walkways, light fixers, bathrooms and bedrooms of the hotel rooms."
bad,co workers are amazing. supervisors in my department are rude and insensitive. management over worked and some departments understaffed. Although provided with discounts for all caesars ent. is quite expensive.
bad,"For the flagship company it was OK. Salaries could be a lot more competitive for what the job is. Some managers were great. Others, not so much. Depends on the department."
bad,"As with everything, things change. When I stated the MOTO was "" A happy employee makes for a happy customer. That went out the window and it seems whatever can make us more money is best for us. Under staffed, low pay, uneducated management that doesn't want to hear or care how things are supposed to be done properly."
bad,"hardest part of the job was being on my feet almost the whole shift and not moving around much when stationed at the checkpoints, most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with willing customers"
bad,it was good in the beginning and everything changed and went down the hill. not much to say about this job. it was ok. there was nice cultural people to work with.
bad,managers at the time couldn't stick to one decision since there was a lot of managers and supervisors while one would give me more days another would erase me off but call me in during my off days.
bad,"My typical day at consist of managing 15-20 employees on a day to day basis, I have learned how to work with Microsoft Outlook and how to cost out menu items to reach a certain percentage. The hardest part of my job is when there are call offs and the most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
bad,Since it is no longer Harrah's but Caesars I cannot review. However since taking over and changing name we have filed bankruptcy and can not pay our bills
bad,You will make great money and meet new and exciting people everyday. The management style leaves ALOT to be desired. DO NOT expect to be given true information by their managers.
bad,this isnt a company id say you should go and work for Espresso wasnt a long term type of job at all theres alot going on there no respect no appreciation your job is always on the line
bad,"steady , routine. table games . dealing with customers . co workers friendly. management , interacting and dealing with guest"
bad,It was a good working experiencce. The staff was good. The atmosphere was too smoky
bad,"I learned that no matter how nice you are to people  they still will treat you however they want. I was the youngest person working in my department, and was given a hard time about it."
bad,thought slavery was banned in the 1860's! devolped back problem at ealy age!! hard to take time off for personal reasons. Punished for being sick!
bad,"I take calls 8hrs a day for room, restaurant, golf, show reservations. I also transfer calls after finding out what the issues are from the guest to make sure they go to the correct department. We always learn something new each day. My co-workers are all Great! There isn't really a hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the people I talk to acknowledge that I have done a good job in taking care of their needs."
bad,"Company has too many issue's on whats right and whats wrong. Employees are forced to take the employee survey's which is a voluntary survey, and then when they do fill out the survey's, they are not informed on how it works, and that it does not go against the higher management but effects the lower management which takes the lashing for upper management (Terminated)."
bad,"For a billion dollar corporation, Caesars Entertainment Web Development Dept, was WELL unorganized. I was just a temp, but their didn't seem to be any team work.. Everyone was out for themselves, it actually seem like they actually tried to get co-workers  in trouble? Form on person slacking on their assignments, which would hold off the whole production of the total overhaul of upgrading all the websites for all Harrah's properties. To help point out their was something really wrong, is when the the head man of the whole project, puts in his two week notice. Within the third phase of a nine phase project."
bad,It's a place I miss because of all the different types of people that come see Caesars Palace. Our lunches were paid and the health care was great the only thing I didn't like was the seniority list
bad,Great place to work at. There are a lot of benefits for the Team Members and room for advancement within the company. CO-Workers go the extra mile to help each other out. Management cares about their Team and tries to balance   work/life.
bad,"I like my job, the people I work with and the people I attend ant the restaurant.  But the income is not helping, I started at 7.25 and ending at 8.25. every other State went up. There are some problems to advance."
good,"This Job Was Really Great For A Learning Experience. Working In Different Parts Of The Casino You Learn More Than Just What You Were Hired For. Working In The Hotel Was A Great Work Experience, It's More Than Just What People Think. The Co-Workers For The Most Part Are Very Friendly And Are Willing To Help Anytime. Management Could Be A Lot More Better Than What It Is. Management Is Really Great With The Customer's, With There Employee's Not So Much. The Main Thing I Loved About This Job Was Being There So Long I Had My Regular Customer's Who Knew I Would Help Them As Much As Possible."
good,I would not recommend this employer. The Company lacks integrity as well as the management team. They do not give their employees the tools to do their job.
good,"I still work at Caesars, i was super excited because this was my first secure, payed weekly job; but now it’s very toxic and stressful. Pay is little, I wouldn’t recommend there benefits. I feel like as a cashier it’s us against the guest. I know we’re supposed to ignore side comments from the guests an make sure our customer service makes them comfortable to stay at Caesars as well as buy our merchandise but it’s stressful and supervisors and leads don’t have our back when it comes to these guests. Guests feel since they “invested” in the company by gambling they think they can talk to anyone any kind of way and I don’t respect that since we’re all people and management is not up to par."
good,If you want to get into casino gaming or entertainment it would be a good place to work at and advance.  But if you are not pursuing any of those work some where else.
good,"While the mission and ideas of Caesars Entertainment are quite alluring, Harrah's Laughlin is the ugly stepchild of the company.  The property has been around for 30 years, with many employees and management having long term tenure.  In some ways this is admirable, but many ways the culture is very archaic in its thinking and actions."
good,"Not helpful to temp personnel. Did not let me know when my final day was so I was unable to collect my belongings. Since I was temp my duties changed almost daily, and training for the new systems was offered, but never done. I was accused of lying when I said I was not trained. I was reviewed after three weeks and the first I had no access, the second I was loaned out to another department and the third I finally got into the work and was expected to know all of it. Instead of letting you know there is a problem supervisors go directly to management and you feel like you are going to the principle for discipline. The hardest part was the way the other people treated me when they knew the supervisor did not like me.There were a lot of people in other departments that were very friendly. I did meet a few people that were helpful and friendly in my department. I was sorry to leave without saying goodbye, but not sorry to leave."
good,the atmosphere is ok and fast pace but the pay is definitely not that great depending on what department you work in.they do not promote within house always outside hiring. some managers to do not give great directions.
good,"Harrah's  doesn't care about any employee, the only thing that matters - the Bottom Line. On my 20 year anniversary not one of my bosses mention it, didn't even get a form letter. With the old Caesars Palace owners I would of got a Caesars Palace diamond ring valued at $2500. What I did get was a 20% cut in pay for doing the same job. I took an early retirement  from Social Security."
good,"Variety, different every night. High volume of customer service - had to handle players that were winning, loosing, crying and drunk. Counting money and playing chips for an eight hour shift all while smiling can be fun and frustrating at times. Enjoyed my co-workers."
good,"Each day managers would complain about how much they disliked their job. Other employees would complain they entire shifts on a daily basis. Customers were rude and inappropriate at times. Advancement was promised, however nothing ever came of it. The hardest aspect was the long hours on your feet with little reward. The most enjoyable part of the job was the free employee buffet. "
good,I would like to say although I was fired for  reasons I was not  informed  . The Harrahs casino is an awesome place to visit and vaca. I enjoyed the pay and hours given. I move never before worked as a front desk agent but I enjoyed my time working with the Harrahs team.
good,The company as a whole is not a bad place to work.  Most of the people are wonderful regardless of which department they belong to.  Just some departments are not all what they seem.
good,Working at the horseshoe is a good opportunity for anybody with a chance to advance your skills & meet a lot of people from different races & culture & if u lucky you could see a star.
good,"This is a ok place to work, busy place, all types of hours and you must maintain a specific amount of hours to  maintain medical coverage, has good benefits if hours are maintained but don't get sick for to many days because 10 points and you will be wrote up and or fired"
good,running in valet at my age was best suited for the high school twenty-somethings and not for me. My mind is of much more valuable than running myself into an early grave.
good,"The job was fun! I had a opportunity to meet a lot of famous people. the cons, Management was poor. They were real hard to talk to."
good,The day is burdened with extra work above and beyond normal duties. Learned considerable amount with regards to unionized companies. Upper management at director and executive level care only about own pockets. Hardest part of job knowing that no matter how much you may care about your staff this will not be considered at higher level. Most enjoyable part of job is working with staff that ultimately really care about doing a job well.
good,"I was hired as full time and in the beginning it was great! After only a few months, our ""promised"" full time set schedules began to change drastically with sometimes only a one day heads up ( going from day shift to graveyard etc.). Customer service was a huge priority, and I strongly agree it always should be, but employee satisfaction and upbeat and positive work moral should be a goal as well!"
good,Working in housekeeping was fun because you are more behind the scenes. But you do have interactions with guest. I loved my managers they were the best.
good,work day would consist of meeting new and interesting people from around the world.
good,"I liked most of the people I worked with. I did not like how management handled differet situations that occured while I was working there. The management team handled it as professionally as the could, and alot of times they did not. Needless to say there were alot of guest complaints."
good,"Huge issue in the department, with a lack of care from management. Great job position, but no feeling of security for position due to the nature of the management team. It is a great place to get your foot in the door for the company, but I suggest moving on to a different position within Caesars as soon as possible."
good,This is a great job if you are looking for a start at the hotel industry. The store I worked in was really slow most of the time & the other store saw most of the tourist. Overall my coworkers were friendly my managing staff was sometimes messy & it took them 3 weeks to schedule my new hire orientation! Starting pay & you needed atleast 2 years with the company to move up . Overall a good first job or if you are in school.
good,"Enjoyed my time there. Very busy and high occupancy, however management is incredibly poor and favortism is a big deal there. A lot of drama and petty behavior from coworkers, and coworkers are all incredibly lazy so you have to work twice as hard."
good,"Great place to work, fun and enjoyable environment, and amazing food!! I learned how to make pizza from scratch. Hardest part was making salads, soups, and desserts when you're super super busy. Most enjoyable part my co-workers could make you laugh uncontrollably and we worked together as a team."
good,"Decline to answer. To much to say what is wrong with this place. No work life balance, cared more about the numbers then the employee, far below median income level."
good,"working there is was fun, I have a good team that I love and miss, but the management team did change a lot. before is was enjoyable to work and is became stressful..."
good,"Cool place to work if your not locking to build a career. Bad when it comes to pay and PTO. They fire over anything, but if your young and like the casino culture its a good start."
good,"Finance management team lacks experience and maturity.  Accomplishments are ignored, expectations are poorly communicated and management has crafted an environment of blame shifting."
good,"I worked front desk, checked in and out guest, answered any questions guests had. Management was decent stuck to there schedules and made sure employees were comfortable. The hardest part of my job was seeing disappointed guest who were being helped by another person. I would ask the guest if there was anything I could do to fix there problem and they explained the person they were dealing with just didn't seem to care. I ended up moving them to my computer, and helping them with their problem. I  gave them a fee upgrade for the night due to their inconveniences which was approved by management. The way the guest felt after I dealt with them is probably the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"employees were nice, the work was hard had to clean alot of rooms, on a time schedule.hours were giood pay was ok,they feed us for luch ,breaks were good ,friendly people."
good,"Great benefits but horrible management. Nobody knows what they doing. Favoritism, if you know someone you might move up otherwise its imposible, horrible hours"
good,"Have very little to say about company. Companies forget that it's the employees who makes company succeed, but that is not how we were seen...we were just a number. Working for GTE and CITIBANK we were acknowledge for our hard work and was appreciated. We were not just a number."
good,"My typical day was spent fixing self-inflicted wounds as the database (Access based) was a complete disaster.  Management had no set of priorities; everything was ""very important"" and things that we must spend time on right now, even if another project with a hard deadline was near. "
good,"A typical work day is busy, lots of inbound calls, as well as outbound. Co-workers are a pleasure to work with, very close group who makes up a well rounded team."
good,"My experience was so unfortunate here that there were several times I honestly didn't want to return to work. I felt as though I was being harassed, discriminated against to the point I left most nights frustrated, under a lot of pressure and stressed out. "
good,"	Safeguarded and saved greyhounds during races"
good,Hard to advance in the company unless you know someone.
good,"Securing assets, always providing the very best customer service, following the Alcohol and Gaming rules and guidelines. Management are for the most part unprofessional and under qualified. Not all but most. Same goes for some of my co-workers. However some are excellent at doing there job. The hardest part of my job is trying to enjoy it. Its difficult to to do something you don't enjoy. The most part I like about my job is meeting new people everyday, and knowing that I can make them smile if they are having a bad time or experience."
good,"I enjoyed the work and the other employees, I even enjoyes the physical enviornment. However there is one person that has forced themselves into leadership role that rules totally by intemidation which ruiens the plae for everyone elese."
good,"I just do not feel valued or heard."
good,Commitment and dedication essential to being successful here. Attendance policy is strictly enforced.  Within the first 90 days you’re allotted 5 points. 1/2 points for being tardy and 1 points for missing. If you reach 5 within probationary period you’re terminated. Past this you’re allowed 10 points
good,I enjoyed all of the people I worked with. If you like to work hard this is the place for you. The hours are hard if you have a family. Promotions are based on favoritism not on who really deserves it.  They put people in management positions that you have to train as your boss who have never done the job a day in their life because of who they know.
good,It can be a doggy dog world. Other than that it’s ok upper management is unapproachable not very nice at all.. It’s very easy to loose your job that’s all I have to say
good,Not the place if you have a family. It's a consuming job. The hours are not normal. Gamblers are sometimes very abusive verbally. I learned that money has no value as a dealer. Your pay is based on the tips you make.
good,"Was productive & fun place to work, but too far to travel. Gaming experience was not ideal for me. I did not like the long distant it took going back & forth to work at night."
good,Salaried employees are expected to work very long hours with poor direction from management and a lack of tools to do the job correctly. Management is never present to show the employees any care.
good,"Your pay as a casino host in Asian Marketing will be the same as a domestic's Ambassador Host.  Seniority will allow you to delegate lower senior hosts to do your bidding.  Like every other corporation, advancement is offered by favoritism.  Numbers are irrelevant as long as you're the boss' favorite, they will spoon fed you; spin and code premium players to you. I would NOT recommend working for Asian Marketing."
good,"what can i say except, the casino was sold to another company, its now called jack's. they easily got rid of alot of employees. they wanted to downsize.."
good,Has it’s up and downs. Some days were good and others were bad all depends on what was happening in the city. There were times where the floor would be dead and others were you are unable to walk on the floor. People who work here are all good people.
good,"Must be open to working late hours, weekends and holidays. No extra holiday pay and working holidays is mandatory. Working here is best for single individuals"
good,Hardest part is to get everyone on board.  The long hours does not allow you to breath.  This property need more work to be successful.  If you want a challenge try it.
good,Each department did not seem supportive of other departments and that made getting tasks done very difficult when they always included several departments to collaborate with each other.
good,The management team wasn't fair. The phrase no such thing as holidays or weekends was true. those days became blackout days and if it fell on your off day depending if you was in good you might get to keep them..
good,"A lively and exciting place Horseshoe was a bundle of activity. Sure there were slow days but most of the time was spent engaging with plenty of people making customers happy. Unfortunately, horseshoe was not much of a good workplace as workplace morale was low and  managment could not accommodate for being understaffed. While being forced to work extra hours was ok, the compensation for working extra hours wasn't beneficial and management was less understanding. In fact management didn't interact with employees too much, leaving supervisors for the shifts to teach and control employees even while they themselves were busy. Hardest thing when working with horseshoe was customer interaction as technicians couldn't do much to help customers and would b called out for overstepping their boundaries. But learning and gaining the knowledge to work and operate certain machinery was fun and exciting."
good,"At points a sluggish but also very fast paced place of employment."
good,Great health benefits and paid time off. culture of pettiness and management that can't distinguish personal and professional life. too much favoritism.
good,"A table games dealing job can be a good opportunity to receive quick training for a 40k a year job. However unfavorable clientele and spotty management can make any given day a miserable one. Opportunities to advance in the casino are given, however the pay raises aren't substantial and days off are not favorable."
good,Please the customer. Name of the game. Crazy hours. Drunk customers. On your feet the whole shift. Cover for shift when short.
good,Very happy with employment. Benefits were OK. Management on the lower levels maintained a good working relationship with employees. atmosphere was good.
good,Bad management with poor business decisions. Very little room for advancement. The hardest part of the job was staying motivated when know one appreciated your work.
good,"This job required managing employees in a number of ways which included scheduling, procedures, evaluations, and customer interactions. The other aspect of the job entailed customer interactions and satisfaction."
good,"i was hired by the executive sous chef as a graveyard steward. after he went on to bigger and better things, the exec steward who did not hire me, started messing with me by changing my ,then changed my position to banquet steward during the day and stay at night till everything was cleaned and put away. this was not what i was hired for and caused problems."
good,Not a good place for a carrier. As a table games dealer you meet a lot of different people. And you take a lot of money from people. it was really hard to work there seeing this every day for 14 years.
good,Worked the 4 am- Noon shift. Enjoyed meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was not showing any emotion when you were cursed at because they player lost.
good,A typical day at work for me would be to greet and assist our diverse clientel and respond to occurences within the facility. I was also responsible for assigning duties to fellow officers as needed. I would lias with other departments and agencies on a daily basis.
good,"Harrahs Casino St.Louis was a very exciting and fun place to work; when I first started. As a security dispatcher a typical day would consist of ,multi tasking, answering the phones,dispatching calls and officers where needed. at times calling for a ambulance,are mhpd,depending on the incident at the time.I learned how to work under stressful enviroment .My co-workers where like family,the hardest part of the job was keeping minors from trying to enter the casino,because if one got on the floor ,every employee that made contact lost their job.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing someone when a jack pot.And meeting new people all the time."
good,The benefits were good but managers and we're never on the same page from shift to shift. They were not considerate of your life outside of work. Punished for being sick or having to leave for emergencies.
good,"I have learned a lot, met a great number of great people.. unfortunately my seniority can not secure me a day shift job so I feel it may be time to move on"
good,"Harrah's is a big corporation that has a high turnover rate. Because of the high turnover rate,  you aren't super secure in any position.  You can always be replaced by someone. The pay is pretty fair, good for the area but could be better. The work/life balance is pretty rough,  especially if you have children"
good,Not a great life/work balance.  The workplace culture is not conducive to career development. Benefis are meager at best. The corp structure is not aligned with the customers.
good,Supervisorso are put under to much stress and employees seem to be doing supervisors job. All that extra but the numbers in dollars never match the job demand.
good,"This company give very small raises, between 1% to 3%. One out of 100 would get the 3% raises. "
good,Truthfully I was a young adult when I got the job at Harrah’s. At that time I was happy with the atmosphere and coworkers. As time went on both the atmosphere and employees turned to a downward spiral. Unfortunately I don’t see it returning to its former glory especially with online gambling and saturation of casinos on the area are eminent.
good,"I was paid for the hours I worked, I showed up when I was supposed to and left when I was told to, I did what management told me to do. Simple, I show up and deal poker for 8 weeks, they paid me well for doing that and now the job is over and so I move on. No one in management or anywhere else recognized anyone for their efforts, there was no opportunities after the series ended ."
good,"Stressful place to work"
good,"The job of managing the Casino Hotel front desk was difficult and challenging . First, the training for hotel check in was deficient. "
good,this is a great job for a single person or just two in the household but for a full family that needed a balance this is not for you this job can get stressful
good,A typical day working as a Special Events Representative was very different day to day. You do many different events but it is fun and exciting. You may have trying guest but as long as you stay upbeat and positive you will do just great. If you love helping people and having fun Caesars Entertainment is perfect for you!
good,"Some of the best co-workers I have ever worked with.  Always smiling, asked if you needed help.  If they couldn't help they would reach out to other departments to see if they could help you.  All worked well together as a team.  I loved that!"
good,"You better be good at what you do to work at ballys..Most employees have been there for 10+ years. Its fast and furious and fun . Theres no such thing as training so you better already know there computer system , stations in the clubs and recipes"
good,"The company has changed from the old Harrahs companies, and not for the good we lost our values and much of the culture that made it great place to work."
good,Productive workplace but stifles innovation.  work routine too repetitive.  Management limited.  Workplace culture fabricated.  Guest relations the best part of the job.
good,"Harrah's New Orleans was a pretty ""Good"" place to work when it comes to the atmosphere. I must add that the management proved to be a little less moral that I would have expected from a very large corporation."
good,the beginning was great but the further you try to advance the more people try to sabotage you. in the end you cant really trust anyone a lot of the good people end up leaving
good,the people and co workers were great to work with...management showed favoritism when it came to scheduling and time off...the environment was nice nd the working conditions were good
good,The job was enjoyable mostly in the cage. Work schedule was the hardest part to keep up with. The hours you worked always fluctuated so there was not a lot of opportunity to make plans.
good,the management sits in their office. The workers create a toxic environment. very little to no kitchen team work. all and all was one of the worst places i have worked for.
good,"Do not work Front desk! You'll have not life. "
good,"Work in and exciting and fast-paced environment.  Deal cards to guests. Show-off to get people's attention in the hope of getting them to sit down and stay/play at my table."
good,"21 years time wasted.No family time,odd hours/shifts,and extensive lack of communication between management and staff."
good,"None stop on the go type of company. I've learned how to handle all types of guest in many situations. This company keeps you on your toes, and allows you to interact with the guest. You begin to build a strong relationship with the guest, and this is what keeps them coming back.  Well this and the money they win."
good,"Management is constantly restructuring pay and downsizing the department while at the same time raising daily quotas and adding more and more work responsibilities. Work harder for less money and management is not very positive. I would say if you are looking for a sales job look elsewhere. For PTO which is paid time off they will actually use what you accumulate for holidays, so for a holiday day off with pay they take 8 hours of your PTO. So basically if you have 2 weeks PTO per year they will reduce that down to about a week after all your holiday days that they just take your PTO. Another way the big corporations take advantage of employees. Hours are great and you are home nights and weekends, best part of this job."
good,My experience with Caesars Hotel and casino has been not a very positive experience. We have great team members who work there and bring good mood and a desirable place to work in.but upper management was not that responsive.
good,Company has a lack of appreciation for employees who go above and beyond by working 6 day weeks and 10 hour days.
good,"There is very little room to utilize decision making skills so that the tasks become quite repetitive. Overall, coworkers and staff are quite pleasant and professional."
good,"I cleaned guest rooms, hallways, and elevators. I also delivered specific items such as pillows, roll out beds, refrigerators, ect."
good,"mid management is good, upper corp management is horrible . greedy, non caring , and completely blind to any type of employee satisfaction what so ever."
good,"Working at Harrahs Casino was an incredibly fun experience. But as soon as Hollywood took over things began to decline. If you have any sort of difficult conflicts such as being a college student you will have a very hard time getting fair hours. Favoritism is an issue at the Hotel Front Desk. Good Luck moving up at all in the company. You start as the night shift (4-12) you stay on this shift until someone quits or moves up. Set days off are given out by seniority or so they say but many times favoritism plays a role here as well. Also the benefits for full time are pretty expensive, but part time is even worse."
good,"The hours of standing in the same motion are hard on a persons body, plus the 20 min breaks every hour 20 are very hard."
good,"Work day was not bad"
good,"I have loved working at the hotel.i feel i have drank all the KOOL AID they wanted us to drink.alot of times,its like walking on egg shells.which is not a good enviroment,because it comes off on the customer's.Manager's today,there are some really great one's and it's sad to see that the ""NEW VEGAS"" has changed them over time."
good,"when i worked in Caesar at abbey bad moment for the economy a I cannot write a review about that time.Often staff was absent because upset of the work condition, so I had to do the work for 2!!!"
good,"I worked at Harrahs Metropolis for almost 2 years and worked in 3 different areas in the hotel. It was a great learning experience into large hotel operations...but, if you are considering trying to work your way up into management, you better hope you are in the clique, otherwise, forget it! They bounce their managers around from department to department, so you have no chance you will beat one of them out for a position. I transferred to another property, where I was offered a management position right away."
good,"It was average, to much paper work to much nonsense it was a friendly place to work when it was Ballys when Harrahs took it was a nightmare all they cared about was their pay checks not ours they stopped 401 k  they gave everybody more stress more senseless bull to make them feel important to justify their high paying jobs It was not a good place to work"
good,"Working at Harrah's was always a different situation daily. The company was bought numerous times so it was hard to find your place. I was a cashier at a coffee shop, a server at a sports bar, a room service delivery attendant, a helper in the employee dining room. My job changed a lot yet the compensation never seemed to be respectful enough for all that was expected of me. I worked with a sorts of different people from all walks of life which helped me to value diversity. The enjoyable part of the job was working with friends, what i hated about the job was that the people that could not afford to be at casino, watching them loose their livelihood in a matter of seconds. They seemed to take it out on the employees, and you were not supported by your management."
good,taking drinks order and making loops. The managment was AWFUL! I had to leave there. They didn't care about anyone. 
good,Dealt with customers and processed wagers on horse races and sporting events
good,"A typical day was like a factory. People just showing up to do their job. Once your shift got started so did the complaining. There was no trust between staff and management, lots of back biting. tons of personal vendettas.  Work place culture was you were either in or out! I personally opted out of those situations. I believe that, that's what plagues that department."
good,"At the time Horseshoe Casino was just opening at the Baltimore location, I was one of the many that started as a security ambassador. The company was great in the beginning but the culture raised safety concerns amongst all employees working  security unarmed"
good,This job is not hard physically but can he mentally draining. The worst part is having to deal with ignorant behavior directed toward you and not having a supervisory entity to uphold you. This is very frustrating and some days makes it not worth the abuse.
good,I’ve worked at worse places. Tips are ok. It’s always cold inside the casino. Edr is dirty. It’s a good place for slow steady traffic. EO list is always open
good,I had a decent time working for them until they just let me go with no explanation. They didn’t even allow me anytime to grab my stuff. I hadn’t don’t anything wrong but they walked me out of the building like some kinda criminal.
good,Decent place to work  good benefits they are expanding and getting bigger management needs to get stronger and the pay can be higher due to cost of living getting higher
good,It was a good job and a career that can take you to anyplace in the world you wanna go but its overly stressful and not everyone is cut out for the industry you must have very thick skin
good,I enjoyed my time working at Harrahs. The guests were wonderful. I was able to have two breaks during my shift. A meal was also provided.Paid time off and medical insurance a big plus.
good,"Caesars Entertainment is a great company to work for as a whole, with lots of opportunities to advance and grow as a person and as an employee. The most enjoyable part of the job is the family that I created while working there. The people I've met, the people I've truly got to know are amazing individuals, and they inspired me to be my best and show up, day in and day out to help make Caesars a better place. The hardest part of the job was the disagreements with senior leadership on how certain operations should be handled. The expectations for perfection added unnecessary stress with out clear guidelines set."
good,"It was fun at first until your supervisor give you more work then you can complete or get done in a reasonable time.  I was robbed by a few customer's and I was forced to lie,  so they terminated me and evicted me off of there property. Also the Supervisor told most of the department what happened to me but never called me.  They don't communicate or let you know things you need to know to stay safe and protect your employment."
good,It can be very frustrating when your mangers can not make up there mind and they play the blame game with one another . It's all about who likes you when it comes to getting any awards. When you speak up about an issue they take as your being negative.
good,"management needs more work, culture is horrible, lots of favoritism, career advancement is non existent, leaders are toxic people, we do so much work for less"
good,Point System is ridiculous because if you need to take your child to the doctor you will get pointed. You will receive one point off until two more months. Harrah's don't except no doctor slips at all.
good,"It's an alright place to work.  There is no recognition for a job well done.  There is a requirement to offer a credit card to callers as well as to trick them into a time share presentation, which is very uncomfortable."
good,"Fun and exciting.  Help customers during concerts is great..."
good,"Being an eletric gaming machine technician, we perform daily routine checks on machine functionality and daily performance. This job has taught me that there are different types of slot machines, learning to troubleshoot by the games,daily use of hand tools. Constant communication with co workers and management through verbal, radio and written skills. Managers respect and listen to my opinion on my needs and ideas to help the tech shop. The casino environment is energetic and fun.    "
good,I been at Horseshoe Casino for almost 4 years my job is in the cage i deal with large amount of money a day managers at Horseshoe can be very unprofessional i need to be in a professional environment
good,"There is no room for life outside of this workplace. Not a good environment. Very dark inside, no windows or clocks. But the pay is very good, it keeps people at this job."
good,Standing for long periods of time.. dealing with intoxicated people is the norm.. great place to work if you don't mind the smoking. Great pit bosses and they care about your well being..
good,A typical work day consist of meeting lots of people from all over the world. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every day. Its a fun job to have.
good,"Policy and procedure vary between departments. Inconsistent application of policy and disciplinary action if needed. Labeling actions as ""corporate"" or ""tribal"" depending on situation. Calling health insurance costs a ""hidden paycheck"" is a slap in the face to the frontline employees. Lack of competition means tight control over policies and compensation. Low wages mean high turnover."
good,Great benefits. Salary slightly above average for hospitality industry.  Aggressive HR department. Co-workers are fine but there is a toxic management style that pollutes an otherwise good workplace.
good,"Although the workplace offered me an opportunity to learn new and enhanced cooking skills, it was the management's lack of oversight that affected my decision to leave the company."
good,not a good job profession for anyone the hours are RIDICULOUS....THE managers don't support you at all. Being sick or having a family emergency does not matter
good,"There are many things I could say about working in the field I was in during my time at Caesars, but I'll keep it short and simple.  I'll even list things off."
good,"The work itself is interesting. Always something new to do. Upper management is inconsistent, out of touch and not helpful/not interested. The only way to advance is to leave to work for another casino or to threaten to leave."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers.   I worked with a variety of different ethnic backgrounds and made some life long friends.  With such a diverse group of people working for the company as a employee there was always someone around to translate or help customers with questions.
good,It was a fast paced casino. Great benefits.  Things were always changing. Went by a point system. Anything could get you points. Never knew where you were working until you get there.
good,was fun at first then it became like this weird cult thing during the beginning of the shift they forced us to play games and if you didnt play hit the ball or these weird invasive games that put you on the spot you will actually get coached and fussed at. they made us perform for them like we was auditioning for a movie like put you on the spot during panel all of the people that may have been qualified for the position was eliminated just for being shy. i mean it was positions that didnt require those skills like cleaning serving and cooking lol.when it was the horseshoe it was very unfair the management had favorites and the female managers fired girls for reasons that seemed personal .it wasnt any union when it was the horsehoe so management really trolled the servers they didnt like and if they showed any signs of a attitude they fired them .
good,"Great Customers, I worked in the Spa and loved all my quest! Management leaves alot to be desired. Management has favorites and if you dont fall in that category regardless of your job performance it can be unbearable."
good,"I enjoyed working for Caesars. I didn't like the location or management of the location. The other employees were ""cliquey"" and wasn't very open to new members of the team. Management didn't really care if employees were happy or not. Only cared about making money."
good,working at the casino was fun sometimes but the management sucked. he didn't listen to his employees who worked with and around the guests more than he did. it was like his way or the highway. but it was a good fun place to work. we get to see different things everything. working in a place where people come from all over the globe to visit. very exciting. the guests is what makes my day work fun-filled
good,Hours are not flexible. Poor management in food and beverage department. Very often short staffed. Always laying off employees more than often. Unfairly treated by upper management staffs.
good,"learned the administrative areas of being a Banquet, didn't a lot potential growth with the company . The salary was very low for the expectations the company wanted you to have."
good,"Many hours worked. Company has many positions to work."
good,They want you all here. They will ask you to work crazy hours and never change you shift. You have to wait until someone who has been there longer than you to quit or get fired just to get a different shift
good,Very stressful work enviroment with little recognition if any for achievements. Tiny raises with extra work due each week that was expected to be completed on your breaks.
good,"Caesars is a challenging place to work. The work/life balance expectations are fitting for a young professional, but are unrealistic for those who are starting a family. The company has a poor culture for recognizing hard work and lacks a moral compass."
good,"When I started this job I loved it. However, you quickly see the onion layers being peeled back. The workers here are genuinely great people and nice to a fault. On another note, the management and company does not let you advance compared to other casinos in the area. Before you get a supervisor/management position, the higher ups will fly in someone they know or hire someone they know from the area, this is why they people that has been there for years and years are stuck in the same position. If you are pt you don't have benefits, but if you're ft you get some, but they aren't as good as you may think. The pt and ft positions vary only in that, pt stops at 37 hours and ft starts at 38. So the will work the heck out of you till that last minute just to avoid giving you ft! With this casino the customer is always right, so if a customer complains on you or so says something as little as you didn't greet you, you could come under fire."
good,I was hired on as a supervisor. I and the other new supervisors were trained in various functions of the job. we were taught of customer service as well as.
good,As a dealer youre on your feet at all times standing robotically moving carefully under continuous security.you deal to ignorant customers and management talks down to you.
good,"A lot of hours, and the higher ups are hard on the managers. Not a lot of direction and mentoring for senior leaders, but hey expect a lot. The employees are great to work with. However, compensation and benefits are good."
good,My contract was terminated early as funding from job centre was cut. I learnt no new skills from this work placement. The eating area and toilets were not pleasant. The management were unfriendly and not helpful
good,Get as much training as you can then move to another casino or job they have excellent training but very poor compensation. Co workers are nice people and over worked for what there paid. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the middle management very under educated and born micro managers also company policies are vague and applied selectively. The coworkers were enjoyable good people.
good,The really wasn't a typical day because in the gambling industry anything can happen. I learned everything you could possibly learn about customer service. Management was not always supportive. Co-workers were not always team players and the hardest part of the job was balancing your work life with your personal life. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"Walking through out the casino talking to guests.  Learned that there are more ""gamblers"" in the area that I ever knew.  Coworkers were great to work with always willing to help other employees when needed. Management was not always willing to talk to the ""underdog"" other for disciplinary purposes.  Enjoyed working with the public and assisting whenever I could."
good,"The department that I worked in was not too stable there was a lot of turnover and layoffs that happen. Mainly because of poor management staff just not treating their employees right and being too involved with daily operations. The company as a whole was a good company to work for, and provided a fun an energetic atmosphere."
good,The casino is a 24 hour operation that is full of life and excitement.  I learned many things during my tenure there.  There are various card games and the pay out odds for each.  Management is helpful and do their best to make sure things run smoothly.  My co-workers are fun loving people who love enjoy the casino culture.  There really isn't anything that is too difficult at the Horseshoe.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the excitement of learning the various games of the casino and becoming competent with each.
good,"A Typical day at the Horseshoe Casino is a great day you get to meet new people. Co workers are working together to get to job done even with the lack of teaching on how to do the job from management. The hardest part of the job is working with mangers and supervisors who do not see you as a worker more like a object, they want hard workers but are not willing to work with them and treat them with respect. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with a team of people who care about you, people who are willing to look out for you."
good,You are regarded as just an employee number the company is too big and has too much going on to adequately serve its employees.
good,"As a Caesars records Coordinator you will soon find that Career advancement is rather difficult. This departmet can be rather ""clingy"" as well. You should use this department as a spring board to do something else in the company. Just know that you will have to use your connections to do so."
good,Everybody wants to be boss and no one is on he same accord everyone has a different policy in there head and what they think is right instead of following the book other then that its a okay job you just have to know who to listen too
good,"I thought that the company truly didn’t care about there employees."
good,"This is a friendly place to work, you deal with people from all walks of life so you expect a variety of expectations from everybody, sometimes you have a good day most of the time not so very good. But the show must go on,"
good,"I could really sit here and bash this employer, but I won't! There are many wonderful people working there and it is a real ""family"" environment amongst co-workers."
good,"First off this review is solely on the caesars palace guest services department/call center. I made the best choice financially to accept a position with this department. But minus the good pay and union benefits this department sucks! Management is incompetent,  the work life balance is almost non existent and the turnover rate is out of this world. As of late most new hires don't make it past a month which is sad. Then my personal con, it being a call center, can leave one feeling bored and drained from the constant verbal abuse from guests. While those are the main cons, the pros include amazing holiday pay, free meals, free show offers, and nearly free benefits which are a blessing in this day and age. "
good,"A typical day starts with what we call a buzz session where you take attendance, give information about the day ahead and up coming events. Then take inventory to insure we have enough product for the day ahead. Then organize your team to handle the days events. Next would be meetings to discuss business costs and strategies to help generate revenue and lower costs. At the end of the day you send out all communications concerning the day."
good,"They work you hard and don't pay competitively, however that gives you a lot of job security."
good,"a typical day a work is ok. could be better but the casino business is very different from any other job sector. i have learned alot while wokring here, especially within the law enforcement side. the management could be alot better. better management would reslut in so many positive things. my co-workers are very good people."
good,there's many days when work is busy and a little hard on the clerks because mostly there is only one clerk per shift. there is a lot to do for one person but we manage and once you learn a flow of things its a little better. I would be ok if the pay was a little better for the labor or more than one clerk work per shift. the fun about the job is meeting so many nice people and I really get along with all the employees. I want a better job to better my financial needs and my knowledge because the benefits they offer are not that good and I believe the management poorly organized.
good,"I enjoyed the guests, not so much the management. People will stab you in the back without hesitation"
good,"The immediate work group was great, some better than others with very few slugs. The higher up the management levels the further the disconnect from the realities of day to day maintenance and the requirements. I enjoyed the job and its varried content and the feeling of accomplishment."
good,"I really enjoy my co workers, everyone is nice and takes the time out to get to know each other and work together as a team. My only problem is that as far as job advancement is concerned the company shows a lot of favoritism towards employees who worked years for the company. Despite the qualifications a new employees may have or who is fit for the higher positions they will always pick according to who has been with the company longer."
good,I would assist players with player cards. I learned to not trust the person working beside you. Management showed my various ways to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was to find out that the person I worked beside was stealing money out of my cash drawer. The most enjoyable part of the job was having justice served and being off.
good,Working on a team was the best part about working there along with the benefits & meeting celebrities.
good,Many different cultures all rolled up in one. The staff were high maintance but upbeat.
good,"I was a ready excited to work there. It was so colorful. Pretty, loud, crazy place to work. My managers were great. And again I was also taught to focus on customer service. the hardest part of my job was just seeing again customers losing money and feeling bad. Best part was talking to the customers getting to know them."
good,Harrahs is a good company to work for but they seem to not have the same values as they once did. Managers and staffing has changed tremendously and it is bringing the company down.
good,"Worked for a very cool, open Boss! Loved the Team, just not to keen on the company and its values."
good,"It was an ok place to work, nothing special after Ceasar's took over."
good,Not a bad place to work. Most supervisors and managers professional in their job approach. Policies towards attendance and such also fair.
good,I was given a rare opportunity to enter in as a supervisor Prior to obtaining a degree). I was Given various leadership training as well as classes to meet a certain standard which I myself could really appreciate.I had some really fun times and met some really great people. I am thankful for the opportunity as it allowed me the experience and growth need to further myself in my career.
good,Hard work long days and low pay. Management was horrible. did have free meals all day and discounts. poor upper management as well. no encouragement to move up
good,Hi early was great when I first started.. the went downhill after first year..managers talk like employees like it's high school can't advance unless u know someone or our friends with them before coming in
good,Not a busy place to make enough money for tip. Poor management. I would stay cuz money is great but schedule been really bad for me. Rules always getting worse and worse plus scheduling workers are more somthing to worry about.
good,Poor management by allowing employees to not follow procedures.  I worked for the Leave of Absence department which was managed poorly.  We were understaffed and management was inconsistent with processing of LOA.
good,"While working for Harrah's I worked for several different departments. Although I had mixed experiences, I can not deny that the pay and the benefits make the job worth it in many ways. However some departments are very ill managed. The workplace cultural is not as healthy as it should be. I found that many of my coworkers were over worked, stressed, and felt that they were mistreated. I found that in many departments, dual rates and supervisors were not chosen by who was most qualified but more of who was the favorite."
good,"Managed all aspects of events, sales, menu's, clients, orders, etc.."
good,"Call volume is heavy. 90% of calls are complaints. Its difficult to address the guest concerns. You can only do so much on your end. You can put in the maintenance work orders or the housekeeping request but ultimately its up to the Engineers and housekeepers to complete the requests. As a guest service agent you are held accountable and when the other departments don't hold up their end it falls on the guest service agent. Water outages, A/C outages power outages, 3am construction start times are common occurrences in the guest rooms. Not much can be done other than empathize with the guest put in the work order. Absorb the abuse from the irate guest and offer compensation.  Call volume is extremely heavy that reaching out to management seems like an impossible feat."
good,"will work you like a rented mule and pay you as such, barely respect the employees, rampant nepotism, lack of innovation company wide."
good,"difficult to get a good position because of seniority so oncall/ steady extra positions are unstable.  interview process is long and tedious but some say its worth the benefits, only if you get offered a fulltime postion."
good,"It was a good place to work but high stress environment! With that said it was fun and interesting!!! Lots of good people to work with, long hours pay was ok."
good,"Prepare for greatly varying hours based on what you know. Players like to take shots and management doesn't often take your side. There is a great deal of favoritism. That said, the supervisors and dealers are typically good people and the players that like you will always try to brighten your day. It's a field that's not for everyone and can be as rewarding as it is mundane. It all depends on what kind of person you are. It just wasn't a life style I personally prefer as a father and husband. You are almost guaranteed to work every holiday but if you are a single individual who learns fast and has an upbeat attitude, you will do great. I personally overall have mixed feelings about my experiences with them but you may have better, who you are really makes a huge difference in you time there."
good,Caesars Palace was a stressful place of employment.  They were short on staff and were firing permanent employees while I was placed here through a staffing agency.
good,The job is busy and provides a lot of opportunities to learn skills that are practical for a corporate position. Good work-life balance. Lack of career growth opportunities-- management cares more about covering their KPIs than helping others develop.
good,"Can be a fun place to work, It does have its down falls. But for starters, I learned how to communicate a lot better with people. And it gives you  a lot more independence there than other jobs would. For example, in the store I worked in I was able to change any display when ever i wanted, rearrange certain things in the store that changed the overall look of the store. You can always find something to do."
good,Not much room for advancement.  Managers show favoritism amongst employees.   People are not promoted on knowledge and workmanship but on who is favored by manager.
good,"The money is good as a dealer, but there is much sacrifice personally and on the home life. Management is geared towards making the Stockholders happy. There are Spotlights every month which they evaluate your performance and outside secret shoppers who evaluate your performance. We must promote venues and promotions to every customer or fail the “secret “shoppers” evaluation. There will is no management continually on the floor anymore to handle situations which come up which leaves much responsibility to the already short handed staff. It’s Corporate policies and employees are just numbers and held responsible for the numbers without any backup from management."
good,"very fast pace, fun exciting and worth a try. coworker are very friendly and the leads are a blast. it has its ups and down, but the good out way the bad."
good,"Benefits were great! I enjoyed my host job very much, however when they decide they want you gone...for whatever the reason, they will find way to get you out!"
good,Not the best place to work and not the worst. It is what you make it. They have a very strict point system and it can be annoying. I don't feel as if there's much job security either
good,"My co-workers were highly motivated & intern, motivated me. I felt valued and enjoyed going to work daily. Being on-site before, during hotel renovations was a great experience.  To see the project(s) go from ideas, design, on-paper, then seeing it materialize into the visual, was an amazing process. Very self-rewarding."
good,"Being a part-time employee, you receive little to no benefits other than Total Returns credits. The management was very disorganized. Our ability to receive discounts on rooms at different properties as well as numerous shops with our employee badge was a huge plus though. The paid lunch was nice, but the provided food in the employee dining room was almost not edible. The food was always either way overcooked or way undercooked."
good,Worker schedules were sporadic and not well defined.  The dealing environment was very crowded with no shuffle machines and difficulty in certifying the dealer bank.
good,This is a good place to work if you are going to school because of the tuition  reimbursement program. There are draw backs sometimes you are required to work overtime with little to no warning.
good,Peoples jobs were threatened on a daily basis. It was not a fun place to work. There was really no chance for advancement in the position I was in. Basically I was glad to have a job.
good,"There was no fun at the place. Its all about them.. There were to many chefs telling you different things noboby is on the same page. there was no balance with your out side life, as a manger I lost a lot of my time off because we were always short handed. vacations were denied most of the time. Its crazy to think that you just lose over a hundred PTO hours."
good,A typical day was check your e-mail there was always a lot of e-mail and just go thru the routine things that had to be done.  I don't think I learned anything there.  The management was ok.  When I asked to go from graveyard to another shift I was told we don't wont you to move we like you.  The culture was different.
good,Lost benefits had to purchase out of my own pocket. Hours cut down. Expensive menu prices pushing customers away. Over staffed at times excessive training.
good,NOT really an exciting to place to work. No room in my department for growth. Management has little to no say on important decisions. I felt a lack of leadership.
good,It's not for everyone. Communication between departments is stressful and forced most of the time. Very few people in the company will encourage one another.
good,"Would love a long term employment with Caesars, however the property I was at briefly appeared to need management guidance "
good,Good place to work. Friendly environment. Good Hours.  Get paid every week. You get a lot of hours. It's always busy. Decent food. You get a free lunch.
good,Harrah's was quit challenging because it was the grand opening and there was no stability.  We went through 3 managers in six months while trying to develop a concept.  What I did learn from Harrah's was how to manage a  crew of 20 or more of women and men.
good,"For an organization that has over 50 locations, you would think it was the first time they were opening a casino.  They would set policy and within a day or two change them.  After a while, no one knew which policy they were enforcing that day.  Some of the supervisors would be harder on some employees than others.  The hours were family friendly and then six months into the job they changed them so no one had family friendly hours."
good,"Harrah's casino offers a professional working environment however does have a few faults, specifically in opportunity for advancement as well as an acceptable living wage."
good,Management does not really listen to employee suggestions. They do not pay well compared to amount of work that is needed from you.
good,"A typical day at work depends on where you are scheduled "
good,"On a typical day, I supervise up to 6 table games with 8 dealers.  I open table and make sure all table have the correct amount of chips.  I welcome customers to the tables, approve cash buy-ins, make sure CTR and MTL logs are accurate. I make sure dealers are complying with procedures and protect the company assets.  I document and/or coach when there is a discrepancy in procedure.  I have to have knowledge of multiple payouts and approve such payouts.  I interact with customers and help my team have a productive day."
good,Loved working at Caesars for the most part.  Worked with some terrific people and loved my actual job requirements.  Great benefits and some home life consideration.
good,The casino environment requires anyone working for them a lot of commitment. The casino was a good employer and did their best to try and work with people to help balance work and family.
good,Greeting the customers as they enter the casino and parking their cars. when they ready to leave the casino I will bring they vehicle back to them.
good,"Everyday is consider a typical day at work when dealing with the players,co-workers, and upper managements. I find that this is the hardest and difficult task of this job environment. The most enjoyable moment of the job is to bring joy and happiness to others at work."
good,Transporting goods and delivering thru out the casino. Checking for goods when being deliver to warehouse.
good,"It is the type of business where money talks loudly.  However, that doesn't fall into the non-management employees salaries or benefits."
good,Fast paced family friendly place to work. I learned how to effectively communicate with customers as well as co-workers. Management works with you to assure that you reach you goals. Hardest part of what I experienced was readjusting to new managers and supervisors. Most enjoyable for me was the interaction with my customers.
good,Was very nice place to work.  People were friendly.  Clean work place.
good,Company is so far in debt.  Going to sleep at night not knowing if we will get a 30day to closure letter is not comforting.
good,Interact with a variety of departments and diverse employees.
good,"A typical day at work was first seeing how many games were going and were there any special things I should know ex. did anyone call in sick, do we have enough staff for the potential volume of customers etc. what I learned about managemant is that I am very much more suitable to be one than to not be one, if that makes sense. The co-workers are the same everywhere, people are people, if you are fair with them they will respect you, respect the job, and most likely perform better. The exact opposite being true if you are unfair. If you apply yourself things are simple and become routine. I liked interacting with the patrons who were the players but poker players are a queer bunch, and I found myself wanting to leave the gambling world and chart undiscovered [ by me ] territory"
good,Managers easily blames staff of the wrong doing instead of working with the staff. Lack of communication.
good,Job was eliminated and outsourced.   Went to a different department where itnwasn improperly managed.   Loved my co-worker but the supervisors and managers only had their own backs. Always understaffed and was not able to get proper breaks.
good,A better than average place to work with almost all training provided. No advanced education needed but does help to advance to management position and better than average salary starting out.
good,working for harrahs has boosted my experience in hotel operation. this employer has also helped me mature and become a little more aware of conversation content due to the fluctuation in the age level.
good,Worked in this industry for close to 17yrs. I have had the opportunity to learn some great managment skills. Your co-workers are the best part.
good,"The Front Desk at Caesars Palace is a crazy, fun place to work. Agents (being union) have more power than Supervisors. Guest demands are outrageous - you won't believe the requests or complaints, but that is part of the fun. If you get in, enjoy it."
good,The Department overall is small comparitively to the work capacity placed on it. The women are very experienced in what they do especially the VP.
good,"A typical day at Harrah's is a ball of emotions. One minute you can be laughing and the next minute a customer can make you mad. The casino industry can be very rewarding if you have a thick skin and no family. You lose all holidays and maybe subject to overtime without notice.  I learned how to ignore people while working there.  The good part about Harrah's is the benefits, they are great!!"
good,"Coctail Server on Casino Floor"
good,Fast paced with spots of fun and many engaging employees. Staff challenges made the days long. The employees that were most engaged made it worth while.
good,"There is plenty of energy and excitement each day. That being said there is zero guidance. Which in some ways can be comforting believing that you are trusted, yet when you need someone they are not there. Management is new and for the most part in over their head. The coworkers are fun and helpful. When your on the floor you build relationships in all departments and learn who you can rely on. You must be social, light hearted, energetic, fun, and positive at all times.You are there to give the guest a positive experience. There are many hard working individuals that are not being noticed. I suppose it will come with time, so hopefully change goes into effect."
good,"World-class restaurants serving lunch, dinner and a late night offering with live entertainment."
good,Overall Harrah's was a good place to work; however some of the inner workings of the company do not correspond to the overall goals as spelled out in their mission statement.
good,Greeted guests and attended to their needs
good,"i learned about customer service, and work orders, i worked as a security guard then became a bus greeter"
good,Since Working there I've learned that there is a lot of none trained management and supervisor through  this whole I'm department a lot of favoritism doing 15 rooms daily. Some supervisors are there just to pick on you and use their power trip and the night shift manager goes in all the check outs taking all the tips and nobody say anything if you do they will replace you
good,Good Benefits. Department does not offer flexible hours. Management does not give enough recommendations. Pay is good after you get full time but it takes forever to get full time.
good,"great place to work for many years.  quality of work life changed as number of properties in brand increased.  competition from many surrounding areas forced critical cuts in service and quality.  "
good,"they do not listen to staff when in the wrong! they only gave casual hours contract and send you home after 1.5hrs."
good,"Management is horrible at the Ione, Ca location. No one seems to know what they’re suppose to be doing. Managers are more concerned about themselves than their empolyees."
good,"First off if you are part time YOU GET NO BENEFITS. Full time workers get everything paid time off sick time etc, but you have to put in years. Full time is hard to come by at Harrah’s, you mainly start off part rime then work your way up. I started off as a CSR which was only a weekend job...the pay was $10 which was really no money . I then went to cage cashier . The good thing with that was automatic tips ...they tip so good but you have t split it with every one in the department so sometimes it leaves you with about $80 extra for part time people ...if that! The pay there was $11 an hour. But the environment was so fast paced and fun and friendly....it was my favorite job til this day"
good,"people talk about you, regardless....unless you're part of the in crowd, you are alone. It was very difficult to keep up with the ever changing rules, depending on who was there that day."
good,Welcomes you with any culture and system. They loves there stuffs. It could be great if they match with payments. It's very under payment jobs for most departments.
good,"Good Company, depends on the department on promotions. Usually have to transfer to another department to be promoted. Great benefit, discountss and perks, but stress level too high and work/life Balance too low to enjoy them."
good,"The General Manager is very involved in all areas of the operations of the arena.  To be fair , I have to mention that this is the first time Caesars Entertainment took on management of a Convention Center.  So I am sure there are a lot of adaptions to be made to the practices of running a casino that don't fit in the operations of a City owned convention center.  I was retained in the take over from Aramark , one of the few that stayed on, because of my knowledge of the Concession operations.  In fact I actually was the only employee with the knowledge of all equipment functions and uses, from grills, ovens, coolers, freezers, beer taps, cash registers and signage ie: menu boards . I trained all food and beverage managers and supervisors how to program, use, and maintain  all equipment."
good,I have no comments about Horseshoe casino I’m no longer there! Was very ok while it lasted.  Move to another job . The hours and days were just too much.
good,"It was a lot of drama and sneaky things going on in the casino. Managers weren’t so nice and professional. The employees are very rude and childish, the establishment is bad."
good,The company is currently trying to make changes and I hope it works out for them because they do have many great employees that deserve a better work environment. They provided good health benefits but the work/life balance and ability to disconnect are nonexistence.
good,"Good place too work. I always had a good time coming in working with my peers, the management team is awesome they help in and anyway they can, the food and the edr was sometimes good but overall it was a good place too work."
good,Company is doing interesting things in marketing and analytics but all for the purpose of getting customers to spend more time gambling. It can be a really fun company but you have to love gambling/gaming - not much else to it.
good,I loved working here just a lot of foolishness goes on wishing the workplace. The Pay was cool although the company tried their best to get some of it. You get to meet all types of cool people which is a plus.
good,"I worked for Horseshoe Casino for 13 1/2 years. Was promoted 4 times. I worked in the Casino Cage Dept. for 11 1/2 years, my position was terminated, so I transferred to the Finance Dept. That job also was terminated after 2 years that I was there. Some of my positions while there were, Supervisor, Shift Manager, Assistant Cage Manager and Finance Trainer/Coordinator. It was a stressful job trying to keep customers and employees happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know a lot of good people ( customers and employees)."
good,Have been with Horseshoe Casino for almost 12 years. Typical Corporate operation. No opportunities for long range goals if you aspire to obtain advancements.
good,The pay for what I did was pretty good but management was not sufficient at times and rude. Employees were great but some where quite drama centered. Can be a great opportunity if your in a executive level
good,"As being an employee there, i felt like i was beneath and unappreciated. Some of the other workers were fair, but for the most part it wasn't my cup of tea in general."
good,"Harrah's is a fast paced environment and for that reason you have the opportunity to learn a lot if you are open to doing more than your job. If the pay is great will depend on what you do, what you expect, who you know."
good,I guess it’s was a ok place to work they often give too many rooms in the to do sometimes you don’t even get a break and sometimes you leave a 1:00 if there no work and they live to fire people
good,"The atmosphere was great, seeing different costumers every week. The Director would come through High Five is employees and supervisors. That was a change of pace for me. Same job as before ,didn’t really learn anything new. Costumer service is a must."
good,"A very nice place to work."
good,interaction w/ guest. gaming industry. interaction with all staff and tribal members. fast paced. Had to hustle for your tips. Time management important
good,Typical large corporation. No worse or better than any other. They promote and encourage being average. Saving money is more important than making money.
good,nice and easy to serve our patrons/guests;  job responsibility is learnable; strict compliance in cash handling is highly practiced; rules and regulations are highly followed; co-cashiers are approachable...teamwork; doors are for suggestions and sort of complain/s;  management is balance.
good,"Great pay & benefits.  However, corporation is undergoing a lot of changes.  It may be a great place to work again in 3 - 5 years when the dust settles, but for now, headquarters is in turmoil and morale is low in some areas."
good,"Very traditional culture, some very smart people but there's a lot of difference in opinions between the newer members and the old school way of thinking."
good,"PEP Rallies before each shift, union environment, fun staff.  Shift changes occur often, days off generally in the middle of the week or Sunday and Monday.  Inexpensive meals."
good,Wonderful benefits package and a great place for advancement. A lot of opportunity for cross training and skill development. I was at this job for three years and it was fun.
good,A typical day at work was interesting. I learned communication skills. the management was ok. The workplace was ok. The hardest part of the job was on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,Everything about this company and other Caeser's properties are all the same. Sometimes good sometimes bad. Just like any other place you have to take the good and the bad. Overall Caesers is a halfway good company to work for.
good,I was fortunate enough to find this job so that I didn't have to work two jobs while attending college. It has treated me well over all. I was able to learn many skills and the benefits are about the best you can find.
good,"There are so many things that they need. Like they need sick days, better pay, more management, to keep people more informed, and to really care about their employees in stead of saying that they do and there actions showing different."
good,"Liked working with the employees.  The supervisors are very unfair"
good,Definitely not a bad place to work. There are advancement opportunities all the time because the turnover rate is so high. They offer a good benefits package. The attendance policy works on a no fault point system which kind of sucks. In the department I worked in it was almost impossible to get time off granted so I could go see my kids. If overtime is required you will be forced to do it unless you have a doctors referral saying you can't. Company provides food for employees during their shift and they also have an onsite gym and wellness center. My biggest problem was the double standards. I absolutely hated how they would say one thing and do another.
good,"Horseshoe Baltimore provided an excellent work experience dealing with all kinds of different people. My interaction, presentation, and customer service skills improved because of my time working at Horseshoe. I also learned a great deal about management. A typical day at work is usually very exciting because of the clientele that comes in. I love greeting guests and not only making them feel welcome and special but also willing to come back to valet. My management overall was adequate. I think they did their best to make sure that I was treated with respect while giving me my orders. Most of the co-workers that I had while I've been working here were great to work with because of the chemistry and similar goals. The hardest part of the job was in the event I was inconvenienced with less staff to help me and a lot of work to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to give guests smiles on their faces knowing that I did my job well."
good,Co- workers were great. A job is what you make it. This job consist on managing 7 properties on Las Vegas Strip and can be stressful at times. What I learned at this organization is what to do and what not to do when I am in a leadership role.
good,"I am a hard worker, but this company will work you to the bone and spread you super thin - assigning you multiple properties, yet not compensating you for the aditional workload.  They say they promote a job/work life balance, but if you are in management,don't count on it!"
good,"provided guest service and knowledge of the game of poker to the beginner"
good,"Enjoyed working with my coworkers. I met new people everyday and provided great customer service skills, while preparing beverages. The best part of the job was being able to make quick money."
good,"They are known to hire too many for a position.  After a few months or so, they layoff."
good,"A typical day at work is doing the best you can for people who outnumber you. I have learned that in the culinary industry, you give more than you receive. Management is a gamble. The hardest part of the job is doing things that are not in the job description, but doing what is necessary to show passion for the career. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I have a purpose when I wake up in the morning."
good,My time at the Horseshoe gave me valuable customer service skills that will be beneficial in my next endeavor. I had the best co-workers ever! The management was cold and abrasive. Hardest part of the job was not having supervisory support in tough situations with customers. The most enjoyable part was seeing deserving people win money!!
good,stocking linen room was no problem. Management problems occur ach and every day. communication is a problem with management
good,"typical day at work is clocking in, listening to events for the evening, getting assigned table to be dealt. getting straight to work."
good,"Lots of moving around, lifting, twisting, bending over. Most of the other workers dont speak english which makes it hard to communicate at times."
good,"Checking the information we have on CMS is updated and complies with Title 31 regulation. "
good,"I was a bartender. If you work in the hot spots of the casino, you made money. I guess it depends on what you're idea of real money is. I worked in the diamond lounge and the base pay was high but the tip percentage was low because we pooled tips with all the other employees in the lounge. The people I worked with were fun, but the job could be very stressful and a lot of the stress was unnecessary."
good,"a typical day at work would be to get your cart together and get to work asap so you do not get behind, this is a very fast paced job and very tiring, what made it enjoyable was some of the co workers there. I think i would have enjoyed the company more if i were in a different position."
good,"I enjoy my job because I am able to organize my work and work at my own pace. Over the years I have learned tolerance when dealing with the public who are sometimes irritated due to losing money while gambling. Management is always on site and available when needed. My co-workers are very good at jumping in in an emergency and helping out, as well as being team players. Physically, this job can be demanding but at the end of the day I do feel a sense of accomplishment, especially when supervisors notice and comment on a job well done."
good,The most experienced and helpful people work at Caesars. I am honored to work with such knowledgeable eployee's
good,"Provided service to guest arriving from the shuttles, provided vouchers for the guest to play in the casino."
good,Great position within the region.  Was able to book and work with the top talent agencies and bands in the country.  Very demanding but worth it.
good,"i have worked in managment for 6 years, managing over 100 employees. Some of my skils include training, developmnet knowledge of FMLA/PLOA, Timeworks, REED, and union knowledge."
good,A very repetitive job with a lot of demands.  Management does not care about their employees as they would like you to believe.
good,"On a daily basis, I worked hard to bring groups into the casino.   Motor coach groups were very important to our business and we had to be creative and competitive in our offerings to this group.   "
good,"Not a bad place to start, but definitely a stepping stone. Room for growth is limited. "
good,The clientele is always interesting and the job is hard work but enjoyable.
good,An averge day at work starts out very busy Working at harrahs taught me how to be a better supervisor when t came to doing disiplinary paper work. And learning how to keep the casino floor fully stocked. The management team was always changing it needed to be more stable. My co-workers were the best. The hardest part of the job was trying to make people happy when they are losing money. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"Difficult trying to balance work vs family life since it is a business based on 24/7 hours, and they are open every day of the year."
good,"My typical day at work was to pray god so no one went home without a job, because everyone in the company was your boss and they can say whatever to get you fired, but the ppl i worked with was amazing."
good,Hardest part of the job is doing more with less.
good,Gained a lot of operational experience
good,Great people to work with and the people that play there are amazing as well.
good,"I think harrahs is a good place to work. Coworkers are friendly and helpful to one another. they have great rewards for employees. I do think that there can be better management and more trainin when it come to do certain things, but over all a good company. I also thikn the compensation could be higher"
good,"Good pay for the job, dealt with lots of drunk people, which can be funny sometimes but most of the time it was kind of annoying. Most of the hourly people were good to work with."
good,"They talked about a family culture, but they were far from it.Again the same negative energy and smoke wreak havok to your health and well-being. Did I mention the smoke?"
good,"The hardest part of this job was dealing with the public each night. When customers were winning, they were tipping and everyone was happy. When certain customers were losing, they can be rude and really make your night miserable."
good,Current situation in limbo with no information as to direction.  Been waiting over six weeks answers to the current situation.  Have been waiting for too long
good,"Good workers and bad get treated the same. A rumor got me fired I walked 6 miles a night cleaning and that got me "
good,It was ok the first six months and after that my co workers started ducking off leaving all the work to me for me and I got tired of people asking where is everybody else at y yu working by yourself so I quit I got tired of over working myself and I tried but for the life of me I couldn't get along with our lead it was the way he talk to you...
good,"They make you feel like family and they do can if your going through personal problems. Its just hard getting good hours when your last in seniority. The food is good, the pay couldve been better and everyone works as a team."
good,"The casino business is like no other business. It is loud, smoky, and the night life atmosphere is crazy. You have to be a multi-tasker, very energetic, and strong."
good,"Fellow employees are nice, management is good.  Hardest part of the job is the second-hand smoke.  Most enjoyable part of the job is helping the clients."
good,"Overall good experience , bad pay, long hours, working long nights mostly overnights all weekends all holidays not a very good job for family events in lifestyle."
good,Fast paced friendly environment that makes every employee feel valued and will help motivate them to want to come to work every day. Benefits and decent pay as well.
good,It is a very stressful job with the upper management that has unrealistic expectations and are very demanding. All departments have needs that they think are more important than anyone else.
good,"I've worked in multiple positions over the seven years I've been with the company. I'd say the Accounting and Finance roles are good fits, especially if you're a fresh college grad looking to get solid experience with a large corporation."
good,Always busy and never a dull moment. Managment was not so great but with the diverse ethnicities made the job a fun place to work.The hardest part was keeping the lines down but I was an excellent agent and a great asset so I helped manage the lines.
good,Great place to work and the owners have your best interest in mind. Its a good starting place for a career. Gave me the strengths that I needed to succeed.
good,I have grown and learned a lot during my years with the property. Nothing is like the casino life. My department is amazing and I love who I work with.
good,"Foot observation of the casino and hotel floor area"
good,"great chance for advancement"
good,"i enjoyed my time at harrahs."
good,"People work together.  great atmosphere.  Worked there for 6 years.  Only issue is shift work.  I am trying to get a permanent day shift with weekends off, to spend with my family."
good,"There is much to learn through the Caesars Entertainment Corp. There are so many different areas and departments to explore. You get to enjoy the EDR so you don't have to worry about what you're going to eat while there, and you have the opportunity to meet many different people from different backgrounds and walks of life."
good,"They provided many services, but lacked in inter-departmental communication. In fairness, this was just before the bankruptcy.  I hear much has improved and they are, again, focusing on guest services."
good,"Worked hard, long hours, management at the time was not very supportive.  That was a long time ago and much could have changed since then.  I have nothing further to add."
good,Horseshoe Casino has some exciting features. Management was not as engaged in employee issues as it could have been. casino was not willing to work with employees schedules.  treated some employees differently then others in a negative way.  employees were involved in fun activities to celebrate different holidays.
good,"Exchange paper currency for playing chips. Ensures that wagers are placed before cards are dealt. Computes payable odds to pay winning bets and collects losing bets. Inspect cards to ensure compliance with gaming standards. Dealt Black Jack, Baccarat, Roulette, & Poker"
good,It's good company to work for...I worked here a long time changing management a lot of changes took place such as free food versus now paying...Christmas bonus versus no bonus...Free turkey or ham for Christmas & Thanksgiving versus norhing.
good,My personal experience was that this company does offer a lot of training and learning opportunities. It is a great place to work for those that are just getting into the work field.
good,"Great team to work with. It was never really what you knew, but who you knew would get you job advancement opportunities. Without some sort of college degree, you will find it difficult to be promoted"
good,Caesars Entertainment was ok to work for until the new management took over.  New management was unprofessional and unfortunately the amazing management we had before ended up leaving.
good,"A typical day was stocking for most of the day and being behind the register. I learned a lot from there, handling money especially counting it all out at the end of the shift, learning how to speak to customers and stocking items and clothing in an orderly fashion. The most enjoyable and also hardest were the customers. You just never know what kind of person will pop in and if they will be respectful."
good,Working at Harrah's provides you with the skill set of dealing with the public. Very organized and professional. Hours were long. A lot of standing and overtime
good,Working for Caesars was an interesting experience.  It was a new industry to the Cleveland area.  Everyone had to learn together including the guests.  It was exciting to be a part of the initial renaissance of the downtown area.
good,"I really don;t want to comment on this at all. I enjoyed my time there and made good friends and family  and ill leave it at that. Its  fine if you want something temporary but long term. its political and its who you know , not what you know. No appreciation for unless your in the right cliche"
good,Gets busy on weekends.  Learned abouit players personalities.  Upper management don't show up on the casino floor.  Hardest part of the job when the computers breaks down and the players are drunk and misbehaving.   The most enjoyable part of the job is when players are happy and having a good time.
good,"Was able to learn what I desire and don't desire in my career. I believe upper management is treated very well and those lower on the totem pole are not, but this is typical of any large organization"
good,"hardest part about the job is not having the right equipment..... the work place culture was great....advance to lead position in just (6) months....,"
good,"Fun place, nice people, very busy  high pace, stressful for some peolpe ,like a family at times , job stublity, lots of family work there , together 11"
good,"They want a minimum number of people to do the job of a lot of people, and they just keep increasing the workload. We used to be able to help each other as needed now you have to jump through hoops to help someone."
good,"I worked at Caesars so long ago, that I couldn't possibly imagine how my review would even matter.  It's been so long that there are restaurants that were open then, aren't even there any more."
good,"Its a alright place to work for. Just need more money. Its something new everyday. Guest come more in the summer so u are always bisyIts a alright place to work at to"
good,"It is filled with entertainment amongst guest and employees."
good,"It's an okay place to work. Good people, good wage, room for advancement. Union is a low point, so many strikes for now reason. Could be better could be worse."
good,Decent company with nice pay and benefits.  It boils down to most places of employment. It's a matter of if you like the type of work you do and have a good boss.  I've had jobs that I like and jobs that I don't.
good,"I worked very hard and my bosses do not care what do , I trained employees and I do not get credit for what I do, I worked everyday, I go to worked on time, moreover there is no one in my department, that have a up beat positive attitude than I, I am always smile with my customers, from day one until now."
good,"Good place to work. Great co-workers, descent benefits....once you hit your deductible. Every job has its moments and not every job is perfect but is definitely a good place to work."
good,The hardest part of the job was making all of the beds in the rooms and getting out on time.  Some rooms had double beds and we were paid by the room.  The presidential suites was like cleaning an apartment.
good,Caesars is a good company to work for. As a team member you have the opportunity to grow within the company and move around geographically. Senior leadership is constantly looking for growth with covers and finances.
good,Worked as cocktail waitress. Workplace culture was very fun. There was not any challenges faced there. I enjoyed going to work daily. Very fun. Got to mingle with a lot of customers and offer the best customer service possible.
good,"If you love poker, you'll probably like the job.  However, hours can be very long because you are only assigned a start time and breaks can be few and far between."
good,"Great people to work with, but the company will do what they need to do for the company even if it means sacrificing the employees. Alot of micromanagement."
good,showing and just going through the motions. Eight dice was to many for a craps game. Their opinion was was yours. took care of all their favorites. Parking to catch the shuttle. Meeting the players.
good,"my day at work consisted of watching 200 monitors a day and protecting casino assets.."
good,:Productive and fun work place. Pay was horrendous and managers didnt care about employees.  Thirty minute breaks. Food is decent. Casino filled with drunk people and smoke.
good,"Managers hold grudges and the demeanor has gotten stricter as various departments within the wide berth of the call center eat each other whole with demands. Management tries to keep a cheerful tone with various fun days and dress downs, but overall it's set dressing despite low employee morale. Often they seem aloof of what's going on and refuse to admit to fault on their behalf. Lower supervisor counts are laid back but falter under pressure. Feels like it's a chain of yelling that goes down to the front line employees."
good,"Exciting place to work and great people to work with. You are expected to be on your toes your entire shift, from customer service to providing medical assistance."
good,"Casino can be fun, busy and entertaining. A typical day at work consist of handling the day to day operations of the cage and count department. It is nice to see employees and guest having fun!"
good,A typical day at work is coming in and finding 3 or 4 applications or updates on your desk. I have learned not to let anyone get under your skin at work.
good,"I was there for the opening of this casino and it was very busy at first. We had to figure everything out on our own and create a staple image on the bottle service in Baltimore. It was very difficult because we had no bussers and on top of that we had to pour and serve the entire bottle. It started to get very slow and because of the area no one could afford bottle service, they just came to the casino to try to win money they didn't have."
good,"Typical work day was working from 10:00 - 8:00.  Job included pulling reports and building ticket profiles.  The workplace was a great, fun place to work!"
good,you make your job fun it how you look at same. all management it about how make you make the look bad or good so it up to you how much fun you put in to your work
good,Got to enjoy some of the food at events and some of the shows.  It was nice to have flexible hours while going to school full time. Liked the fact of having a personal trainer st the employee fitness center.
good,"Building employee relations was the best part of the job."
good,"Very strict to following guidelines and rules,  attendance was very mandatory.   Tips plus hourly wage about 22 hr.   Good job but Bnsf was one of best in country until my train came apart and I was injured."
good,"Was unable to trust the management as a front desk agent. I learned how to handle a quick and busy environment. The hardest part was learning the computer program for the front desk. There was little to, no encouragement to succeed from the shift supervisors. The most enjoyable part was the fast pace and exciting events at the casino."
good,Poor culture and very little support from certain leaders which made the working environment very difficult at times. Culture is a very important ingredient in the success of any brand.
good,"Caesar's Entertainment Regional Accounting Department was not equally yoked, bias and forth coming prejudice if not of an Asian decent. I can only speak from while being an Employee 2007-08."
good,"it's a break-in house with little concern for the employees, supervisors are rude and undertrained, management is only concerned about their bonuses, and every single person this the table games dept complains all night about their jobs."
good,This was a good place to work if you are interested in improving your customer service related skills as you will need them a lot when working with people who like to gamble.
good,Caesars was a big company to work for. A lot of new things to learn. Company structure could be changed a lot to increase efficiency. Very stressful working with guests who always come to complain.
good,On regular basis dealing with problem solving guest issues.  Its always a new issues to solve which keeps things interesting.  Best part is the people I work with they keep it fun and everything running smoothly.
good,It is too difficult to work night shifts because I am unable to sleep during the day. It is too tiring to work the night shifts. I would prefer working a day shift if possible.
good,"•	Provided unrivaled customer service in a Bar Porter role within a high-volume setting; duties included mixing and serving alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages per patron specifications"
good,it was an alright job but not much of a career it was like the military in my experience all the bad people stay and anyone worth keeping find better jobs there is a few exceptions to that though.
good,Different event every other week downtown of New Orleans. There's always something new going on. Great for young and upcoming dealers. Management is a little poor. Pay usually have its moment
good,"The A/P Department was good to work with in the beginning.  But they brought in new department heads that changed the flow and dynamics of the department.  they also OUTSOURCED a lot of jobs, so there was no such thing as job security anymore."
good,Down to business. As with any casino environment is can be harsh and strict. you must sacrifice livelihood for the business. Must be proficient in math if your are going to work on the casino floor.
good,"In this specific department of Caesars casino you are responsible in booking reservations, shows, tournaments, and providing assistance to the VIP hosts."
good,I was transitioning from one city to another and it was the first offer I got. Not my preference and especially working in the cigarette smoke is not my thing...
good,"Security and asset protection including monies transfers, ejections of undesirable patrons and providing customer service to both internal and external guests."
good,"The hardest part of this job is the hours.....very hard to get a weekend or holiday off.  And, at times, you have too deal with difficult guests and players."
good,employee are expected to absorb the work of multiple properties an without increases in salary or other incentives. hard work is not rewarded or appreciated
good,I learned from the employees that are working there. They treat there customers like family. Makes you never want to leave. A  fun filled day/night entertainment.
good,"Harrah’s was fun until they sold, then thing started to get out sourced and they started cutting corners. At that point I returned to the Isle of Capri Casino in Lula MS were I am now."
good,"Very unorganized. Takes a long time to get things done. Big footprint in Vegas so many properties to choose from, but all not so good.  Older property and stuck in their ways with older management. Irritating when nobody can give you a simple answer when you need an upper level response."
good,"The industry was dying and never turned a profit the three years I was working there. The turnover rate was immense, and the entire financial planning and analysis department had been relocated by the time I left the company."
good,"Job was ok. there are several pros and cons to working for the company.  The pros outweigh the cons, but seriously need a management overhaul. Operations training is key"
good,"Needs better management lots of turnover and stressful place to work.   The co-workers were great and all other employees very nice."
good,"Very laid back work environment, great co-workers.  Really enjoyed the manager I worked for, very professional and very knowledgeable. Great incentives for customer service goals."

good,"Fair employer with strong goal oriented views and policies.  Top 50 employer."
good,"This company, especially the Horseshoe casino can be stressful but at the same time enjoyable. You can meet some very interesting people and can build a great relationship with the guest."
good,Over all the working environment can be stressful but however if you like the customer interaction then this is a good place to work. Be mind full though this company can be very strict.
good,"i was well trained for my job and was provided with help when needed, they worked with me when i needed off for appointments or emergencies.Most everyone was friendly."
good,"fun place to work, friendly environment. i met a lot of fun and friendly people at Harrahs. i do miss my customers and my co workers. the only reason i lost my job was a misunderstanding on the point system for call ins."
good,"Harrah's is an ok place to work, but you have to be on your best behavior or you will be documented for it. It used to be a great place to work, but over the years that all slowly changed as new management took over the property. I learned a great deal over the years there. The hardest part of my job was trying to stay awake at night. I worked the graveyard shift, and it wasn't easy. The most enjoyable part about my job was my co-workers. We were a very close family."
good,"Good company to start your career.  Free meals, ok benefits.  Need to improve benefits ..culinary workers get better benefits.  Offices too far from everything."
good,The workplace culture is fine.  The atmosphere is a bit different from a typical workplace as corporate people work in the same building as the union employees since this is a hotel casino.  There is a lack of communication at time with disseminating information from management to the employees.  Company offers free lunch in their employees in the employee dining room.
good,"Ensured high level of customer satisfaction by providing accurate and prompt financial services.  Managed a window in the boat’s bank, handling up to $125,000 each day.  "
good,i work her for about 2 years and at first i thought it was great but i saw how people acted to one another and is was ugly. i got out as soon as i could . casino bring out the worst in people.
good,Working in the kitchen you have to make sure you are food safety certified. Harrah's does a good job certifying and making sure everyone is aware of the food safety guidelines.
good,The amount of work depends on the day and the event that is going on. It also depends on the position you are put for the day. Most of the time you just stand around and watch everything.
good,Though the work was strenuous. It was the other employees that made it worth working there. The management team in our department had their hands tied by the higher ups so it made our jobs extremely difficult.
good,Work culture is great.. A lot of internal conflict. Great benefits. A lot of room for growth. Most enjoyable part of the job was co workers. Management is not qualified.
good,"Anyone who works in Adult Gaming must realize that it is a 24/7, 365 day company.  You will forfeit major holidays and be prepared to be on your feet the majority of the time you are working."
good,"it was an ok place to work i got a chance to meet many people who were not from the city of new orleans, i enjoyed wirking with my team and the management was good"
good,"Environment was fun because of the co-workers. Management was always the most considerate at time. It has been some time since I was there, so I can only speak on past events. The guests definitely affected the experience as well."
good,It was an overall good learning experience. I met many great people and learned many things about the casino and security.
good,"Fun environment that just needed more stability. Now that it is under new management, I am sure it is a much better company."
good,It was a decent enough place the work is not too hard but not necessarily easy either. It can be taxing but the people you work with make it worth it in the end.
good,I ready enjoy my job and what I have learned working for this company. I had move up to become an dual rate supervisor and the supervisors there are very caring and helping you learn the job duties.
good,I there is no room for advancement. All in all it is a good company to work for. There is satisfaction For the work that we do there
good,"This was a quite job.  We were monitoring employees exchanging full money cans to empty ones.  This is done in the very early morning hours."
good,I enjoy the many different interactions with customers on a daily basis. In this position every shift will include interacting with a wide range of ethnically diverse people.
good,"a typical day for me was clocking in and filling the par sheet,afterwards I delivered desserts to the steakhouse and started my prep work for the following day.I enjoyed working with my coworkers although we did different jobs within the same working space.Some of the management team sucked but they were very instrumental in delivering great service."
good,You can never get any time off and would hardly ever promote within the company. They expected you to work sick unless you were in the hospital.  Hard to get your breaks.
good,"Caesars Entertainment Corporation, is an American gaming corporation based in Paradise, Nevada that owns and operates over 50 casinos and hotels, and seven golf courses under several brands. It is the fourth-largest gaming company in the world,[3] with annual revenues of $8.6 billion (2013). Caesars is a public company, majority-owned by a group of private equity firms led by Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital."
good,Every day is something new always learning about games with management coworkers are very well inform. Making sure the dealers and players are very happy. And really they are one of the best to work for.
good,Hardest part is the boredom. Standing for 8 hour shifts.  Most enjoyable part was meeting and helping people. Everyday was a learning experience. The management was very understanding and helpful with the needs of the employees.
good,There are many opportunities to advance within the company but no so much at the New Orleans Property. You really have to be friends with the right people to go far at this property.
good,"Easy going place my first job while in high school.Learned alot there about time management and responsibility,great place to work surrounded by good people"
good,"Very fast paced fun environment. It was very hard to change from the graveyard shift to days. I worked there for two years, and was STILL not eligible to move shifts."
good,"If your excited about a fast pace work environnement, Late nights hours, and enjoy being around all types of people . . . .  sure this job is for you"
good,I enjoy working for this company because they believe in promotion within and looking for hard working employees. Everyone is friendly and looks out for each other.  Department heads lend a hand when it is needed and are not afraid of helping out.

good,"management is really poor, but the job itself is really easy and fun. and salary is not bad either, benefits is good, co workers are fun to work with"
good,Dealt with the night audit procedures and handled any guest issues that arose during the shift.  Enjoyed working with coworkers and trying to solve problems with guests.
good,Guests are mostly regulars since this isn't a destination Casino. Management and co-workers are you make it. The facility is non smoking which is fantastic for you health.
good,"Good place to work with a lots of benefits, they have total return program for their employees, and employees on line store, free meals, employees discount at the gift shop and especial events and sale for the employees."
good,Very nice casino in northwest indiana.  The hotel and food outlets are amazing.  The casino itself needs to be updated decoratively
good,Overall average casino with an amazing hotel and food outlets.  However the casino itself needs to be updated decoratively.
good,"The systems LEM and CMS are 40 years old and waaay out of date. One training room hadn't been cleaned in weeks. And it was freezing cold. People eat in the reservations phone area at their desks. No one has their own desk/monitor. There is only ONE monitor per desk and many programs to run. Constant switching. You must apologize for other people's mistakes. You must be on the ""pet"" list a fav of the super to get OT or a shift you want. They are not spending to fix much of anything that needs repair."
good,I would come in and get the hostess stand ready for the buffet to open up. i.e make sure there were silverware and my seating chart
good,Nice getting to know all the patrons and staff. We had some regulars that we looked for who graced us with their presence everyday. worked as a team to get things done.
good,"Horseshoe Casino Cleveland is for some people not for all because of its schedule/salary. It seems to be the departments with better schedules are a lower paygrade. Where if you have a higher pay than the schedules a not good if you have a family. Very nontraditional work hours. 4am-noon, noon-8pm and 8pm-4am. Your shift is set however different start time within a 2 hour time frame. After receiving vacation hours its hard to get time off approved. Almost everyone works weekends and all holidays due to the nature of business. If you have a family that depends on you this may not be the place for you. All shifts a bidded on and you are going to start off at the back. The pay is good and the benefits are as well however that because almost all non management employees are working for mostly tips. So you earn your keep around there. Everyone is nice and friendly."
good,I have learned a great deal about the Ticketmaster Archtics system.  The majority of what I have learned has been self-taught.  I love to learn new systems.
good,"Nice customer services"
good,"Casino was not as big. Employees were able to form a more personal relationship with the customers.  "
good,"enjoyable department, great coworkers!  learned a lot during my time there about the gaming industry. Would recommend working back of the house."
good,"Had a great time working for Caesars, Management team was great,pay was great, balance between work and home was perfect."
good,I did the job that was required of me.  I did't dislike the job.  I learned how to do the job and did it.  I do not wish to speak ill towards any job nor is it necessary to talk about the persons inwhich I have worked with.
good,"Very data intensive work. Not exactly exciting, but if you enjoy working with data/database marketing then this would be your dream job."
good,The benefits are excellent and family coverage is affordable. 401k and tuition reimbursement is a plus to being employed by Harrahs.
good,I have worked with this company for 8 years and I'm interested in moving into a different industry with better opportunities.
good,Threw out my 17 years of employment with Harrah's I really enjoy working with a lot of people. I learn a lot of games. And the hardest part of being employed with Harrah's is the day we found out we were closing and the day we actually close.
good,"A typical day at work consists of speaking to guests and helping them with any questions or concerns they might have. I have learned how to navigate through the casino wide system to be able to provide extra services to guests, such as being able to look up offers, print cards, change account information, print food vouchers, write up promotional chips, and sell their reward credits for free play. I am also able to speak to guests about our Total Rewards visa, and all the benefits that come with the card. My co workers are amazing and we have so much fun when we are all together, guests would always see that and would want to join in on the fun! The hardest part of my job would be having to work with guests who are upset about certain situations, but we would always get it worked out. The most enjoyable part of my position would be the themed events, being able to dress up and have a good time."
good,"It was a nice mix to be able to supervise some days and deal others. I was given training on standing floor and the procedures dealing with the computer system ect but never got to actually stand floor, they had me sit box every day. A portion of the dealers had no respect for me."
good,It was a nice place to work. I learned a lot from them and for that I'm grateful for the experience. I learn how to create new recipes or improve them. I have nothing bad to say about my co-workers other than sometimes people will disagree. the hardest part of the job was seeing people not giving more effort.
good,"Working in the restaurant gave me good foundation of knowledge within the food service industry."
good,"Middle management is good, upper management can be inconsistent in their strategy.  Very little in terms of career growth and development."
good,Great job for starting out in the gambling business. The gambling industry has changed. Cesars Entertainment is the leader in gaming with properties found across the United States. The company provides great opprotunities to move to different areas of the company if you are interested.
good,"After loading my work on to my computer in the morning I begin planning my calls.  Calls are based on Players actual play and value to the casino.  Once I have qualified them for the visit and complimentary flight I begin calling guests.  The package I am promoting is a complimentary flight and room for predesignated days at our outlying casinos.  While the package is complimentary the cost to fly is $30.00 per person called an experience fee.  This requires a credit card number be given with each booking.  The credit card at the end is a challenge at times but can be overcome."
good,The casino is great in appearance but working there doesn't match the base rate due to the fact that a portion goes to the Indians.
good,"I worked graveyards. Oversaw great co-employees with wonderful sense of team work. Very customer service oriented, though the casino seemed to be closing after the first of the year."
good,I enjoyed working with the public and my co-workers. It was nice to work where you meet customers from different places'
good,"Heavy guest interaction paying out jackpots, correcting situations on the floor with machines or other guests.  Staffing/scheduling daily. Positive coaching for subordinates."
good,"Typical day at Harrahs is preparing work task for my crew,to make sure casino is clean for our guest. Great team of employees i supervise."
good,Assisted customers with beverage and special food requests to provide each customer with an enjoyable dining experience. Working in a fast-paced environments while maintaining a pleasant customer experience.
good,Harrah's Gulf Coast has some of the greatest and most loyal employees.And I'd have to say the most enjoyable thing was the people I worked with.
good,"Customer Service driven, engaging and never dull. customer service can be challenging as well as rewarding. Always energetic with each day offering something a little different from the day before. Most challenging part of my job is trying to create a decent work/personal life balance."
good,Worked the dining room. Co workers were good to work with. The hardest part of the job was working the grave shift. Was a challenge dealing with the customers that came off the gaming floor. Met  a lot of different people from different countries.
good,"The company is having some growing pains but has no where to go but up. Management seems to want to make positive changes, but only time will tell."
good,Good company to work for.  Very good in database marketing with a great emphasis in loyalty marketing. A lot of old-timers leaves little room for mobility for new employees.
good,"long hours, no breaks. decent salary rate. looking for more secure environment."
good,"face paced atmosphere.Customer service based.very smokey,cigars,cigarettes,ect. must be able to deal with all types of people in differerent situations.Your co workers really make your job fun and enjoyable. the hardest part of your job is when people lose their money and take it out on you."
good,"I worked in security for more than three years, and even though I was promised advancement opportunities, I only made it up one level despite my efforts. The coworkers were great, and if it was just that I would have never dreaded going into work. However, the upper management is out of touch and though they claim they listen to everyone, their actions say differently. Many of the new rules and policies they came up with would limit us instead of keep us safe or protected. The benefits were awesome. but when you get in trouble for doing what you're supposed to be doing and have people above you not doing their job but getting away with it, it almost doesn't make any of it worth it."
good,"A typical day at work at the Horseshoe is not being prepared for the current work load. It is either over predicted or under predicted of how many guest will being coming to the casino. When the restaurants get overwhelmed with guest, business goes down hill."
good,"Co-workers with great work-ethic. High energy, fun work environment."
good,"Good job, I have improved my math skills overall while working here. Great Coworkers"
good,every day is different . It is an exciting atmosphere. Co-workers are fun and help you when needed. Talking with regular patrons and getting the chance to meet new ones every night is fun. The hardest part is not having enough time to spend with family away from work and getting to be with them on some holidays.
good,"I loved working there, the customers and the fellow employees always made it fun being at work. After a year though management changed and due to professionalism towards me and a few customers, i was forced to find new work."
good,"when i worked there i wasnt assigned to a particular restaurant, some days i work as a runner at the coffee shop some days at the buffett an even one time as a busser at an italian restaurant."
good,"-playing/dealing games to adults"
good,"The hardest part of the job is the inconsistency. Almost all your income comes from tips, so each day you brought home a different amount. To receive a good day of tips is by the luck of the draw on where your rotation begins. In one year we changed schedules four times and changed our hours scheduled three times."
good,Positive Company with opportunities for advancement for the right candidate with the right combination of attitude and experience.
good,Extremely fast paced work place that requires each employee to deliver A plus customer service at all times and offer fun and excitement to the guests.
good,"Worked 7-4 and fixed problems"
good,Sewing kids clothing and stocking. learned that I was not cut out to work in a production type environment.
good,The job itself isn't hard. Love being around a lot of people. Always great to have a good convo with guest.
good,I am passionate and driven to provide guest and customer relations that are hard to find!
good,A few bad apples never spoil it for the entire bunch! The environment is only as enthusiastic as it's employees and this is where you'll find enthusiastic people!
good,"A typical day at work consists of briefing at the top of the first work hour, then onto the floor to begin guest interaction, during the shift several employee escorts and funds drops will be accomplished, you will be given two 30 minute breaks per shift.  "
good,this is a great job you get to meet new people and experience a great world of cosmetics
good,Typical gaming corp.  Usage of a flexible-full time position as a bridge between part-time and full-time gives them an edge in keeping employees.
good,Good for entry level needs.  Tried hard to advance but no opportunities.
good,customers were great. management was very informative . Most days were fun. Doing everything possible to save a life and it not work. The fun we would have at ralleys.
good,its a good job that allows you to see and experience how the casino functions. And you get to work and assist other departments in the casino. You interact with the public all the time due to you being the first person they see coming in and throughout their stay at the casino.
good,The start of the day reading emails then going to the casino floor. Scheduling employees evaluating employees and overseeing their daily work schedule. My co-workers some were helpful some wasn't. I work well with everyone. The hardest part of the job was some of the people over us didn't know the aspect of the job. My cashiers and guest was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Could have better advancement opportunities. Better organized supervisory staff.
good,"I learned a lot about at Harrah's, The  job taught me how to WOW my customers."
good,a verry fun place to work. the only problem it the manger don`t talk to eacher.
good,A typical day at work is very fun and enjoyable. I love making a rapport with my guests. I learned everything that I know about tables games from Horseshoe. The management was a hard part of the job to deal with. Horseshoe has so incentive for moving up into a pitboss position which make no desire to do so. They are also hiring supervisor that are learning games on the spot which gives the dealers nobody to put their faith into besides themselves. I love all of my co-workers. The dealers are amazing and everybody else in the casino. The hardest part of the job is being able to trust your supervisors when you have more game knowledge than them. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the guests and creating a rapport.
good,Typical work environment. Management allows PM to perform without micormanagment
good,It was a good place to work but you couldn't question anything and they didn't care about family issues and if you had family emergencies and had to miss a day. Most coworkers like any place are great to work with but those few who are the ladder climbers would throw you under the bus.
good,A typical day at work is very busy and fun!  What I learned from Harrah's is outstanding customer service skills and how to multi-task on very busy days.  Management is professional and always willing to help their subordinates.  Co-workers are very enthusiastic and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was check-ins from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.  It is a quick paced work environment and no room for error.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people from around the world who were coming to have a good time at the casino.
good,"When I first started working there, everyone was really warm and friendly, and it seemed like everyone had your back and wanted you to succeed. It used to feel like a TEAM. In recent times, though, it seems like that has really changed. The supervisors are never on the same page. The only way to move in my department is out the door. The atmosphere is as different as night and day from when I was hired. Back then, you felt that everyone was looking out for you and was ready to back you up. I miss those days. I won't say that I dislike everything about the job, because that simply isn't true. I've made some awesome friends, I bring home a decent paycheck, and it's really fast-paced. I just wish we could go back to the good old days."
good,"Company is good for entry level employees, it is a great place to start your career and learn from industry professionals. Best company in the gaming industry to work for."
good,"A typical day at work is busy, I learned a lot of accounting skills, I like my Controller and my co-workers were helpful and amazing people to work with. With Team work their is really nothing hard on doing our job. The most enjoyable one when I received a recognition for my hard work."
good,Fun place to work. Job was very enjoyable but management was awful. A lot of drama in the work place.
good,This company cares most about the bottom line. Employee needs came a distant 2nd. The lower level execs are good to work with & co-workers make a fun place to work. Fair salary & comp benefits.
good,work at this company help me to get more experience and to learn diffrents ways to work
good,Poker is part of table games and the dealerss do not keep their own tokes
good,Learned alot of different things at this job I withheld and moved on to doing three different positions inside of the casino. As well as cashier in the different resturants to being in guest rooms restocking their fridge and working in room service
good,dual rate supervisor of table games. Dealer and supervisor. Handled the duties of both at times.
good,"Great company to work for if you're looking for growth and development. Many opportunities to promote and/or relocate. It's a very exciting industry, with opportunity to work with all types of people. At the management level expectations are very high, which is great, but the hours required for success do not allow for a good work/life balance."
good,It was a temporary position that I have had in between my career positions.
good,Harrah's Hotel was a fun casino to work for. i worked in the party pit where i met lots of people.
good,"A typical day consist of making sure there is enough coverage for all of the work areas, constant monitoring of the restrooms and all of the casino. Other duties include make sure that workers have ample supplies and make sure that everyone is going to and from break on time. Overall making sure that the customers are satisfied."
good,love working at the property hope they hire me again company is the best .
good,was fun but did not pay either. was good learning experience. best part about it was being able to move around and learn more.
good,I enjoy fast paced environments and this was one and the pay was better than most jobs.
good,"- most enjoyable part of the jobs is usually helping customers, specially the disabled people."
good,Learned Audit and IT skills over a span of 21 years.
good,"ALL I can say is the place that never stops. I was a cage cashier I handled over 500,000 a night, I worked in high limits so I got the chance to meet alot of famous people which was very fun."
good,"Very fast pace, customer service was very high. Didnt like having to cut my hair but the job was fun."
good,Caesars Palace and Caesars Entertainment was an enjoyable place to work with career advancement opportunities.
good,great place to visit but with any company you have to abide by the rules.
good,"time work there was nice, very energitic place to work, they offer help to united way"
good,Good work environment and friendly people. Enjoyed the job and working with the guests. Immediate supervision was wonderful. Other members of the management team not so much. Would consider working there again.
good,The position was fun and full of interaction with guests. A professional team that was fun and diverse to work with.  The computer LMS system is all coded and made it difficult for me to learn. Very Complex and training didn't cover alot of it. The expectations were too high check in times with all the questions the guests need answered.
good,"Fellow employees were great. Its a union job but at this location the servers from day one will not retire allowing next generation to come in.So there is really no way to make money. At buzz they gamble off stations and  if you are low you immediately have the worst same section. And most senior are immediately in tables, there is no rotation which is odd because its union.And you will also be mandated to stay hours past your shift due to server incompetence and favortism which is incredibly wrong going by rules of the road and due to it being a union job.Their hours are 6 hr shifts if you stay a reg hour shift."
good,"Been a contract employee twice and both times pay was great. The direction and focus of management lacks substantially. The Caesar's way is to throw $ and resources at the problem rather than performing a review of how to do it more efficiently. With that, it's a whirlwind, pay is great but you never know when you'll be cut loose. The CEO just walked away with bank, and the financial stability is quite concerning."
good,i was ok you learn evey day i count the money every day i took the money out the slot machine i secure the machine i took it down stars and count the money in the valt
good,Strong customer service culture that thrives the company thru its' service.  Great customer care is emphasized.  Fairly good work relationship between management and employees.
good,It is very quick-paced and stressful position. If you can not multitask and be time conscious then I would not recommend working here. You will be dealing with a high demand for customers needs. I repeat you NEED to move fast!
good,"For my department, there is some training for entry-level.  None whatsoever for consecutive promotional bids.  Management is hit or miss.  The best supervisors are good, the worst are abysmal.  Constantly short of supplies to carry out tasks."
good,"Depending on where you work with in the company will change your responsibilities, workload, and job security. Depending on the time of day you work will also change the type of environment you work in. Mid day and night being the most stressful times to work depending on the day of the week or what events are happening during that day. It can be relaxed at times but again depends on the time of day and year."
good,My experience at Harrah’s was a very pleasant one. One of the things I appreciated the most was the fact that we had employee parties and received quarterly bonuses
good,B- they want people with no opinions. It is very micro-managed. They don't want your opinion or input. Every decision has to go through higher management.
good,"good work life balance"
good,The Gift shop was a dead end job. Very hard  to move to another job. Pay is low and few full time positions. It was fun working with others in the gift shop and the guest where great too.
good,I actually loved working for this company. They have amazing healthcare benefits and along the way I met some awesome people. I developed great customer service and communicating skills while working there.
good,"Ability to make lots of money if you are a dealer.  The rules and regulations are very strict and this can be a stressful job due to the constant time constraints and requirements.  You sometime feel like your life is not your own due to mandatory meetings, revised work hours and off days that can be changed at any time."
good,"Workplace is always busy, the staff is friendly and I had great relations with my team. "
good,"1. The training process was alright. I was trained to do transactions differently by each person that trained me which was confusing."
good,People were fun to work with - the atmosphere is fairly laid back. Management can be overzealous with requests to employees with little/no experience. Not the most organized company.
good,"I have mixed feelings on this establishment, staff that do not hold a managerial position are wonderful. However I found that this establishment was poorly run and is in crucial need of new management. I often found I was working on week to week as management continuously failed to provide a rota that covered at least a week or provide a rota that gave you enough to plan your private around your work life."
good,"This was a great property. With changes in the senior leadership, some trust was lost for this Company's decision making process that brings these leaders in."
good,A typical day is performing audit functions. My knowledge of auditing has increase. I have a working relationship with management. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I have the opportunity to work with others to solve problems. I also enjoy giving back to my community by participating in different events.
good,"They went through some rough times due to managerial changes, but seem to have things on the right track.  Solid team work atmosphere and friendly coworkers."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my customers.  My customers are what made me happy during my time at Horseshoe Tunica.  Knowing that they completely appreciated my devotion to them and hearing daily compliments made my day happier.
good,"I enjoyed the job itself, dealt with other casinos all over the country and bankers to update credit for customers, enjoyed speaking with customers on a daily basis"
good,"Previous leadership has been pretty good but current leadership lacks care and desire to create a positive atmosphere. Company tries to reward employees but due to the large size, unable to fairly do so.  Very fast-paced, ""always on"", environment since the casino is open 24 hours."
good,"Keeping employees happy and motivated is not a priority for management. I will only see manager on average once a week. They do not micromanage which is a pro of course. Work and task are not challenging, job responsibilities feel more like data entry work and not accounting work. I receive hundreds of company wide emails a day and 2% of them are useful, but then there's a huge lack of communication from management. Most days are relaxed but on stressful days it is extremely stressful. Most of the time they become a stressful week. On those stressful days you are not thanked by management for the great work done. Never considered advancing because of the lack of training. After a couple of years being employed here I still do not feel equipped with the skills required to advance. Most people I've seen advance have acquired their skills with a prior employer."
good,"Great work environment , co-workers are very nice and helpful . Job requires a lot of effort and maintaining keeping up. No slackers and lots of energetic people"
good,Make sure to understand everything you are getting yourself into. Great company but work load can be more than you are asking for. Depending on your position it could take over your life. Pay should be more for the location that you live in.
good,It is nice that I get to do my job freely and I was trusted.  Typical place you get paid dealing with the public. Good benefits though and they are somewhat organized.
good,this has been my favorite job i learned a lot from here and i loved my job...sadly they let me go and for this i kind of hate them and which to too them go down.
good,"I worked with this company for a few years and was happy for the most part. Compensation is decent. Near the end i had disagreements with new management that was brought in, so i had to part ways."
good,High turn over rate is the one thing I noticed as I started with 3 techs within a few weeks all three were moving on to another firm with job offers. I am in that situation now as there is not a good structure at this firm in the IT department.
good,"I would say between all the management and higher up positions , there are to many in charge and to many making to much.  Business structure is poor, to many managers , most of the management is new and does not do much work and sits in back , those making minimum who are worked heavily , have chance for advancement but are not promoted , instead others of no experience get position and don't work because are trained poorly , putting more work on good employees who have been there the longest and work the hardest.  Overnight hours are tough on the body, and enviromenr is toxic to work in ,  company benefits are among the best I have seen , employee parking area is ridiculous , hotel is ran like a casino and not like a hotel should be of hospitality nature , company main people are friends and family of each other , and promote by who walks shoulder to shoulder with others , company is not for me but is for others"
good,"Harrahs is a great place to work, is fun every time when I got there it was like  other  life to me, I learn a lot from been a cook all the way to assistant chef, The hardest part was management, and the enjoyable part was been a part of a great team on swing."
good,"Easy job. Pretty strict with the small details. The employee dining room could be better, always saying they are going to improve it but never did. Always filling out surveys every couple months and required to do online training every couple months also."
good,"Lots of changes in the past decade, but still a good company. Good opportunities for education and transfer. Fast paced atmosphere."
good,The biggest problem with this place is it's all on who you know with advancement. Other than that wasn't a bad place to work
good,It takes time to get integrated into the community of coworkers and a lot of shady things happen behind the scenes working in the gaming industry. Slightly difficult to advance in the job or switch to a different department without previously already knowing someone.
good,"Overall it is a great place to start your career, but long term it just doesn't pay well enough or provide enough opportunities for growth."
good,"Extremely fun work place!! Overall enjoyable job yet.., despite management being old immature and revenge driven.."
good,I have an excellent team that I work with and immediate supervisors are excellent. Immediate management team look out for their workers. Chances for advancement and department change is high and fair.
good,"As a Security Officer I help enforce Caesar's mission which is, inspiring grown ups to play, I've learned the importance of continuously being upbeat and positive in the workplace, while management leads by example which I appreciate.  The crew of Security Officers sincerely make a team as getting great reviews comes from team work.  The hardest part of the job is minor which is walking and standing for 7.5 hours and only being allowed one 30 minute break throughout each day, but the most enjoyable part about my job is the customers embracing our friendliness."
good,"Harrah's Laughlin would be an ideal place to work if their concerns and efforts were placed more on employees. I found the right mix of culture and personalities in Harrah's, where everyone greets everyone regardless of position or ranking. Management really needs to be reevaluated as the Director of Finance is very negative and condescending due to lack of experience and education."
good,Working in the Gaming industry was a new world coming from more of a manufacturing background. being part of the marine crew we were a necessary evil to the upper management but most people that I worked with are really good people.
good,After working there a few months I have noticed that everyone does not follow the company moto
good,can be a fun place to work. Some training but not a lot. You meet a lot of interesting people. There isn't a lot of job security though since it is a high regulated industry
good,Grateful and thankful for all the experience working in this company.
good,"Security starts at the market rate for the position for the area (with no experience), but the tasks and duties required for the position far exceed the compensation. Especially compared to the same position at other properties, and other departments within the company."
good,"•	Responsible for the coordination and execution of all entertainment offerings in accordance with regulatory approvals."
good,I was the graveyard supervisor. I developed tracking system to insure all food and beverage outlets were clean. II also developed a system of accountability to the graveyard shift so if there was any items that needed to be addressed I had a transparent accountability model to answer all questions.
good,"OK benefits."
good,"Casino life can be fun and exciting.  There is a friendly and outgoing staff here.  However,  coworkers tend to be pitted against one another by managements overwhelming favoritism.  Even if you come here with years of casino or management experience from your previous jobs,  don't expect to find any opportunity for advancement unless you are a college student, or still a young person in your twenties. "
good,"Fast paced, some days slow.  Met new and interesting people on a daily basis.  The hardest part of this job was dealing with intoxicated guests."
good,"Every single role at Thistledown is different. No one has the same day and work varies a lot. I was a VIP Hospitality host, so most of my work was planning and helping with VIP parties, giving food comps to guests (if they met the criteria to earn one, which we had to learn how to calculate), dealing with free play/mail, and answering a lot of questions on our promotions, the way free play works, the way the card works, why someone isnt receiving mailings anymore, or why their offers have decreased, etc. Mainly, we are called when a guest has an issue or problem and do our best to fix it. Kind of like a smiling punching bag (since most guests whose play has been reduced are furious, or if they are denied a comp they are usually insulted), but trying to get the guest to leave happy."
good,"Everyone seems to think that dealing at a casino is a fun and easy job to do, but dealing is anything but fun and easy most of the time.  After dealing for over 7 years, I have learned that dealing is very stressful and challenging to perform, especially late at night.  When the customers did win, the job was typically more fun because everyone was in a good mood; however, the job became stressful when I would run out of a denomination of casino currency that everyone was playing with, and the supervisor was unable to or did not want to order a fill.  Most people did not color up until it was absolutely necessary to do so.  Unfortunately, in most cases, the customers would lose when they played, and sometimes they lost a lot of money when their luck was terrible.  It was when people lost that they would say some mean and hateful things.  Sometimes they would still say mean and hateful things even when they won because they had lost so many times in the past.  Swearing (by both men and women) was fairly common, and some men even used physical aggression (i.e. slamming a fist into the table or throwing their cards in disgust).  I disliked that management did little or nothing to make the guests stop any inappropriate behavior, but I understood why.  I enjoyed working with the other dealers, and they were some of the best co-workers you could ever ask to work with.  While it was nice to get paid for all of my breaks, I would have liked the breaks to last a little longer than 20 minutes apiece.  I learned the importance of ethical behavior as a casino employee, and I strongly encouraged"
good,Department not very proactive. Property in AC hurt by economy.
good,"Delivering drinks quickly with an upbeat and positive attitude is a day in the life of a beverage server at the Horseshoe Casino Cleveland. The department was not very well run. Supervisors were never on the same page when it came to rules, leading to team members being confused as to what was expected of them. Management hardly ever came out of their office so they were not aware of the problems we were having with stocking and employee interactions. When suggestions were brought to them, they were either ignored, or told that they didn't have to work there if they didn't like it. I thoroughly enjoyed taking care of casino guests and making their time at the casino unforgettable, but having to navigate around all the back-of-house issues made it hard to do."
good,"I check guests in and out every day, address guest complaints or questions or requests. I learned how to listen to guests with empathy, resolve issues, computer skills. Supervisors were helpful and co workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is when you've felt you've done all you could for a guest, but they are still unhappy with you. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you develop with coworkers and guests."
good,During my time at the Casino I noticed it was more of a good old boy system. Who ever had the most to tell the manager got the most out of their time. Fun atmosphere but not for a career fit. Great for 2nd job. 
good,The management here definately subscribes to furthering its own culture. You have to drink the Kool Aid to get along. Advancement seems difficult.
good,"If you would like to learn about casino management, this is the place to go. However, there are concerns with future business, as they do not have a presence in Asia."
good,"Cashed out casino customers, management and employees were ok to work with, hardest part was the overnight shift, most enjoyable was the co workers i worked with"
good,Very busy pace of work volume. Great employess to work with.
good,Friendly atmosphere with limited opportunity to advance. Upper Management shows little appreciation to those hard workers.
good,"The manager in my dept. is outstanding, she is fair and consistent. The corporation as a whole ties the hands of managers in some cases making it very difficult to remove bad employees, making it hard for good employees to remain employed there. The hardest part of the job was watching people take advantage of the company. I have learned that I cannot change anyone's work ethic and had to move on. Customer service is a really big part of this job and for the most part, I loved waiting on people that truly appreciated my help."
good,Cleaned rooms and other work areas so that health standards were met.
good,The job is okay. Pay not so great for the amount of work that’s being done. Every six months your schedule change so no stability for life/work. Every job isn’t perfect.
good,"I really like working there but when it came down to the money it were like they didn't care if we had a job and how we were going to pay our bills. When we close down on June 4,2014, the didn't care how we were going to make it but that what I didn't like about them and gave other a bonus."
good,"The job was fun at times . But very stressful . I did not like the smoking environment, which that casino allowed smoking in the gaming area. A lot of the players had quite disgusting habits."
good,"Work culture is easy going, however, the distribution of work can be uneven especially across different teams despite similar pay. The working conditions are comfortable and the traffic for the corporate office is tolerable even during rush hours. For motivated individuals, there may be a bit of opportunity to learn and work on some projects, but this is dependent on the manager and current team composition."
good,"Caesars is a great place to work, but can be very stressful at the same time. Great pay and benefits. Management is great. Caesars really strives for a great workplace culture."
good,"A good organization to work for, but they are not best in-class. You can do better working for some of their competitors. "
good,"Set schedules, PTO, union support, and plenty of opportunity. Harrah's is a great casino for an entry level position. Room for advancement in most departments and friendly staff. Very high passed and stressful at times."
good,i honestly was stressed everyday coming into work it is still a job but not one you'd want forever. The most i can say is if you do decide to work there expect to be on your own if you do not have people backing you up.
good,It has been a while since I worked there but I would recommend it to someone else. She had her choice of preferred workers. I wasn't trying to be anyone's favorite but wanted everyone to have a fair chance
good,"I have mixed feelings about my time of employment at Harrah's New Orleans. I got a chance to meet a lot of nice people, but the communication line was not open."
good,"Lots of social events and happy hours, fast paced working environment, interesting and challenging place to work and opportunity to learn about business and gaming practices"
good,It's a great property to work for.  It is a well known property and one of the oldest hotel on the strip that has a lot of history.  The experience you will learn from working a big property like this are priceless and will certainly help anyone who's looking for advancement in their career path.
good,"Going into an Entertainment company as Caesars, I was expecting a very dynamic, horizontal, team work oriented culture."
good,"I work hard always trying to learn new things and always positive, I know a couple people who work there now and they love it."
good,I liked working here but left to finish my degree plan for college.The management was okay and the benefits were great.  It was a great place to work.
good,"It is a nice work place, meet different people of different culture,sometimes it is stressing and challenging. The company gives a lot of benefits and gives rewards"
good,The management style career is challenging but rewarding at the same time. I really enjoyed my co-workers and the guests I got to meet on a daily basis.
good,The Casino industry requires you as an employee to be totally committed the it. Everyone works weekends and holidays.  The customers are always right in most cases.
good,"I spent 7 years in the hotel reservation and 5 years at VIP Services. "
good,"LAD was a fun place to work great people. Good experience if you want to get into the food and beverage business. Management was decent for the most part, but definitely could use some improvement."
good,"A typical day at work for me is, speaking to everyone that I come across. Always having smile on my face even when I'm in a bad mood."
good,"Some days are the same day in and out, sometimes you do not know what to expect. "
good,"most days were fun I went to work and did my job."
good,"I have always believed that if a company takes care of its employees, that the employees will take care of the customers. The last 3 restaurant jobs I was laid off due to closures, or I would not have left because I have a good work ethic and a following of customers. My last job was with Grandview where I sold timeshare for 2 years! I was let go in December of 2015 and now I would like to serve in a gourmet room again."
good,Working as Horseshoe was an overall pleasant experience.  Great teammates and management.  Company provides a great benefits package as well.
good,the management was all too ready to blame employees rather than take responsibility for their own decisions .high staff turnover in key positions favouritism of unqualified  (but flirtatious) employees was rampant if you do not play the game it does not matters  how good you are at your job
good,"Initially when I started at Harrah's Casino it was fun and exciting. It seemed like a great place to work with the promise of career advancement. Towards the end of my time there I realized the management and HR department is what makes it a horrible work environment. The co-workers are great and they really do become family. The managers, however, do not care about their employees. There is a union and they are helpful, but they only give the bare minimal."
good,"Overall housekeeping at Harrah's Casino was okay, it was chaos at times especially at crunch time which was around 3 pm but it was overall a nice place to work. The benefits are great and other employees are for the most part friendly.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help others, but I also learned some people will not be able to be satisfied."
good,"the typical day at work is very steady work environment."
good,I have learned how to do things to make a customer happy and customer is number one. The management is average and sometime they may check on you to see if you are doing the job. The hardest part is transfer to other department in the same company. Some may favors others to move up when the ones that do the best at their job does not get transfer.
good,"Various situations daily, never the same old thing......."
good,"Worked as a buffet chef at the Heartland station which mainly consisted of smoking, flaming, grilling and carving various types of high end meats in front of guests at the station. Various side dishes were also provided and maintained. This was all done with an entertaining smile and demeanor to the guests at all times. In all 7 stations make up 'The Spread' buffet and 3 were mastered by me. The cooking and preparation experience I gained was priceless."
good,Caesars Entertainment is always a fun to work for. It has a lot of opportunities and technologies on which we can explore and learn.
good,an enjoyable place to work. I was with the company for 11 1/2 years and met many friendly people and developed several long lasting friendships. the benefits were very good and there are many chances to advance and find a job or career that is a fit for you.
good,There was never a dull moment. Loved meeting new people and worked with great co-workers.
good,It was a fun job but not something to raise your family on in regard to wages.  Expensive benefits.
good,just recently started working for Caesars entertainment and i really enjoy coming to work every day. My co workers are easy to get along with and everyone works as a team. My managers and supervisor are also nice and helpful people who doesnt mind helping us on the floor when it becomes very busy and hectic. I'm glad i work for this business.
good,"Balancing a cash drawer of 180k, excellent customer service, and data entry. For the most part management is ok. The co-workers are great people from many diverse backgrounds. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for long periods of time. The most enjoyable is meeting all the different customers and the stories they have to tell."
good,I was on my feet the entire shift. The customer line most of the time was long. I had to work fast and be accurate.
good,I liked Harrah's but when had a lot of rooms you feel good cause of the money. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all those real nasty rooms. The management had picks and chooses.
good,"A typical day at Harrah's Casino & Hotel is fun and the employees are for the most part friendly and helpful. Some days are better than other days. Hotel guests are most of the time pleasant to speak, but some do not want to be bothered because they are sometimes mad after loosing money at the Casino. The hardest part of my job is making the beds in the hotel rooms, but other than that my job is pretty simple. The most enjoyable part of my job, I guess would probably be having breaks with my friends in my department."
good,"A typical day consisted of me counting and processing all the money going through the casino. I as responsile for machine maintenance, running MPS machine,opening toke bags,opening table games,jackpot and poker tables,opening and verifying bill validator boxes. Work environment was pretty, due to the intensive security measures involved while handling money. Hardest part was driving an hour way then working 15 hour shift, and then driving another hour back home. Most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits, very good pay and excellent healthcare."
good,"Good money; chaotic environment with no prioritization from top leadership. Managers and VPs in my department are amazing, but there's a lack of leadership from their bosses."
good,Business volume was great in the beginning but tapered off quickly. Learned a lot about bartending and met a lot of great people. Management was not always understanding but tried although some were absolute nightmare micromanagers. Most enjoyable part of the job was coworkers and guest. Hardest part of the job were the slow days. Horseshoe Casinos sister site so more emphasis was placed on Horseshoe than Harrahs.
good,Fun place to work and great employee discounts but little room to grow unless you change positions. Company was going through bankruptcy which had an effect on salary increases or lack there of.
good,Working for a casino/resort takes quite a while to get used to but once you do it is a great company to work for. Harrah's treats their employees better than most casino/resort do in same industry in my opinion.
good,Harrah's and Harvey's Lake Tahoe was an interesting journey. The training is focused on a team first attitude surrounding customer service as a mainstay.
good,"Very stressful work place from the employees to the customers, everyone is drunk, somedays a lot of down time other days extremely busy, dealing with a lot of money and you learn how to count poker chips,"
good,"Working with people all the time you must be a people person and have lots of patience. You will be tested there, you have to deal with people that are drunk and belligerent. They will be days where you get people that are rude. Overall working with everyone can be fun, however, you must be quick due to the fact that its such a fast-paced job. On the other hand, you really don't make much there working as a waitress we don't get fair minimum wage and sometimes it feels like each supervisor or manager has their favorites when it comes to servers."
good,"I used work Harrahs, I like the job culture, I got great award from manager, I work very hard , I am out going ,I am  friendly , I did such excellent service for guest. when they short hand , I always help out what I can."
good,"Overall was a good job but in my salaried position I would have times where I'd work 2-3 weeks straight and retain regular pay but when there would be a closure for renovations or seasonal closures, the days missed or closed would be removed from regular salary and in order to accrue PTO is a long, slow process."
good,In my line of work time management and strategic planning is necessary to remain ahead of all task. The most challenging part of my job can be the inflow of traffic daily from employees; however I smile and accommodate reach employee according to the highest priority need. I believe customer service is essential when communicating with 500 plus people weekly
good,"a few good opportunities,under paid, semi good benefits, if you want to move up know you have to work hard while been under paid also remember every man/woman for themselves."
good,"Love working in the casino industry.  I have been in the business for over 20 years , and plan to continue doing so . I have learned a lot from my managers and feel like I would flourish at a new location."
good,I spent nearly 9 years at Harrah's New Orleans. My time there offered me a great deal of experience. I was able to build strong relationships with internal and external guests. I learned a lot about guest service in varied situations. The benefits were considerably better than those from other employers.
good,"constantly moving, learn a lot of new things, many different experiences, however they do not value their employees they are seen as ""replaceable"", management was very distant, a lot of favoritism, hostile work environment"
good,"Plenty of opportunity for advancement, great benefits. Pay rate is too low for duties of job.  Management of this department is not knowledgeable in procedures to perform job functions."
good,I Worked for caesars entertainment for nearly 3 years. I got fired but IIl be completely unbiased. Its a decent place to work and the people for the most part are easy to get along with. The pay and job security is good (especially if you are union) but Managment in my department were incompetant and didnt know how to properly handle being short handed. Overall if youre trying to start a career in the gaming industry caesars is one of the two big boys you want to work for or if you want to work in the restaurant/bar industry and make very good money as opposed to places that only pay minimum wage then i recomend you apply at caesars ent. especially if youre trying to get out of fast food/retail since pay is almost always decently over minimum and you get paid lunch.
good,"Work was challenging but meaningful.  Management did not micromanage however, lots of people took advantage.  More training is needed as everyone does things differently."
good,A typical day at work would include walking around making sure no one is stealing chips or counting cards and even other gamblers asking others for money. There were also lots of escorts when there are people in the main gates needing to go somewhere with large amounts of money they could not move without a security escort.
good,Harrah's Surveillance was a great company to work for. g Harrah's had great Supervision and employees.  I just decided to move on and take on a new challenge with a new company.
good,"As security we went where ever the money went. we handle any complaints  anyone had, and had to be well informed on events in and around the casino. Our most important duty was to keep anyone who was not 21 out of the casino ."
good,"Last time i work there it was great. but sense iv'e back there more worried about a minuet. Employees don't count any more.coworkers are great. Management not to bad. They did hire some young men but they went to other shifts, the other shift could have use at least one of them.and they got the best days even better the us that that been there longer. we need some mechanics that are small enough to fit in small places, we have a lot of them. They hired a big man, hes a good mechanic, he came another one of our property with 4 weeks vac.and high pay that's fine but they could hire 3 young men and train them, it would have been more cost effective. We got top mechanic that know our building completely. I don't think they know how to hire anymore in the Engineering department.the hardest is caring into them small places working on the H.V.A.C. valves."
good,"I do not have a typical day at work because we do many different events at the casinos. I can work anything from gift giveaways, slot tournaments, dinner registrations, raffles and bingo nights. "
good,Unfortunately my work is very far from my home and I feel like I have wasted two hours of my daily life commuting to and from work and I would like to find something closer to my family.
good,"i really enjoy my job i like it here i just don't like living here so i would rather leave Cleveland just for a fresh everything then stay here i love my co workers i work will with everybody  fit in i do my job and i go home and i also spent time with my co workers and management out side of work. i typical come in at 11 pm to 7 or 8 am to  (3rd shift) to park and bring up cars for the costumers at the Casino and i greet them as the come and go. The hardest part is the wealth when it rains or snow really bad here and the management isn't correct some times but i still do what is asked of me no matter what and more , the enjoyable part is to meet great people enjoy new things or great wisdom and growth as a young man its beautiful. Its just the city."
good,"Overall, the company is a great place to work for. Everyone in my department from my Director to Controller, Manager, and my Seniors , they are very nice and very helpful. They try their best to help you finish the work."
good,I just had return back to work on a Sunday a guest told me that housekeeping didn't clean their room in two days. So I responded by apologizing about them not having service. So I took care of the guest and told my supervisor what happen.
good,"The company has been great to me in a sense of making a living. As long as you're willing to work hard you'll walk away with an amazing living! Benefits were outstanding when it came to the culinary union. I only wish that management didn't change every month so we, as the employees, knew exactly what was going on daily. Unfortunately they only gave us a week in advance to look for new jobs. Not so loyal after all."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Horseshoe. The associates were nice, prompt and sociable. The management was fine but lacking in certain personable qualities. The benefits were very nice and they were flexible when it came to the work/personal life balance. I would work there again if the opportunity presented itself."
good,Overall a typical day at work was always entertaining guest and learning all sort of culture influences. Management and employees had the same job description when it came to acknowledging harrahs guest. The hardest part of the job was watching guest loose so much money. The most enjoyable part was working together with fellow employees.
good,"Poor scheduling.. But very fun place to work for. I learned a lot about customer service.. The company overall has made me a more friendly person , although I was from the start. I find myself saying hello to people everywhere."
good,Assist costurment sit the guest greet answer the phone always nice to your customer smile eye contact
good,Working at Caesars you need to be able to work in all areas of the shop.
good,I really enjoyed my time and probably would still be there if the Tunica Roadhouse did not close. I also left because I was not going to take a pay-cut and perform more work. I have nothing but great things I experience from Caesar's Entertainment.
good,"Helpful training, very long and multiple step interview process, must be good with customer service type situations, fair compensation for job requirements"
good,"it was fun and there was a lot of help, but the guests always complain, none of them are grateful. if you upset a guest you get written up. most of the guests are drunk at night"
good,Just keep to yourself then you can make this the best job you ever had. The supervisors only worry about themselves but what else is new. Moving up is easy but don't miss any days or it well be hard much harder.
good,Handled millions in cash on a daily basis Favorite aspect of job was stacking bundles of cash and counting it. Particularly liked personality of the countroom supervisor Stacey Allen. Unfortunately the dust and less than perfect ventilation of the countroom was detrimental to my chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(c.o.p.d.) which forced me to resign. Also did not enjoy working from 3 am to the afternoon. Weird hours for me.
good,The casino was a great place to work.  The company and employees treated you like family.  The job I was entilted to do was easy and very professional
good,Caesars Entertainment has been one of the most amazing places to work. My team is full enthusiasm and hard workers. Scheduling has become an issue in my life seeing as Caesars Palace runs 24 hrs a day. 
good,"Strive to exveed customer/employer expectations by delivering second -to-none service. Maintain customer centricity in all initatives and interactions, always putting the customer first."
good,"My typical day at work would be trying to make our guests stay here a great experience! Making different reservations for many places, preparing their plans on a day to day basis. Was a great experience!"
good,"Wonderful  place to work but lacks Management backing"
good,"A usual day at work in the Laundry room is very busy; because Hourskeepers are always in need of linen, and towels. Therefore, the washing machines always have to be going."
good,"My typical day is Booking hotel reservations,limos,restaurants,shows,customer services. I did learn a lot about the hotel industry. Management needs to improve they don't want to tell you the truth about a lot of things for fear they will lose their job. I feel the job is too micro managed and you sound like a robot saying the same thing over and over again. And if you don't say current things in current order on the calls and if it is the call they grade you on you get wrote up and don't pass your monthly review. That's the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable is earning points to buy things for getting good scores."
good,It is a typical day working at Horseshoe Casino the environment is very clean very fun and very friendly during ploys are very fun and very friendly people speak and the meals are fun it's a Hands-On environment everyone gets a loan if there's a problem is solved before you even reach higher management it is a very fast working place
good,the work was easy it just the bosses expected to much out of us prep cooks who did all the work but the pay and benefits was the big issue great place though.
good,"> A typical day at work as a Surveillance Supervisor is supervising your people on shift with you.  However, all people in the room are trained to the point that they are supposed to be self sufficient.  The reason for this, is that each person/persons could be out on the floor doing visual surveillance at any given time.  The other(s) would be watching on the cameras."
good,"i have been with them for almost 3 years and its been fun , but not easy to advance in the company. which is why I'm looking else where. east to be full time"
good,Don't  care on  employees.        Sometimes no lunch all they want is there rooms to be done   and some of the supervisors  are very mean  and too much pressure. Even though  they see rooms are very dirty  they want  rooms to get done perfect And if 15 rooms aren't done a warning is given.
good,Everyday I open emails and prioritize to maximize time management. Then I deliver the best service possible to my assigned clients. Third I always look for ways to make my job more efficient and productive.
good,i got to meet new people on a daily basis. i enjoyed the people i worked with. the  most enjoyable part was having my hours structured.
good,"Harrah's will hold a special place in my heart. I have learned so much and connected with so many wonderful people throughout my journey here. I miss the money, the family environment and the great management team I had. The only bad things I can say was that management was never consistant, and some too young and not profeesional sleeping around with the servers. Also just watching people speand their life savings, even seeing some deaths along the way made it clear to me that I will never gamble in my life."
good,"I truly enjoy the staff at the Horseshoe, I have never enjoyed working at a place more than this. The fellow supervisors and dealers work to provide the best experience possible. Our shift manager is very good at his job."
good,"my day typical day at work was fun,my co workers and supervisors were great"
good,"At Harrahs you had to stay on your toes.  When people loose thier money they automatically blame you instead of themeslves. management did not allow me to be human and have a zero tolerance for disrespect and bad behavior. instead they told me to suck it up,  take it, and keep smiling.  Even if the customer is becoming hostile using profanity and making other players and my  evening miserable."
good,"A typical day at this job was greeting customers, ringing up guest and seating them to their table. Ive learned to hanlde large sums of money. My coworkers were very different from what I was used to. They were diffenrent ethnicities.The hardest part of this job in dealing with complaining customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was working in a different setting than what I was accustomed to."
good,Hours were nice at most of time co-workers were nice enjoyed doing different things. Christmas partys were fun also.
good,My years at Caesars were wonderful. Raised my children and put them through school. Had a good middle class lifestyle. Flexability to be able to raise my children and provide made my job a dream job.
good,Best experience of my life. If it wouldn't have been for my family being so far away I would have stayed with them. Hardest part of the job is working holidays or not getting the time off for special occasions.
good,"Typical day required up to 12 hours."
good,tell you about about time i was at work and we misplaced a coustmer keys. The coustmers was waiting on their car not knowing what was going on so i approached the cust and let thtem knwow what was going on and what was taking us so long to bringi their car around.Of course they was upset bugt i got them to calm down and made a promisethat i was going to be the one that found their car and brought it to them immidately. After i spoke with the managers about everything i began my serch running from lane to lane and then i found their car and brought it around for them less than 6 mins.
good,"My specific department has horrible management, but overall it is a decent company. Pay is low and raises are minimal, but all other benefits (insurance, 401k, etc) are above average for my area."
good,"I was employed while it was Horseshoe. Liked 90% of the job. Did not like no paid Holidays, working every weekend.Once Horseshoe was sold and all of my Managers and Supervisors started leaving, that was when I started looking. In Surveillance it was required that you learn all table games, all odds with no cheat sheets even though all of this information was written on each table, you are required to take a test every 90 days with paper only. if you do not pass 3 test in a row you are terminated. Pit Boss's have said they could not pass this test."
good,Guards are there to keep the peace and eliminate any potential situation(s) or individual(s) quickly and discretely in the early stages before they escalate. Drunk people (men & women; women are the more stubborn of the two sexes) Escort employees and patrons to the cage; kick certain people out. Check id's; not for the timid. Leave ego at home. Good job for people with naturally protective instincts.
good,no room for advancement shift work no time off very hard work no inhouse training   always have to work weekend for same pay
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy nights and can work every weekend and Holiday. Benefits are awesome and they do have a break area for employees with a free salad and soup bar and bevages. "
good,"employee meeting, get list of rooms,clean all rooms, including stripping beds, changing linen, cleaning bathrooms, stocking bathrooms with needed items. Dusting, vacuuming rug and sweeping and mopping tile. I had a quota of 19 rooms in a day."
good,I really enjoyed working for Caesars. I am currently trying to work there again. Its great if you are single and have no children. Then you can survive in Atlantic City.
good,The position I held was great but if you wanted to spend time with your family it is not for you. The position demands a lot of time and dedication. Your only good as your last months numbers seems to be the best way to describe the motto for Caesars. I don't want to bad mouth but I lost a lot of time with my family and I realize that was more important than a great paycheck and a high profile job.
good,"fun job to do, it helps with customers service skills, but the place isn't too good to work. it makes the job harder. as an overall rate i would probably give them a 5."
good,"Great place to work. Management is always eager to help their employees succeed. There is a reason why Harrahs is rated a best place to work!"
good,fun place to work at with management they always try to fit to your schedule but cant do anything if its last minute. lots of overtime if needed have a great lunch and its one hour paid lunch
good,"A great place to game at but as for work it was very difficult to balance family and work. They pay better than most but you will work 45+ hours a week on a salary. Not bad but this is at a entry level, it is a bit much. Management was hit and miss with a rotation of managers from outside properties staying for a month or two to fill in. Promotion are few and far between, lack of growth is why I left."
good,"A typical day @ Harrah's includes making sure all the vending machines are functioning properly, and that the front-line is clean and fully operational & that the entire cafe is clean. The hardest part of my day is making sure it stays that way. The cafeteria at Harrah's is a very clean and productive 24-hour environment with tv's pool table and computers set-up for the employees enjoyment."
good,"No money was used to repair or remodel facility. Facility was very old and dirty. Morale was =very low because of that. I have worked in much better places over the years. If you are complacent, that is the place to be"
good,I have been working with this company for 13 years now and I have seen a lot of changes and a lot of growth within the company I have worked with some of the amazing people and management who stood by me through difficult times like the lost of my mom when hardship came for some employees they were there. now it sadden to say my department will no longer be needed and after 13 years of being with the company no placement has been bought up to us. even though these few past months have been a ride of emotions I  am still very thankful to have a job for now until my final day I have nothing bad to say . I am very grateful for the years I have been there.
good,"Fair - great coworkers and great benefits - need to have more advancement opportunities for non 01 employees and be consistent with policies "
good,"I have learned  a lot since I worked at caesars, there are many fun and nice people in here, I have had lot of fun with these people. But the business is going down here, lost of the time we got nothing to do."
good,"They try very hard to make the environment family-oriented and customer-centric, but everything comes off as fake and for profit. It was difficult to come to work motivated and passionate."
good,I have been with Caesars entertainment for 4 years and have had an overall very pleasant time working here. We are in the midst of new leadership regime change and along with that comes  a culture change that my style of management doesn't fit well with.
good,Working one on one with customers is something I like to do. You get one on one contact with guest. The hours of the spa was what I loved most. I wasn't there all night like the rest of the casino. I had time to spend with my family in the evenings.
good,"I learned to serve mentally and physically. Running to fetch food orders in the would have to be the most enjoyable party, as well as the most difficult part of the job. I feel like Tarzan."
good,"Its casino life, smokey but full of entertainment. The management is good they are supportive. Good insurance, cafe food is cheap and decent.............."
good,"Caesars is a nice and fun place to work for. I love my co-workers, the guests that come from all over the world and the locals.  I learn about other cultures, the regular guests that comes every day/week/month and so on..."
good,"The company had an excellent training program which allowed me to be confident and professional in my position. The daily interaction with the clientele is what I loved the most about my position there. "
good,"My job started off great. That was until the summer was over, and I had to choose between school & work. They refuse to work with my school schedule. I started to see my co-workers true colors as well."
good,"A typical day has over 400 check in's with 5 representatives per shift. It is very stressful when the hotel has limited room availability, long line, multiple customer complaints, and mandatory overtime. However, it feels good when every guests are finally in house."
good,"the hardest part of my job, first of all is working late  going to work at 10pm.  I was use to going bed at 10.     the next hardest thing is dealing with irate and drunk customers at that hour.  then not making enough money ."
good,It was a great company to work for just the job security was not there.
good,Great atmosphere.  Management is a little shaky as there are people in positions that have no business being there.  They hire you as salary and then expect you to work 60 hour weeks driving your hourly rate down and then they don't have to pay you overtime.  There isn't any incentives to work these hours as there is no bonus' for anyone unless you are manager or above.
good,I did enjoy being able to assist patient's with medical emergencies.
good,I had 4 supervisors on day shift with 12 call center reps. It was a lot of fun!
good,"Don’t apply to be a beverage server. After the smoking ban, they’re making pennies. Especially the overnight shifts (12AM-8AM) and day shifts (8AM-4PM). Swing shift does alright, but be prepared to be surrounded by colleagues who act like high schoolers... This job was fun in the beginning but quickly turned into BS after the smoking ban"
good,"Great place to work for benefits and overall pay in a tip based position. Just like anywhere, it has pros and cons. Most days the money outweighs the negative. The only big con for me was not having a normal life schedule, working weekends and nights."
good,Very unprofessional management they like to control every situation and end up being more trouble than they are good. Many occasions where my boss was not doing a good job
good,"Most people gain skills and work for this large reputable company for a short period of time, then move on.  It was hard to retain good employees.  Many layoffs in last 6 years, and tough times during bankruptcy.  Lots of change.  Did not provide much training and development.  It was up to you to find it on your own through mentor or other very talented employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team and the types of marketing, technology and innovative projects we were doing.  For a gaming & hospitality company Caesars has some cool projects to work on, if they get funded!"
good,it is challenging everyday but you meed people from around the world the work i did here was fun and exciting people were nor always nice but it was a good job
good,"The job was pretty good however you have to stand all day long. If you have health issues that would prevent you from standing for long periods of time, I wouldn't suggest applying. NONE of the positions allow you to sit for any reason."
good,typical day was not bad working machine that were down for repair. good up keep of changes but should have waited until supplies came in from manufacturer.
good,"Good place to work. Surveillance employees were well trained by me. Management overall is good at the Rio. Focused on watching table games, slots, and cashiers."
good,"The Senior  Management at Planet Hollywood had a double standard when it came to policy and procedure and how discipline was initiated and / or given. "
good,"every day was different, i enjoyed delivering high standard service to all types of customers, including serving the welsh rugby team."
good,"The company was a good company to work for, although my schedule was just not able to work with their hours at the time. I enjoyed the atmosphere and everyone in it."
good,"Great pay and benefits for a job only requiring a diploma, benefits are really good after you become full time, give you insurance, 401k, etc. Raises are rare, if any. Coworkers are great and diverse, management is overworked and therefor could do better if provided incentives and proper staffing. Hardest part, i don't feel like they actually care for or take care of locals, or people with gambling problems, most enjoyable was working the Kentucky derby and Superbowl."
good,The training you receive is very thorough for the job description. The instructor was very thorough in job scenarios that you may encounter    during a phone call. Being on an on call status was not ideal for me due to not having a regular shift. The fluctuation from day to night was not suitable for me.
good,"There were a lot of opportunities to take leadership courses to better myself as a restaurant leader. Overall, the company would be a good company to work for and to get experience on a large scale."
good,"I do not wish to report, but today these companies are not loyal!"
good,A typical day at work was fun working with the customers and co-workers. Management there was horrible all the way to the Human Rersource  Dept.
good,"Not much thought into promotion from within, in my opinion."
good,Enjoyed team and people that I worked with at Caesars. Workload poorly managed at Senior leadership level. Everything number one priority that hampered progress and traction on projects
good,"Very fast paced, a good place to get experience and work with a lot of different departments. The best way to move up in the company is to be willing to move/relocate to another property within the brand's umbrella."
good,"If you are a quick thinker and catch on to procedures quickly...You will excel in this environment  I have met many people who started at caesars when they were very young, and are still there.  These veterans know and love the business of the hotel and entertainment industry"
good,The work environment was fun and entertaining. The pay was good. The clientele was the best on the river. Tips were good until the economy took a hit.
good,"This was the first place to give me an opportunity upon graduating from college, and for that I am very grateful.  Everything that I learned in  my time at Harrah's will surely help my excel in my new career."
good,I wish they would give you guaranteed hours instead of 0-40 weekly especially for new employees. It takes years to get a set schedule or full time hours.
good,Nice place. Busy constant work different guest fun atmosphere a lot of music great party scene good for travelers and visitors amazing for at home games during game season
good,"-work hard and stayed focused, since the business is high on weekends and holidays and also summer break, that's when you have to be there. So you don't get to spend time with family but other then that its fun place to work with great management."
good,"Working here involves some very complicated procedures for some tasks that require a lot of experience and knowledge in order to use them. Which is why it is so jarring that the team plays games and walks around talking to each other constantly, even when under strict deadlines that often go unmet."
good,Low paying job for the work. Office is cold and dark and quiet. Socialization is frowned upon. Good job to get your foot in the door but would not want to be in the position for long.
good,"The Horseshoe is a good place to gain a lot of experience with demanding guests, noisy environments, and inexperienced management.   If you remain focused and work well with your teammates you can advance quickly."
good,"The job is really not hard work and the pay is great. Very flexible hours to accomodate any lifestyle. The employees there are mostly all great people. Management is a little weak, there are only a handful of competent supervisors and pit managers and they are very inconsistent on what they want from dealers. Has the potential to be very fun depending on who comes to your table, but is more often than not dealing with people yelling at you for taking their money."
good,I worked there for almost a year. Great people great hours. Management could be better but I really don't have any complaints for this place. They treated me great just let me go over a misunderstanding.
good,Horseshoe baltimore casino is a good place to work . i learn to have patients working for horseshoe but the way they run thing is not good they treat there 7star better thing the co-work. The manager team is good for security. The hardest part about the Horseshoe job is they sell liquor 24/7 so will deal with a lot of drunk people . I like work there but i had to quit because i was sick all the time
good,"I loved my job. I had fun and really enjoy the friends I work with. "
good,"Enjoyed working at Harrahs.  Your Management team was there for you, they had your back.  There was always some reward for the employees to show we were appreciated.  We enjoyed working there."
good,"Typically during the week it is rather slow in the Starbucks. On the weekends it pick up. WE have several responsibilities for the upkeep of the outlet such as, changing sanitation water and rags, refreshing retail items as well as ready to eat items, maintaining cleanliness of guest areas, refreshing ingredients as they deplete, stocking back of house items, etc. I learned a great amount of time management skills as I often had to close the outlet which must be done in a timely manner. Management changed greatly while I was there. Our original manager was hardly attentive enough. We were severely understaffed in the beginning and are now overstaffed. Despite the promise of a regular schedule I have received several different shifts and a constantly changing daily schedule. The most difficult part of the job is managing the vast amount of tasks expected to be done busy or not. The best part though, is when a guest becomes a regular because you have made their day a little better in the simplest way."
good,"Overall the folks i directly worked with were fantastic. However, the management was and is another story. The work environment within other departments was uplifting and caring."
good,its a good job where you meet different people from around the world. your able to build relationship with your customers. so that they would feel comfortable enough with to you and would love to comeback and visit you as much as they can. management Is different no one care about they employers option and was awful with commutating with the staff but overall it was a good experience's
good,I would suggeest that if you are trying to work in marketing or the gaming industry Caesars would be one of the best places for you to start your career.
good,this was a growing casino newly installed machines. now closed for business. i loved working here plenty of people to meet.
good,"Great job and place to work with plenty to learn as you go but the only problem is corporate has decided to bring in cheaper players that spend less on gambling so tips are way less. Because of this my yearly pay has dropped over 20,000 a year in 5 years"
good,"walk around the casino talking to guest while running pit fills or going to emergency situations."
good,Harrah's Hotel gave me a diverse outlook of the international community.
good,"There is a fun and festive atmosphere here.  However,  beware if you are looking for advancement.  There is a strong dicrimination against older workers, and favoritism is present."
good,"Long hours. Sometimes wouldn't get off until 6am. Depending on what kind of shift you had. Customers are fun, some are rude. Management is okay."
good,"The unusual building design presents a few time-management challenges. Not having previous casino experience makes each day unique. It has taken almost a year to learn the regular guests, as well as the nuances of dealing.  Most of the Floor Supervisors have years of casino work, and are helpful in smoothing out the bumps in the road.  Casino employees are very enthusiastic about our jobs, and provide an enjoyable atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is the shortness of breaks- which reverts back to the building design.  The guests are the most enjoyable part...  I love it when they win... almost as much as they do!"
good,It was very hard job bad hours and no family life. The best part of the job the chefs showed a lot more about cooking.
good,was only casual employment so very few hours were available
good,"A place for adults to enjoy Gaming and entertainment. As a dealer you have to greet customers, offer assistance to customers when needed while dealing all table games in a friendly fun atmosphere."
good,"Typical day at work sign out my keys for the office, pick up items from the box, get messages, check e mails, log in items in the computer, speak with guest and employees on the daily. My co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is that we are always busy and don't have enough man power."
good,Great job great pay. The union won’t do much for you. And management let’s nothing slide. Other than that co-workers are nice. Friendly Atmosphere! It’s a good place to start.
good,"very good company with ausome people. while the project I was in was depends on the usa online gameling market, when they found the market will not go up, they dismissed our team, while still like my work there."
good,Great place to work overall. Training and development opportunities was a plus for me. Overall great pay and  benefits provided the market that i lived in.  The hardest part of the job was work life balance.  Be prepaid to work holiday and weekends.
good,I actually liked working there was there for almost 11 years than had to go to a day time job. It’s a good place to work but if you want a holiday off than it’s not.
good,"Great place to work, very friendly environment. Everyones looking to help, great customer service. You will be well prepared for the task each day you step into work"
good,It's a great place to work with a wonderful team. I only left because of the pay. Overall i loved the management team and everyone I worked with. I would have loved to stay.
good,The casino industry is it's own environment. If you like dealing with people from all walks of life and you are easy going and can deal with high energy than you will love working here.
good,"They capitalize on managerment more than any other job I had "
good,"A step-up from a lifeguard position, depending on how you look at it. You won't need a license or anything like that. You'll be required to check room keys, bags for illegal items, basically a bouncer of the pool."
good,Harrah's was one of the better gaming companies.  They provided great employee benefits and pay.  They were very aggressive with customer satisfaction and treating their guests right.
good,You’re constantly moving throughout your whole shift when it is busy. there are times it is slow and you have time to relax. It only consist of bringing down vehicles to the guest when the have requested them and parking the cars that cone through the port.
good,Harrah's was an amazing company to work for. There is great opportunity for growth within the company. They recognize hard work and appreciate their employees.
good,"The job is good I worked on graveyard but the toke rate is low.  The supervisors are easy to get along with, it is a very relaxed place to work at least on graveyard.  The biggest downfall and that made my decision to leave was the temperature they keep it extremely cold in there to where you have to wear layers of clothing underneath your uniform and you still don't get completely comfortable."
good,"The atmosphere is fun. You get paid to play games all night long. The nights can be long because you have no idea what time you will get off.  However, there is a short break ever 1hr 20min,"
good,"I liked it much of the time, but the hours make it hard to be with family.  It is very hard to find day care during the hours that need to be worked.  Pay was good, but things changed a lot and for the worst when Jack Binion left.  The lay offs took their toll on people.  I had to leave to take care of family issues.  It is hard to get other jobs with the experience from a casino, when you need to leave that business due to the schedule and such."
good,It is a fun and challenging work environment. Every day you get to meet new guests that like to have a good time and be entertained with all of the amenities that the resort has to offer.
good,Good company to work for. Nice people and good standards. Management is helpful and culture is also good. The hardest part of the job is working with no proper business documentation.
good,"Harrah's is the largest Casino corporation in the industry and arguably offers the very best training for their employees. However, their retention of employees is compromised by their inability to remain competitive in salary and benefits compensation. The vast majority of employees will pay their dues at Harrah's and successfully market their experience and excellent training to other companies offering far more appealing compensation packages."
good,It’s an okay place to work. No fair pay. No teamwork. The company does have fair benefits but the pay and other issues are way out of hand. Some departments needs better management.
good,I enjoyed working at this location. we were a great time. There was creative freedom to create need dishes for the restaurants and staff. I feel the pay could have been better compared to other companies in the area.
good,Much better casino when jack binion was there. Things changed when harrahs came in. Things were based on being in a click.  Can be a stressful job. Many employees stay for insurance
good,"I really enjoyed the people and management I work with. I learned a lot that allowed for advancement outside of the company. Although it was a great working environment, they didn't pay at a Competitive rate."
good,"The employers and co-workers were all good to deal with and they mostly always have your back.  The only problem is dealing with some of the crazy, abusive, and drunk customers.  Some of them can really work you over.  My female co-workers were often screamed at, hit on, or worse, to the point that they were worried leaving alone at the end of the night."
good,Overall a very good employer. Unfortunately constant lay offs make it difficult to secure full time employment. Benefits and salary are impressive. I enjoy working there.
good,I enjoy working for the company overall.They could be a little more fair and or considerate of loyal employees. A typical work day is very positive and steady pace.
good,A laid back and fun atmosphere. A great sense of teamwork. Offered a lot of perks and benefits working for this company. The hardest part of the job was working graveyard shifts.
good,"If you have a strong work ethic, this is the place for you. No such things as holidays off, unless you work in human resources. Can also be a bit stressful. But the ability to move into other departments if you qualify is good, as is advancement opportunities."
good,".I am not interested in getting anyone in trouble. My typical day of work dealt with checking in guest dealing with special issues. The hardest part of this job is dealing with demanding guest, I worked with VIP guest and they all had special request. I was not always able to deliver what they wanted."
good,"I have worked at the company years ago while in college. It was a great company to work for, and even to continue on looking for a career. The work environment was great."
good,"Have to be mindful of the team you are assigned to...some will smile in your face and stab you in the back.  Upper management attempted to help, but I was not in a job that suited my stronger skills"
good,a very productive place to work. They offer different types of events and work place. The casino is a very fast place business with great insurance. I work for the company almost 12 years.
good,Maintain communication with passengers and answer any questions as needed Drive in different road conditions/ inclement weather.Help with luggage as needed
good,"We were mostly slow in the spa except for weekends. I am a spa attendant my duties were answering the phone, scheduling appointments, cashier, washing and folding laundry, and keeping the women's and men's lounge clean and presentable."
good,Great pay! The atmosphere is very stressful but fun. The managers are very strict and the clients can be very difficult. This job was a good learning experience.
good,interesting company with strong analytics culture...ton of old school thinking thou..lots of egos to manage...very little time left for family...lots of properties to work at
good,"I loved my job there and would still be there if they didn't have to lay off so many because of the smoking ban that was activated in the state. Overall, great place to work."
good,"Fun place to work pretty exciting and always a lot going on a lot of friendly co workers and a lot of experiences, one big gaming place and constantly meeting new people."
good,Innovation and growth and the most enjoyable part of the job was making dead lines and receiving the recognition from upper management and being rewarded
good,"Get used to change, you will see alot of it. They have an awsome training team and the HR staff are always excited to greet you with a smile. No worries its not a facade, they are in place to help. Open door policy is taken seriously in all departments as is confidentiality."
good,The team I work with is great. It is a type of career you have to find a balance that works with your lifestyle. You will build relationships with employees and customers. Many opportunities to grow in your career. Overall great.
good,"I spent several years there. It was a close nit group of employees, benefits are good, both Medical as well as 401-k. It was a great place to work. That said, being a Casino it had one heck of a grapevine."
good,"I learn different kind of skills at The Caesars Entertainment, such as special event, customer loyalty program.I receive student reimbursement while attending college, base on grade."
good,Some of the managers were great but 50% of them were not inspiring and clearly looked down on the girls in our dept. The money was decent most of the time.
good,"Caesars is a fun and diverse company with many positive attributes.  The array of show, dining, reservation and gaming options for guests and employees make it a sound investment for those choosing to vacation."
good,A great company to gain experience with high volume.  You are trained properly in management roles and business demands always remain high.  Good benefits and it is a great company for advancement considering there are so many sister properties as well.
good,a typical day at work was counting and balancing all the banks from tables bars and restaurants.  It was real challenging.  it was fun on holidays and paydays
good,"Harrahs was a good casino to work for, it just wasn't as busy as i would have liked it to be in my line of work. My coworkers were great and the management team was good for the most part."
good,This was my first job. I mostly worked as a cashier. Enjoyable because there were new people and new experiences every night. Gained a lot of experience here.
good,"•	Reviewed and investigated customer’s inquiries and concerns. Explained various promotions to fit customer’s financial needs."
good,Great rate of pay and lots of overtime available. Swing shift is very difficult to have a social life. Also being in a union is great but... your job can change without notice if you in a bumping position.
good,"The higher position employees were quick to offer help with any issues that arose. Everyone was friendly, you got to work on quite a few things at once."
good,Working for Harrah's in the casino industry was a blast! I got to meet a ton of great people along the way and never hated going into work. Every day was different and this job was a great fit for the season of life that I was in at the time.
good,Harrahs resort and casino in Atlantic City is a great place to work. All the employees are extremely supportive and help you to reach your full potential. The casino industry is none stop action and stay on your toes.
good,"As a cage cashier you give people chips or cash in their chips for money. It's a very good job and you get paid well. I worked the late night shift, and that was probably the hardest part of the job."
good,"at harrah a typical daily based work day consisted of basically keeping the hotel maintained and cleaned through out the day.management was ok for the most part somethings could have been better but thats with any job.hardest part of the jobs was when we needed linen to turn over our rooms and there were none due to laundry issues,break downs and shortage of workers.like any other job most enjoyable part was going on lunch break with friends and completing that days work heading home..i learned that team work only really matters when you have a strong team of workers thats willing to put in the same work effort as you..all in all it was a good ride.."
good,working in a high volume restaurant that is sports themed. Catering to tourists and knowing the surrounding areas for entertainment and attractions. Co-workers were fun
good,The ever changing Casino industry is a great place to work. Training and career advancement opportunities for anyone interested. Tons of career options as well as great benefits.
good,"Demanding workplace with strong opportunity for lateral and upward growth. Mobility, however, generally requires significant networking effort."
good,"Very rewarding job with several return customers that I grew to know very well throughout the years. I enjoyed working with the public and building rapport with clientele.  "
good,"The employees there really bond with each other and love to be around each other. On busy days, interacting with the customers can be fun and exciting, but can be the exact opposite on slower days. Management in the Valet Department could be better."
good,"the department was great, everyone got along with each other. the job was never boring because there was always something going on"
good,"Enjoy the pace of working and the competition of working with individuals having the same drive as myself, also greeting guest as they come into the establishment."
good,"I hadn't learned to play politics well enough while employed there, so I didn't have the most positive experience while there."
good,"I was a hotel housekeeper cleaning the rooms in the hotel ,I loved it ,It gave me more experience as a hotel housekeeper, I enjoyed working there."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the position are the people I work with.  It's a 24/7/365 business and working weekends suck, but overall it's a great place to work!"
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job, besides the pay, was my co-workers. I developed long lasting friendships with them and continue to talk to them today. Management was reasonable but the scheduling was dreadful."
good,"Harrah's Hotel and Casino has a very diverse team and is always seeking to improve the workplace to please its employees. A typical day at work starts at 6am for me. I prep and provide exquisite desserts for all fine dinning restaurants. In this job I have learned a lot of baking and decorating skills. Although my current position is not of a lead or higher, I sometimes perform leadership duties. Management in the Bakery Department has had its ups and down. This department is under new supervision and it seem to all be running better. I think the hardest part of my job is that of having to work long extra hours on holidays and not being able to take time off during holidays. The most enjoyable part of my job is my break. It is a paid break with a lunch included. The company provides its employees with a dinning room, plus a paid break."
good,"great place to work, competitive salary for all employees, great paid time off vacation offering, great discounts, and great managment"
good,"Caesar's Entertainment is a great company to work for with MANY opportunities to move around not only locally, but nationally as well."
good,"learn how to deal with difficult people not only difficult guest but incredible difficult supervisors, most of my fun time was wen I was delivering items to guest made conversations with them listen to the opinion they had on the city, etc......"
good,"Good, The hours could be kind of rough, working on 3rd shif was pretty hard but I did it for 2 year. All in all a very nice place to work."
good,I was able to interact with a lot of lovely people while working at the casino. It was a very social environment and I enjoyed celebrating guests wins with them.
good,"Worked here for about two years. Loved the job and the people there. Was looking to advance but many people just stay in their positions and there is little advancement in upper management, so your advancement suffers. The pay is much lower then the average. They are making a lot of ""cost cutting"", so staff suffers. There are some great people here, but with the cost cutting they push some great people away as well. Upper management listens sometimes, but not as much as they should. Need a shakeup to make this an even better environment.  EXCELLENT TRAINING!!! Best training that I have ever received, Good Front line staff, HR staff very pleasant.  Worst part was not getting a monetary bonus. None offered by them, only ""points for gifts"" that they have, which is not really what anyone wants."
good,Great company to build a career.  Great stepping stone for other opportunities.  Great networking opportunities within the company.  A lot of weight and responsibilities is placed on your shoulders with this company.
good,"voted 2nd best place to work in phiadelphia, and id have to agree. very fun and outgoing people.i have made some good friends, but am looking to see what else is available to me."
good,Enjoy my work when it is available. co-workers are my family.constantly learning new things as per current client request on function. management feels like family also. very physical must take good care of yourself.I really enjoy people. I still work for Caesars. Not enough work. Majority of money goes to health care ( for lack of hours) Taxes (for all of us) and union dues. Not much left for me.
good,Easily the best opportunity I was given by Caesars Entertainment was my current position as Director of Operations for the High Roller. This job has given me so much experience in a diverse set of skills that I never would have been able to get anywhere else. I'm grateful to the management team of The LINQ and the High Roller for giving me this chance to shine and show just what I can do.
good,"Working at Harrahs Casino introduced me to working with customers face to face to resolve requests and disputes up front in a fast paced environment. The co-workers were all great and management staff. The most challenging time was during the busy holiday, which was packed with customers. and very noisy. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with our customers directly and building relationships."
good,"Excellent provider of customer service."
good,"this place is fun  and friendly to work for due to the big company where you meet new people everyday and staff is really nice and helps in everyway they can, good benefits."
good,I enjoyed the position that I held.  It was challenging and rewarding.  All the people of the organization are great.  The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with the team members.
good,it was fun managers cool dual rates act like teen age college kids when they should be grow adults and do there job yeah it was fun
good,"Fast paced, change occurs fast. A good place to harness skills. Managers are good to work with. I have learned to be adaptive to a start up environment."
good,"Continue to learn about the company and always able to talk to management about projects and concerces for guidance. "
good,This was by far one of the better jobs. Harrah's really does provide a fun work atmosphere. The management works with you. The hardest part of the job is really just dealing with customers who lost money or had a bad night.
good,long days of cleaning the hotel rooms but there is good days and bad  days. co workers were alot of women and sometimes you would get along and sometimes you wouldnt. over all it was a good job
good,"- Always being a productive member of the team"
good,The best part of this job was definitely my co-workers. We had fun while still getting the job done. Management was very easy to talk too as well.
good,"A typical day of work included coming in at four a.m. and dealing with party going guest on the way into an after hours nightclub. My management team were wonderful, I have never worked with such an amazing team of employees. The hardest thing about my job was having to handle intoxicated rude guest. The best part of my job was learning how to deal with difficult situations in a more positive way, meaning learning how to resolve the situation by compromising rather than arguing."
good,"Learned the importance of using customer service skills not only in working with guests but fellow employees as well. The  job could be a challenge but  it gave my multi-tasking skills a work out.  I enjoyed the interactions with guests, getting to know them and helping them reach their goals for better ratings and having a positive gaming  experience.  Training Dealers through listening and applying policy and procedures was an enjoyable experience.  The company did require a lot of extra meetings which sometimes could provide valuable information for working with others and completing job functions."
good,Very busy region with daily deadlines for vendor processing times.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my previous job, was how everyone worked together as a team to satisfy our guests.."
good,Work is awesome for me I'm a social butterfly I believe in positive attitude treated others equally as I would want to be treated. When it comes to management it could be very tough but I work in a structure environment where work comes first play comes when your off. I enjoy working with my fellow co workers we have built a work family. I take on any challenges given to me there is nothing about my job that is too hard for me. What I enjoy most about my job is the people I work with as a great team players we get the job together never an I in Our Team!!!!
good,You are able to meet new people everyday you work from all around the world. If you are full time Caesars has great benefits. You have job opportunities all around the world.
good,the supervisor was a great person to work for he would lay out the jobs and then we would go out and do them. If we needed any help he was there to help and never really got angry was very pleasant all the time. The work day was organized and we knew what was expected.
good,"Typical day - daily Title 31 audits including Front of House (FOH) operational support with Internal Control Q & As.  "
good,"Good team"
good,Every evening at Planet Hollywood is like going to a club. Fun work environment for the young at heart.
good,A typical work day consisted cleaning. I would sometime vacuum the floors and clean up restrooms.
good,"Assist in set up, service and breakdown of the food line."
good,"Company cares, about its guests and its employees. Always doing things for the employees and there families"
good,"Mangagment is great."
good,"They treat their employees well. It definitely ""breaks the mold"" of a typical hospitality company. Caesars offers great pay and benefits for management, and line staff. They offer tuition reimbursement, unlimited growth potential, and they have a wide variety of management positions from which to gain experience."
good,"As a performer, it was a great experience working in a well known worldwide live lounge show. Announcing duties, and M/C, along with featured segments displaying vocal talent. Importance of working with other performers and blending complimentary styles. Management and co-workers were wonderful to work with and many are friends to this day. I found no difficult areas of the position. The most enjoyable part of my job was entertaining the audience. It is it's own reward to see people smile and respond to a performance."
good,"A typical day at work would be closely resemble that of a 8 hour math class. We are responsible for counting chips, cash, and coin mentally, and accurately completing each transaction with customers. Management was for the most part helpful when needed, and co-workers helped the day pass along somothly"
good,"Working at Caesar's Windsor as a banquet server was a great opportunity. I was able to work a variety of events from banquets, luncheons, lobster fest, and many more. The other staff were all very friendly and welcoming, helping me get settled into the flow of things quickly. Some events could be messy and very fast paced, Lobster Fest was one of those events. Being responsible to serve 40 people a 3 coarse meal as well as 3 separate beer tastings all at the same time. You have to be quick on your feet, well coordinated, and able to handle caring 50 plus lbs."
good,"As a Cage Cashier, you are to be and stay aware of many things. Fake bills, checks and chips while giving great customer service and clearing your drawer every night. The job demanded a lot physically but the atmosphere is enjoyable."
good,"Harrahs was a good place to work. The pay was very good, and the job straight forward and easy."
good,My department is a subset of the hotel and casino marketing department.  We respond to direct mail offers that fly customers into Atlantic City from various cities along with hotel accommodations.  My coworkers and I work incredibility well together as well with others from other departments to make sure the customers are taken care of while on property.  The hardest part of the job is the numerous changes implemented by the corporate office that give suspicion to actual job security.
good,"Meet and greet guest. Issue complimentary dinners, and concerts, assist our VIP players with travel, hotel, and playing needs"
good,"Don't have a problem with older generations, yet I do have a problem with the bad attitudes they bring to the table. I worked with several dinosaur employees who just had a bad daily attitude that just ruined it for most customers and fellow employees.  I don't like work just as much as they do, but sometimes you have to bare and grin it.  I enjoyed the experience but wouldn't entertain working amongst employees with sour grapes for breakfast.  Most senior management catered to these lifeless and long term employees, bending rules and regulations because they were all grandfathered from days ago when rules didn't exist at Harrah's."
good,"making accurate and fast transactions"
good,I received three promotions during my six years with Caesars Ent.  I would still be employed with them if I did not have to relocate.  Great pay and benefits.
good,Everyone who works there is fun to be around. Company has a good goal
good,A typical day is fast and very up tempo. You learn how to huslte and work for your money. The management is really strict and non personal. the co-workers are very competitive. The hardest part of the job is the weather. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to drive many different cars.
good,love my job and the people i worked with. everybody was easy to get along with.
good,"A typical day consisted of calling and setting up appointments with customers, researching customer's criteria for their desired homes, viewing homes with customers, preparing necessary documents, and communicated with broker and customers to assure that customer's needs were properly being met. The most enjoyable part of this job was knowing at the end of the day that the customer was satisfied.  "
good,"Caesars offers a fast pace, everchanging and high demand work place with great rewards."
good,Excellent training and great tools!  Enriched knowledge of the gaming culture 
good,Harrah's was a great place to work. It was a fun environment. Great co-workers. 
good,"Your typical day at Harrah's revolves around one thing customer service. This can mean anything from turning back underage patrons, assisting in handing out jackpots to escorting drunks. You never knew what was going to happen and for the most part made the days enjoyable. "
good,"Employed since 2004. Started as Staff Accountant, then Financial Analyst, then Sr. Financial Analyst."
good,i loved working here. met people from all over the world. loved meeting new people.
good,"I love to cook. I consider myself a very talented Chef who continues to enhance my craft. I am a team player and understand the big picture of running a restaurant including but not limited to food inventory, Profit and loss statements. building moral amoungst team members. I do not think any part of our job is hard but it can be challenging without the proper tools. I enjoy talking to guest and getting feedback, good or bad. to adjust to demands. Able to work long hours standing up to 14 hours at times."
good,"Not a family oriented place. The bosses do not care about the employees. It is a fun environment but with the situations you have to deal with sometimes, can make for a very stressful shift."
good,"Our team has a group meeting called buzz, where we go over rules and special projects for that day. Then we are released to go and perform our duties."
good,"Learned how to work with all kinds of guests and provided the best guest services possible, so they had an overall positive experience at the Horseshoe."
good,"I am a hard worker at work, and learn or teach others, when asked for advice, I give it my best and all. I am very confident and enjoy challenges."
good,a typical day at work was a lot more fun than any other field of work that I had been involved with previouly the teasing the inside jokes the playing around with human nature I liked the aspect that my supervisors had dealt and could relate to what I was up against
good,"Caesars Entertainment allows an employee to feel like a part of the journey of the company, including it's successes. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved in community events, clubs, health and wellness programs, amongst many others. I would recommend Caesars Entertainment as a quality workplace."
good,My Coworkers are incredible. Nicest people I have ever met as well as hard workers. They made work fun and enjoyable.
good,"This was my first time working in a Culinary Union environment. During the time I was there, I learned so many different aspects of this, in addition to becoming familiar with the Casino atmosphere. I achieved the respect of my fellow colleagues and co-workers, taking many friendships with me when the time came for me to move on."
good,"The Carving's Buffet in Harrah's Reno was an enjoyable place to work. I got to meet new people every day and learn new things as well. It was a wonderful place to work. I had to quit unfortunately when they stopped calling me in for shifts for over a month as I was an on-call worker and couldn't afford to pay my rent any more. I quit when I moved to Carlin, NV."
good,I enjoyed the work very much however I required more money and different hours to fit the needs of my family.
good,"A typical day at work would start with roll-call. Then ypu would go to your assigned place to work for your shift. I learned how to treat people, when the customer is always right. The management was very helpful just about all the time. I this type of business their is always a get a head type attitude with co-workers, but for the most part the other workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of this job was being on your feet for 7.5 hrs. out of a 9 hr. shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the different types of people all the time."
good,"Harrah's Hotel & Casino, New Orleans, LA 70112 (2-12-11 To 10-1-11)"
good,"Installed, maintained and repaired slot and video poker machines, as well as maintaining a security /accounting syatem for the equipment."
good,Loved my time at Caesars - especially the people. Extensive calendar management. Seemed to learn something new everyday.
good,I got great training when I started working there. I felt like I would be an asset to any company I went to in the future after the things I learned there. We really learned how to treat people with respect and be proud of the job we did.
good,"Harrah's is an entertainment compant. It provides Great guest service, excellent food/drink while someone enjoys their gaming experience."
good,"For Starbucks only *"
good,The start of the season was actually really nice but then people started quitting and then we were being scheduled weird. The company at the rio dose not have enough money to pay for more people and also we are being scheduled once a week which is truly unfair.
good,"The overall experience working for Caesars was good. I did not, however, feel that the advancement of my career was a priority to my superiors. Leadership was very helping on projects when I needed them"
good,"Great place but terrible management, to many chefs with larger than life egos. They play “favorites “ so if you want to be  recognized you had better pucker up and get to kissing. It seemed the harder you worked and the more relationships you cultivated with their guests, upset your supervisors. HR does not “ advocate “ for the employees but more for the company, if go to HR to address a problem 9put of 10 times they go and tell the person you have a problem with and that makes your job extremely difficult"
good,The people or ok but the  management  Was poor the had people stuck in the same position not a real come up I worked hard & did not get a fair  change in a  Promotion
good,"This is your typical security position for a casino; flashing lights, music, alcohol, and gambling. There is always the under 21 years of age which try to get in, but if you look 30 or under then you will be checked."
good,"Caesars is a good company to work for, but because of its huge size very few resources are directed to individual employees. It is easy to get lost in the shuffle and become just another number."
good,"The job was fast paced. I loved talking to and helping the customers. I met a lot of people, some I became friends with. I got along well with coworkers."
good,"I learned a lot during my time there. The pay should be higher, no one can live off of their minimum wage. The discounts you receive as a employee are wonderful!"
good,"Beautiful property, great place to live, very nice coworkers and upper management, great benefits, love working in high frequency market, lots of great entertainment"
good,The company provides good benefits and a lot of potential for overtime. Good for temporary work. They have flexible hours. There is potential to relocate to many company owned locations.
good,"Good place to work, great perks included free show tickets to all caeasrs entertaiment shows. 401k even for part time employees, and an employee EDR so you dont have to buy your own lunch everyday."
good,They need more people to cover all the areas that need  covering. You have 1 person working 2 and sometimes  3 areas to get the job done. If you make a mistake it's ure mistake and possibly reprimanded when you should not have been given the overload without help from the beginning.
good,"Great learning envir. but needs to pay there employees better to stay comped in the area marking and retain top talent for the organization."
good,I recommend working with Caesars Entertainment. It’s a friendly environment and you will always keep busy. The management is very upbeat and positive and will make sure they are there for you when needed.
good,"Depending on the manager, it could make or break your employment experience. In one department I worked, I had a great team and everyone worked well together. However in another department, the managers did not properly train employees and did a poor job of communicating their expectations."
good,"Income Control: Computer accounting and balancing of each account daily from the previous day's business. Daily auditing of all departments and customer relations on phone or in person."
good,No comment money is good lots of places to work lots of experience to be gained.................................Management is various due to amount of venues
good,I can say that when I was working at Horseshoe Casino and Resort stay that the pay was okay but it is a casino and not a place to work for a family oriented person.
good,I like working at the casino but they are not paying or giving enough hours. You meet a lot of interesting and fun people and I love working with people.
good,9 to 5 customer service. I enjoy talking with all the customers. Culture is very cut throat. The hardest part of the job is not really learning anything new. I need to use my mind.
good,Very colorful place to work and there's always something going on so its not boring. Just difficult to balance life/work. Plus there was a lot of favoritism within the company so not easy to advance.
good,"The job was usually quite enjoyable. But many employees who had been entrenched in their positions made it a challenge to efficiently run the business. This was aided by a desire to make things ""better"" by some managers, with ""better"" meaning everyone should feel good about it and no one is reprimanded too heavily, despite behavior that warrants it."
good,"For my role, I have had a fair time and it has had its moments of stress but everything can be fixed so at the end of the day it is a god place to work."
good,Good people.  They care to a point then make you work a lot of hours.   Its tough to get ahead.  Lots of opinions and tough to figure out what the right thing to do is.
good,"The work is fun. You work alongside some great people. Most Managers are trained to provide support to the front line staff. Compensation is great for those who have few skills and no college education. Tipped Casino and some F&B jobs can earn more than $60k/year. Not many businesses offer that. Benefits are competitive as well."
good,"Its a family type work environment, everyone works as a team"
good,"Harrah's was a very large exciting, busy company to work for.  Always something new and different. Training of new staff was high on the priority list."
good,"A typical day as a Security Specialist at Harrah's Atlantic City is anything but typical.  Some days are extremely busy, some not so much.  Working here tests your people skills on a daily basis."
good,You clock-in and have a pre-shift meeting. You learn what events or promotions were happening that day. It is a diverse culture with people who enjoy working with each other. The hardest part is always being understaffed but needing to satisfy everyone anyway. The most enjoyable is how easy the job is.
good,Good pay and benifits but hard to find child care for odd hours. Players can be mean and not all floors will help you when players become verbally abusive.
good,"A typical day of work would be me starting off cleaning all mini day beds , lounge chairs , etc. Then i check the voice inquires for cabana or daybed rentals. When we open I am food running & when we get busy i fill in as a server. I am pretty independant at work & i am given many job tasks that I have to figure out on my own most of the time. I think this job is a good place to get my foot in the door."
good,"I have worked for and at several Caesars properties. I have worked as a officer, dispatcher, surveillance operator. I have conducted investigations, drafted reports."
good,"Caesars does engage its employees to give back to the community, provide education assistance, works to promote a Team environment. "
good,This is a great company to promote from within. I was promoted two times within my three years in the company; each time I was promoted it was a huge career step for myself but with the help of management I was able to be successful.
good,company is good I'm just moving to Philadelphia for personal reason but I was with this company for 10 years I always found it fair in all the ways but is time for a big change.
good,"Cashiering would consist of counting banks, taking customer's/ server's checks and putting them through, organizing receipts, and handling guest dissatisfaction."
good,i love my current co-workers. the environment is fun and friendly. you get to build great relationships with the guest and others. also you have many learning opportunities.
good,You have to stay on your toes. Training and information may pass you by. You have to be a sponge and absorb as much as you can.
good,Harrahs is a great place to work. The company looks to include its employees in every aspect of the operations of the resort. Co- workers are a blast to work with and everyone greets everyone
good,Everyone did what they could to keep the operation going and effective. Great leadership at the time. The unions made it tough.
good,Great property to work and something always happened... not just Parades in town but events and tournaments and great Brand events. I was always busy telemarketing or with an event during the weekend.
good,"This was a good place to work, a good wok environment and friendly co-workers, directors and managers are more concerned with the numbers, rather than the people who do the work, always short staffed, which results in poor customer service and a facility that is not properly maintained."
good,"management was decent, some days were very busy due to events, friendly co-workers, hardest part of the job was dealing with very drunk guests"
good,"As a Table Games Dealer it was a great experience. I got to learn the world of a Table Games dealer. It was fun to play games for an eight hour shift and have fun with the individuals who love the game or just wanting to learn in general. Although, if looking for re-employment for such company is a downfall."
good,I found Caesars to be a good place to work. They provided a pleasant but competitive work environment and management was supportive to the employees.
good,I love working there and having daily interactions with co-workers and guests from all over.  Great place for advancement and standard benefits for that type of business.
good,diverse culture a new business that continually growing into it own element. For other that are interesting at working here it an experience you will either like or learn from.
good,"en caesars palace gym, el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, la estabilidad laboral es la que falla un poco ya que la mala administración provoca caídas y bajas en afluencia de publico."
good,I supervise dealers on the floor of the casino. I maintain the money intake and outtake. Give performance evaluations of employees.
good,This is a great job for someone not looking for a lot of hours and quick money. This is the job for you if you like to meet different people at a fast pace.
good,"It is not the best but a good place to work. i enjoyed working in a gaming industry. I work as dual rate Manager, who takes care of the shift. I do dealers and supervisors assignment, handling customers."
good,"It can be very fast paced environment."
good,This job is great for someone with a great attitude but complacent.  The opportunities for advancement are slim unless willing to move.
good,"Great group of people to work with. A lot of fun, yet very challenging. Dealing with customers questions and concerns, some can be very challenging. Great management and people you can trust."
good,"Always busy"
good,"I worked in the Marketing/ Promotions department. It was a fun job where I worked all the casino promotions and got give our customers gifts that they earned. I learned a lot about customer service, dealing with money, and the night life industry. It was a great experience and I worked with a great team."
good,36 years experience working for very large multi-property casino.  The best co-workers in the business; learned how to excel at accuracy and superior customer service.  Hardest part of the job is handling increased responsibility and workload over the past 5-6 years; most enjoyable part is sense of accomplishment in providing superior customer service.
good,i secured the premises wherever i was scheduled. Was an interesting working experience because I dealt with so many different people on very high social as well as professional level daily.
good,A typical day at work would be just to start off with social media marketing/online marketing. Then putting on a uniform to commence to the Las Vegas strip to promote the upcoming event or to service the clients in anyway. Co-workers often ran into each other and edified each other to clients to build credibility.
good,I loved my job when i worked here. I wish i would have never left.
good,Horeshoe is a place that allow you to discover who you are and what you like to do. This company as allow me to discover new things about myself. Day to day operations helps me with things.
good,Getting to work and getting the room ready for a busy night. Making sure everything sparkled.
good,"Harrah's understood that a happy employee makes happy guests. The management were always checking in, on a personal level with their staff to make sure each one was comfortable and satisfied with the way things were run."
good,"A typical day at work would be building flight manifest for alligient air and dealing traveling agent booking for flight. while working with Harrahs Casino I learned how to build to a plane chart to seat guest, and the laws in working with TSA. I really enjoyed working their. I would meet different people everyday. the hardest part of my job was trying to accommodate everyone."
good,I like my job and love the people I work with.  The hours are not great no matter what shift you're assigned.  With my being the only working person in a household of six I need a second job to make ends meet and the hours and responsibilities of the position does not allow very many opportunities.
good,"It was incredible to fill a store from the ground up. shelves everything. don't lik,e working ever weekend"
good,"Working at the Casino, never was boring. It was a great fast-pace area, which I personally thrive in. However, it did seem as if manager lacked communication, direction, and real leadership. This then caused issues at all shifts."
good,The company is more concerned about expanding than fairly paying their employees that  aren't off on holidays or anything.
good,"A typical day involves food preparation and guest interaction.  I learned how to cook and prepare food for large volume sales.  I like the fact the managemet team has allowed me to be in cooking competitions and assist inthe development of menus.  The hardest partof the job is when you can't always keep up with guest demand on the food. However, it is quickly refilled with minimal waiting times.  In a perfect world, a guest would never wait but unfortunately life isn't perfect and there are occasions where it is virtually impossible to be perfect."
good,"Pro:"
good,"I haven't returned for many years, so I really can't comment. I understand they have a wide variety of Carnival games."
good,"If you have no interest in a personal life this is a great place to work. It is a fun, exciting gaming industry. You can stay busy the full day with no down time watching the clock. The only problem with this position  45 hour a week turns into 65 hours. You work every holiday, weekend and all holiday shifts 12 to 14 hours. Good company but has poor organizational management in food and beverage."
good,A typical day for us was always dealing with customers that had complaints are jackpots. I did money transfers and escorts and alot of customer service. 
good,"Job is great if you enjoy being around people. I also worked with many great people. Management can be flaky, though. "
good,I started as a Soil Sorter and advanced to a Heavy Utility Porter. The job was fast paced and constant moving. The co-workers were great and management had their pros and cons. The hardest part about the job was working 10 hours in very hot temperatures. The most enjoyable was unloading the cargo from the semi-trucks.
good,This was my very first and to date only Casino job. I learned alot about how the table games work... and bets and the like. i made alot of friends during my 8 yrs of service. Some i am still in contact with to this day. Being in a fast pace work environment is what i am looking for. Performing my job well in a swift manner is important to me. which makes my working with others fairly easy. I am also good with customers.
good,"Casino cages are very busy and stressful. I enjoyed dealing with the guests. Most of them were happy. Sometimes not!! We always did all we could to make sure their visit to our casino was a good time for them. We had a happy, rowdy crowd there most nights."
good,Always busy. New casino employees were fitted with uniforms. Alterations or repairs were executed accordingly.
good,"Since it was a pool open to the public we had several kids running around to look after and maintain watch over. At times we had drunk guests. We dealt with extrem heat or freezing cold weather conditions. We would walk around while off stand to pick up trash and towels. If you were assigned to stay in the towel hut you would greet the guest, answer any questions they had, and hand them complimentary towels. At the end of the day we would have sections we would have to stack the lounging chairs for the other employees to power wash the floor during the night. If you were also assigned to push sand you would have to get in the pool after it is closed to push sand back up to the main line to make the scenery look like a beach as it's suppose to look like."
good,I got to work with new and exotic food and had a few great chefs to learn from. Most management didnt care about the little people that let them earn their 6 figure salary ONLY the bottom line. We had equipment that was jerry-rigged and sometimes didnt work at all!
good,Loved working for this company and was 100% dedicated. Miss the people and the community service outreach.
good,Did not receive holiday pay for working on a holiday. Wirking around smoke was hard health wised.
good,"It can be a fun job, but you need to learn the rules, just like in a game. As opposed from other jobs where your contact with the customer is brief, hotel desk you may get a customer for a week or a month, or several times in a year, so if they are complainers and they know you are a good listener, they will stop by to complain every day. It can get old fast. Now if you learn how to play the game, you will have great customers that will be happy to see that you are there and because they know you will take care of them in a professionally and effective way they will stop the whining and will be back every time knowing that their needs are covered. It is all about the Customer Service!"
good,"I enjoyed this place immensly! However, they (Corporate) did not value hard workers with integrity. Absolutely heart broken at being over looked and not trusted."
good,They do take care of their employees by providing tons of perks for employees to enjoy with their family. They do provide a great work/life balance most of the time.
good,"Working at the casino is great for money, base pay is only 4.65 an hour but tips are very good thanks to the costumers. Life/work balance is not good at all, when you just start you pretty much have to work night shift. You are expected to work every holiday, weekends and all. Also you never have an exact idea of when you will clock out, because you rely on closing games. Therefore it is mandatory overtime. If you are just looking for a place that pays well and you can work whenever, the casino is a very fun and easy way to earn plenty of money."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people with whom I worked with and the guests that came to the casino. Management was great at times and not so great at other times.
good,"Enjoy the atmosphere and employees. Fair to employees if they make a mistake. Understaffed, need more employees and pay is low. Very structured environment."
good,"Be careful of swing shift employees. They love to gossip about other employees. That's why they have a high turn over rate for swing shift. "
good,"The company overall is fine. I like my department and the folks I work with, but not the rate at which I'm advancing. Lack of direction on how to advance and change of leadership left me wasting time unfortunately. I would still recommend working here though."
good,"Great perks, nice coworkers. After few years they finally set in place a training schedule, prior it was learn what you can. Lots of favoritisms. Management will make or break you."
good,Everyone kindda knows everyone. Usually dont have a lot of problems. Every ao often some people thwink they are better than the other employees of dame experience
good,Overall a good place to work. However Caesars often experiences hiring freezes that hinder the ability to move within the company. Caesars' benefits could be improved.
good,"I've only worked for the company for about three month now. So far it's gone pretty well. They have some, kind of, ridiculous rules. They've taken away the food down in the employee cafeteria and are going to replace it with vending machines."
good,"fun place to work, but hard to get off 3rd shift, the interview process, and hiring process is very intense. Over all a very fun place to work, would not recommend a married person apply"
good,The last restaurant and bar that I managed was Cabo Wabo Cantina. So managing a restaurant and bar and coming up with retail idea's presented it's challenges. The establishment was open for about 20 hours a day and if someone called in due to budget problems and staffing issues you could be the one there for the duration. Though It was fun with the bands and this place could get rocking and we did quite successful with all the challenges upper management put on us with the expectations of our P&L'S and profitability. We built a great menu and came up with new and innovative concepts that stayed well after I left though all in all it foundered eventually due to constant overcharging of a tired product.
good,"It's been many years since working here and I worked here in two types of positions. Front of the House, part-time total rewards rep and eventually back of the house, full time CRM coordinator creating offers."
good,"Fun upbeat environment, always busy and new things to do and learn. Casino hotel was a experience that I will always treasure. Management and staff were very team oriented and always on top of making the guest number one priority"
good,"Started working there overnight.  After 4 months I went to 3-11Pm.  Finally got on day shift 4 months later.  Overall was not a bad place to work at, met a lot of cool people that I still talk to today."
good,No room for job advancement.  Some mangers get away with murder. Rude and lazy. No one in my department steps up to do any extra so I had to and got no thanks for it.
good,"Union paid position. Solid work hours. Intense & high volume. Paid vacation and health benefits, dental, life insurance, vision and short term and long term disability. Various outlets and schedules to choose from."
good,"Harrahs is a fun atmosphere, you get to interact with different people from across the world .Often celebrities come and enjoy themselves.Theres the masquerade club inside that draws a crown often and it's interesting to see different cultures come together and have fun."
good,"Cesars Palace was a great place to work, I learned a lot in the short time I was there, the executives at Cesars were great, I enjoyed working with every single one of them."
good,"Lots of walking, standing, talking to guests. What I learned a lot about customer service on how to deliver excellent customer service. How to stay upbeat and positive throughout my work day."
good,Excellent career choice for a young person just getting started. Physically demanding position due to requirements of the job and frequently changing shifts hours and mandatory overtime. 
good,For such a large corporation Caesars is great at making employees feel like they matter and are contributing to the companies success. Advancement opportunities are there but not in all departments.
good,I worked as a beverage server for many years and made really good money for a living but as the years have gone by it's hard to make good tips anymore.
good,"Apart from working mainly weekends this company provides an exceptional customer experience. The atmosphere is always fun and ever changing, a true staple in the entertainment industry."
good,"I typical day is busy, I have learned to think quick on my feet. Management are there to answer some questions, the environment is fun and the hardest part of my job is running out of rooms for guest."
good,"workplace culture was difficult at first. I had come from the North,"
good,"Would usually walk into work and get settled at my desk. Check my email. Print out my paperwork and schedules for the day. Touch base with the Supervisor coming off duty for any concerns and issues. This could be wither with staff or technology. "
good,Caesars Entertainment was a vast company with various options and a good culture that made a good Career option. With a better work life balance I could have been with Caesars for a long time.
good,Always busy. Which is great reason being I like to keep busy. If I am bored I will find something productive to do and assist other departments if they are short handed.
good,"Caesars Entertainment is a company that is willing to take a chance on people who prove themselves to be diligent, hardworking, team players.  Advancement is not considered by tenure.  It's about what you want to do with your time with the company.  The opportunities are there for those who want it."
good,"I had more than one position during my time at Harrahs.  I started off as a temporary employee in the Recruiting office.  It was absolutely AMAZING.  I loved my manager and my coworkers and loved my duties and the opportunities I had to advance within the Human Resources Department.  When my temp time was up, I went to the Casino Marketing Department.  I loved my employees and actually loved my job, but felt that my manager had ""favorites"" and there was a definite difference in the way she treated some employees.  Additionally, she was a bit catty and allowed her personal life to interfere with her attitude.  She is no longer with the company.  At the end of the day, I loved the company and would love an opportunity to go back!"
good,Fun place to work and a lot of good people to be around  as long as you do your job no one bothers you pays its ok raises could be a lot better.......
good,"Typical day was always meeting new people, learning different aspects of the job.  Management was pretty straightforward making that our job was done."
good,"Typical work day included meeting with employees/management in assigned client groups such as Table Games, Hotel Operations, and Food & Beverage. I also investigated all employee related complaints and presented findings to upper management."
good,My Review of being a supervisors is making sure you come to work on time and making sure the shift is prepared  have everything they need such as chemicals and brooms and dust pans. The typical type of day in the casino world is making sure the slot machines are wiped down and the bathrooms are maintain for the customers and checking everything detail the workers have done. The hardest part about my job is looking for the working making sure they are in there assigned area making sure they take there break on time. when I was a regular employee I had so much fun.
good,"My job role as the rooms inventory clerk manager I not only help the front desk with checking in guest I also call in rooms that need to be out of order. shut down the system when need be and put rooms back when they are ready for use. I also change room types when the front desk agents need rooms changed. Another part of my job is when the supervisor is busy and a guest is needing to talk to a manager and a supervisor I will step up and speak with the guest. My job keeps me busy, but I do not mind it. Also when we have big groups that check in, I have to deal with the block reports and getting them together to send off to the right person in charge."
good,"I enjoed working there, good tips and fun working environment.  Our manager had a drinking problem so you never knew what you were going to get.  He is long gone now!"
good,"Caesar's Entertainment is a multi-billion dollar company that provides amazing benefits and has a wide range of job opportunities. Management within security can be a little disorganized at times, but overall they always tend to come together in difficult times. Workplace culture is diverse and exciting. Everyone here tries to work together to make the workplace an enjoyable place to be.The hardest part about the job is overcoming the obstacles with difficult management styles and personalities. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with guests and it's a fast pace environment."
good,"Caesars is a good place to work and gain experience in various areas of the industry gaming, hospitality, F&B, finance, and sourcing.  However often employees take the skills and experience they gain here and move to a different company who might be willing to pay more, or to a different city.  The company culture varies depending on what department you are in and who your superiors are, but overall the corporate environment is fairly laid back."
good,"Display attentive upbeat , and enthusiastic behavior during each and every moment.Clearly communicates functionality of slot floor. Verifies and countersigns hand paid jackpots."
good,"A typical day at work is working a bank, time management, customer service and paperwork. I learned to multitask in a fast pace environment, customer service to high end customers, managing large amounts of cash and suggesting to guests. The culture of Caesars entertainment is refreshing. It's also challenging. The hardest part is slowing down and disfusing upset guests. The most enjoyable part was the pay and atmosphere of the job."
good,"Working at Caesars Palace was a dream come true. The company is in continuing growth and offers many opportunities to employees."
good,Good place to work. Would still be there if it wasn't for a broken foot from snowboarding. Very close staff in kitchen. Most employees are long term employees who are will for change. My still of management is positive energy and corrective critique. Always make the people around you better without them even noticing. I love what I do so this is easy!!!!!!!!!!
good,Great Place to work when it was still Harrahs.  Great money and security. They were always changing concepts to keep things fresh and interesting for the guests.
good,Accounting department has many opportunities to move around and learn new experiences. The corporate politics very much exists and leadership decisions have potential to be questionable at times. The work/life balance is reasonable. Sub-departments take time to celebrate with quarterly events and give back to community through various public services. Not much to complain about benefits but compensation could be better at other companies.
good,Proud that I worked at the Horseshoe. I met so many good people. not only the employees but the guest. I learned a lot about customer service and how to build relationships.
good,"It was an extremely hard job, with a lot of responsibility, and a certain amount of  knowledge of the law was required.  Changing shift patterns and night shifts were normal.  good team work and  exceptional customer service was part of the job. I found it very challenging"
good,"They offer so much and also treat me with the best of respect."
good,"I was not here at this job long, but it was a nice place to work. You get to interact with people all around and I was able to make tips once i moved to the main floor. Unfortunately i got fired because I was ""stealing time"" by just sitting on the clock once I finished all of my duties. I wish I was able to stay here, but it was a lesson learned."
good,My boss was a little grumpy but had allot to teach me. It was hard as i worked 3 to 11 in the morning. My coworkers did not say much but did a good job at being a team.
good,"coworkers were great , management was horrible , definitely learned about different types of food and what different cultures enjoy , all around was good"
good,"Harrah's Cherokee is one of the largest employers in the region.  There are multiple departments where one may begin a career.  The benefits are great and there is the potential to earn a very good salary.  The ""casino life"" isn't for everyone as it is a 24/7, 365 operation that often requires long working hours.  However is this isn't an issue the place is great.  The one detractor for me is the petty behind the scenes politics/back stabbing.  It can easily cost someone their job."
good,"very good place to work for   awesome benefits,  You gain tons of guest service, co-workers are more like family look out for each other"
good,"I would of never left this company if it wasn't for an incident that I had."
good,"Monitored kitchen inventory and re-ordered food and supplies as needed. Maintained kitchen condition to standards exceeding health regulations. Prepared food cooked to order in a fast-paced, short-order diner. Supervised and trained restaurant staff including sous chefs and food handlers. Handled all aspects of food service management"
good,"I love working at the Caesars pool. Some of the coworkers there are great to work with and I like my management. This year has just been a roller coaster for me. I have felt exhausted and uninterested to come back to work recently. I feel like I'm the only one that works really hard. I feel like I don't deserve the kind of pay and treatment of my schedule that I've been getting. This manager, before he was suspended, pretty much destroyed the pool. People are working five days and 8 hours a day, instead of four days and 10 hours. I have had weeks where I worked six days in a row, even seven! I just can't deal with it anymore. This manager fired too many people way too easily. We are dangerously understaffed. I was working the opening shifts earlier in the season, but then I started taking summer classes. This changed my schedule to closing shifts. It was manageable at first, but once that manager made me close on the weekends and five days a week, I was very upset. I felt like my seniority didn't mean anything. I have more seniority than all of the lifeguards at the pool, and he gives me the worst schedules. I also just can't bear the heat outside. It's fine when I'm in the water, but having to clean and close the pool under these temperatures sucks. I sometimes regret coming back for a second season. There was no drama, no issues, and was just chill last season. Also the fact, that one of the newer lifeguards got the lead position instead of me is honestly insulting. I work hard, know the area, and willing to commit to any challenges I would have to face. At the same time,"
good,"If you Have no young Children and desire to be in a big party on the holidays, Casino Life is for you. Suggestions are not only taken but Rewarded for the best each month. This is a High Stress Customer Service Environment. If Guest are happy Things go well."
good,"Working at he horseshoe is great you deal with all different kinds of people and personalities, coworkers are awesome, would recommend"
good,"people I worked with were very friendly.  My immediate supervisor and his supervisor were great but upper management was to slow to address problems or acknowledge any improvement suggestions."
good,Job security might be sketchy depending on who you work with or under but good overall working conditions. Good associates to work with.
good,I would work with the servers in a high volume environment in a party atmosphere. I would have to make 150 to 200 drinks per hour for the servers to bring out to the playing guest.
good,"This was my first Front Desk job and I enjoyed it. I worked for many casinos before and I do enjoy Harrahs because they treat employees good. Everyone is trained for good customer service so no one is allowed to say, ""well thats your job, not mine."" Which I heard that many times before in different places. They trained me with the system to check people in & out. Gave me nice dress clothes uniform: Suit and tie. They also have this site its like amazon.com where we can buy everything we want but using our points, points you earn while you do your own job. So basically you are getting recognized for the work your doing which was awesome for me because I've worked for many jobs before that I would bust my butt working hard and I would never get no recognition for it and my bosses would say, ""Well I've never seen anything from you."" My supervisors are very supportive. "
good,Really enjoyed working here and meeting a lot of different people. Worked for an amazing guy while i was at this casino. Always something different when you go on a call.
good,Casinos are a fun and entertaining environment with great opportunities. Promotions and transfers from within are a plus. Benefits when given full time employment. The most enjoyable part is the entertainment while working and opportunity to see famous celebrities occasionally.
good,The environment is a fun and safe. My co-workers are all team players. I have learned to inspire others and be motivated so my team is motivated. The job does not have any challenges that stands out to me.  I have learned how to turn a bad situation into a good situation. I enjoy meeting new people daily.
good,Great place to work...everyone knows everyone and you aren't just a number.  This is the largest gaming corporation in the world.
good,The one thing that I think Harrah's/Caesar's Entertainment does well is that they don't necessarily look at the traditional things when choosing employees.  They didn't care that I had been out of work for eight months after my former place of employment closed.  They choose their employees based on whether or not they will fit and I think that's a really good thing.
good,"In a typical day I did data input, answering multiline phone system, customer service, assigning driver duties- runs, breaks and lunches, filing, faxes and emails, coordinating transportation for internal and external guests, computer proficient in- Microsoft office, creating Excel spreadsheets. The hardest part was supervising employees. The most fun was working with so many different departments to make things happen"
good,Started in Management Position.... Schedule was done by lottery process with 3rd Shift being the last to be chosen. Customer Service Training was exceptional.
good,"I really enjoyed my experience at Horseshoe. We would be on a table for 1 hour at a time then getting 20 min break where we could go eat in the cafeteria or go to the break room. To keep us ready to play we had dominoes and cards to pay with each other to keep sharp. "
good,"- Great people to work with."
good,its was job i would go to work 11 pm get off 7 am. assisted manager with conducting til audits.supervise and motivate staff to deliver best service. knowledgeable about events and ready to deliver.
good,Working at the Horse Shoe is very entertaining. It's were adults come to play and enjoy themselves. I like working at the casino and I've learned a lot about the casino life.
good,Great job with friendly co workers. A lot of time you can be over worked and the management team can use some tweaking. Great benefits.
good,"As much as I enjoy my job at the casino my chances of getting full time is very slim. I have a lot of experience with the warehouse aspect of the place and have learned valuable experience in the industry. I have been working there for 7+ years and the supervisors and fellow workers are great. The hardest part of the job is working different hours each week, but the most enjoyable part is going to work enjoying the day and having a productive day."
good,"Better pay and benefits than your average hotel. Decent job perks (hour paid lunch, employee cafeteria, employee gym). Management support and interaction is virtually non-existent. Preference is given based on seniority, rather than hard work and results. Culture is punch in, work hard, and punch out."
good,"I love to manage or work an event for 10 or 400 peoplto enjoy and learn a lot about as we work the event.  along side my co-worker. Theses event  could be for $ 500 or $50,000 most of our events all  always fun gathering in which I enjoy."
good,"I reconciled and reviewed point of sale reports on revenue for each outlet at 6 casinos. I processed AUR reports to the top sheets for settlements and revenue amongst food, beverage, and retail for each outlet. I communicated with managers at outlets regarding misc. revenue postings for accuracy on account classification. I audited weekly payroll submissions provided from casinos for gratuities received in room service, and reviewed emails including covers at bars or restaurants. I reviewed daily sales reports produced from weekly audits to resolve variances. Processed month-end journal entry and upload to LMS after daily sales are confirmed. Produced re-class journal entries on changes requested for the period adjustments. I reviewed Live Entertainment Tax calendar verifying appropriate tax was charged and recorded for the period. Tasked with completing daily deliverables and meeting reoccurring deadlines. Reconcile front of house non-gaming cash drops to system point of sales cash readings. I ensure accuracy of Over/Short reports used by operations for employee accountability and disciplinary purposes. I investigated and respond to departmental inquiries in a timely manner."
good,"My job entails giving creative direction and copy for our art on our mail pieces, and segment the data based on qualifications for each individual event or promotion. "
good,good work place great people work the supervisors are supportive
good,"Meeting and checking in people from many states and some time countries."
good,"Windows XP to Windows 7 Migration Team"
good,"I love working here, really enjoy going to work.  The hardest part of my job is the shifts provided.  The most wnjoyable part of my job is the atmosphere."
good,"Company has great benefits. They offer an employee gym, discounted show tickets.  They offer plenty of training classes for you to succeed and advance into other positions."
good,Supervised hourly security guards when supervisor was on his days off. Leared the State POLICIES REGARDING GAMBLING.
good,"A typical day at work is everyday is diffrent. you are given training to handle any situration, customer's or emergency."
good,"Horseshoe Casino is a wonderful place to work however, there are not enough hours for me to be able to support myself.   Management has decided to start scheduling by seniority and unfortunately I rarely get to be scheduled."
good,"Most days at a casino are the same."
good,"Being a management trainee in Las Vegas has truly broaden my horizon and opened up a world of possibilities for me. "
good,"I enjoyed working there. The co-workers were good hard working people and always willing to do more, so was i. Anyone that needs a part time job could work there."
good,"Typical day at work for EVS is cleaning and maintaining the casino floor. co-workers in all departments got along with each other, "
good,"Great Benefits, exciting atmosphere and managers that care."
good,"Horseshoe was a great company with great pay and good benefits. I loved my set schedule and how I could earn more hours if needed. I enjoyed seeing my guest come in and tell me about their winnings or loosings every night. I did not enjoy the work atmosphere at Horseshoe. At the time,we were having a few bad apples bringing their problems to work and the management expect the good apples to work when they told them too without moments notice."
good,"• Provide excellent patron experiences through phenomenal customer service, evidenced by high number of regular patrons requesting to sit in my sections. Ability to multi-task during high volume promotions."
good,"Coordinate group bookings of 13 or more guests for over 50+ venues, overseeing private events for VIP clients and high profile companies. Exceeded 2007 Goal."
good,"Hours of work were fine, fellow employees were fine, I would work for them again."
good,"Gaming Industry Hospitality, Work Days are rewarding when your regular customer base keeps returing"
good,"This is my first experience with a call center environment, and we preform all types of general HR functions, including directly handling FMLA, Leaves of Absence, and tuition reimbursements. Although I was already generally familiar with FMLA, this job has reinforced all aspects of the program. I've also become familiar with casino operations, union plans, and payroll for a larger company. The department is fairly new, and they're always trying to improve, but I find that we are always short staffed and frantic to make up time. Management has no power to correct this due to budgets. However, nearly everyone I work with is upbeat, and happy to pitch in...even with the negative nature of the work we do. The hardest part is dealing with negative people and being repetitive all day. Once you learn the job, there is no real challenge other than keeping up. The best part, and the part that keeps everyone going is each other. I work with some pretty awesome folks!"
good,I learned a lot about patience. Sometimes guest are edgy and verbal about things that are out of your control but thankfully for the professionalism that the training from this workplace provides its makes situations like this fairly easy.
good,"I learned to always keep a smile on your face, and to have a positive and upbeat attitude no matter what. It will make your work day go smoother."
good,This job enhances my ability to meet people. A fun place that made me progress my customer service capability.
good,Diverse company with many benefits. Opportunities to transfer departments and for advancement. Somewhat high turnover rate; there are lots of employees!
good,"Interesting, fun, and people oriented.  I was required to give great customer service and I did.  My job required a variety of skills to insure customer satisfaction."
good,Great place to work been there for 9 years just looking to create more income for my household. Have to save up for retirement so that I can enjoy the other rest of my life
good,"Working at Harrahs Casino has been a learning experience. The business of the F&B departments  (Buffet and Loung) will teach you the importance of patience, communication, and team work."
good,"I worked at a location that was in a low cost of living area, so the pay wasn’t awful. The worst thing you’ll ever have to deal with is the customers. But that’s any job you work with the public in."
good,Flexible and supportive.  Pay scale is competitive. Great insurance.  Leadership at local level is amazing.  Opportunity for advancement exist  at every level.
good,"With as many projects and properties that this company has it is full of opportunities. Whether you are a developer, support or anything in between there are chances to grow in experience and develop skills needed in other areas."
good,A very good and respectful company to work for. Mindful of diversity and inclusion and everyone is held to the highest ethical standards. Peers all work as team members with the greater good and strategies guiding actions.
good,Assist guest with any concerns in regards to their account and provide five-star service. Love management open door policy and great employee appreciation programs.
good,day to day was busy and always different however I left because of my manager he had poor communication skills and came off as rude and heartless to everyone
good,Great money ..horrible management.  It  use to be organized and professional. Currently everyone looks out for their selfs and place is very cut throat. No longer a happy up beat and positive environment.
good,"meet and greet guest as they walk by or sit at your table, exchange customers money for casino chips, deal the game that customers decide to sit down at"
good,Great people and place. I learned a lot during my time there. They have very good associates with a lot of passion for taking care of the guest and each other.
good,"I came back to work for a different position (front desk), and the management there was a struggle and there when there were problems, they say they'll fix it, but they don't. But I like how they train newbies for a month before they go upfront."
good,Working for Caesars was great. Management and co-workers felt like family. Great working environment. Learned a variety of customer service skills. I also had to learn CPR as take a lifeguard class after being hired. New positions and opportunities were readily available within the company. Management worked with conflicting schedules. Everyone worked as a team and was true to the mission. One of the most enjoyable working experiences.
good,I was recruited by Caesars from an outside vendor. They groomed me and advanced me as I was ready. Entrusted me with projects and  gave me opportunities to grow.
good,I enjoyed working at HGC as my co-workers were my work family.  We all worked hard and helped each other and that created a strong bond between employees.
good,"Not a bad place to work. More of a single persons work atmosphere. One manager there thinks she runs the entire show, and she pretty much does. She likes to flex her ability to control every move the place makes, regardless what the other managers say."
good,"Fun exciting place to work , Always something to due. They never close. Management is fun and out going. Working long hour when short staffed. Bonding with other managers."
good,I have learned so much since I have been in this department. The diversity is matched to none. A typical day can be fun as long as you prioritize your workload.
good,Army Commendation Medal/ Army Good Conduct Medal/ National Defense Service Medal/ Afghanistan Campaign Medal/ Two Campaign Stars/ Global War on Terrorism Service Medal/ Army Service Ribbon/ Overseas Service Ribbon/ Armed Forces Reserve Medal/
good,"Caesars Palace is a really good place to work. There is never a dull day. As long as you work hard, you will be recognized and rewarded. My team was like a family and we all helped take care of each other. I would definitely work there again!"
good,"You get paid really well and you can always put in overtime but sometimes its mandatory 6 days a week so you work a lot and its very tiring. Also, they almost expect you to not have a social life. It's hard to attend school and work here."
good,It is a fun atmosphere to work in as a poker dealer.   95% of money earned is from tips.  Upper management needs to be on floor ore often to see what dealers say about increasing more revenue.
good,"I’ve been with Caesars over a decade.  There are good tones and bad times, great leadership and not so great leadership that will always impact any company and if they are good to work for.  With our new ceo I have seen improvement but unfortunately advancement opportunities continuously get removed."
good,This was a good place to work unfortunately they made some financial decisions they made it necessary to make changes in there employee base.  Having to reduce salaried upper management.
good,I like working for this employer because it created stabilityin my life and career but it needs more improvement on how to help employees to achieve a career advancement. The hierchy model that is in place doesn't seem to balance the entire company as a whole but I do believe in due time since the company just came out of bankruptcy recently - this is something I'm hoping will improve in the future.
good,"Mainly you have to be upbeat and positive to every guests, no matter what kind of attitude they come in with or leave out with. The key thing that they looking for is to suggest the best to the guests."
good,This was one of my first jobs outside school in my chosen education field. Though compensation still left me sub 20k/yr it was a good experience with knowledgable leadership to get some experience
good,Working here has allowed me to advance my skills and learn new ones.   This is a place where guests and guest needs always have a high level of importance and I pride myself on delivering more than the guest expects.
good,Harrah's is a good company to work for.  One issue staying with this company long term is trying to move up.  The only real way to move up far in this company is to transfer locations.  I enjoyed being a dealer or a supervisor but am finally fed up with the attitudes you have to deal with everyday from the players.
good,"I work in the mornings so I get all of the employees ready for the opening of the casino. I have to place the daily supply order, process payroll, train employees as needed and monitor the daily activity on the casino floor to insure guests are taken care of."
good,"Tuve una gran experiencia al trabajar para esta compañía ya que he contado con personas que siempre están disponibles para enseñarte, y ayudarte,en fin se hace un gran equipo de trabajo,me encantó trabajar para esta compañía y creo que volvería a trabajar para ellos."
good,"A job is a job so Harrah's would be one of the best workplace. Competitive, fast paced, and teamwork.  I work with several different guests, coworkers, etc."
good,"We had just opened the new poker room, the thing was huge. Fun and exciting work environment. Made alot of money there, as things were booming in Las Vegas."
good,"Solid company to work for..."
good,My time at Caesars was the start of my career and appreciate the experience I gained with the changes throughout the years. I am glad to have survived there as long as I did.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company for 7 years because of strong job security and great compensation. However, the hustle and bustle wore on me, and i realized I would rather have less stress for lower compensation."
good,"Great place to work, just don't work in the buffet. Anywhere else is great. Union is great and fair to employees. They pay is great and the benefits are nice as well."
good,"Management takes what should be a great job, and makes you want to leave. Pay and benefits are good. VP makes life miserable for everyone and is not held accountable."
good,"Caesars is a good company to work for they have a lot to offer and they treat their employees respectfully. They are always on top of their work, they are always finding new ways to benefit their employees in every way possible as well."
good,"As soon as I arrive, I inspect and ensure all rental equipment is in working order.  Check to make sure all paperwork associated with the equipment is accurate and up to date.  I then begin to evaluate my team of employees on their daily performance by conducting individual spotlights during their everyday operations.  I provide feedback and coaching to the team on those evaluations.  I create a break schedule for the team and make sure to have enough employees on the floor so things continue to run smoothly.   "
good,"Lots of opportunity for advancement at this casino. I have been promoted 3 times in less than 5 years. The casino lifestyle is not for everyone, but Harrah's Cherokee does their best to minimize the casino impact on your life."
good,"Generally a low pressure, relative enjoyable place to work.  One of the few employers who actually pays the bonuses they promise.  Good work life balance.  However, management values youth and diversity putting whites in general, and older white males in particular at a disadvantage.  I witnessed HR personnel openly mocking older workers and lamenting the fact that the unions made it difficult to ""get rid"" of older workers."
good,"The senior leadership really looks out for their employees. 401k Matching, generous pto, and one of the best medical benefits packages I've ever had. That being said, if you don't have a day shift job, don't expect to ever have a normal work/life balance. Every department segments their shifts' start times differently, and most require you to come in for a pre-shift meeting 15-30 minutes before the shift starts. Added to the inability to live nearby (the casino is on a reservation where only members of the tribe are allowed to own homes) makes for long commutes for some employees, this can turn your workday from an eight-hour shift to a nine or ten-hour endeavor. "
good,"A large multi unit venue with Casino"
good,its based on food industry. happy to work employees are very friendly. some time very busy in work but all staffs are supported to each other. love this company
good,"Ok to work for, expect a lot and has seasonal hours. The casino gives you opportunities for advancement and it's easy to move around in the company. It's ok"
good,"Working at Caesars is okay. Great benefits but ridgid schedules for emts. Its what you make it, like everywhere else. I worked graveyard shift."
good,"It is a pleasure to work for Caesar's Entertainment. The environment is very upbeat and happy, for the most part. I have gained a lot of knowledge within the surveillance department but would love to see what else is out there for me."
good,"This is a constant upbeat position where you have to promote luck with every interaction. Lots of walking around and on your feet all day. Good place for growth, and perfect for the ones that loves talking to customers."
good,"Great opportunity to start IT career, with exposure to a variety of different technologies, from Networking to point of sales, AS400, AIX"
good,Management is overall caring and is dedicated to talent development though opportunities can be lacking.  There are a group of very talented people here.
good,"I have been with the company for almost 6 years, "
good,"Direct our environmental service employees in their daily functions of maintaining the cleanliness of the casino and the Horseshoe facility. Duties include but not limited to, making sure that policies and standard operating procedures are followed in a safe and efficient manner.  Other responsibilities are, new hire orientation, training, inventory, payroll, audits and employee review and documentation.  Emphasizing team work and creating a service with a passion attitude."
good,Typical day was ensuring staff and customers were always happy and had what was needed to be successful.With management I learned that I had to manage a gumbo of different personalities. My co-workers were fun to work with and focused on achieving the same goals. The hardest part about the job was working 12 to 15 hour work days and not having any family time The most enjoyable part was seeing the customers happy and enjoying themselves.
good,Horseshoe is a great company.  I worked for them for 15 years.in four different positions. The last ten years as a poker dealer where I got to interact with the public.
good,"Employees are very valued. Long days, but the pay and benefits are worth it. There are a lot of advancement opportunities."
good,Everyday involved playing games and having fun with different groups of people. I learned how to manage a positive attitude amongst wide varieties of people and being able to handle angry individuals. I also learned how to handle drunks and get them safely escorted from the premises. The managers I had were always fun and handled situations that arose effectively and quickly.
good,"I worked there for 20 years, the money was good, my peers were fantastic. The company overextended their credit position and had to make tough cuts.  Like any corporation it is all about making money."
good,"No one is just an employee, everyone is family.  The pace is quick, not boring.  There's always something new to learn.  All of the employees take care to help each other out when needed.  For the most part it runs like a well-oiled machine.  The hardest part of the job, for me, would be the 10-11 hour days."
good,I really enjoy meeting and interacting with new people and this job allowed me to do that. The only thing that I don't like with working in a casino is the strict rules and the tendency for mass firings when business is slow
good,"I enjoy the interpersonal relationships with my co-workers, and other dept. personnel.  I company has an advancement potential, but upward mobility is sometimes very scarce.  My typical day is anything but that.  From medical calls, to lost and found items, to taking care of high rollers, each day can and is sometimes challenging."
good,"Interesting workplace, not too much to remember but when you get an angry guest it make it hard. Management is decent but never stable. Pay is good but hours and shifts are 0 stars"
good,"Day starts with setting up the bar.  Filling up the ice, making sure bar is wiped down, stocking up if anything is missing, cut fruit for garnishes, set up sanitize buckets. When restaurant opens up provide menus to guests and take care of whatever needs they may have such as beverage and take food orders. I've learned various drinks and how to provide outstanding customer service. As far as management goes there is a lot of turnover and it varies with every one that comes aboard. Co-workers are fun and outgoing, keep positive attitudes and keep the atmosphere fun and upbeat. Hardest part of the job is when we get busy and dealing with multiple guests all at once. Most enjoyable part of my job is providing cocktails to guests and building relationships. Love when my guest leaves with a wonderful experience and comes back because of it."
good,"Horseshoe Hammond, Harrah's Entertainment Inc and Harrah's Shreveport are all part of Caesars Entertainment.  Always something new to learn.  The IT department is ran pretty good for this company."
good,"I cross trained and worked between about 5 different positions. All positions included interacting with guest and players that spent a lot of money at the casino so customer service was key. I answered phones, sat guests at tables, served guest, made drinks, closed out checks, etc. Management and co-workers were like family. We were required to work holidays and weekends so we were always together."
good,"Working for Caesars is very exciting at time. My normal day is coming in 30 minutes early start at 7am taking calls from fellow employees in all locations from Las Vegas to Atlantic City. "
good,"I really enjoyed Harrah's great benefits, nice bonus package. Caesars over monopolized on the Las Vegas strip, This led to too much inner competition for the gamers annual spending budget."
good,"My day consists of assisting guests with the Total Rewards experience.  Any time there is a question, my co-workers are ready to assist."
good,Great place to work. Very few of the management could be done without. Excellent benefits. Great employees to work with. The hardest part of the job was working extremely long hours due to being shorthanded.
good,a typical day at work is most of the time fast paced because we are a business that is open 24hours. I learned to deal with the many moods of customers especially the intoxicated ones. my co-workers just do what they have to do to work as  a team. Sometimes the hardest part of the job is seeing people reactions of being intoxicated they can put their selves or another guest in danger. The most enjoyable part of the job is the atomosphere is so alive and theres never a dull moment of working at a casino.
good,"A typical day at work is an 8-9hr shift of helping customers, cash handling, cashing in winnings for chips or cash, balancing in and out of drawer.30 min and 1hr lunches, the lunches are great and you get the chance to meet alot professional people."
good,Co-workers are fun to work with and work well together. Hardest part of the job is sometimes you work longer hours than expected.
good,A typical Night at Harrahs was on the weekend when all the drunk and friendly people come in and they tell you how much they love New Orleans and how they want to come and gamble all they money because they can to have a good time. Sometime Celebs come and talk to us it make our day go by. I learned that some people with money are very rude and very fun when intoxicated. Our managers use to try and have fun with us. Co-Workers were more like family because you see them more then your family. the hardest part of the job was staying up overnight after the crowd die down but I love interacting with people
good,great company. good work life balance. bad pay. good management. good projects.
good,A typical day at work would be working with my team to be sure their day goes smoothly. Work through any problems that need to be dealt with. I have been with Caesars for 18 years. I have learned so much in my time that I was there. I really enjoyed volunteering for the Hero events to help others.
good,"In working at Harrah's Casino, I learned a lot of beneficial elements to help me  to excel in furthering my career in the beauty industry. The managing team that was involved in maintaining the spa kept every employee up to speed with those elements that were needed in producing a conducive workplace."
good,"1st casino I ever worked at, it was fun and exciting . enjoyed my co-workers. loved working with people and learning so much as time went on. New games. lots of fun."
good,this is a decent place to work depending on whaat you want to do. they offer 2 weeks of hr training which is great for people skills later on as well. they pay overtime and pto time.
good,I have worked for Caesars Entertainment for the past 17 years. If you are willing to work hard and take risks this company is for you. I have learned so much when dealing with the public. Co-Workers are wonderful as I have not had hardly any bad experiences.
good,Working for the riverboat casinos takes a special person.  You have to be dedicated and ready to work hard.
good,I had a great time there.  I was never bored.  My shift flew by.  My manager was wonderful.
good,room for advancement but have to stay on top of applications
good,Excellent work and play Environmnet - Happy work envirnment with great people
good,"1 hr. Break and free lunch. Hard work lifting heavy luggage. There were some great customers, some co-workers was lazy."
good,"Harrah's Entertainment has always been fast pace place to work. Opportunity for advancement was never an issue, and if you are willing to put in the extra time and leg work the company would reward you with recognition and promotions."
good,They like to promote within so no matter where you start if you work hard you can advance. The long hours make it difficult to have a work life balance.
good,"It was a great place to work, and was a great job opportunity and learning experience. I first took order on I-pad and the switched to Bar-tending. "
good,I enjoyed my job as well as my coworkers it's a great advancemnet place to work
good,"Supervise dealers, give guest service, maintain bankrolls."
good,"A typical day at the Horseshoe was one that was very busy, with guest. Constantly cashing in coins, tickets and paying out jackpots. The hardest part of the job was standing constantly, the only time you sat down was during your breaks."
good,Caesars Entertainment is a great company to work for. It is a fast paced environment and always changing. I throughly enjoy coming to work everyday because I have a great department and team members. Management challenges employees but believes in making the work environment fun. I believe that I have learned skills and knowledge that I would not have received anywhere else. 
good,"I would handle between 50 and 100 calls per 8 hour shift, while talking to guests in person and dealing with front desk, bell staff and coat check staff.  During all this, I would be verifying employee hours for payroll, issuing keys to guests, checking rooms for cleanliness.  It was a fast paced work environment that required strong multi-tasking skills as well as working with little or no supervision (often I was the only management there for the whole hotel)."
good,The job was fun in enjoying at first  as the weeks  go by supplies was getting harder to fine some Co.worker  do not know the mineing of team work.  I'm a team player  in that was so heartbreaking . I trust  management  to do they part .  I have  a new job opportunity now the pay is Dollars more so I Resigned
good,Harrah's employess and customers are the BEST in the Delaware Valley
good,I really enjoyed my time at the company. The management & staff were easy to get along with and talk to.
good,"Excellent for growth. Company education is available & offered to all. Demanding at times, Management can be a bit narrow-minded....""out of the box"" ideas not readily accepted."
good,"good working environment, fast pace, organizing projects in addition to parts ordering,inventory, moving slot machines, etc."
good,"A typical day was just cleaning tables and sorting dishes for washing, and assist the waitresses with customer service."
good,When have bad customer
good,"a typical day at work is pretty much the same thing everyday, i learned to deal with customers and their different moods and humors, i have learned to be a better person by dealing with difficult situations in a better manner. my co-workers are the best, i have worked with them for years and they make the day even better. the hardest part of the job is probably when im standing there waiting for our line to go down, (as a cashier we cant let the line go to far, then we gotta stop), especially cause i like to be a busy person. the most enjoyable part is when i can leave a customer with a smile on their face cause i did somethin nice for the and made their day."
good,A typical work day at harrahs is like a usual casino. It was a exciting fun and desirable atmosphere. Talking and meeting new people everyday and making the customer feel welcome and acknowledging them wether they were winning or losing.
good,"A typical day would be looking forward to a wonderful day of delivering great service,and meet the expectation of the customer."
good,delt craps and interacted with customers and fellow employes. Followed any instructions bye my supervisor
good,"It as not only a great place to work because of the clientel, the majority of co-workers and supervisors were very good at what we did and were dedicated enough to get it done whenever it was required."
good,Company is good. It has a high turnover rate from what I could tell but that is understandable with jobs that employ so many people. It’s a casino so the future may not be as optimistic with everything moving online.
good,I am a part time disabled employee. My work is sufficient enough for what I need. It's a Good Company to work for it you work for it. I am able to get some of my needs met. Job location and commute isn't working for me right now.
good,"I have been extremely satisfied with my own department but have seen things that make me understand that on a high level, all employees are seen as expendable"
good,"I enjoy working for Caesars entertainment. Management is excellent, and work conditions are usually comfortable. The pay is good. Employee moral seems very high, making it easy to do my job."
good,"it was great for just a summer job and the people i worked with was fine. most of everything there was good, and so there is nothing more to say about it."
good,"I enjoyed working for Caesars entertainment. The benefits are great and you meet a lot of good employees. The management is a different story, at least in my department. They were never on the floor and the only time you met with them is when yuh were in trouble. Unfortunately I was terminated without cause and won my unemployment compensation case."
good,"I was working there 3 years and as a whole it was a good experience.  There was a management change in our department, and it threw the call center into a tailspin.  They were required to do tasks with an insufficient amount of staff. I hope things are better now."
good,"The hard work, and long hours pay off with work that you can be proud of. The teams work together, we become friends and family and make coming to work fun. You can spend 10+ here no problem."
good,"They need better management, its enjoyable work but the supervisors don't have your back. The casino its friendly place. I learned time management, cross training."
good,"The collections team was responsible for preparing statements, applying payments, depositing markers and collecting debt on past due balances for all 29 properties nationwide."
good,Great workplace. They really strive to improve the culture both for employees but also for guests. You will be challenged and pushed to succeed in the best of ways.
good,It was a good place to work. I enjoyed it but there’s a lot of favorites in certain departments. Long hours and was always asked to work on my days off. I felt like I had no time to myself.
good,"The company promotes a""Green"" environment. It is Culturally diverse, which promotes cultural understanding Management has a high level of Customer service expectations, which prepares its employees the ability to work in any area of customer service. It is a fast paced environment with many facets.This allows its employees the ability to multi-task in any arena. "
good,"Senior leadership, human resource, and managers all have own agenda's and don't always to the right thing. HR has to much turnover and takes to long to review cases."
good,Caesars is a great place to be introduced to the civilian world as a transitioning military member. They truly appreciate their vets and will go out of their way to help them out.
good,"work hard under appreciated,"
good,"Caesars is a very large company with a lot of opportunity for advancement with its many properties. I feel like the company as a whole is currently in a rebuilding phase and is working out a lot of kinks which makes some days more difficult than others but, all in all I have learned a lot of valuable knowledge that will last a life time."
good,Met a lot of fun people in the company. Learned a lot of skills and experienced ups and downs. Learned different systems and some techniques. Hard work.
good,"While working for Harrah's, Hurricane Katrina hit the Louisiana/Mississippi Gulf Coast.  We were all affected by this disaster.  I was proud of our company and how it responded to not only its employee needs but to the needs of the communities that were affected."
good,"A company that offers virtually any opportunity someone is willing to go after.  "
good,"good place to work.  Just did not want to see it end like it did. Found out on the news it was closing.  Coworkers were like family."
good,"Caesars is structured and they invest in training, management is committed specially to employee satisfactions, benefits are great and tones of events. Best part of job is the people, toughest part is the union"
good,"Horseshoe was a good place to work, the staff was friendly and willing to help the new people learn as much as possible. As apart of security we was the front of the house always having that positive upbeat attitude"
good,I would love to continue with Caesars Entertainment If the right opportunity becomes available! .......................................................
good,Its fast past and you must be a people peson. You must be willing to learn new things and be able to adjust to change. Being upbeat and positive and be ready to stand by you brand.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Harrah's, the management was very proactive & we were treated fairly, I would recommend this employer to anyone. Harrah's is very customer service oriented."
good,I was on-call so I didn't receive all the benefits or vacation pay.  They push Total Rewards Reps to sell Visa's creating a lot of stress for us and clients.  But a very good environment to work otherwise.  They offer good training and encouragement.  People there really do want to see you succeed.
good,"On a regular day at harrahs, is fun, fast pace, warm , chill kind of day...Then you have the days where is management is riding you because their manager is riding them... They work on a point system and only allow you to get up to 12 point.... Overall its not a bad place to work if u can balance your outside life"
good,"Las Vegas strip! Beautiful hotel and casino! Employees are held to very high standards of service so one must bring their ""A"" game always! One can be proud to carry such a name as Caesar's Palace on their resume'!"
good,I have worked for several casinos and found Harrah’s to be too big for its own good.  Massive buyouts  of other casino companies made their holdings too large to effectively manage.
good,"Caesars entertainment is leading gaming  business for one reason.  The know how to treat their employees! From top to bottom, no matter what your title is or who you know. Caesars entertainment is #1"
good,"Does have career advancement opportunities, just have to do your job and not complain about it, be sure the job you’re applying for you can do and manage if you want to move up the corporate ladder. Majority of the workers are great employees, some are lazy like the rest. Some management decisions could be much better in terms of the company and for the employees, but for a casino, it’s the best one to work at."
good,"I learned new things every day, work was always something new, it was hard but fun, I miss working their. you had fun with what you did. they showed you how they appreciated you."
good,You feel as if you are always under review. They have occasional review for all employees. Like random recordings of you with secret shoppers. Pretty annoying if you ask me.
good,"Some days were better than others. I learned excellence in customer care. Management was stressful when it came to meeting goals to the point where it became overwhelming. Due to favoritism the work environment became very hostile. The hardest part was trying to accommodate to guest needs with not much management guidance, there was always grey areas. The greatest part was the people I worked with and those I supervised."
good,"I enjoy working where I am. I have never worked at a place, as long as I have here. Working here, it is like one big family. I have many friends, from all departments. Co- workers, and even some of the guests. Truly care."

good,"great place to work lots of guest daily ,management is very understanding and work with staff to make every day a good day.Lunch is free,breaks are one hour."
good,"Good place to work. Management very fair. Unloaded incoming trucks at shipping docks during morning hours, Delivered promotional setups with straight truck to certain sites. Also picked up food that was needed for casino at US foods / Sisco foods in Jessup MD.  Learned food management orders to the casino restaurants. Hardest part of job on the dock was high turn over rate. For some reason could not retain employees for long period of time. Best part of job was the benefits and free food."
good,This company hasn't improved with their employees  within the first year of the grand opening. Hopefully they will one day. With great responsibility comes great sacrifice.
good,the work environment is laid back and co-worker are friendly and helpful.  The training is very thorough and easy.  The adherance abd attendance policy is strict but fair.
good,Caesar is a great company to work for provided that you are given hours. The majority of the call center is union meaning everything is based on seniority. The only draw backs are they tent to over hire making hour a bit limited.
good,Good pay and benefits. upbeat and steady work pace. supportive work environment with access to build relations with other departments. computer system needs to be simplified. Too many logons and screens that prevent proficiency.
good,Caesars was a great company to work for.  It provided a great life for my family.  Day to day operations were fast paced on the spot decision making.  Enjoyed working with FOH employees and guests.
good,I enjoyed the culture in the Harrah's Reservation call center. We were expected to have fun with our customer's and each other. I enjoyed the quarterly Casino Night and earning Harrah's Bucks to play games or win contests. It was fast paced but a great place to work!
good,I enjoy assisting and providing excellent customer service to all departments.  Overall the company works as a team and we as team players.  I enjoy my job.
good,It is pay oriented place where you work more that what you are paid.With a little training need to work more. They expect more perfection with a little training and guidance.
good,Great enviroment to work in. Fast paced always on the go. Sometimes you get to meet some celebrity guest. Communication is key to a efficient operation.
good,Caesars is a great company to work for with an environment that makes everyone feel like family.  If advancement is available this company is perfect for someone looking for a career.
good,"the job never allows for boredom because the pace is very fast and enjoyable at the same time if it is in your nature to keep busy at all times."
good,"I will be forever grateful to the opportunity to work for this company. I was given a chance to prove myself and grow with a company that gave me the useful tools to preform my job.that being said this job is a hospitality job at a 24/7 operation therefore the hours can be very taxing on your personal life, and it feels as though you get slowly consumed with work life and rarely feel like you have time outside of work. I did it for almost 3 years working almost every major holiday and weekends. With that being said i needed to find a job less stressful and where i could get my PTO that always seems impossible to take when you needed it the most. I love the people i work with on a daily basis , and my direct boss was a pleasure to work with and for, but the wear and tear on my mental state far outweighed me loyalty to an organization who in current form is more worried about the bottom line and budget than helping departments who are struggling in the manpower department. At the end of the day i will never bad mouth individuals or the company as a whole but the current direction that my property is heading i feel as though my talents and life force are better utilized somewhere else. thanks again for the opportunity,"
good,"*Fast pasted work."
good,"I learned and experienced a whole new type of hospitality environment at Horseshoe. Very demanding, high paced, food quality and an incredible staff to accommodate customer relations."
good,"The work load was very demanding, but also productive. I produced graphics and publications on events we held to drive and promote business, revenue, and customer loyalty. I treated this job as my own business and realized that the harder I worked, the more beneficial it was for me. I contacted established customers to build relationships and maintain loyalty as well as built new leads and drove new business. The work place culture was fun and exciting, as well as demanding and ever-changing. I learned how to network and build relationships, increase revenue and manage high worth accounts and maintain their profitability, put together P&L's for special events we hosted to promote the brand, how to manage and run a special event, and much more. I enjoyed every aspect of this job, but the hardest part was learning how to find creative ways to deny some requests of our loyal customers while not offending them and offering them alternatives to still keep them happy and maintain their loyalty."
good,The casino was a great work place because you learn new things in the casino. I advance to difference positions in the casino.
good,Overall a great place to work for. Only complaint would be that I wish management and directors were more honest and forth coming with information. (I.e. Telling employees something isn't going to happen when all other departments know and then the information turns out to be true.)
good,"I enjoyed working there. I was let go due to pregnancy in late 2015."
good,You create a bond with the team when you open up a new property that is great.  The best part of the job was the team that we had and dealing with the guests.
good,I been employed at this company for 10 years and at no point there has being a Thank You for being loyal to the company.This company does not appreciate their employees. Only worries about making money.
good,I really enjoyed working at Harrah's Entertainment. Working at Harrah's Entertainment was a pleasure until they outsourced our jobs. I was able to take advantage of their tuition program.
good,"I absolutely loved this job.  I was fortunate enough to continue to take on projects and more responsibility than others in my position.  Unfortunately, promotions came hard to come by due to employees being loyal and sticking around.  Someone would have to retire in order to get promoted."
good,Great company culture with opportunities for advancement and great benefits. Management staff worked hard to develop the talents of subordinates.
good,Many events happen at Horseshoe Casino. Anything from concerts to private parties. It was a lot of fun working in this fast paced environment. I met a ton of really awesome people. Some were co-workers and some were customers.

good,"a typical day is very energetic with all the exciting guests! I've new ways to sell and treating the guest in a respectful, playful, welcoming way. Management thrives to make you better! Co-workers are a mini family away from home. the hardest part of the job is to not have fun! Enjoyable part is always meeting new people and learning about where there from!"
good,"I was only there a short time.  Overall good place to work.  Culture is fun, yet challenging and many changes.  Fun environment."
good,"Must be self motivated and independent. Supportive Management, Competitive Salary, Work from Home, New Business Development, Selling Las Vegas and Atlantic City."

Also, my co-workers and I are friendly to each other. We help and treat each other with respect. We have fun talking to each other during breaks. "
good,"Initial supervisor meetings to go over days activities and any new info. Prepare attendant pre-shift meeting for new shift. Various  themes and info with question period. This was a great way to check everyone on shift and answer any concerns. Using a software program that tracked players, I could locate and meet up with important patrons.This Bally program was also used to locate lost tickets and /or theft. I had a radio and called for an attendant or technician when needed. Check break times for staff and monitor my area."
good,"It was a very nice place to work, meeting new people every day, and being respected by my peers and guests. The environment while working there was fast-paced and energetic."
good,"I loved my co-workers at Harrah's, we was like family. the company overall was better when it was the Grand Casino. Like any company, Harrah's had it's up and downs. I enjoyed working their for those seven and half years."
good,A typical day at work for me is making sure that Bally's is clean for the guests. Cleaning around my area vacuuming if needed and maintaining the bathrooms. I learned how to do my job in a faster way and still keep it clean. Management is good they make sure you have all the stuff you need to do your job. My co-workers are great as we all work together to get things done in a timely fashion. The hardest part of the job is doing more with less. In theses hard economic times we have had to do more with less staff. The best part of the job is working with all my longtime friends to make the day go by fast and help the company be at it's best.
good,"Most nights were quiet, but when problems occurred my co-workers were there to back me up. The assistant casino managers treated everyone with respect, and didn't hesitate to sit down and talk with us and treat us with respect."

good,"This was a job where I can gladly say I was excited to go into work.  With the amazing co-workers I had, and friendly management there, it was always a great place to be.  It taught me many skills and responsibilities too, such as proper customer service and keeping count of large quantities of items, along with organizing said items."
good,"The fastest of all the work paces. I would provide customers with change , pay outs and any other request the guest needed. I learned to pay attention to money, peoples behavior, and requirements of work. Management changed every day.Co workers where focused on providing the best service we could for the customers. The hardest part of the job was working so much away from the family through holidays and  personal events. The most enjoyable part was providing a good service and the peers recognizing it ."
good,"Working for the casino involves very up close contact with with the general public. Responsibilities include security of the people and property. Although I have had a lot of experience in customer service, I did learn different typ of customer service skills based on the type of business.but that involves the most enjoyable part of the is seeing the fun people have at the casino, especially when the win."
good,"If you work in retail or non union job, you will be underpaid. My suggestion is to get a job that is union, guaranteed more money and benefits."
good,"Watch dealers and guests, customer service."

In addition, reviewing ageing accounts, working with collections team, responding to emails, approving adjustments, and preparing reports. The management team was a very good group to work with. They were all very knowledgeable in their field. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers they were a great group of people.

The hardest part of the job is keeping up with promotions and guest complaints. The most enjoyable part of my job is being surrounded with people who treat you like a family."

good,My working at the company has been a great experience. The people sre good and I enjoy what I do as a credit clerk. In the position their is so much to learn because of so many different circumstances and the different properties you deal with and all the different people you come in contact with over the phone.

good,Working for this company and the staff was a pleasure. If I were to return to New Jersey I would definetly want to return to them.
good,"Benefits are excellent, health insurance and prescriptions are a paid benefit by the employer. Company discounts with vendors and drawings for prizes."
good,Definitely a fun place to work although certain departments is not managed properly. Very strict attendance policy and no grace period. Attendance is accumulated by points. Definitely has good benefits and this is a place you can grow in your career.
good,Corporate training is top-notch for management. Business is grossly under-staffed causing low moral for employees. Upper management empowers lower management to make decisions without repercussions.
good,Very comfortable and a good atmosphere to work... Management is very attentive wen need.. Your able to try different positions along with able to move up to management or supervisors which ever you desire.. It’s family oriented.. Harrah’s provides fun and family functions barbecues games etc.. just a very respectful place to work with..

good,Dynamic experience with daily challenges and new experiences. Good benefits and work environment. Opportunities to grow through career building programs.
good,"I remember loving my first season working at the pools at Caesars. I couldn't wait to come back the next season. Unfortunately for my second season, a new assistant manager was hired, and me and my coworkers were not pleased with him. He was rude, lazy, and kept firing my coworkers even though we are super low on staff. I even had coworkers leave or quit because they couldn't deal with him anymore. It was such a mess working my second season. This was until he got fired in the middle of the season. Afterwards, the season got so much better and some of the new coworkers we got became long term friends. I've always loved the management team, except that one assistant manager. As much as I loved working there, I needed to work somewhere with more pay, but I was picky on only lifeguard positions at the time. I'm looking forward to try out other positions and would be open to go back to Caesars."
good,"It is difficult to get raises. It is done thru testing but getting someone to setup the test for you was extremely difficult. Other than that, it was a enjoyable place to work."
good,"Working for one of the largest companies in this state is a privilege, years ago this was the number one place to visit and work.over the years it has changed and it's become more strictly managed.the rules and policies don't always come consigned with the union contracts for union employees that's the down side oworking there if you have"

good,"I enjoyed working for Harrah's Casino and Hotel.  I enjoyed working with my team as well as the customers that frequent the casino.  If my position had not been eliminated, I think I still may be there."
good,Can be a challenging place to work some days given the relationship between management and employees but overall a good place to work / start your career.
good,"They work with you and the hours are doable (split-shift). However, it is easy to make enemies as I found out. It was still a very fun job regardless and the pay was absolutely great!"

good,It was an amazing place to work . Everyone is very helpful and full of energy . My coworkers helped me learn and grow and I appreciate them so much for that.
good,"Harrah's is at the center of New Orleans downtown. It's an eneregic place to work with lots of tourism and locals in which you interact with. Due to the city working on the streets, parking is an issue in which you would have to leave home early for."
good,"27 years that must’ve liked it.  Made a lot of money, made a lot of friends. Took care of the customers very well! My father worked there 23 years before myself!"
good,The benefits are great. You can make a cooperative living here. There is smoking on the premises so that can be a problem. Its a high pace society. Would recomend.
good,"Shift review, set up schedule, manage up to 30 officers, very fast pace.  hardest part of job customer satisfaction, and risk management. Working with others."
good,Company went through a major transition period during the economic downturn and now is in process of growing.  The company is expanding in new ventures such as Brand Hotel of a non-gaming nature.
good,Harrah's is a good place to work.  The atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  I have a good boss.  My coworkers are excellent.  The pay is good.  And paid time off is liberal.

good,Used my customer service and management skills to conduct a well organized entertainment establishment in fast paced conditions. Managed table games employees as well as customers experience.
good,I relocated and this was the first job for me in this area.  I met a lot of people that I am still in contact with today.  Learned a lot about the gaming industry while working there.  Met some celebrities that I probably wouldn't have met otherwise
good,"The casino hold tips for everybody and share it equally along with the paycheck, was fun, a lot of people from all over the world, good environment and good friendship."
good,I was a table games supervisor. I learned a lot of lessons in management. The pace was fast and fun. The hardest parts of the job is seeing people lose their money and missing time with my family. I really enjoyed the job but hated the cigarette smoke.

good,"I worked for Caesars Entertainment for three years. It was fast paced and had a regular clientele. I would still be working for the company, but I choose to relocate to South Carolina where Caesars Entertainment does not have any property."
good,I did not work in this potion long enough to give a detailed review on how things run due to it changing daily. It can be busy one day and quiet the next. Some of the servers can be nice and sometimes they aren't so nice.

good,"highly technical,friendly .Manager and team was awesome"
good,I found Caesar's to be an enjoyable place to work because the co-workers & management are great people & make a great team for the business.  They show professionalism in every aspect of the business & interact in a pleasant manner.
good,I loved working for Ceasars Ent.  I thought that it was a great company to work for and I loved my job.  The managers were personable and easy to work with. In the casino it is difficult to move forward once you are a supervisor and there is no flexibility when it comes to scheduling.
good,"for the most part a typical day is very pleasant, i find that the nicer you are to the customers the better reaction  you get from them, the managers are very nice and always there to help when you need them. the culture is very nice, we have all different types of races and we all get along very well, we are all on the same page and that is to provide the best customer service possible the hardest thing about the job is not having sometimes all the information available to assist the guest. the most enjoyable part of my job is when i provide and give the best possible customer service that i can give."

good,Company has many hotels under one umbrella and has lots of opportunities for advancement in your department or in different area.  Great employee benefits!

good,"Everyday was different, some days were slow paced other days were fast paced. There's always something going on here. They love their employees and they do so many things to show it!"
good,"There was never a bordering day at work. Very fun environment, great for people that are sociable. The management was great, we was supported by a great team."
good,Staff levels in every department diminished during the past 17 years with company. Vegas economy did not fully rebound after Sept 11th. (I was a 27 year employee)
good,"can be fun ,I find the big bosses are running it into the ground especially food & beverage.... nice people in general. team work is vital , customers always come first....... so always work with a smile on your face"
good,I enjoyed working here. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday. The managers show favoritism toward the employees that have been there longer and that were Mexicans.
good,"One of the best jobs i ever had. Though only temporary I would go back anytime if they called. Also Edr stands for employee dining room, and it was pretty darn good. Biggest thing i liked was knowing i was working in a Historic Casino."
good,Great company to work for.  Very professional team.  Great working enviroment.  Management had an open door policy.  Enjoyed working with a diverse group.
good,Balanced environment with structured type culture that pursues great results. goal driven and have some programs to encourage team members to excel in the particular positions.

good,"fun and exciting atmosphere. reat people and management. good medical, dental and vision insurance. Room for growth. Would highly recommend to friends or family"
good,"The atmosphere at Caesars is professional, but also allows you to have some fun.  Busy work environment provides variety of duties.  No two days are the same.  The management staff provide excellent support when dealing with difficult callers.  They allow the Guest Services Representatives some flexible when dealing with problems and how to solve them."
good,"There isn't any micromanaging, management is understanding & easy to work with. Your accounts are yours to managed at your pace. Flexible hours. Number can get boring after a while is my only down fall."
good,"This company was an awesome place to work. It was fun but also a learning experience. With the many different ethnicities present, I learned many different things."
good,is very fast paced and changing.  It is a casino so noise and smoke filled usually.  Got to see some amazing performances by great artist.  Do not get holidays off because it is open 7 days a week 24 hours a day.
good,"Maintained the hotel, kitchen equipment, parking garage, etc."

good,I currently love my job. I enjoy getting ready for my day. The only reason I would really look to leave would be a better opportunity. The position I currently hold has very little room for advancement.
good,"Actually, I was not working for Harrahs I was working for the service companies as a public area cleaner since January 2016, sometimes I was cleaning the east or west casino, so I know pretty much the hotel."
good,Great please  just no future. If  there was more room to move up in the company that would be great. The best part is that the company is big enough that if you do want to move up  you can  but you will have to relocate at some point
good,"Standing on your feet for your entire shift, excluding your lunch break, can be extremely hard on your body!  Otherwise, being a Customer Service Representative is a very rewarding job.  Assisting customers with resolving issues involving their accounts and having them walk away with a smile is great.  I've learned that every person's issue is a big deal to them no matter how small it may seem to the Representative (without saying so of course).  Management can sometimes be difficult because whenever you do have an issue, they're never around, you have to leave your post to get them.  The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods, but the best part was the other Representatives were very helpful and friendly."
good,"With any job it can be stressful at times , but even with such a big company it is family friendly. I have grew to love the people I work with. They are like family even though we have our differences and that's why I returned after leaving for 2 1/2 years."
good,In March 2013 the doors were opened at Horseshoe Cincinnati bringing the area a world class gaming facility. The property was a partnership between Caesars Entertainment and ROCK Gaming (now JACK Entertainment).
good,learned alot and you can further you're life into a more career based job without necessarily needing a degree. isnt a bad job at all. always able to transfer into other positions
good,"Great experience, extremely fast paced. International experience. A totally different type of environment from any thing I had experienced prior to joining the Caesar's team"
good,"In my personal experience at Caesars Entertainment, they have an excellent, very positive, people-focused culture. They hire people with unique, upbeat attitudes that are generally a pleasure to be around. However, when it comes to advancement and management, they are still a more conservative company, with a strong focus on saving face."
good,"Great place to work to meet people from all around the world. Good Job to have if your only looking for part time, it is a bit harder to get a full-time position."
good,this is the funniest job I have ever had.. you get to meet all types of ppl learn what they like and prepare those foods for them while they are staying at resort...
good,"I liked working there because everyone was friendly people worked as a team and felt obligated to help me in anything I felt weak in."
good,"Best job I ever had, doing the least amount of labor. It's all about tips, help players win and the good ones will pay you back for it, and the world goes round and round at the casino. Tips are split so you're working for each other, some nights you'll wish you kept your own, others you'll be glad someone's getting tips somewhere at least. It evens out. But I highly recommend it, in today's economy not a bad job at all. Tiring working swing shift but worth it in my opinion. Liked my job."
good,For me this was a great experience. I would go back to work for them anytime if I still was near the Harrah's Properties. Many perks and benefits that were much better than some competitors but also much lower than a few others.
good,Harrah's was a great place to work. The best part of working there was having new faces to meet and creating new experiences. Every day is different. Managers and supervisors are understanding and willing to make changes to daily work and schedules.
good,"Being a valet parking attendent, you are very busy. They did a good keeping it organized. You are constantly doing something so you are always moving."
good,Good Job for Seasonal Region. Business levels are slow during the Spring and Fall season which creates an environment for fluctuating income. Good benefits.
good,I enjoyed my job really. Some of the things that were allowed were frustrating at times. My manager was amazing though. It was fun and fast pace but always enjoyable. I loved my co-workers for the most part. You grow to have your everyday guests and build a relationship with those guests.
good,"Caesars Entertainment has allowed me to invest my time well as an officer and the caring culture and attitudes of my coworkers make it a place I enjoy spending time,"
good,"This job isn't for everyone, its a fast paced, night life environment.  The pay was not that good.  But upper management was really cool.  I didn't care for 2nd shift but its hard to get on a day shift there.  I think everyone starts with 2nd or 3rd shift.  Great benefits at the time I was there."
good,"I've enjoyed worked here, however it is currently unable to supply me with the means to support my family as I desire, and I am no longer inclined to live in the area nearby, and so it's about time for a change. But would recommend. The departments I have been a part of have been enjoyable and acceptable in most areas."
good,"Harrah's New Orleans is a fun place to work.  It's a place where adults get to play all day! A typical day includes listening to music, enjoying and entertaining the guests and just having fun!"

good,Its a good workplace to work at because u meet so many people because i worked n the hotel@ they loved their employees because when they had car shows they let us work extra hrs buy the fun park for the employees they jst was good at rewarding their workers an was not pleased to hear we were closing but i loved everything about them
good,"great place to work ... benefits if you love/enjoy working around new people from different area codes, then Caesars Casino is the correct place for you."

good,"Fast paced and systematic environment that demand physical and mental capability. Management are disorganize and scatter, employee usually have to self govern. Co-worker cooperation is very important to this job and mistake will lead to hundred or thousand of dollar lost. Hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with players."
good,Harrah's has provided me with priceless work experience! I loved everyone there and all of my guests! An absolutely amazing place to work.

good,"Great job great people, fun environment, and lot of tips. I loved this job but make sure you get good hours I work the 6pm-2am and it was good until school started cause the hours killed me then and it was effecting my school schedule, and managment had other hours but would not let me switch"
good,The Horseshoe allowed me to grow professionally and individually.  My job escalated my customer service skills.  My team was willing to take commands and I was able to work behind the scenes.  My Supervisor was exquisite!  He was a great man to work for. I would enjoy working with the employees from Horseshoe in the future if that was what was in store for me.
good,It was an excellent place to work and be apart of the Harrah's family. Also the work perks were great incentives to keep us motivated and on our toes.
good,"At this casino there were always chances for promotions or at this department transfers. I was in the security department it was harder to move up in that department because people tend to stick around once they move up and there were limited supervision jobs. Other departments like dealers, servers, slot attendants, etc. had better chances of moving up since they were bigger departments."
good,Horseshoe was a great opportunity. I learned a lot of information while working at Horseshoe and met a lot of great people. It was a very busy and fun work environment. I didn't feel like I was working at time because I enjoyed my job.

good,"Beautiful surroundings. Atmosphere is always the most exciting, and fun can be seen and heard here and there."
good,"I had a great time working with a great company like harrahs casino, and its pleasurable in my experience over all.The company is a good source of employees to enhance some of their casino skills,"

good,"Good management, that was supportive of all employees.  Excellent benefits package.  They could have been a little less concerned with politics, but that is expected for large corporations."
good,"A typical day at work is you never know what department you are going in, the good thing is I learned all of the department. My co-workers was easy to get alone with because I get alone with anyone. The hardest part is when someone train with someone that don't want to train you, the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customer satisfied."

good,The company treated you fair and had an arbitration board for employees to address any complaints and to resolve any issues that may arise in the work place.
good,I work many hours over 40+ per week.  The benefits it very great because you get lots of medical and dental amount.  The job is not very secure because many people in the company is scare from the bankrupt of the corporate company.  Even though the company see that you are a very hard worker they don't look at any of the good things you do only the things that you do bad.
good,"I was hesitant to take the job but ended up loving it. You meet different people from all over the world , my coworkers are very friendly , and you make GREAT tips. I would recommend anyone to try to become a beverage server."
good,"We made it a fun place to work . I learned to treat every customer with the greatest respect. The hardest part was when we could not honor the guest respond but we still made it  an enjoyable day. It was very productive and it was a casino, what not to like.

Co-workers are great too, very helpful. The hardest part is processing an express application and taking care of the guest over the phone. The most enjoyable is free food and paid breaks."
good,"Being a dealer at a Casino is generally very exciting and fun, but it is also a job in which you handle large amounts of money throughout a regular work day.  You have to think fast, maintain control of the game, and provide game protection while entertaining the customers.  The job can be difficult when you have to separate yourself from the feelings of the players that are disgruntled or have lost a lot of money, but it can also be very satisfying to see players win and have a good time while at your establishment."
good,"Fun job, met a lot of good people. Not as fun for someone who is older or not in the cliq. Transferred from cashier cage to dealing. Loved the cage, but dealing was another story. Paid over $1000  for dealing classes (paid to the company),offered a position, then was asked to go back to the cage. When I refused (because I just spent over $1000 to learn the games) I was let go for drinking a soda from a self-serve beverage station. All in all it was a fun atmosphere, despite  the overall outcome. Job is not for everyone, and you must constantly put on a smile no matter what."
good,Great ability to learn about the functions of the Hospitality industry and to work as a strategic business partner to managers.

Management were the best they always care about the employees and their needs. My co-workers are definitely the funnest and most energetic team I've ever worked with. The hardest part of my day would have to be when it gets incredibly busy but I prefer service to be busy because I feel that I work better under pressure. Most enjoyable time would have to be when I'm working hard. Nothing gets your adrenaline going then getting a huge dinner rush."

good,"Harrah's Metropolis (part of Caesar's Entertainment) is the first place I ever worked that encouraged employees to be silly. Enjoying your work, enjoying the interaction with the patrons, and enjoying the people you work with is all part of the day. Education is also encouraged and with the flexible schedule, it was easy to fit work around class time. The benefits are awesome; health, vision, dental, 401K, life insurance, - they have it all. But casino work is not for everyone. As an entertainment venue, we work when everyone else plays. That means evenings, weekends, and all holidays."
good,"day starts off very busy, learned to sharpen my skills improved my techniques and speed to meet and exceed standards for a fast paced environment. co-workers were great, willing to learn new things from me and assisted them in improving their skills. hardest part of the job is communication, not everyone is on the same page."

The most enjoyable part was having a big winner."

This was a very fast paced workplace. I paid jackpots, fixed malfunctions on slot machines, assisted customers, and tried to make their experience an memorable one. Many times we were too busy to take a scheduled break. However, it did always make the time go by even faster. Co-workers were people that became friends, and we always helped each other out when needed. I learned to meet peoples needs, and work at making their visit a fun experience."
good,I cleaned hotel rooms at the casino. The only reason why i transferred and left there was for advancement in slots at the Sheraton Casino.

good,I love Caesar but the salary is too slow  and the job had  too many to do for a little money  also they need more employees  they need to cover some open areas
good,"With being such a large company the best way to approach it is to change locations.  They have a great website that allows you to search for all job postings inside the company all over the US and apply for them.  Free Meals, and are always willing to work with people with work times."
good,Very good workplace and great culture. I would've of stayed there longer but due to my at home schedule at the time I couldn't manage to continue. Great benefits though.
good,I love the job and the people I work with but there is no work life balance in my current position. Te benefits are great and overall the company does care about their employees.
good,"I work with competent, kind, funny people who like to get things done. I feel that I can trust my team members to always do their best because I do."
good,I could volunteer for extra hours.  I enjoyed food court cashies much more than cage cashier.  I didn't enjoy customes getting angry when they could not get anymore money off of their credit cards.
good,"I believe that the best part is being about to work lots of different jobs, getting lots of experience in a variety of fields without ever leaving the company"
good,"I was the manager of Valet Parking through a sub contracted company to Harrahs. I would hand out valet tickets to every car that parked valet. I would have valets come to drive and pick up cars to take to lot to park and deliver them back when customer was ready to leave. I would park VIP vehicles myself. I would also handle meetings with Harrahs management then run meetings with my personnel. I handled hiring, firing, training and payroll."
good,Great place to work if you don't mind the corporate atmosphere and alot of rules to follow.  It is a team we all work together to get the job done. There is alot more room to improve and grow.
good,"I liked the job.  Paid well for me in my circumstances, they provided a breakfast, lunch or dinner and discounts.  And they gave us discounts outside of the casino as well."
good,Wonderful place to work. I could not have asked for more from Management to give me the freedom to do my job. They trust my abilities and give me the space to actually problem solve which is what I am good at.
good,They treat all employees as equals. Friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Diverse employees. Everyone is very helpful to new employees.  It's a party that never stops.
good,The majority of the employees and management keep a good positive attitude which makes it enjoyable to come to work. There are many opportunities to do special projects and get involved with efforts to help the city and the community.
good,"I learned more about finance in this position, about large corporate and the casino life which in and of itself was exciting.  Management were the best teachers"
good,"I loved working for Caesars. They had plenty of opportunities for employees to progress. I started out as a hostess and wanted to move up into management so within a year I was promoted. Within another year, I was promoted again. The career opportunities with this company are endless."

good,Very laid back environment and team unity is great. Goals are a little ambiguous. Management has a good read on team vive and makes genuine effort to improve the workplace as much as possible.
good,"It was a fun job, but the middle management is pretty bureaucratic, and having ""bean counter"" management is a pain that only dealers will understand. Most of the issues I had came not from the management, but was just hardships that came as part of the job, (I.E. the nasty players, the night hours,). Eventually it just started to wear on me."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Caesars and especially getting to work with such first-rate individuals in their fields. Good benefits, good working conditions; who could ask for more?"
good,"Good company to work for, many people have long careers here. Caesars promotes good, safe and fair working enviornments for people of all backgrounds and experience levels"

Caesars Entertainment (Las Vegas, Nevada la sede centrale) mi ha dato la possibilità di crescere lavorando nella loro sede europea in Leicester Square (Londra) all’interno del Casinò Empire."
good,"Horseshoe is a fun place to work at. The people are great and friendly. If you don't understand something someone is always there to take a step to help you out. Or, if you don't have enough time, or get too busy someone is always there helping you catch back up. Everyone is a TEAM PLAYER!!!"
good,"I am certified to deal multiple games, so my day can change with demand. My co-workers and bosses are wonderful. They make working at the casino a pleasurable experience. The only down fall of the job is that when people lose their money, they can get pretty nasty."
good,I have worked for this company for 14 years and the pay is really good for the industry. I believe that advancement is a little more difficult at this company because there are so many properties and that creates an environment of people transferring laterally in oreder to experience new markets.
good,"There are a lot of great things about this job, mainly the people that you work with. There are times when it is a lot of fun but can also be boring and slow at times. It is difficult to have a life outside of work because most people work almost every weekend. That's just the casino business"

Meeting people from all over the world. Great team setting. Hardest part about my job, is when having a unhappy guest, and you try to everything in your possible effort to make sure they have a good experience. Not only with their coffee, but with they're Las Vegas experience. I enjoy working with my co-workers. They are all wonderful people, even my manager.

good,Lots of room for advancement. Love the people I work with and really enjoy what I do. Great benefits good supervisors and am always learning something new.

good,"I Look Forward to Work in your concern, be a part of your team  & to put positive efforts to provide excellent service in your establishment"

After working at creating a team environment and training all staff to go beyond what they knew at the time I was hired, this team has improved greatly.  Inventory turnover has increased and inventory loss has greatly reduced.  There have been 4 staff members that have worked with me, that have advanced. I have learned so much working for Horseshoe.  The team there has increased in the trust and respect through out the company of Caesars Entertainment."
good,"The Buffet team members were wonderful to work with at Tunica and LA Downs.  They help make the job easy and fun.  They  worked hard to please their guest, even the rude ones.  They tried to convert the rude guest into friendly customers.  "
good,I looked forward to going to work everyday. It is like one big family working at the Horseshoe Casino. Management is excellent. The most enjoyable part was working with the clients.
good,"Come into work and count into bank. Service customers rather it was signing them up for credit or cashing them out for $.01-$100,000. Holding conversations and answering questions. Answering telephone."
good,A typical day at Harrah's Entertainment was pretty much a normal work day. I learned about casino operation as well as ways to prevent the company from unethical behavior. Management at Harrah's Entertainment were generally nice and down to earth. Although some of my co-workers come from different backgrounds we were able to work together as a team. The hardest part of my job was doing the same thing everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help others.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting and greeting guests. By working at the horseshoe casino you have the opportunity to establish relationships with your guests such as diamond players and seven stars players. Its always great to see happy faces from players who either lost money from upstairs that still have great attitudes when they come to the buffet.
good,"On a typical day I engage with my team members, guiding their creativity and helping them reach the best solutions for the design and marketing needs of our clients. I work with our outside vendors to ensure timely, accurate and quality products are being produced.

good,"Enjoyed doing housekeeper/houseperson. People were friendly, enjoyed the hot food, management, staff was great."
good,We as employees get a chance to stay in the hotels we work for complimentary for one night so that the experience we have can be expressed when booking a reservation for guest. We can explain the details of the property as well as the rooms they will be staying in. They are very understanding about issues they may occure with family. Great place to work!
good,I loved working there. I left to move home and get married.  My supervisors were superb. The benefits were the best I have ever had including the 21 years I was a senior pastor in the United Methodist Church.  Great company. Needs to pay its employees more and not be so greedy making money for the tribe (per cap).

good,I experienced things in a kitchen that I didn't even know was possible. like working for a four star and five star casino and hotel in north Carolina; plus being about to meet with famous people from around the world.

good,"Awesome casino to work for, very technologically adept, albeit mind your Ps & Qs and follow all rules, or you will rack up points on the employee disciplinary system that gets you gone."
good,A typical day was varied and as  I received three promotions it was always changing.  Management support was exceptional. Workplace culture was comfortable and I got to know a wide variety of people.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy guests which is part of the culture of casinos.  The most enjoyable was the great music and environment.
good,"My typical day at work was focusing and concentrating on the game, people around the table, money bets, and playing chips. I had to put all my private problems on the side and provide excellent customer services, enjoy the game in an upbeat and positive environment and be cheerful all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the players, meeting people around the country and feeling especially successful providing my table with a lot of fun, laughter and winning hands. The hardest part of the job was to be confident in your knowledge of the game by not making mistakes and work under a lot of pressure under camera surveillance and the game management. Also, I had to be capable dealing with the losing bets and angry players but still having full control over the ongoing game. What I learned from all this experience is how to gain self-control, work under the pressure and still multitask with the smile on my face!"
good,"I made mixed drinks at concerts and events, I worked with a lot of different people and  clients. I learned a lot of people skills and and how to make mixed drinks."
good,I started working at Caesars Windsor Casino as a table games dealer. The money and benefits were good. The only thing is that you work every weekend for 30 years. Every Holiday. Working nights. It is ok for a few years but not for 30 years. Your family life tends to get affected.

good,Great place to work and grow. 40 hour work week; nice balance between work and home if you strive to seek a balance. Workplace culture is on of fun and enjoyment.

good,I absolutely loved working for Caesars Entertainment. I was able to move around and try a bunch of different positions. I was also able to learn a variety of things within each job. Management was great and cared about your future and making sure you took the path you wanted. All of my coworkers were great to work with and so willing to help when you needed it.
good,Great team and great company.   provided great raises and fast full-time offering from part-time.  Advancement seemed it was a game of favorites and not experience/education.
good,"There are a lot of things I liked about the job was you went in at the same time and days so you worked with the same people which became your family as well. You were around these people 90% of your day. I learned from a lady named Beth how the casino's money worked in the hotel, it's more than I ever thought but really enjoyed learning from the inside and working there, Management all worked together as ONE.There was communication which is a plus in my life on the job so everyone is on the same page and to know what our goals were for each week. I never had hard days. I love my work, I like the management, working in the casino, learning the casino's and seeing my family daily as well."
good,I enjoy this job; I get to walk around and talk to people all day.  It's a fun active job.  Work environment is friendly and fun.  Management extremely helpful and friendly on all levels.
good,"Management had open door policy, co-workers got along, nice place to work."
good,"Each day was a new experience.  People coming and going from the casino, nightclub activity, and convention activities create a busy, non-stop day at work.  You have to learn to pay attention to your surroundings and become a people watcher.  Management becomes an important part coordinating all efforts with state police and security.  The hardest part of the job was being able to multi-task.  You could be watching security approach a intoxicated patron, watching a high roller on a table game and watching a particular person for a potential drug deal.  You had to work in conjunction with your co-workers.  Everyone had to be on top of their situation and still be able to help your co-worker with theirs.  "
good,"The internship program at Caesars Entertainment Las Vegas was unpaid. We were compensated by free hotel room, board and various show tickets. I participated in several different on-site projects. One of the projects was called Kaizen. Kaizen means continue improvement. I  assisted my manager to design a more efficient flowchart to increase the labor efficiency of Harrah's hotel. Besides the projects I did, I worked with VIP managers to solve guest complaints, related compensations and rewards."
good,"Nice place to work, but was working full-time schedule when only part-time. I enjoyed working their , but the over schedule and weekly double shifts tired me when trying to juggle school as well."
good,"Since the age of 13 of been in the work field, my last 15 years at Caesars (Casino) Windsor has given much experience working with the public.From 7 1/2 years in finance balancing daily transactions was great, I enjoyed the everyday challenge it gave me."
good,Gaining the experience that I can now share with other companies was priceless.
good,A typical day at Caesars was very challenging. Everyday was very different. You were dealing with over 1000 staff to supervised plus 1000s of customers. The customer service was the key to success. The job was very diversified with many changes on a daily basis. This company gave me the opportunity to learn and be trained with many management and leadership programs.There was quite a bit of knowledge that we were trained for management and union. Co-workers were either very negative or very positive.. My job was to maintain a good balanced day. The most enjoyable part of the job was i love new challenges and being trained .
good,My co-workers and management were very respectful and friendly people to work with.
good,"The Internal Audit department at Caesars/Harrahs Entertainment was a great place to work. The work life balance was very good, but the work was fast paced and could at times be very demanding of your weekends. The management team for the department did not micro manage, were invested in developing their talent, and always strived to ensure the department was providing the best work product using the most up to date auditing methods available. The only down side to the company was that almost all chances for advancement within the department basically required you to relocate across country, however, supported all efforts for their employees to transfer to the operational side of the business."
good,"management was good with employees. Its a fast pace and it can be stressful. Upbeat and positive to coworkers and guest. Helping my coworkers when needed while I'm restocking for my end of the shift. On register i remember guest names, have a short conversation to gain that personal experience. Making sure each ticket order is out to the company’s expectations. Clean the lobby and kitchen beginning and ending of each shift."
good,Its an overall a good place to work. It's fun and upbeat. Theres a lot of room for advancement even if it's not in your department. Benefits are good. Supervisors are awesome and very understanding. There is a bit of drama in that job. And the hours are a bit rough to work if you have a family or a very active personal life. You start on graves and move up to swing shift from there.
good,"I like the company, but it's pretty set in stone that it can take over your life and that's why i only work part time. I love my co workers and supervisors...everyone is very helpful bc there are a lot of procedures to learn."
good,It was a great company to work for. treated employees great. Culture changed as it went through a series of ownership changes who forgot what Caesars embodied and cut it down to nothing special like other casinos under its umbrella
good,"Harrah's Casino was the epitome of fast. Lots of walking, standing and sometimes sprinting. You'd better purchase the best shoe that one could afford. The people I worked with were amazing. I enjoyed going in and working with people who loved their job and put more into each day."
good,A great work environment. Pleasant and positive role models. I enjoyed my time working as a employee. The benefits we're great. They have flexible hours to meet your needs.
good,"benefits was the best part of the job health vision 401k, dental, paid time off  overtime the management was easy going as long as you got the job done"
good,"Really enjoyed my time at Horseshoe Casino, the opportunity for a job in the field that I loved became available, so I took advantage of it and I couldn't have been happier.  I left Horseshoe on good terms"
good,"Prepare orders for customers, prep foods for use on the line, assist other cooks as needed when busy."
good,Harrahs is a wonderful place to work. I've learned a lot and have been treated fairly. I'd recommend it to everyone. Everyone should stop by and check it out.
good,Sold the company to private investors and took away employee stock options then the stock split.  Customer service began to suffer.  My boss was one of my favorite bosses of all time!!!  Former employees still keep in touch with current employees.  You become close with your co workers.  Things began to look up when Caesar's took over ownership.
good,"This job was amazing. I never would have left had I not had to relocate. They really did care about the employees. Terrific benefits, free meals, and they encouraged family members to work together so as it was different departments. it really was like a big family."
good,My coworkers are all so fun and always make a work day go by a lot faster. The company is a wonderful company to work for. I have enjoyed working with Caesars enterprise services.
good,"Usually when I clocked in it was really busy. I learned to be a team player, how to keep my composure. The management was the best in all circumstances. My co workers were great, always had positive attitudes. When it would be concert night (Jamie Foxx for example) the restaurant would be packed and there would be a hour waiting list a lot of customer would be upset and I would help turn that frown upside down by communicating with them and putting humor into it. I enjoyed everything with the job knowing that I was a big assistance to the main servers really made me commit to this job until I decide to go into the service."
good,Great resort with lots of potential. Very short on employable labor force. I left to return to my family still living in Florida.
good,It's been a long time since I worked here but if was overall a very good co. to work for. They really care about their employees.
good,"At Harrah's, they are committed to customer service.  On a typical day, you would be faced with at least 65 different customers.  The management for my department is quite exceptional.  I also have been privileged to work with the best coworkers.  The hardest part of the job is lying to the guest.  Because our rooms are based on yield and play in the casino, we have to deny guests rooms because they do not meet a certain criteria."
good,"competitive place to work, always improving and expanding. room for advancement"
good,"meeting and greeting customers, assisting them with any issues that occurred during their stay"
good,"Typical work days included counting and balancing each bank and the entire boat. Four banks balanced to one. Chip, token and jackpot payouts. Hard work but rewarding teamwork and environment. Hardest part of the job was to stay clear of drama. the best part of the job was the math, balancing, and error searching. I learned accounting tricks and computer programs,daylight savings time,"
good,"I have learned a lot about casino activities while working as a Surveillance Officer. I've gained tools and abilities that help my understanding and ability to detect suspicious activity. It gave me the ability to work with court systems, local and state police."
good,Provided security for both Patrons and employees. Able to meet new people and interact with the Patrons.
good,"I managed the casino floor and held pre-shifts. I either Bartended or was a cocktail server, serving guest drinks. I had great relationships with co-workers and guest. I enjoyed interacting with guest and the easy flow of a work day. The long hours on your feet could be tiresome. I worked well with other managers and learned from them. It was here that I learned gaming rules and how the management works in a casino."
good,"Every day is different, never know how many people you will see or who you will see. hardest part would be when we are not warned about incoming busses."
good,"I loved my job here and everyday was an adventure. You were always working in different area with different people and guests. I worked with about 30 girls daily and about 6 bartenders so there was always something going on, but we were all like family. It was a very hard but rewarding job. Unfortunately I had to quit working here to go back to school."
good,I enjoyed my time being a hostess at Harrah's Casino. There were always multiple opportunities to earn extra hours. You can work in multiple departments at a casino so you learn a lot of different skills. Always opportunities for career advancement.
good,Everyday you feel thankful to work for Caesars. Company offers a lot of fun work envelopment and your actual work feels somewhat rewarding once accomplished.
good,"Great Job culture, excellent management, benefits, fair payment."
good,It is a casino. There is constant partying everyday. Working at Harrahs was a great experience for me as a CSR. You are always meeting new people and the co-workers are great. Harrahs is a family environment.
good,"not a bad place to work, always something new to do. Management is non union and team members are union. as long as you got your job done as a manager they left you alone"
good,"Worked for this company for 5 years in the area of Customer Service.     Everyday was different and learned a lot from working at this company.  They truly believe in promoting from within, so if advancement is what you are looking for then this is the place to work."
good,Customer service was the typical part of the day parking and retrieving cars for the customers. Here I learned how to better interact with people and improved my people skills. The managers there were great people to work for and carry out conversations with and they listen to you and work around your schedule even if your in school. Never a hard part of the job except having to run in rain to retrieve cars. I love being outside so this made the job that much better for me.
good,I was thrilled to be apart of the Horseshoe Legacy. I was one of the original bussers of the buffet. I had a wonderful experience.
good,"a typical day started off with check on marine personnel; making sure we have everyone on broad as per U.S.C.G. requirement. I learned a lot about boat inspections. We. had quarterly and annuals. The management team for my first ten years were the best group of people a person could work;with very enjoyable. Our deck hands were not professional hands, but it gave me great pleasure training them in fire and boat rescue. the majority of them was with me for over ten years. Our other team members also was really great to work with over the years. My job was not really hard, because I knew my job (that's a real fact). I got the chance to meet a lot of interesting guests and made it my business to walk around and share a moment with most of them."
good,I believe that the company works to make sure that their employees are healthy. They have great health insurance and a onsite health clinic for their employees. The management is sincere in wanting the best for the employees and often will go above and beyond for employees if the Employee has great potential.
good,I loved this job. the people was excellent to work with and the place was great. I remember this job like it was yesterday. I was able to help many people get jobs there since I was in HR. It has changed a lot but I had some wonderful experience their.
good,"This was the best job I have ever had. Easy, enjoyable, and cultured."
good,"making sure that all functions have been delivered to the banquet rooms and all equipment is accounted for on the set-up, doing payroll ,approving vacations , making schedules, attending BEO meeting, hardest part of the job is maintaing an adquate amount of china,glass and silver to do functions, the most enjoyable part of the job is to see the banquet room finished and set-up when doing VVIP functions , all your hard work comes together"
good,Working at Harrah's was slow-paced during the morning but very fast-paced during horse racing season. They always had varies ways to advance within the company as well.
good,"Usually early morning I would come in and clock and everyone would greet each other. I learned how to work in a fast-paced team environment and how important it is to have good communication skill when it comes to working. The management is wonderful and always checking on the employees and guests satisfaction. There is nothing hard about my job I really enjoy every little bit of it and the best part of all is coming into work, Interacting with the guests and my co-workers, and just working hard and having a great time.

good,I liked working with the horses on tbe race track and interacting with the riders however i always wanted to go back to performing arts but it was my bestjob so far
good,"If you want to make money and have good benefits, this is the place for you. If you want to have a life or family, this is the worst place. The guests act like you are garbage, management makes sure you know that you are replaceable, and the employees all hate their jobs. However, you will meet a lot of people and the pay and benefits is the best in the area. Just know that if you are in a good money position, you will never have another weekend or holiday off."
good,"there is never a position that is full, if you dont like yours then wait it out a few months and try for something else, just make sure you dont upset your manager or go behind their back to do it or they will ban you from transferring"
good,"its a good company, when I worked there the manager was very hard to work for but I understand she left right after I did. I guess it is ran by the service company now."

good,I operated the cash register everyday. My co workers and I provided excellent customer service to very large volumes of  people. The work load was kind of overwhelming at times. The part I enjoyed the most was meeting new people from all over the world.
good,Horseshoe was a great place to work. I gain great customer service skills and company knowledge there. Management was great. loved all my co-workers and I still love them to this day.
good,"I work as a human resource integrity it was great experience! "
good,Really didn't work there long enough to establish what the management team was like. I learned a lot in the short time that is was there. the hardest part to me was getting on the elevator going all the way to the top of the building. I'm afraid of height so that was the hardest part to me.
good,"My typical day is dealing poker for 8 hours with 2-4 breaks.  The job and the co-workers were great, there's just no room for advancement or increases in pay."
good,"A typical day at work was checking campaign schedule, follow-up with those who were responsible for an offer both in build and data pull. Updating schedule before team meeting. Build & proof Special Event Las Vegas offers as it comes available. "
good,"I enjoyed working for the Horseshoe Casino. A typical day at work could be very busy as far as the guest volume leaving the team members with very little downtime. I learned that even in the most hostile situation, it is always a choice on an individual to remain calm or to react with anger. I have always been very patient and understanding of a guest that was not satisfied with the service being given to them. In doing so, I would try to find a positive solution to appease the guest. My coworkers and the management team were more than willing to make sure that we worked as a team and kept the common goal of pleasing the guest in mind. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smile on the guest's faces when they were having a good time. At the end of the day, casino gaming is supposed to be in fun- no matter how musch money is lost or won- fun is the ultimate objestion. "
good,Overall treatment by managers is good however require shift changes at amoment notice.
good,Harrah's is a great place to get a lot of different experience in different departments. Cross training is a must.

good,Working for Harrah's was very entertaining.  You got to meet many different people through out the years.  They give you the training that you need & care about their employees.
good,"I would caution against working for Harrah's in Council bluffs, at least in a managerial capacity. There was not a lot of communication and the servers in the restaurant didn't really have a lot of respect for supervision"
good,The only reason I left this position was because I was offered more money. I did like this job a lot also because I was an Employee Service Rep. which required me to work with handling all employee problems that may occur

good,"Good work life balance.  Pay is decent but could be more competitive.  401k is nominal.  Good workplace culture and teamwork, and management.  Would recommend to a friend."
good,I  enjoyed my years at Harrah's and grew as a person as well as a professional. Employees are held accountable when they do something wrong however is also commended when observed doing a good job.

The people I work along side everyday are all have big heats and are  open minded, its a pleasure working with them day in and day out. The most difficult thing about my job is not being able to see everyone leave in a better mood than when thy came in. The most enjoyable part is when I hear guest brag about the display of teamwork that goes on in the restaurant."
good,Would recommend working for Caesars to all friends and family. Unlimited learning potential along with advancement opportunities.

good,"Everyday is filled with excitement, strategy, lots of money, and a great way to relieve stress.  You never knew what was going to happen from one minute to another.

Many of my o-workers got sick after eating from the employee dining area. The managers are great and culture is wonderful. Opportunities are available to move up.
good,"Fun job if you don't mind dealing with occasionally difficult customer. Shift work and hospitality so you will always work all major holidays. Large number of employees for this company to manage. Good attendance and being on time is important if you wish to keep your job.

good,"I truly enjoyed working there. The majority of my co-workers were really great to work with, and the best manager I've ever had was at Harrah's, he mastered the art of being fair and unbiased across the board.

I educate myself in what is going on for the day, clock in and greet all my co workers and managers who are all super nice always, everyone treats everyone like family, ask about what needs to be done for the day and begin tasking. the hardest part of my job sometimes can be getting everything that needs to be done in  one day when there is a heavy work load. the most enjoyable part of the day is making people smile, laughing and just having a good time at work with friendly people all while maintaining a good work environment."

I have learned and been able to grow into an extremely productive professional.  The culture and values that the company stands on makes be proud to be a part of it.  Typical day currently is about 10 hours and continual non-stop work pace.  I have learned how to multi-task like a champ and switch gears on the drop of a dime.  Co-workers are supportive and enjoyable. Challenges include work/life balance and compensation for the work and time that is put in.

good,"Fun job, can be stressful at times.  The co-workers are wonderful. When you learn all of the games there is the opportunity to advance."
good,"The hustle and bustle of rushing to get started ,I learned to enjoy my job and as time passed I learned to love it. Management over the time different people to get to know and them know you so management does start noticing who can do and who not. Working with my co-workers is like getting to know them thru their personality some are mad but when you can turn the madness around to a Hello then you can get along great with your co-workers. Writing a statement on a co-worker then their termed. Most enjoyable part of the job for me is knowing that i can make a guest or co-worker smile because happiness makes the work enforcement go around."

good,"Loved working for Caesars entertainment at the Rio and Planet Hollywood for the World Series of Poker tournaments. Really enjoyed the management, staff, and perks offered to employees. "
good,Typical day I was on property 12 hours and worked average 9 of the 12 hours. I learned that when managers deal with hundreds of employee's they cannot get to know you or evaluate your performance. Hardest part was feeling lost because vast amount of employees
good,"lots of promotion opportunities.  great people.  fun place. I have worked for Caesars at several different properties in a few states.  It is nice knowing the culture is the same, regardless of where you go.  The company supports growth and celebrates team members who work hard and care."
good,My experience at Harrahs was incredibly wonderful. It was a fantastic company with even better leaders. I liked the style that they did everything even when they had to break bad news or give less than positive information they did everything they could to lessen the sting. I take many many pages from their book when it comes to management styles because they way they did it creates a beautiful culture and friendly environment. If you handle the amount of smoke on the gaming floor it is a great job.
good,This is the first company that I have encountered in Las Vegas that took a true interested in the welfare of their employees. I enjoy working for this company.
good,"A very upbeat and friendly place to work. My current team is small 5 people, but we work as a fine tuned machine including the manager. Everyday is an adventure, whether we are meeting new guest / groups, dealing with airlines to get the best flights, or preparing for an event."

good,"I was a security guard which handled the front and side entrances. I also walked the floor, escorted players with large amounts of payouts to their vehicles. Escorted the change of money to and from the cash out boxed. Ran  the floor by talking to my fellow workers to where they should be, when it was time to take their breaks and when lunch was. When i needed escorts and to which section."
good,Caesars Entertainment provides many opportunities to to advance within or with their other properties. Management always had an open door policy making it easy to provide feedback at all times.  Highly recommend working for this company.

good,Harrah's Casino was a fun and well rounded place of employment. At Harris I was able to express myself as well as show self development and grow with in my skill.
good,Everything was great until they brought in a new manager from AC..then to save the company money they came up with ways to get rid of the full timers so they wouldnt have to pay the benefits..well after i was let go the manager was found to be corrupt and subsequently fired..alot of good people probably lost their jobs. It was a great place to work just unfortunate they hired the wrong manager at the wrong time or I would still be there probably.
good,"Working for Horseshoe was a very great experience. The managers were great, the pay was great and I enjoyed the culture I was apart of. I loved coming to work."
good,Caesars prides its self on guest satisfation and attention to details. Guests needs are to be ment but apear to be effortless. To give the guest the expierance of being a pharaoh for the duration of their stay.
good,Caesar is a really good place to work. I do have to admit that when it comes down to customer service they are great at it. They are great on training people especially if you're walking into the department having no knowledge of what the job consist of.
good,Awesome place to work but if you are married with children and expect the 9-5 work day you better start looking somewhere else.  Expect to start working the night shift going in anywhere from 5-9 pm and getting home 2-7 am.  Nothing bad to really say about the place except the hours of work.  You can advance up getting the better days off like weekends (which are basically mandatory as well as holidays) but be prepared to work for 10-20 years before that happens.
good,Nice place to work very friendly mangers easy work not hard at all very fast pace has great food different selection have many opportunities there and all are great

good,I really like the total returns reward program for their employees.   In my department I have good relations with management and feel valued and appreciated.
good,With this company I have a great time. Awesome benefits and great pay and you always have an upbeat and positive attitude throughout the day. Only down fall hard to switch shift which make it a bit difficult to balance my personal life and work life.
good,"A very exciting place to work lots of lights, noise, very high energy."
good,Harrah's was and extraordinary company tie work for the pay was great great atmosphere great bonuses there is nothing negative that I could say about Harrah's. Hate they sold the company
good,it gets really busy and people call of and they might give you more rooms to clean the pay is ok and they do have raises. they are friendly and welcoming at least the HR lady is.
good,good vibes great people a lot of fun going on all the time nice people to talk great energy a lot of helpful staff wanting you to be successful in everything that you do
good,i learned that you can have fun and still be the best worker. i would statr my day by stocking my cart after stocking my cart i go to my first room of the day out of 16. i would strip and clean the dirty rooms  make them sparkle again. I would help guests in between if they needed it i gave them 110% of my attention and dedication.
good,"My time at Caesars Entertainment was by far the best job I was ever employed at. We would clean the pool deck of trash and towels, and straighten chairs. We also would accommodate to every guests need in the best way possible by setting them up with chairs, and free water to every guest. We also handed out towels to the guests, and sold sunscreen and apparel. It was a blast and I enjoyed every second at my job and working for this company."
good,Those 8 years was the most good years of my  life. I've worked with some of the most good people I've ever worked with !!!   And i enjoy meeting new customers and new workers .
good,"My workday was never dull or boring. If you like fast paced and meeting different people of all types of cultures , then you would enjoy working for Harrah's. I learned a lot from my coworkers every day as well as trained new employees in our area that came in. I also worked all 3 shifts to make sure we had enough people to cover due to being short handed. I did love all the different tasks. From time edits to inventory to confidential processing of employee paperwork. We were always busy. The time went by fast. If my husband,s job had not relocated him, I would still be there. Lots of chances for advancement."
good,Accurate account of all monetary instruments used by casino industry according to state regulations.  The job was routine so easy to accomplish tasks given on daily basis.  Small department so close relationships with co-workers were developed.
good,"A typical day for me would be checking emails, making sure that what banquets we have are set to go. I manage my cooks and push them to do the best they can. I put out banquets flawlessly with the help of my staff. The hardest part of the job would probably be trying to make eveyrone happy for example, PTO requests on high volumed days, giving people certain days off and working with them. I think that I am extrememly fair and professional. The most enjoyable part about my job would have to be my staff. They are all amazing people and are very hard workers and I am so grateful for them! I've learned that you need to put friendships asside at work and be the supervisor. Sometimes that can be hard because you don't want anyone to hate you. Overall its a very good place to work, I am just looking to move out of state to Indiana and take my career to better myself and try new things."
good,well the first thing is your working for a casino in Atlantic City & Los Vegas. Then sometime your on the gambling floor or in the server room handling all or any problems with the new software your team just installed during the early part of the day. On our days off we could see a show. Or just check out the other casinos
good,I would ring people out take them to tables serve them drinks or get them condiments. I would also clean tables take dishes to the wells to get cleaned and pretty much anything they asked me to do I did it.

good,Customer Care is what we did. I learned that the Customer is always right.Management was on Point. The hardest Part of the job was the hours I had to work being a new mom. The Most enjoyable part of the was getting to meet and help the customers with their  inquiries.
good,"GReat job, it has fair pay. they have an cafe in the building for the staff only."
good,"This is literally the first job that I've held for over a year's time, aside from working with my father mowing lawns.  I have gained an immense amount of experience, knowledge, finesse, through countless interactions with an innumerable amount of customers, or as we in the casino industry like to refer to our customers as, ""guests.""  I initially started as a bus-person, cleaning and setting tables, as well as, serving beverages to guests.  Having worked that position for 5 years - also worth mentioning is that this was and still remains my very first restaurant job - I'd learning quite swiftly that casinos truly have a ""revolving door.""  I've worked with many different bus-persons, waiters/waitresses, bartenders, bar-porters, supervisors, managers and executives, and each of them had bestowed upon me a fixed amount of their knowledge.  Some of it was extremely pertinent and incomparably useful while other disclosures were arbitrary or completely vacuous in nature.  All in all, I do not regret taking this job."
good,"Answered question on several marketing promotions and company products. Managed customer complaints. Booked airline, hotel, car,and limo reservations ensuring clients needs are met."
good,The professional gamblers were so much fun to talk too.  I loved seeing the professional sports players and actors.  The day went by quickly and the holiday parties were fun too.

The managers are every easy to get alone with as long as you're doing your job. It's fun to work with your co-workers because you have to look out for each other. Having to deal with a unsatisfied customer. When you have done your job to the best of your ability and supervisor notice it."
good,I worked for this company for almost 7 years. It's a great place to work.
good,Hands down the best place I have ever worked I love harrahs!!!
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this employer. I was able to exercise my ability to multi-task while remaining productive. I was in a fast paced position, in charge of many aspects of daily operations and seeing to it that each shift flowed smoothly. The hardest part of the job was remembering to separate personal feelings from what's best for each shift. Having people you were fond of expecting or wanting to be cut (let go early from shift) and having to remain professional and relieving those best suited for the operation. Another difficult aspect was being called away from whatever I was doing to assist in any removal of ""intoxicated patrons"" Regardless of what I was doing, should I receive a call I had to immediately go to the area where I was needed and handle the situation. The most enjoyable part of my job was being in constant connection with the public."

good,A typical day would be from 7pm- 3am very fast paced and loud. I learned how to interact with multiple cultures and had to provide excellent service while trying to entertain and do math at the same time. The management here was pretty great as well they were always very approachable and understanding. The hardest part of the job I would have to say would be the hours and dealing with rude customers who would get angry and take it out on me.

But be ready to work a lot depending on the place because you can either have a lot of tasks or very little depending on where you work at and what your position is. Every restaurant will get busy on the weekends so be ready to fall behind in tasks. Furthermore, be ready to take up extra hours since some workers will not be able to go that day."

The most enjoyable part was getting to be a part of the couples big day and seeing how happy they were after the ceremony."
good,Caesars is a great place to work. you can have great work/life balance while working for Caesars. Typical day can be busy but people like me who like to stay busy can enjoy that kind of environment.

good,"I worked in the marketing area, we would help with customer service , update accounts and applied rewards when needed. We would also come up with new promotions. Managers were nice and the co-workers were awesome! I enjoyed meeting new people everyday. The only reason I am no longer there is because my job as a personal care giver had become a round the clock job."
good,"Depending on if I were to bartend or drink serve, my day varied slightly. Bartending, I would either work a service bar for servers to deliver drinks or one of the face bars just helping customers. Serving, I would be all over the casino floor serving table games or slot machines. Working both sides gave me a better perspective of the job as a whole. Working for Horseshoe I developed a lot more confidence in myself and ability to interact with people whether they were a regular or someone visiting on vacation. My coworkers and myself worked together as a team to help make sure everyone was taken care of, if one person were to get behind. The hardest part about horseshoe was adjusting my sleep schedule, but that didn't last too long. My favorite part of the job was just seeing how much fun people were having, whether they're by themselves, with a loved one or family, or just a group of friends. It's a great mix of different crowds all in one upbeat environment."

When you get sent to your working station the best thing to start off the shift right is greeting your customer introduce yourself to everyone at your station and make it an enjoyable day by interacting with the customer thru out the day."
good,While working for Harrah's Entertainment I found that it not only was a company that was there to entertain the guests but they were there to entertain the employees. On a regular basis we had what they called roasts. This would be our managers getting in front of the team members and make fun of themselves or their positions. Everyone was able to get a good laugh and it made us all realize that our managers were on the same level as the hourly employees.

It also seems that they're doing the rights things to cater to the changing demographics / customers."

good,i enjoy working for rio. been my home job for many years. would recommend it to anybody who wants to get into hospitality. depends on the area you work at what your day is like. i worked wsop and sports book. moving up the ranks can be a headache cause nobody leaves. you make a lot in tips if you are nice to your people. hourly can be low but walking out the door with $100 plus a day makes it bearably. im a guy and made decent coin. girls usually make more if they work hard and dont rely on looks. ie the ones that just sit there and look pretty dont get customers so no tips. staff is friendly and training is pretty good. word of advice watch your money at all time!!!!! dealing with $10000 on a daily can be a task. and the money only goes up from there. seen 90K bets fly like it was $2.

I spent 4 years training table game dealers as well as being hired as a Pit Manager for Casino Windsor (Ceasars Windsor as it is now named). I gained my ""Key"" license while working in Windsor, which is the highest level gaming license that one could achieve. Once Casino's opened in the state of Michigan, Ceasars Windsor started releasing upper management positions. I was a victim of this cutback and returned to Calgary in 2009.

Since they were a lot of people, all with different ideas and styles- you have to find a way a balance and come together to work as one unit.

good,Its a great place to work with people. You get to meet new customers everyday. Get to know everyone personally. I've learned how to remember customers not only by faces but by their names. When you call a customer by their name your showing them that you really care about their service and presence. The most enjoyable part about a job is that you can actually relate to people. When you relate then you can build a relationship with them.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of discussing ideas for the department and overall company with coworkers and ways to better serve and satisfy the customer/client. A busy day consisted of multitasking and working well & fast with your team in order to complete the tasks and job duties at hand. I learned how to properly use the email, address several stressful tasks at once while remaining calm, and not letting a customer leave angry or dissatisfied. Management was very helpful and always professional. We were short on staff when it came to managers so sometimes it took a longer than expected for them to come help but again, they were so busy that it was expected. My co-workers were hard-working, focused individuals who were a pleasure to be around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that had just lost hundreds sometimes even thousands of dollars at gambling and came to vent their frustrations to me. At first I didn't know how to handle it but after about two weeks I learned how to calm them down and turn a loss into a ""gain"" by telling them about our total rewards program and how it worked (the more they spent the more points they earned on their total rewards card and could use those points to get free stuff). The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting customers from all over the country and sometimes even across the world! It taught me that even though people may say, ""it's a small world"" it's actually much bigger than one imagines."

good,"The managers want the customers to be satisfied, and also the managers would want us as workers to clean up our areas and the restrooms. A typical day at work would be laid back, long as the job is being done. I have learned to make sure the customers are well taken care of and to make sure that everything is clean. My coworkers are fun, great to talk to and also energetic. The hardest part of the job is when the customers complain & it gets back to the managers and we get in trouble about it, but after all the most enjoyable thing about the job is that customers leave with a smile on their face."
good,I love this job before they close and i learn alot to further my careers and my coworkers were always fun to be around and act as a family and there wasnt a hard part about the job
good,"During my time at Caesars I have had the chance to speak with people from all over the world and from all different walks of life. It is never boring and there is always something new to experience while working. The management is fantastic and it is a privilege to work under them. My co-workers are respectful and hard working but the hardest part of the job would be the fact that you are constantly doing something. You do not the chance to sit, get away from people and in my line of work, get out of the sun."
good,"Security was awesome you just never knew what to expect it could get very busy from underage kids, theft, fights you name it security done it but it was an awesome experience"

good,This is an excellent company to work for. They have a great caring culture and everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. They have great benefits and so much opportunity.
